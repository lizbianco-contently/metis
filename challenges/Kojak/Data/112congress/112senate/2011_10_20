Mr. President, as we all know, the No. 1 issue on the \nminds of most Americans is jobs, and I think it is pretty clear both \nparties are focused on that issue right now.\n  I also think it is safe to say the two parties have a fundamentally \ndifferent take on the solution. For Democrats, the solution, \napparently, is to increase the number of people who work for the \ngovernment. My good friend, the majority leader, made this pretty clear \nyesterday when he said the private sector ``is doing just fine'' and \nthat the President's latest stimulus is focused on government jobs \ninstead.\n  Republicans take a different view. We recognize that government has \nan\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\nimportant role to play. We recognize the need for commonsense \nregulations to ensure the safety of our citizens and the preservation \nof our resources. But it has become increasingly clear to many \nAmericans that Democrats in Washington have lost all sense of balance \nwhen it comes to both the size and the scope of the Federal Government \nin Washington.\n  Based on the letters I get and the people I meet, there is a growing \nsense out there that government regulations are simply and completely \nout of control and that this is one of the main reasons we are in this \njobs crisis. There is a growing sense the reason for this is that \nlawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington have completely lost touch--\ncompletely and totally lost touch--with the struggles folks outside the \nbeltway are going through.\n  I saw yesterday that the Washington, DC, area now has the highest \nmedian income in the country. Washington, DC, the Nation's Capital, has \nthe highest median income in the country. I have no doubt many of these \npeople do good work, but the point is they are weathering this economic \ndownturn pretty well. Not only are they making big salaries relative to \nthe private sector, they are also holding on to their jobs. The \nunemployment rate for the country as a whole is 9.1 percent. For \ngovernment workers it is about half that--4.7 percent.\n  With all due respect to my friends on the other side, it is the \nprivate sector that has been begging for mercy. It is the private \nsector that is being crushed by regulators in Washington. I don't think \nthe solution to the crisis is to make the Federal Government even \nbigger.\n  When it comes to jobs, the primary role of government is to create an \nenvironment in which Americans and American businesses can grow and \nflourish without the heavy hand of government on their backs. We \nshouldn't be making it harder for people to do business and to prosper. \nWe should be making it easier. Yet everywhere I go, from Silicon Valley \nto Kentucky coal mines, I hear the same thing: Get Washington off our \nbacks. They are killing us with all these impossible demands. It is not \nthe commonsense regulations they complain about; it is all the new \nburdensome, duplicative and, in some cases, impossible to comply with \nregulations. I have small business owners in Kentucky writing me to say \nthey can barely get by as it is, and the EPA is harassing them with \npaperwork and threatening them with fines.\n\n  I mentioned a paper company the other day in Ohio that is shutting \ndown because the EPA demanded they upgrade their boilers with a \ntechnology that doesn't even exist yet.\n  I know my Democratic colleagues hear these same complaints because \nthey literally cut across party lines. One story I saw this week \nfeatured a Democratic mayor in Massachusetts telling Washington to back \noff.\n  Here is a woman who went to the President's inauguration, an Obama \nsupporter, stood in the cold to witness it with her kids. And now she \nsays she is losing her faith in government because the overzealous \nenforcement of brutal new fishing regulations is destroying jobs and \nforcing smaller players out of the business altogether.\n  Democrats hear stories such as this too, and their solution is that \nwe should hire even more people who wake up every morning thinking \nabout yet new ways to regulate private industry until they cry uncle. \nOur view is that we should actually listen to what people are asking us \nto do and to help them out, give them a break. It is time for \ngovernment to help private sector job creators instead of looking for \nways to punish them.\n  What we are doing is we are asking the Democrats to work with us on \nways to help the private sector grow, because the fact is we are not \ngoing to get this economy going again by growing the government. It is \nthe private sector that is ultimately going to drive this recovery.\n  Look, if big government were the key to economic growth, then \ncountries such as Greece would be booming right now. If big government \nwere the key to economic growth, Greece would be booming.\n  What we need to do is to focus on helping the private sector grow. I \nknow the Democratic plan is to focus on their government jobs bill \ninstead, to punish private sector job creators with yet another tax to \nsubsidize even more temporary government jobs at the State level. But \nwhat I am saying is, let's put the government stimulus bills aside for \na change and do something for the small business men and women in this \ncountry who are begging for mercy from their own government, right here \nin Washington.\n  There is a lot we can do. As I noted yesterday, the House has already \npassed three pieces of legislation this year alone, one as recently as \nlast week, that would send an entirely different message to businesses. \nEvery one of these bills to roll back excessive regulations by \nbureaucrats here in Washington got solid bipartisan support in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Last night, Senate Republicans also moved ahead on legislation that \nprivate contractors who do work for Federal, State, and local \ngovernments have been asking us to enact as a way to protect jobs. At a \ntime when so many businesses are struggling to stay afloat--to \nliterally stay afloat--the government shouldn't burden them even more \nby taking money out of businesses that they could use to invest and \nhire.\n  The best thing about this proposal is not only is it bipartisan, it \nis also part of the President's bill. So here is another example of \nsomething we could do for job creators that we know will actually be \nsigned into law. And there is no reason I can think of that this \nlegislation shouldn't get 100 votes in the Senate--a proposal supported \nby the President of the United States, passed with a large bipartisan \nmajority in the House. Why don't we pass it? It is in the President's \nown bill, for goodness sake.\n  The White House said yesterday that every part of the President's \nbill is equally important. If that is true, let's pass this measure. \nThis legislation should get unanimous support. So let's vote on this \nand the other bipartisan jobs legislation I have mentioned and then \nsend them to the President for an actual signature, making a law \ninstead of making a point.\n  It is time we showed people who are struggling out there that we are \non their side, because right now I know a lot of them are having \nserious doubts. It is time we do something serious about jobs. The \nproposal I offered last night, with the support of my Republican \ncolleagues, supported by the President of the United States, passed by \na bipartisan majority in the House, would be a good step in the right \ndirection.\n\n\n                              LISA WOLSKI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate Republican team is losing a \nkey player today as we say goodbye to Lisa Wolski, chief of staff to \nthe Republican whip, Senator Kyl.\n  Lisa has been a greatly valued adviser to me as well and to my entire \nteam. We have always valued her intelligence, good strategic sense, and \nher sound judgment. She has worked extremely hard to make sure we \nalways knew where the votes were, which is very important in this line \nof work. And, most of all, we appreciate very much the fact that she \nhas done all this with great team spirit.\n  I want to thank Lisa for her hard work, for me and for the entire \nRepublican team, and we wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6790-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6790-S6791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         SPC BRANDON S. MULLINS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I come to the \nfloor today to commemorate a brave Kentuckian who lost his life in \nservice to his country.\n  U.S. Army SPC Brandon S. Mullins of Owensboro, KY, was killed on \nAugust 25, 2011, in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, when insurgents \nattacked his vehicle with an improvised explosive device. He was 21 \nyears old.\n  For his heroic service, Specialist Mullins received several awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas \nService Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\n  Brandon Mullins inherited a proud military tradition. He was the \nthird generation in his family to wear the Nation's uniform. His father \nThomas was a military police officer, and as a child Brandon and his \nbrother Shaun used to love to play with his dad's old MP mementoes. \nThey also loved to play on a World War II-era tank that was on display \nin a park near Brandon's childhood home.\n  As a kid, Brandon loved sports. Hockey was his favorite. He and his \nfamily enjoyed going to Nashville Predators games, but Brandon's \nfavorite team was the Detroit Red Wings.\n  Brandon also played hockey in high school and was the MVP of his \nleague. He thrived under pressure. One time, Brandon's team found \nitself in a shoot-out situation for victory in a high-stakes playoff \ngame. Brandon asked his coach to put him in as the goalie. He wanted a \nchance to step up in a clutch moment for his teammates and, sure \nenough, his team won the game.\n\n  Brandon also enjoyed being outdoors. He was a hunter, a fisherman, \nand a hiker. His family described him as fearless when it came to \nphysical challenges. He started rollerblading at the age of 4. He is \nremembered as high spirited, generous, and very popular.\n  Brandon's family was certainly not surprised when Brandon grew up and \nenlisted in the military. ``He wanted the tough job,'' his mother \nCatherine said. ``He wanted to fight. He was competitive.''\n  Brandon's brother Shaun had enlisted before him, and so in February \n2010 Brandon enlisted in the Army. He deployed to Afghanistan in May of \n2011 with Company C, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker \nBrigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based out of Fort \nWainright, AK. Once again, he thrived under pressure, this time in the \ndemanding task of fighting for our country.\n  ``Brandon matured very quickly,'' his father Thomas said.\n\n       From the time he entered basic training . . . you could see \n     a big change in his life. He was headed in the right \n     direction with his life.\n\n  Brandon loved being in the Army, and would send letters back home \nabout how cool basic training was. Brandon's fellow soldiers quickly \ntook to the new recruit from Owensboro.\n\n       ``I can honestly say I've never met anyone like Mullins,'' \n     said SSG Matthew Mills, Brandon's squad leader.\n\n  SPC Deroderick Jackson, another one of Brandon's fellow soldiers, \nsaid this:\n\n       He was just a big help to me. Every time he saw I had a \n     hard time, he made me smile and told me to get it together. \n     On a mission with the Afghan National Army, I was real tired \n     and they were going real fast and [Brandon] said, ``You've \n     got this, brother!''\n\n  Another fellow soldier, COL Todd R. Wood, recalls that Brandon:\n\n     . . . was best described as the epitome of selfless service--\n     he took on details others did not want, he did not complain, \n     he just did it, and usually with a smile. He carried the \n     heaviest loads and helped out everyone he could. He was \n     always concerned about others first.\n\n  Brandon's fellow soldiers also recall he had a fun side. ``I remember \nhe was really goofy,'' said Private First Class Adam Baldridge.\n\n       One time I remember we got in trouble and we were getting \n     smoked until we almost had a tear rolling down our cheeks. He \n     just turned and looked at me and said, ``Just remember, they \n     can't smoke rocks.''\n\n  We are thinking of Brandon's loved ones today, as I recount his story \nfor my colleagues in the Senate, including his parents Thomas and \nCatherine Mullins, his brother PFC Shaun Erik Mullins, his sister \nBethany Rose Mullins, and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  This past September 11 was the tenth anniversary of the brutal \nterrorist attacks that ushered in a new era of military readiness and \nresolve for America. On that day, the Mullins family held a memorial \nservice for Brandon. More than 800 people came to show their respects.\n  The funeral procession, led by 576 motorcycles, traveled from Good \nShepherd Church to Owensboro Memorial Gardens at a slow, somber place--\ntaking 1 hour to drive 11 miles.\n  On that day, CPT Sean J. Allred of the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry \nRegiment, wrote Thomas and Catherine Mullins a letter.\n\n       I hope that through writing this letter you may know how \n     your son lived as a warrior and will continue to live in our \n     hearts and in our victories.\n       Know that your son was a brother to all men in his Platoon \n     and all who knew him . . . Brandon was a credit to you and \n     how you raised him. I am forever indebted to him and will \n     honor his memory in future actions.\n\n  Captain Allred's sentiments are shared by this Senate. Our Nation can \nnever repay the debt owed to Specialist Mullins or the sacrifice he \nmade that weighs so heavily on his family. But we can honor his service \nand ensure that he will never be forgotten by his country. It is thanks \nto heroes such as SPC Brandon S.

I hope we can continue working together to \nproduce a bipartisan piece of legislation that becomes the first \nappropriations bill, as such, that we hopefully will be able to \ncomplete with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wall Street Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have an interesting grasp of history. How else can you explain \ntheir choice of this week to push for the repeal of the most \nsignificant Wall Street reform since the Great Depression? For those \nwho need a reminder, it was 24 years ago this week, October 19, 1987, \nthat the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered the largest 1-day \npercentage drop in history. It was known as Black Monday. The Dow Jones \nlost 508 points that day, more than 22 percent of its value, $500 \nmillion in wealth destroyed in 1 day. It took the Dow Jones Average 2 \nyears to recover from Black Monday. Financial markets had not \nexperienced such a disastrous decline since the stock market crash of \n1929 that set off the Great Depression.\n  Most of us thought we would never again see such an event. Then came \nthe financial crisis of 2008. In between time, I might mention, there \nwas a savings and loan crisis. But then came the 2008 financial crisis. \nAnd 3 years after the near collapse of AIG set off the 2008 financial \ncrisis, big banks and big Wall Street investment firms are once again \nextremely profitable. Most of the banks reported their earnings this \nweek, and the biggest names made the biggest profits ever.\n\n  Wall Street CEOs are still pulling down salaries and bonuses worth \ntens of millions of dollars a year, hundreds of times more than the \naverage worker's income. Most Americans are still struggling. The \nfinancial crisis of 2008 wiped out millions of jobs.\n  I recall the month President Obama was sworn in as President. I stood \nthere on that cold January day, and as he took his hand from the Bible, \nI realized we had lost 750,000 jobs the month he took office. And, \nunfortunately, it preceded him and continued for some time. There are \nnow 24 million Americans unemployed or underemployed. Millions have \nlost their homes. Millions more are in danger of joining them.\n  Nearly one in every four mortgages in America is now underwater, \nwhich means that the owners owe more on the mortgage than the value of \nthe home. In the last 4 years, many Americans have seen their home \nvalues plummet by nearly one-third since 2007, and their retirement \nsavings cut in half. We are paying a heavy price for the perfidy of \nWall Street.\n  Solid, well-run companies across America, many in business for \ndecades, have been shaken to the core and cannot find credit to either \ncontinue in business, expand their business, or hire new employees. \nWhat do our Republican friends offer as a solution? They want to \nrepeal--repeal--the reforms that Congress passed to reduce the reckless \nrisk taking and deception on Wall Street. They want to repeal Wall \nStreet reform.\n  They want to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley reform that was put in place \nafter the debacle of the Enron Corporation. They are offering the same \nmistaken policies of the last decade. They want us to repeat the same \nmistakes that led us to a near meltdown of the global economy.\n  This effort to repeal Wall Street reform is part of a larger \nRepublican campaign to prevent government from passing and enforcing \nreasonable rules that protect our environment and safeguard America's \nfood supply, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products. Cut taxes on \nmillionaires and billionaires and get rid of government regulation, \nthey argue, and the economy will make a dramatic return. That is what \nthey believe.\n  But if that were true, the last administration would have been the \nmost prosperous in history. Those were the hallmarks of the George W. \nBush administration: wage two wars but do not pay for them, but cut \ntaxes on the wealthy and try to diminish regulation, when it came to \noversight on the largest corporations, banks and financial \ninstitutions.\n  Instead, the George W. Bush administration produced ``the worst jobs \nrecord on record.'' Those are not my words. This is a quote from the \nWall Street Journal. They said: The Bush years produced the worst jobs \nrecord on record. And they followed the same playbook that the \nRepublicans now offer as their idea for revitalizing the economy.\n  During the Bush administration, we saw the largest tax cut in our \nNation's history with nearly all the benefits going to those at the \ntop. It was the first time any President in the history of the United \nStates cut taxes in the middle of a war. That is counterintuitive. A \nwar is an added expense to government. Cutting revenue to government at \nthat point invites deficits, which President Bush saw during his term--\nhis 8 years.\n  The debt of the United States doubled during President George W. \nBush's term in office. Regulatory agencies were underfunded, \noverwhelmed, and they were represented many times by people who had no \ninterest in their mission. In the financial services industry, many \nFederal agencies turned a blind eye to activities that led to the \nglobal financial meltdown.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission under the Bush administration \nallowed America's largest financial institutions to self-regulate, \npolice themselves. The Federal Reserve declined to use its power to \nregulate subprime mortgages, which led to the terrible housing crisis \nwhich we still face today. The Comptroller of the Currency used that \npower to preempt State consumer laws on subprime mortgages, exactly the \nopposite of what they should have done.\n  Under the previous administration, unregulated mortgage brokers sold \nreckless loans, including infamous liar loans and ninja loans. Those \nare the no-income, no-asset loans. Major financial institutions \npackaged the bad loans as securities, which they then sold as \ninvestments. Credit agencies blessed those toxic assets with AAA \nratings, while being paid by the very companies that were selling the \nloans. The fix was on.\n  Insurance companies such as AIG insured toxic assets against loss, \nturning junk into gold. Investors all over the world then bought those \nassets, sowing the seeds for the economic crisis we still suffer from \ntoday. It was a daisy chain of deregulation and disaster. And what do \nwe hear from the Republican side of the aisle? Let's go back to those \nthrilling days of yesteryear. Let's repeal Wall Street reform. Let's \nlet Wall Street, like 10,000 flowers, bloom and we will get back into a \nstrong economy.\n  America knows better. We have seen this movie. We know how it ended \nin 2007, and we do not want to see it again. This was not the first \ntime. In the 1980s, savings and loans were deregulated, made reckless \ninvestments, and eventually had to be bailed out by\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\ntaxpayers to the tune of $130 billion. And $130 billion is bad enough. \nIt was almost $800 billion for the TARP bailout of the big banks under \nthe Bush administration.\n  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill requires institutions that \nsell nonstandard mortgages to keep at least 5 percent of those \nmortgages on their books, reducing the risk that they will try to pass \ntoxic assets off as solid investments. Under the new rules, banks have \nto make sure that borrowers can repay the loans. Lenders are forbidden \nfrom steering into expensive loans borrowers who cannot qualify for \nmore affordable mortgages.\n  A new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will look out for the \ninterests of consumers and prohibit the sale of abusive mortgages and \nother risky and destructive financial products. I cannot think of \nanother agency of government, not one, that the Republicans hate more \nthan the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I want to tell you, I am \nproud that I introduced the first bill on this issue, working with \nElizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor. We put together a bill. I \ncredit Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank for rewriting provisions and \nincluding it in Wall Street reform.\n  I think it is about time we had one agency, just one in our Federal \nGovernment, that is designed to look out for and help consumers and \nfamilies across America, to save them from the tricks and traps that \nare thrown at them which they could not possibly understand when they \nlook at the fine print of their mortgage agreements and their credit \ncard agreements and things that even lawyers struggle to understand.\n  This one agency, one single agency, with the limited power given to \nit and the limited resources given to it, is the target--it is ground \nzero for the Republican attack. They do not want to have even one \nagency of government focusing on protecting America's consumers. The \nnew Wall Street reforms tackle the dangers of too big to fail. We saw \nwhat happened there--almost $800 billion in bailout funds to the \nbiggest banks in America. They, of course, had made some stupid \ndecisions, greedy decisions, selfish decisions. We paid for it. \nEverybody paid for it, with savings that were lost and pension plans \ndiminished. And then, when they were about to fail, in came the \nprevious administration and said we have to save them or there will be \na global meltdown.\n  I was persuaded. I didn't want to see a global meltdown. We gave some \n$800 billion to these big banks. Did they send us a note of ``thank \nyou''? Yes. They sent us a note of ``thank you'' and put it on the back \nof the most recent bonuses they gave to their officers. They were \ngiving officers bonuses after the bank virtually fails and they have to \nrely on hard-working taxpayers to bail them out. That was the ultimate \nirony, but it is the reality of what we faced when we passed Wall \nStreet reform.\n  When Enron collapsed in 2002, shareholders lost between $11 billion \nand $16 billion, employees lost $2.1 billion in pension plans, 5,600 \njobs were destroyed, and Enron's top executives, whose recklessness and \ngreed destroyed the company, received $1.4 billion in compensation.\n  In 2007, after watching its stock value fall from $300 billion to $6 \nbillion in 2 years, Citigroup pushed its CEO, Chuck Prince, out the \ndoor--and, incidentally, they gave him a $38 million severance package.\n  In late 2008, with the financial system on the verge of collapse, 17 \ntroubled banks that had just accepted billions of dollars in taxpayer \nassistance doled out more than $2 billion in bonuses and other payments \nto their highest earners.\n  Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill, reduces the incentive for \nCEOs to place short-term gains above the long-term health of their \ncompanies by increasing transparency and giving shareholders a say over \nexecutive compensation. It is another way that the new Wall Street \nreforms can restore stability and integrity to our markets and \nsustainable growth to our economy.\n  Economists still debate the causes of Black Monday 4 years ago, but \nno one who looks honestly at our recent past can seriously debate what \nhappens when you take the financial cops off the beat and let Wall \nStreet and the big banks regulate themselves. Those who are calling for \nrepeal of Wall Street reform are basically saying we are going to give \nfree rein to Wall Street to make their own rules again. If they are \nsuccessful, I predict--be prepared--it is coming at us again. Wall \nStreet will overdo it, and their greed and excess will eventually cost \naverage families and taxpayers who have no fault in the process.\n  We cannot afford to repeat these mistakes--mistakes that almost \ncrashed the global economy. If our Republican colleagues want to join \nus in creating good, middle-class jobs for Americans, they can help us \npass the American Jobs Act.\n  Let me say a word about that. I know the majority leader will give \nRepublicans a chance to vote on one section of that today. Hopefully, \nthey will join us. It is a section that takes part of the President's \njobs act--some $35 billion--and uses it to hire those who would \notherwise be laid off if they are teachers, firefighters, and \npolicemen.\n  Two-thirds of the school districts in Illinois have been laying off \nteachers. That is not good for the teachers, obviously, and it is not \ngood for the students either. We are trying to make sure we save these \njobs and give our students a good education across America in these \ndifficult times.\n  When it comes to firefighters, we had a rally over in the Russell \nCaucus Room. A number of firefighters were there. They are asking, of \ncourse, for a helping hand to save their jobs in this tough economy.\n  I didn't know it at the time of the rally, but Tuesday night in \nMoline, IL, the city council looked at their tough budget and decided \nto lay off 12 firefighters who are responsible for ambulance service in \nMoline, IL. The fire chief, Ron Miller, said that he could not in good \nconscience continue to be fire chief if they are going to take 12 of \nhis firefighters away, that it was not safe for the people of Moline. \nHe resigned. It was an act of principle. It is an indication of how \ndesperate people have become.\n  The amendment we will have today as part of the President's jobs \npackage will give us a chance, on a competitive basis, to fill many of \nthese jobs for firefighters, policemen, and teachers. I hope some of my \nRepublican colleagues will join us in this effort.\n  How do we pay for it, incidentally? There is a tax. Let's put it \nright on the table. It is a tax of one-half of 1 percent on the incomes \nof people making over $1 million a year. So the first million dollars \nis not subject to it; the next dollar is. It is one-half of 1 percent. \nThe money that is brought in from that will spare hundreds of thousands \nof teachers, firefighters, and policemen from being laid off. I don't \nthink it is too much to ask for the people who are wealthy and \ncomfortable in America to share in the sacrifice with every other \nAmerican family who sacrifices every day in this tough economy. We will \nvote on it, and I hope we get bipartisan support.\n  In the meantime, let's not repeal Wall Street reform. We learned a \nbitter lesson 24 years ago and just 4 years ago as well. Let's not \nrepeat that bad history.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment all Senators in the way \nthey have worked cooperatively and expeditiously in moving these three \nvery important appropriations bills forward. Every Senator who has had \nan amendment has worked with us constructively either to modify it or \nto comply with what the leadership wanted to do.\n  I compliment all the managers for their work in moving the bills \nforward. I think it shows that we can govern ourselves.\n  This is the first time in a couple of years that we are actually \nfollowing the regular order on due deliberations of our appropriations \nbills. It is very important that we do this to meet our fiscal \nresponsibility of funding annual appropriations; that is, actually \nputting money in the Federal checkbook.\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\n  We have followed the regular order by each subcommittee holding \nrigorous hearings, doing due diligence in terms of oversight, and being \nquiet guardians of the purse. If anybody has watched us over the last \ncouple of days, we have moved expeditiously. The debate has had such \nrigor, civility, we have learned from each other, and we have modified \namendments back and forth. I think this is so positive and so \nconstructive.\n  I hope we can conclude deliberations on these three appropriations \nbills today. Again, Senators need to have their say. Better they have \ntheir say than have their day and we show we can govern in a manner \nthat is civil, that has intellectual rigor and due diligence in terms \nof oversight but also looking at how we protect vital American \ninterests.\n  The three bills we have today are agriculture, which is so important \nto the American economy--this is a jobs bill. It is also a food and \ndrug safety bill. At the same time, there is transportation and \nhousing.\n  People talk about an infrastructure bank. We don't know what we are \ngoing to do or how we are going to pay for it, but right here, today, \nwe have transportation pending that will go to every State on a formula \nbasis, and then to some very important special needs identified by \nSenators in this process, to really then create jobs and meet the kinds \nof needs our respective States have, to build and repair highways, \nbridges, and have mass transit to get people to work.\n  At the same time, housing is absolutely crucial to our economy. The \nFederal Government does own and operate housing. It is called public \nhousing. The ranking member on the Transportation-HUD bill speaks \neloquently about that. Maine is well known for its compassionate way of \ndealing with people in need, whether it is the elderly, the \nhandicapped, or the poor. But it is also how we can work with local \ngovernment in the Community Development Block Grant Program, where \nlocal people make local decisions on how best to invest Federal funds \nto have a multiplier effect in economic and community development. We \ndon't only want to build housing, we want to build community and at the \nsame time build jobs. This is fantastic.\n  Then there is my own bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, which I \nhave worked on in such a cooperative way with the Senator from Texas, \nKay Bailey Hutchison.\n  We also have the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee is \nsupposed to be about American business, and we have put in money for \nthe Trade Representative to make sure we not only import--we want to \nmake sure we just don't export jobs but we export products made in \nAmerica by Americans, helping the American economy.\n  We also have the Patent Office. We have just reformed the process. If \nwe want to out-innovate, we have to protect our intellectual property. \nThere are those who would rather steal our ideas than invent their own. \nWe have to have it where if you invent it, you get to keep it and \nprofit from it.\n  The National Institute of Standards works with the private sector--a \nFederal agency to create the standards necessary so that products can \ngo beyond the prototype and then be sold in America, but because there \nare certified standards they can be sold around the world.\n  Then we have the Justice Department. Aren't we proud of our Federal \nlaw enforcement? Sure, BATF had a big spill and cinders with the Fast \nand Furious Program. But look at the FBI, look at the DEA, and look at \nhow they are intercepting everything from terrorists to organized crime \nto child molesters. And let's hear it for the Marshals Service, which \nis often overlooked and undervalued. They are out there every day \nprotecting people who work in the courthouses and also serving the \nwarrants and keeping an eye on sexual predators.\n  Then our subcommittee is one of the real engines of innovation \nthrough its work at the National Space Agency and at the National \nScience Foundation, doing the kinds of basic research the private \nsector can't do but will value in order to invest again in those new \nproducts that will create new jobs in America.\n  We like our bills. Again, we have done oversight to deal with how to \nbe more frugal. We want people to work on that as the day moves on. I \nwanted to give everybody the lay of the land.\n  For those Senators who want to improve our bill by the regular order \nof the amendment process, we encourage them to come to the floor now to \noffer them and speak out. We want them to have their say and to have \ntheir day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting for those Senators to come, I \nwish to comment on an amendment offered by our colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Webb.\n  Senator Webb has been a longstanding advocate that our people in this \ncountry be well served by the justice system. He has become \nincreasingly concerned about the way the justice system works and feels \nit needs a comprehensive review. He has recommended the establishment \nof a national justice commission to do a review of Federal, State, and \nlocal Federal criminal justice systems, which will make a final report \nrecommending changes in policy and practices to both prevent, deter, \nand reduce crime and violence and also to reduce recidivism and do it \nin a cost-effective way.\n  I want my colleagues to know I am an enthusiastic supporter of the \nWebb criminal justice commission. It is just a patchwork now. At times, \nbecause we so load up in the bottom end after a crime is committed, we \nneed to look at prevention and intervention and also other things, such \nas alternative sentencing.\n  I wish to acknowledge the validity of the issue raised by our \ncolleague from Virginia. We have a very high incarceration rate in this \ncountry.\n  More than 2.3 million Americans are in prison. Another 5 million are \non probation or parole. Correction costs continue to grow and we have \nto tighten our belt. The problem is definitely evident in my bill. For \nFederal prisons alone, we had to include another $300 million to safely \nguard the Nation's growing Federal prison population, and that does not \ninclude those in State prisons and local jails. This subcommittee has \nan obligation to fund Federal prisons, but this increase did consume a \nsignificant part of our allocation at the expense of other DOJ \nagencies.\n  Why is this happening? Is it partly because of Americans being more \nviolent, there are more criminals, or are we getting better at catching \nthem and prosecuting them? You know what, the answer could be yes, but \nwe don't know. Is it that our mandatory sentencing--a good intention--\nhas now had unintended consequences; that people who are first \noffenders could be in alternative sentencing and doing something else?\n  We are spending a lot on prisons, and so I support Senator Webb's \neffort to create a blue-ribbon national commission to do an 18-month, \ntop-to-bottom review, examining costs and practices and policies for \nprevention, intervention, prosecution, and imprisonment, looking at \nwhich programs work and which can be improved. I hope it will end in \nconcrete, wide-ranging reforms.\n  I support the amendment and look forward to voting for it and then to \nworking on a constructive way to take a look at what his \nrecommendations are. I understand the Senator from Virginia is \nretiring. Along with his incredible service in terms of the national \nsecurity of our country, this will be one of his more lasting legacies. \nI hope we adopt the Webb amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 769\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I do want to comment on the Vitter \namendment and then be able to have the Senator from New Hampshire \nspeak.\n  But before the leader leaves, I want to express my condolences to the \nMullins family for what happened. It is a little hard to get back into \ntalking about amendments and debating issues when you hear such a \npoignant and wrenching story.\n  I am glad the Senator from Louisiana is on the floor, because I know \nwe will be debating his amendment.\n  I want to make a comment about the Vitter amendment No. 769, as \nmodified. I oppose the amendment. I appreciate the intent of the \nSenator from Louisiana to make lower cost drugs available to the \nAmerican people, but we\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nhave many flashing lights about this and I bring this from knowledge of \nbeing both on the Intelligence Committee and also in working with the \nFBI through our CJS in both the classified and unclassified setting.\n  The amendment allows individuals to import FDA-approved drugs from \nCanada. It sounds great. But we don't know if the drug was made in \nCanada, and we don't know if it is coming from a regulated Canadian Web \nsite.\n  We are concerned because of organized crime involvement and now \ncounterfeit drugs--lethal, lethal, lethal drugs--could come into our \ncountry and have dire and devastating effects.\n  We could talk about how to have pharmaceutical FDA-approved drugs \navailable to our people at less cost. Ironically, this is coming from a \nnational health system. I am not going to get into ObamaCare and all \nthat, but I do want to speak as someone who knows a lot about \ninternational organized crime.\n  What I want our colleagues to know is where there is compelling, \ncompassionate human need, there is greed. Where there is greed, there \nare scams, schemes, and in many cases they have lethal consequences. \nWhat the Vitter amendment does--first of all, it does not give the FDA \nadditional resources to combat counterfeit medicine, it just makes an \nallowable use.\n  I don't know where we are going to get the money. If our colleague, \nSenator Kohl, were here, he would speak about the money. I wish to \nspeak about the safety.\n  There are rogue Canadian pharmacy Web sites, and the consequence of \nthat is we do not know what is coming. One of the things we do know is, \nwe have examples of awful things that have happened. Do many of you \nremember when Coumadin came into this country? That is a blood thinner. \nIt was illegally produced and did not meet FDA standards and resulted \nin people dying because they hemorrhaged out because of a counterfeit \ndrug. They bled to death taking something they thought was safe.\n  There is Tamiflu that came into our country, but it was not Tamiflu; \nit was talcum powder. A person might want to swallow talcum powder. It \nmight give them indigestion. But I tell you there are other things that \ncan have more dire circumstances--birth control pills made out of rice \nflour. There is a complete list, and I encourage my colleagues, go to \nthe FDA, find out what they have experienced in this. Go to the FBI, \nfind out what they have done to try to intercept this. Go to our \ncustoms and border people. They have heartburn trying to prevent \nheartache from those things that could come illegally into our country.\n  We do have to deal with the cost of prescription drugs. We did deal \nwith it in subsequent legislation in which we have closed the doughnut \nhole. I compliment the Senator from Louisiana for wanting to do that \nand all who modified it. But do not make a good intention have a \nhorrible, lethal, unintended consequence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment, No. 753. \nThis amendment would prohibit the use of funds for fiscal year 2012 for \nthe prosecution of enemy combatants in article III courts. \nSpecifically, it applies to members of al-Qaida or affiliated entities \nwho are also participants in the course of planning or carrying out \nattacks against the United States.\n  I heard yesterday many of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle, for whom I have great respect, come to the floor to oppose my \namendment. I would like to address the issues they have raised and \nstart with this. I think their arguments miss the point. We are at war \nwith these terrorist enemy combatants, members of al-Qaida who are \nplanning or who have planned attacks against the United States of \nAmerica. In what other conflict has the default or preferred position \nbeen to try these individuals in the civilian court systems of the \nUnited States?\n  The primary focus when we capture an enemy combatant needs to be on \ngathering intelligence to protect the people of this country and our \nallies. I have great respect for our civilian court system. I have \ntried many cases. I have both defended criminals in that system, and I \nhave prosecuted criminals in that system. Our civilian court system was \nnot set up to gather intelligence. It was set up to have a fair \nprosecution of individuals who commit crimes in our country. When \npeople rob a liquor store, the police arrest them, they question them, \nbut the primary purpose is to find out who is accountable for the crime \nand then within that system to hold them accountable. The primary \npurpose of that system is not to gather intelligence and to make sure, \nwithin that system, we gather as much intelligence as possible of every \nsingle connection that individual has, to ensure we are preventing \nfuture attacks on our country. That has to be our primary purpose when \nwe are trying to protect the American people.\n  Those who want to--and this administration wants to--use the civilian \ncourt system as the default system, they are undermining, in my view, \nour ability to obtain valuable intelligence because intelligence does \nnot just come, often, with the brief interview that may happen in a \ncriminal case, sometimes it takes months to gather the type of \nintelligence we need to protect Americans.\n  That is why, under the law of war, we allow people to be held in \nmilitary custody, so we can protect the American people. But also in \ntime, as we develop information, we can go back to those individuals 6 \nmonths later and say we just learned from another individual your \nconnection with al-Qaida, your connection with an attack on the United \nStates of America, and gather further information to protect our \ncountry. Our civilian court system is not set up to do that because, \nunder this administration, when we treat an enemy of our country, an \nenemy combatant, under the civilian court system, they are entitled to \ncertain rights, such as the Miranda rights guaranteed under the fifth \namendment of our Constitution.\n  They are, of course, told: You have the right to remain silent; you \nhave a right to have a lawyer. These are rights they would not be read \nif they were taken into military custody, where they are not required \nto be read.\n  That is a fundamental difference that is very important for the \nAmerican people to think about. When we capture a terrorist, we need to \nknow what else they were planning and what they might attempt to do to \nour country or our allies. If we capture them and make the decision to \ntreat them in our civilian court system, once we hold them in custody \nfor a certain period in our civilian court system, under our fifth \namendment to the Constitution, we have to tell them they have the right \nto remain silent. Here we are telling terrorists they have the right to \nremain silent. It does not fit to have a system where we are treating \nterrorists that way. It undermines our ability to gather information \nthat will protect our country.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues, including the distinguished \nSenator from California yesterday, argue that military commissions are \nnot effective in holding terrorists accountable. I have heard cited \ntime and time again the number of convictions in article III courts \ncompared to the number of convictions in military commissions. This is \nan argument that, in my view, is very misleading because one of the \nfirst steps this administration took when the President came into \noffice was to suspend military commissions. To criticize the low number \nof military commission convictions when the President suspended \nmilitary commissions for over two years strikes me as disingenuous--if \nI were making that argument in law school, I think I would have flunked \nmy classes.\n\n  The reality is, to say our military commissions are not sufficient is \nactually very unfair to the military commission system. I find it \nastounding that somehow that would be cited as a reason not to treat \nenemy combatants, who are enemies of our country in the first instance, \nin military custody so we can gather the maximum amount of information \nfrom them, and that may take a period of time to do so, a period of \ntime that is not built into our civilian court system because they are \nalso guaranteed rights such as speedy presentment. That does not fit \nwhen we need periods of time to gather information to protect our \ncountry.\n  The distinguished Senator from California also raised the case of Mr.\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nMoussaoui. Our court system is, rightly so, an open system for people \nto see. In that system, I would give defense counsel all the \ninformation I had about a case so they could adequately defend their \nclient. When we are dealing with a case involving the prosecution of \nenemy combatants, much of the information is very sensitive. It can be \nsensitive to our national security if it is released. It could be \nsensitive if the individual being prosecuted gets that information to \nother people. We saw that, for example, in the Moussaoui case, when he \nwas prosecuted in an article III court where sensitive material was \ninadvertently leaked.\n  We also, of course, saw in that case victims of 9/11 having to \nsubject themselves to being mocked by him in our open court system.\n  Finally, I was astonished yesterday when I heard the argument from \nthe esteemed Senator from California that if someone commits a \nterrorist act on our soil, they should be exclusively tried in article \nIII courts. She cited Mr. Brennan, who is one of the President's \nNational Security Advisers, in saying we should be using article III \ncourts as an exclusive way to treat individuals who have actually come \nto our soil to attack our country. To me, that does not make sense.\n  If a person is a terrorist, a member of al-Qaida, who actually has \nplanned an attack on our country and actually comes to our country to \nattack us, they are going to be given greater rights because they will \nbe given their Miranda rights, told they have the right to remain \nsilent, they will be automatically treated in our civilian court system \nand we will have to give them speedy presentment and many of the rights \nthat, rightly so, are included in our article III court system. So what \nare we saying to terrorists? We are actually going to give them greater \nrights if they come and attack us here. In my view, unfortunately, it \nsends the wrong message. I think it is welcoming people to the United \nStates of America, when the message should be, clearly, we are at war \nwith them, we are going to treat them in our military system because \nthey are an enemy of our country, and we are going to make sure we \ngather the most information from them and their colleagues to protect \nAmericans and our allies from future attacks.\n  We need look no further than the case of Osama bin Laden for the \nproof that the process of obtaining information from terrorists is \nfrequently long and difficult, but I shudder to think what would have \nhappen if the detainees from whom we gleaned information that led us to \nbin Laden were instead read their Miranda rights, remained silent, we \nbrought them here, we had to give them speedy presentment rights. I do \nnot think it is a stretch to say bin Laden might still be at large.\n  We have to put the priority on protecting Americans by gathering \ninformation. We are at war. We have a fundamental duty to protect the \nAmerican people from the threat of future terrorist attacks. To me, \nthat is the all-consuming priority, more important than extending \nconstitutional rights to foreign terrorists--not American citizens--who \nare at war with us. I urge my colleagues to oppose civilian trials for \nthis category of the most dangerous individuals with whom we are at \nwar.\n  Finally, I wish to address one point which was actually quite \nsurprising to me yesterday as well. The distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California said these individuals should not be treated as enemy \ncombatants in military commissions is because, she said, it will reduce \nour allies' willingness to extradite terror suspects to the United \nStates for interrogation or prosecution or even provide evidence about \nsuspected terrorists if they will be shipped off to military \ncommissions in all cases. And she cited that, saying: Our allies are \nvery reluctant to give us evidence in a process where they don't feel \nthe rule of law is present.\n\n  Well, first of all, military commissions are historically part of our \nsystem. They are consistent with the Geneva Convention and the rule of \nlaw.\n  Secondly, the notion that we would allow our allies to dictate where \nwe would try enemies of our country just seems absurd in terms of what \npolicy we are going to take as the United States of America.\n  It doesn't make sense to me. Here we have a situation where this \nadministration is taking out--and I agree with them on this, and I \ncommend them for this--terrorists around the world, members of al-\nQaida, enemy combatants who threaten our country. We are killing them. \nYet the same administration is saying this same category of \nindividuals--that we shouldn't detain them in military custody, we \nshouldn't try them by military commissions, and that seems internally \ninconsistent.\n  It also seems inconsistent that while we have our allies \nparticipating with us in attacks against enemy combatants around the \nworld, that they would not transfer detained enemy combatants to the \nU.S. for fear that we will put them in military custody. It just does \nnot make sense.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support my amendment. We shouldn't \nfurther criminalize this war. We remain at war with terrorists who want \nto kill Americans. I brought forward this amendment because I firmly \nbelieve our priority has to be to gather intelligence and not to \nprovide them Miranda rights and not to undermine, in my view, our \nmilitary commission system but to treat enemy combatants for who they \nare--enemies of our country--and make sure we protect Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I would like to spend some time today addressing the \namendment I have introduced, which is pending--it will be voted on \nlater this morning or early this afternoon--which would establish a \nnational commission to address the issue of criminal justice in our \ncountry.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the senior Senator from Maryland \nfor her comments earlier this morning and her strong support of this \nlegislation. I also wish to thank the majority leader and, I believe, a \nmajority of our Democratic caucus who cosponsored this legislation in \nthe last session.\n  This is a bill that was put together over a period of 4\\1/2\\ years. \nIt is not so much politics as it is leadership in terms of how we \naddress the issue of criminal justice in the United States. We had the \nsupport last year, we continue to have the support, I believe, and the \ncosponsorship on the Republican side of Senator Graham. Last year, \nSenator Hatch and Senator Snowe also cosponsored this legislation. It \npassed the House in the same form we are introducing it today by voice \nvote, with the cosponsorship of Lamar Smith, who is now the chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee. It was voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year.\n  This is a very important moment in terms of how we are going to \nresolve a lot of the pending issues with respect to law enforcement in \nthis country.\n  I wish to start off by saying that my motivation in getting involved \nin this issue stems first from the time I spent as an officer in the \nU.S. Marine Corps, where one of the strongest leadership principles \nthat was ingrained in every marine was that in order for a system to \nfunction, it has to be firm but also fair, and also from my time as a \njournalist preceding the time I have spent here in the Senate.\n  It is the product of 4\\1/2\\ years of work, outreach, and listening. \nWe have listened to more than 100 organizations from across the \ncountry, across the philosophical spectrum. We have listened to our \ncolleagues on the other side. We have adapted the legislation to ensure \nthat this is balanced politically, so we can set politics aside and get \ninto the complex issue of how we resolve the broken points in our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Our criminal justice system is broken in many areas. We have some \nstrong work in local areas, with people trying to help fix these \nproblems, but we need a national commission in order to take a look at \nthe criminal justice system from point of apprehension all the way to \nreentry into society of people who have been incarcerated. We have not \nhad this overarching national look since 1965.\n  What are the two boundaries that affected my approach to this? I \nwould like to lay them out very quickly.\n  The first is that we have entered a period from the 1980s forward \nwhere we have tended to overincarcerate for a lot of nonviolent crimes. \nThis is a chart that goes from 1925 to today. Beginning in the 1980s, \nour incarceration\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nsystem skyrocketed to the point where there are now 2.38 million people \nin prison in the United States. Seven million people are involved in \nthe criminal justice system on one level or another of supervision from \nour authorities.\n  The second is that Americans don't feel any safer for all of this \nincarceration and for the approach that it has taken. Survey after \nsurvey from the last decade indicates that the average American \ncommunity feels more threatened this year than it did last year. Two-\nthirds of Americans believe crime is more prevalent today than it was a \nyear ago.\n  This is a leadership question. How do we fix it? Whom do we go to in \norder to find the answers so we can have the kind of advice that is \nvery difficult to obtain in a holistic way so that Congress can move \nforward and the country can move forward and solve this problem?\n  This legislation is paid for. It is sunsetted at 18 months--very \nsimilar to the legislation Senator McCaskill and I put together going \nafter the problems in wartime contracting, which now, after a 2-year \nsunset period, has reported out very important improvements in looking \nat a system in Iraq and Afghanistan that resulted in $30 billion to $60 \nbillion of fraud, waste, and abuse. We put a commission together, we \nbrought in good minds to help us solve the problem, they came in with \nrecommendations, and we are going to fix that problem as best it can be \nfixed.\n  It is balanced philosophically and politically. I would ask my \ncolleagues when the last time was that we had law enforcement lining up \nwith people who were generally believed to be on the other side \nphilosophically--the ACLU, NAACP, et cetera--all coming together and \nsaying the same thing. This needs a national commission. This needs to \nbe fixed.\n  In terms of law enforcement, we have the strong support of the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, the National Narcotics Officers' Association, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the National Criminal Justice Association.\n\n  There are a few quotes in terms of supporting this legislation that I \nwould ask my colleagues from both sides to consider.\n  Chief Michael Carroll, president of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, said:\n\n       For more than 20 years, the IACP has advocated for the \n     creation of a commission that would follow in the footsteps \n     of the 1965 Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement . . . \n     The IACP believes that it is imperative that the National \n     Criminal Justice Commission Act be approved in a timely \n     fashion. For far too long our Nation's law enforcement and \n     criminal justice system has lacked a strategic plan that will \n     guide and integrate public safety and homeland security.\n\n  Chuck Canterbury, the national president for the Fraternal Order of \nPolice:\n\n       Law enforcement has changed a great deal in the last few \n     decades. We believe establishing a national commission . . . \n     will only help law enforcement officers do their jobs more \n     effectively, more efficiently, and more safely.\n\n  Sheriff B.J. Roberts, president of the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation:\n\n     . . . make the creation of a national commission all the more \n     necessary to ensure law enforcement . . . has the tools and \n     knowledge necessary to adapt to the continually evolving \n     justice system. The NSA commends . . . this work on this \n     critical issue. We look forward to supporting you to pass \n     this bill.\n\n  Criminal justice experts from across the philosophical spectrum:\n  Chuck Colson, founder of the Prison Fellowship:\n\n       I write from the perspective of a conservative who has \n     always been comfortable as a reformer . . . I don't believe \n     this is an ideological issue at all, but one on which people \n     of good will, conservative and liberal alike, could join \n     forces to make prisons more effective, humane and successful.\n\n  Brian Walsh, the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       Reform experts who are serious about criminal justice \n     reform should . . . reach out to elected officials on both \n     sides of the aisle.\n\n  Mark Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project:\n\n       A new approach to crime prevention is necessary and the \n     time for reform is upon us. The commission created by this \n     legislation would establish an organized and proactive \n     approach to studying and advancing programs and policies that \n     promote public safety, while overhauling those practices that \n     are found to be fundamentally flawed . . . We strongly urge \n     passage of the National Criminal Justice Act.\n\n  Professor Charles Ogletree, Harvard Law School:\n\n       The comprehensive, timely and important bill . . . will go \n     a long way toward addressing some of the severe inequities in \n     the criminal justice system. This effort should be pursued \n     with great vigor to ensure that we not only hold offenders \n     accountable, but that we implement criminal justice policies \n     that are sensible, fair, increase public safety and make \n     judicious use of our State and Federal resources.\n\n  I am grateful that this legislation has been offered as an amendment \non this appropriations measure. Again, it is paid for. It is sunsetted. \nIt is balanced philosophically and politically. We listened very \ncarefully to our colleagues from the other side of the aisle to \nincorporate their suggestions as this legislation moved forward. It \npassed the House last year, and I earnestly hope people from both sides \nof the aisle will support this legislation when it comes to a vote \nlater today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 769\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Vitter \namendment No. 769, which we will be voting on a little after noon in \nthe next block of votes. I want to encourage all of my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to come together in a strong bipartisan way \nin favor of this amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment, and I thank \nSenators Sanders, McCain, Stabenow, and Bingaman for being coauthors of \nit, along with me.\n  The amendment is very simple. It would give all Americans another \navenue to get safe, cheaper prescription drugs by allowing the \nreimportation of prescription drugs for personal use from Canada only. \nAgain, it is very modest and very restricted. We are just talking about \nCanada. We are just talking about, of course, FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs. We are just talking about small quantities for personal use, not \nbig quantities, not wholesalers, not folks in that business. We are \nspecifically excluding biologics. We are specifically excluding things \nlisted on the controlled dangerous substances schedule. So it is a very \nmodest, straightforward, limited amendment, but it would still be real \nin terms of the relief it would give Americans, particularly seniors, \nwho are so often under the crunch--another opportunity for safe, \ncheaper prescription drugs.\n  In its form as I have described, this is nearly identical to a \nbipartisan Vitter amendment that was passed in the last Senate. It \npassed on a strong bipartisan vote, and I thank Members who voted for \nthat.\n  This problem, again, is real. It hits millions of Americans. It hits \nseniors particularly hard.\n  Let's just take three very common prescription drugs.\n  Nexium. In the United States, it is about $635 for a certain amount. \nIn Canada, that same volume of the drug is $386. For Lipitor, the price \ndifference on average is $572 in the United States versus $378 in \nCanada; Plavix, $644 in the United States, $434 in Canada--huge price \ndifferences of 39 and 34 and 33 percent. That cost crunch is what all \ntoo often causes seniors to have to make horrible choices between \nprescription drugs they need for their health or other necessities such \nas food and utilities. Let's give those Americans real relief, and we \ncan in this simple, straightforward amendment.\n\n  Let me say two things in closing. First, there have been safety \nconcerns brought up about the amendment. We have real safety concerns \nabout counterfeit drugs in general, but I do not believe--and I would \nnot offer this amendment if I did believe--this amendment expands those \nvulnerabilities or concerns at all. As an example, the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland brought up several cases documented in the press \nin the last few years, and those are serious cases of counterfeit \ndrugs, but none of them have anything to do with reimportation; none of \nthem have anything to do with Canada; none of them have anything to do \nwith small quantities of drugs for personal use. They are other \nunrelated safety concerns. This amendment would not expand those \nvulnerabilities.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  Finally, this vote is about the amendment I have described, but I \nthink it is also about the intersection of money and power and politics \nin Washington. President Obama often decries that intersection of big \nmoney and big power in Washington, and I agree with him. But I think \nthe single biggest example of that sort of money run amok in \nWashington--buying power and influencing politics in the last few \nyears--has been big Pharma dealing with the White House, specifically \nvisiting the White House over and over during the development of \nObamaCare and in the end supporting ObamaCare. And, oh, by the way, in \nthe end the President no longer supports reimportation, which he had \nconsistently up to that point. I decry that sort of intersection of \nmoney and politics. If my colleagues do as well, they will support this \namendment. If my colleagues disapprove of that sort of action by PhRMA \nand that interaction of big money and power politics, my colleagues \nwill support this amendment too. I urge strong bipartisan support.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from both parties for coauthoring and \nsupporting this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 772 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know my colleague wishes to speak, but \nI have a matter to dispose of. I ask unanimous consent that the Murray \namendment No. 772 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Webb \namendment to the bill. Senator Webb from Virginia spoke earlier about \nthe purpose of this legislation. I believe if we had the time to work \non this amendment we could accommodate the Senator's proposed goals for \nthe commission. However, this has not gone through the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is an authorization of a commission--it is called the \nNational Criminal Justice Commission--which is purporting to look at \nthe entire criminal justice system--Federal, State, and local.\n  This is an overreach of gigantic proportions. It is certainly within \nthe purview of Congress to do a national commission to look at the \nFederal criminal justice system, but to go into State and local \ngovernments and purport to examine the criminal justice systems of our \nStates and local governments is far beyond the reach of Congress, and \nit is certainly not a priority we should meet in appropriations bills \nwhen we are already in a deficit and debt crisis in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National District \nAttorneys Association and a letter from the National Association of \nPolice Organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                                                   Alexandria, VA.\n\nPlease Oppose S.A. 750, The National Criminal Justice Commission Act of \n                                  2011\n\n       I'm writing you today on behalf of the National District \n     Attorneys Association (NDAA), the oldest and largest \n     organization representing over 39,000 of America's state and \n     local prosecutors, to voice our strong opposition towards an \n     amendment to be offered today by Senator Jim Webb (D-VA) to \n     the FY 12 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill \n     which would authorize and fund the National Criminal Justice \n     Commission Act of 2011.\n       The amendment to be offered is S.A. 750, which was first \n     introduced by Senator Jim Webb during the 111th Congress. The \n     amendment would establish a Federal Commission to undertake a \n     comprehensive examination of all aspects of America's \n     criminal justice system--federal, state and local--and offer \n     those findings to Congress and the Executive Branch.\n       While NDAA believes that a comprehensive examination of \n     America's criminal justice systems could be useful, we \n     believe that S.A. 750 in its current form is flawed in many \n     different ways:\n       1. NDAA has major concerns with the formulation and \n     composition of the National Criminal Justice Commission. The \n     14-member Commission would be selected largely by the current \n     President (5 members), with other members selected by \n     Congressional leadership from both the Majority and Minority \n     parties. NDAA feels that the larger number of Presidential \n     selections would skew the panel to favor one political \n     ideology over another. Additionally, while guidelines on \n     areas of expertise (for example, ``law enforcement'', \n     ``prisoner reentry'' and ``civil liberties'') in order to be \n     considered to serve on the Commission are contained in S. \n     306, specific representation from criminal justice \n     practitioners such as District Attorneys, State and local \n     prosecutors, Attorneys General, Chiefs of Police, Judges, \n     Drug Court Professionals, Sheriffs, Police Officers or any \n     other law enforcement practitioner to serve on the Commission \n     would not be mandated.\n       2. Simply put, NDAA feels that an analysis of America's \n     federal, state and local criminal justice systems cannot be \n     completed in an 18-month period. The 18-month timeframe was \n     selected largely based on the President Lyndon Johnson's \n     Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice \n     in 1965. Over the past 45 years, the size and complexities of \n     America's criminal justice system has grown by leaps and \n     bounds and NDAA feels an 18-month window isn't near enough \n     time to complete such a study.\n       3. NDAA believes that the federal government should never \n     be in the business of auditing state and local criminal \n     justice systems.\n       4. During these times of fiscal crisis in America, the \n     Commission would require $5 million in new spending to \n     complete its work over the next two fiscal years. Senator \n     Webb's amendment would offset this new spending through the \n     Department of Justice's Office of Justice Program's \n     Administrative Account, which has already received close to a \n     50% reduction in funding since FY 2010. In addition, many \n     state and local criminal justice programs funded by OJP have \n     been gutted or eliminated over the past few fiscal cycles, \n     including NDAA's National Advocacy Center for State and Local \n     Prosecutor Training and the John R. Justice Loan Repayment \n     Program for Prosecutors and Public Defenders--just two of the \n     hundreds of programs which desperately need funding to \n     provide services for America's communities now instead of \n     funding a 14-member Commission to write a study. It would be \n     fiscally irresponsible to fund such a study while current \n     budget cuts are hitting America's communities hard.\n       It is our hope that you oppose this amendment as it is \n     considered on the Senate floor. If you have any questions or \n     concerns, please feel free to contact me at your earliest \n     convenience.\n       Thank you for all you do for America's state and local \n     prosecutors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Scott Burns,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 18, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf \n     of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), \n     representing 241,000 rank-and-file officers from across the \n     United States, I write to you to ask you to oppose The \n     National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2011 (S.A. 750).\n       During the 111th Congress, NAPO did support the original \n     version of Senator Jim Webb's Crime Commission Bill (S. 714). \n     However, over time the bill morphed into a different piece of \n     legislation which NAPO could no longer support. The current \n     proposal mirrors the later language of the 111th Congress, \n     causing great concern to NAPO's members.\n       These concerns, which we share with other law enforcement \n     groups such as the NDAA, include concern over the composition \n     and qualifications of the proposed commission; the \n     unrealistic timeframes called for in the legislation, and the \n     appropriation of funds for the commission at the expense of \n     other, proven, Justice Department programs.\n       Rank-and-file officers are the most visible and immediate \n     providers of government service and protection for Americans. \n     It is in the best interest of our entire nation to ensure \n     they have the support they need to succeed. We strongly \n     oppose the National Criminal Justice Commission being added \n     as an amendment. If you should have any questions or wish to \n     discuss this further, please feel free to contact me, or \n     NAPO's Director of Government Affairs, Rachel Hedge, at (703) \n     549-0775.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the letter from the District Attorneys \nAssociation looks at an earlier version of the bill which had a $14 \nmillion pricetag and the pricetag on this amendment is $5 million. So \nwith that caveat I submit the letter, because the points the District \nAttorneys Association makes are very valid except for that one error of \nthe amount of money.\n  However, let's talk about the $5 million. Is it the priority of the \nJustice Department to have a national commission that purports to go \ninto State and local governments and look at their criminal justice \nsystems at a\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\ntime such as this? They are taking the $5 million from the Department \nof Justice's Office of Justice Programs administrative account. That is \nthe account that administers the following grant programs, all of which \nI will not read, but they include: the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, Byrne-JAG grants, the National Sex Offender \nRegistry, the Bulletproof Vest grants, the National Stalker Database, \nand it goes on and on.\n  So the Senator from Virginia wants to take $5 million from the \nadministrators of this account and put it into looking into the \ncriminal justice systems of our 50 States and whatever local \ngovernments they would choose to look at. The Senate position is \nalready $118 million for that account, which is $64 million below the \nfiscal year 2011 levels. The House has put $79 million in this account. \nWe would be taking away $5 million more for us to go to conference with \nto do an overreach against States rights in order to fund a commission \nthat is going to look into programs, and take away from the fund grants \nthat are so important to so many of our State and local governments, \nnot to mention the people of our country.\n  Let's talk about the budgetary decisions of the States; for instance, \nNew York and Vermont or the State of Virginia or Texas or Alabama. How \nare we going to look at the criminal justice systems with this national \ncommission and say, Oh, we think the priority for New York State and \nits prison system or its number of district attorneys should meet the \nFederal standard? Would that be the same standard for the State of \nVermont? This is such an overreach, and it is not a priority in these \ntight budgetary times, in my opinion.\n  The budgetary decisions of our State and local governments and the \ncriminal justice systems should be done at that level. If there is a \nmassive problem, there will be lawsuits about it. There would be a \nlawsuit against the Texas prison system. There was one, and it changed \nthe way the Texas prison systems were even built and how much space \nthere was in the cells. If there is a problem, there is a remedy. But \nwe don't need a national commission to come in and tell the State and \nlocal governments they have a problem and rearrange the budgetary \npriorities of those States and local governments.\n  The GAO looked at this bill as a freestanding bill and they said the \ndefinition of ``criminal justice system'' is way too broad. A report on \nthe Federal criminal justice system could be valuable to Congress, \nwhich I submit I would agree with. Maybe that would be important. But \nto be effective, the GAO said, such a report should be narrowly \ntargeted on specific features of the Federal criminal justice system \nsuch as law enforcement, courts, detention facilities, number of \nprosecutors, whether there is a victims rights advocate--they can look \nat a lot of different things, but they should narrow the scope if they \nare going to be effective. If Congress is to responsibly and wisely use \nour taxpayer dollars in these economic times, I think it is essential \nthat we narrow the scope.\n  Let me mention something that is also mentioned in the District \nAttorneys Association's letter, which is something that caught my eye \nwhen I read this amendment. The 14-member commission is on its face 7 \nmembers appointed by Republicans and 7 members appointed by Democrats. \nSo we have a 14-member commission. On its face, seven from each party \nwould pass muster for bipartisan. However, it has the President of the \nUnited States appointing two of the Republican members. If we want a \ncommission that is seven and seven, wouldn't it be more fair or pass \nthe test of bipartisanship if Republicans appoint the Republicans and \nthe Democrats appoint the Democrats? This commission would essentially \nbe nine to five, not seven and seven.\n  I don't know that we have partisan issues in criminal justice. In \nsome areas we probably do but, in the prioritizing of the budget, \nprobably not. Probably there are political differences in our \npriorities for the criminal justice system, so if we are going to have \na fair commission that purports to have a seven-seven makeup, let's \nmake it seven-seven.\n  The reason we have a rule in this Senate that says we can't authorize \non appropriations bills is because we have authorization committees \nthat have hearings, that mark up legislation, that make the necessary \nchanges to accommodate the needs of the majority and the minority and \nassure that something has at least been vetted. This bill has not been \nauthorized. This comprehensive amendment appointing this national \ncommission to study the criminal justice systems of the Federal, State, \nand local governments needs a lot of work. I wish to reach out to \nSenator Webb to work with him to assure that it is a Federal commission \nlooking at the Federal criminal justice system, and perhaps find out \nwhat his priorities are for his commission to study, and let's focus on \nthose as the GAO said would be necessary. I would not take the $5 \nmillion from the accounts administering the very important grant \nprograms to our State and local governments and to the people who are \naffected by missing and exploited children, to assure that the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance program, SCAAP, which helps our border \ncounties in the States that are on the border, accommodate the \nincarceration of illegal alien criminals. In my State of Texas, the \ncounties on the border don't have the money to incarcerate the \nprisoners who are illegal aliens and who are Federal responsibility. \nThe administrators of these programs, such as the Mentally Ill Offender \nGrants, the Cybercrime Economic Program, the Coverdell Forensic \nImprovement grants, the Adam Walsh Act--we shouldn't be cutting the \naccounts that administer those programs. That would not be my choice if \nI had had the ability to work with the Senator from Virginia to \naccommodate his needs, as an authorization committee would.\n\n  This should not be in this bill. If we are going to have a 14-member \ncommission--that is 7 Republicans and 7 Democrats--let's have a fair \nappointment of those 7 members on each side. To say the President of \nthe United States would appoint two of the Republicans and that is an \neven distribution, it does not pass the test of what appears to be the \nfairness in the appointment of the commission.\n  So I oppose this amendment, and I would like to work with Senator \nWebb to have a national criminal justice commission that would focus on \nthe national criminal justice system. We do not need to overreach into \nState and local governments. We do not need to set the priorities for \nthe budgets of States and local governments. We do not have the \ncapacity to do it. I will guarantee, with 14 members, they are not \ngoing to represent 50 States and the needs of the States that are small \nand the States that have large urban areas and the cities that are \ndealing with these crimes.\n  We are into vast overreach with this amendment, and it is not the \npriority, I believe, right now to take $5 million from the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children and Byrne grants that are so \nimportant to our State and local governments and the border prosecution \nfunding and the SCAAP funding.\n  It has not been vetted as we require in the Senate. Unfortunately, \nthe agreement that was made between the majority and minority leaders \nlast night said no points of order would be able to be launched against \nthis amendment. I would have raised a point of order because it is \nauthorizing on an appropriations bill. The reason is, it has not been \nvetted by the Judiciary Committee, which ought to have taken up this \nbill and corrected the problems in it before it came to be full blown \nin an appropriations bill.\n  I will reiterate that I will work with Senator Webb. I will work on a \nnational commission that studies the national criminal justice system. \nIf we can pinpoint it carefully to the needs he is trying to meet, I \nwill be happy to work with him on that. I will be happy to work with \nhim on the appointment of the commission. If it is supposed to be seven \nand seven, let's make it seven and seven, not nine and five.\n  I hope he will withdraw this amendment. I hope the Senate can defeat \nit, if he does not. Most certainly, if we go to conference with this \namendment on this bill, I will do everything in my power to eliminate \nit, unless it is changed significantly to meet the needs of our country \nto assure a fair Federal system. We do not need to get into the State \nand local government\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\nbudgetary priorities in this appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are where in the legislative process \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Legislative session.\n\n\n                        Higginbottom Nomination\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words, if I may, about \nthe nominee whom we are about to vote on.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Heather Higginbottom to be the \nDeputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  It has been more than 12 years since Heather first came to work for \nme in the Senate as a senior legislative assistant, and later she \nbecame my legislative director and top policy aide. In all those years \non the Hill, I want to assure my colleagues who are thinking about this \nposition that she stood out not just for her policy knowledge and her \nunderstanding of the budget and the legislative process but for her \nability to work across the aisle.\n  I know a lot of colleagues are anxious to confirm people who come not \nwith partisan intent but with the ability to try to get things done in \nWashington. Believe me, Heather has that ability.\n  She worked with me and developed my proposal a number of years ago \nfor a constitutional line-item veto--a proposal which now has many \nbipartisan supporters in the Senate. I also saw firsthand her instinct \nto put aside ideology and to go after waste, to push for tough-minded \nbudget reforms, all of which protected the taxpayers' interests. She \nworked with me through seven budget cycles, and I am pleased to say, as \nmany Members remember, we balanced the budget back in those years. So I \nthink she comes with an experience of understanding what the tough \nchoices are that can help to improve our fiscal situation now.\n  I came to know somebody who worked diligently and looked at the \nbudget with a critical eye. When Jack Lew announced Heather's \nnomination, he said she was known for her ``dedication to sound public \npolicy that makes a difference in people's lives.''\n  Health care, technology, poverty, education, infrastructure--for \nevery single one of these priorities, she will look at them to \ndetermine whether the current policies are working, whether there are \nways we could do things more effectively, and whether the American \ntaxpayer is getting what they deserve in return for their investment. \nFor all those efforts, I think Jack Lew could not have chosen a \nstronger or more competent Deputy. \n  For all of those efforts, I think Jack Lew could not have chosen a \nstronger or a more competent deputy. I hope my colleagues will support \nher nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6800-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6800-S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF HEATHER A.

Higginbottom, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I reserve the time we have.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding that under the order, this is the \ntime for the debate. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the time is not about to be used, it will be tallied?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest we yield it back mutually or someone speaks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Sessions is on his way to the \nfloor. He does have reservations about the nominee. I think it would be \ncourteous, since we know he is on his way, to delay just for a couple \nof moments so he could make his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to Senator Collins' \nrequest?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am always in favor of extending courtesies. I think it \nis important to do that. But I would just reserve, if I can, therefore, \nthat we might wait until the Senator is here and have those 2 minutes \nused at that time.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum until the Senator is here, at \nwhich time we will have 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now considering the nomination of \nHeather Higginbottom to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget. We need to confirm this nominee.\n  The Deputy Director position has been vacant for 19 months. The \nSenate received Ms. Higginbottom's nomination papers in January, and \nshe was reported favorably out of both the Budget and Government \nAffairs Committees in the spring.\n  Ms. Higginbottom is fully qualified for this position. She served as \nDeputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of the Domestic \nPolicy Council at the White House. She also previously served as \nlegislative director for Senator Kerry. So she brings with her a broad \nknowledge of Federal policy and the operations of the government.\n  It is important to note that Ms. Higginbottom was personally selected \nby Director Lew as the individual he wants as his Deputy. His selection \nof Ms. Higginbottom speaks volumes about her ability and the respect \nshe has attained from her colleagues in the administration. Director \nLew needs to have the Deputy Director of his choice working with him at \nOMB.\n  I know some have questioned this nominee's qualifications. They are \nwrong to do so. Ms. Higginbottom is absolutely qualified for this job, \nand she is as qualified as other individuals who served in this \nposition during Republican administrations.\n  I hope the Senate joins me in voting to confirm this nominee.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as we consider the nomination of Heather \nHigginbottom to be Deputy Director of OMB, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues my concern for how OMB and the Coast Guard \nhave been conducting business.\n  The Arctic is opening at an alarming rate, which creates new \nrequirements for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy. Multiple \nPresidential directives call for Arctic presence to meet national \nsecurity and homeland security needs; to facilitate safe, secure, and \nreliable navigation; to protect maritime commerce, and to protect the \nenvironment as resource development increases.\n  Polar icebreakers are critical to meet our national needs in the \nArctic. According to a recent independent study, the Coast Guard and \nthe Navy need six heavy-duty icebreakers and four medium icebreakers. \nThis is not a political document; it is a study of the national \nsecurity and commercial viability of the United States. It is not a \nsurprise to this Senator that any third party, any independent judgment \nmaker, or anyone paying attention as the Chinese, and the Russians, oil \ncompanies, even pirates actively stake claims in the Arctic, that the \nUnited States needs to be prepared to engage to protect its interests \nthere.\n  In the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2010, we required the Coast\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nGuard to complete a comparative business case analysis to determine how \nwe can revitalize icebreaking fleet while maximizing taxpayer dollars. \nThis study was due on October 15, and today I have come to the floor \nbecause the law is being ignored. The Coast Guard and OMB have failed \nto deliver this report that I remind you was required by law to be \ndelivered to Congress days ago.\n  Even more distressing to me is that the Coast Guard is moving forward \nwith decommissioning one of only two of our Nation's heavy duty \nicebreakers. We think this is unwise, and it is exactly why the \nCongress required a study of such an action. Surely the administration \nisn't simply choosing to flout the law by moving forward before this \ncost-benefit analysis has been completed or reviewed by Congress.\n  So I know Heather Higginbottom is probably keenly interested in the \ndebate going on here today, and I hope that if she is listening and if \nshe is confirmed as the Deputy Director of OMB, she will take this \nleadership opportunity to transform the way OMB does its business. It \nis time for OMB to stop holding up congressionally directed reports. I \nknow there are a lot of smart people over at OMB, and they may not \nalways like the people and their representatives questioning their \njudgment. However, even OMB must follow the law, and in this case they \nmust deliver the business case analysis to Congress immediately. Some \nof the folks over at OMB may not agree with the Congress that polar \nicebreaker assets should be a priority. And while everyone is entitled \nto their opinion, even if it illustrates a complete lack of \nunderstanding of our national security needs, in our system of \ngovernment Congress makes the laws, and at least this Senator expects \nthem to be followed.\n  Mr. KERRY. With the consent of the other side, all time will be \nyielded back.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Heather A. Higginbottom, of the District of Columbia, to be Deputy \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 171 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, as modified, by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is bipartisan. I thank the \nbipartisan coauthors. The amendment would allow the reimportation of \nsmall, personal use quantities of safe FDA-approved prescription drugs \nfrom Canada only. It is a very modest amendment. It is for personal use \nonly, not large quantities, no wholesalers, Canada only, no biologics, \nand no controlled dangerous substances. It is essentially identical to \nan amendment we passed on a bipartisan basis in the last Senate.\n  I urge a strong vote in favor of this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. First, it is a \nbudget buster. To enforce this will take enormous amounts of resources. \nYou cannot be sure that that drug coming from Canada is not a \ncounterfeit, lethal death drug. You don't have any enforcement \nprocedures in here, you don't have the money to enforce it, and we have \na history of phony drugs coming into rogue Web sites through \ncounterfeit countries.\n  If you want a drug that has been made in a country that we view as \npredators toward the United States, when you take your Coumadin, when \nyou want your wife to take her breast cancer drug, when your daughter \nis going to take that birth control bill, then you want the Vitter \namendment. But if you want safety, then defeat the amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to support Senator Vitter's \namendment regarding drug importation from Canada. Senator Vitter has \nbeen a tremendous partner and tireless advocate in supporting the \ncomprehensive drug importation legislation Senator Stabenow and I \nintroduced earlier this year--the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug \nSafety Act--which now has 20 additional cosponsors.\n  The time for enactment of comprehensive drug importation legislation \nis certainly long overdue--and the critical necessity for this \nlegislation is actually greater . . . not less, particularly for those \nstruggling in this economic environment. Over the past decade, among \nworking age adults--only those with Medicare coverage saw any \nimprovement in their ability to fill their prescriptions. All others \nsaw a rise in their inability to obtain needed medications. Among the \nuninsured more than 1 in 3 individuals went without a required \nprescription--and in those with chronic disease that number doubles.\n  At the same time, according to AARP, over the last 5 years, the \nretail prices for the most popular brand-name drugs increased 41.5 \npercent, while the consumer price index rose 13.3 percent. So despite \nmanufacturer assistance programs--despite the increased use of \ngenerics--the high and escalating cost of brand-name drugs is directly \nimpacting the health of millions. Americans have learned that other \ncountries use the very same medications which we do, made in the very \nsame plants, yet pay considerably less.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, as well as the FDA, on \nopportunities to advance comprehensive drug importation legislation in \nthe months ahead. Not only does my legislation expand access to \nimported drugs in countries with comparable levels of regulation and \noversight, but it also establishes a higher level of safety than exists \ntoday for prescription drugs sold domestically--including employing \nanticounterfeiting technologies and drug pedigrees to ensure the \nintegrity of medications. In fact, it was the first to provide FDA with \nthe resources to improve its inspection of foreign drug plants, many of \nwhich today produce medications marketed here by U.S. firms which \nconsumers assume to be ``domestic''. CBO estimates the Federal \nGovernment alone would save $19.4 billion, so the savings from drug \nimportation are undeniable and I hope that the Joint Select Committee \non Deficit Reduction strongly considers this option.\n  Until that time, Senator Vitter's legislation, which allows for \npersonal\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nuse drug importation from Canada, represents a good first step. Without \nquestion, the price discrepancies between the United States and Canada \nare significant. For example, this week the average U.S. price for a \n90-day supply of Nexium is $524.97 compared to $386.67 in Canada. \nAnother drug, Plavix, costs $565.97 in the United States versus $434.65 \nin Canada for a 90-day supply. Lipitor costs $463.97 in the United \nStates compared to $378.23 in Canada for a 90-day supply.\n  Today our constituents--who pay for research, who subsidize industry \nadvertising, marketing, and investment--deserve access to competition \nand more affordable prices. Senator Vitter's amendment has achieved \nstrong bipartisan support in the past, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill is the result of 4\\1/2\\ years of \nwork and outreach and listening to the other side, incorporating \nrecommendations from across the political spectrum. It is paid for. It \nis sunsetted at 18 months. It is balanced philosophically and \npolitically. Contrary to some of the comments that were made, this does \nprovide for equal participation from both parties.\n  It has been endorsed by more than 70 national organizations, \nincluding almost all of the law enforcement organizations in America: \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, National Sheriffs \nAssociation, Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of \nCounties, National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  It is time for us is to move forward to get the comprehensive advice \nfrom the best minds in America in terms of how to fix our broken \ncriminal justice system.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have talked with Senator Webb. Some of \nwhat he wants to do is probably fine, but we are absolutely ignoring \nthe U.S. Constitution if we do this. We have no role, unless we are \nviolating human rights or the U.S. Constitution, to involve ourselves \nin the criminal court justice system or penal system in my State or any \nother State.\n  The Association of District Attorneys is against this. There are a \nlot of times interest groups are for something, but we have no business \ndeciding from a central committee in Washington whether Oklahoma is \nmeeting the requirements of its constitution rather than the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote against this, and that we honor our \nConstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is there time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is the most massive encroachment \non States rights I have seen in this body. It is $5 million on a \npriority we should not have.\n  I will work with the Senator from Virginia to pare it down so a \nFederal commission will look at the Federal system.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 seconds.\n  Mr. WEBB. This is not an encroachment. I wouldn't support an \nencroachment. It actually convenes the best minds to give \nrecommendations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. WICKER.

Mr. President, would it be in order for me to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl are printed in today's Record under ``Morning \nBusiness.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to please inform me when \nI have spoken 10 minutes. For other people who want to speak, I don't \nthink I will speak that long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 860\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My amendment No. 860 is a good government amendment for \nwhich I hope we can get broad support. There are special interests in \nWashington making the rounds opposing this amendment. These groups have \nargued this amendment will unduly burden the Justice Department, take \naway grant money for worthy causes or erroneously ban grantees from \nfuture funds. These special interests are trying to protect their \nincome streams of\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nFederal grants and don't want somebody looking over their shoulder to \nmake sure they are spending taxpayer dollars wisely.\n  This amendment is a response to the lack of oversight, \naccountability, and responsibility for how American taxpayer dollars \nare spent by grant recipients. It is a response to my work in the \nJudiciary Committee, uncovering fraud, misappropriation of funds, \noffshore bank accounts by nonprofit organizations.\n  Can you understand that? Nonprofit organizations in America have \noffshore bank accounts, and many other shenanigans are occurring in \ngrant programs administered by the Justice Department.\n  To fix this, my amendment includes an accountability and fraud \nprevention package for grants administered by the Department of \nJustice. I am glad to report the National Taxpayers Union, an \nindependent nonpartisan advocate for taxpayers, supports the amendment.\n  For the last decade the inspector general has continuously labeled \ngrant management at the Department of Justice a top management and \nperformance challenge. That is from the inspector general. Despite the \nlarge sums of money the Department provides the grantees, the inspector \ngeneral has repeatedly found inadequate controls on spending, \ninadequate oversight, and a general failure to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent by grantees in accordance with the programs.\n  Each year, the inspector general audits only a small fraction of \ngrants awarded by the Department. In fact, last year the inspector \ngeneral audited 21 grant recipients. Keep the figure 21 in mind. The \ninspector general questioned more than one-quarter of all the taxpayer \ndollars these grantees received. These questioned costs occurred on a \nrandom selection of grantees and represent less than 1 percent of the \ntotal grant recipients. So we only audit--go over 1 percent, but of \nthat 1 percent, 25 percent of them were found to have a waste of \ntaxpayers' money or not proper accounting.\n  Perhaps the most concerning part of these audits is that they are \nrandomly selected. If the inspector general's random selection of \ngrantees universally uncovers unauthorized errors, then we can see why \nwe have a much larger problem. If the findings of the audit from 2011 \nwere extrapolated through all the grants, that would mean nearly $500 \nmillion in questionable costs annually.\n  My amendment requires the inspector general to audit 10 percent of \nthe grants. It also requires the Attorney General to ban grantees for 2 \nyears if they are found to have serious problems that have gone \nunremedied for longer than 6 months after the inspector general makes a \nnegative finding. By requiring this remedy within 6 months, it ensures \nthere is enough time to fix inadvertent mistakes but also ensures that \ntruly bad actors are taken off the government rolls.\n  My amendment also requires the AG to reimburse the Federal Treasury \nfrom the Justice Department budget if funds are given to an excluded \nentity and then requires the Department to recoup lost grant money from \nthose grantees. It also includes a limitation on conference spending at \nthe Department. Just a few weeks ago, the inspector general issued an \naudit on conference spending at the Department.\n  We all heard about this audit, which revealed $16 muffins, the $32 \nCracker Jack snacks, $5 cans of cola, the beef wellington appetizers, \nand other abuse of the money of the taxpayers by the Justice \nDepartment. What we have not heard is how, by this administration, \nspending at the Justice Department increased from $47 million in fiscal \nyear 2008 to 1 year later $73 million and now 2 years later $91 \nmillion. Despite the biggest Federal deficit in history, the Justice \nDepartment, under this administration, has doubled spending on \nconferences in just 2 years. This is unacceptable, and it is why my \namendment requires the Deputy Attorney General to sign off on all \nconference spending.\n  My amendment would prohibit the Attorney General from providing any \ngrant to a nonprofit charity that holds money in offshore bank accounts \nfor the purpose of evading Federal taxes. If it is nonprofit, one would \nthink they would be using their money for nonprofit purposes.\n  This provision was the result of an investigation I conducted into \nthe Boys and Girls Club of America, the national umbrella organization \nfor thousands of local clubs. In response to my inquiry, the Boys and \nGirls Club of America admitted that, despite closing hundreds of clubs \nnationwide, it held nearly $222 million in investment, of which $54 \nmillion was in offshore investments and another $54 million in \npartnerships. When asked why this money was held offshore, I was told \nit was held to `` . . . avoid issues with unrelated Business Income Tax \ngenerated by hedge funds that use leverage.''\n  I support the mission of the Boys and Girls Clubs, truly I do. It is \ntrue nothing they did was illegal. However, given our current fiscal \ncrisis, I cannot support Federal tax dollars being awarded as grants to \nthose who hold millions of dollars offshore--I should say tens of \nmillions of dollars offshore.\n  Finally, I will note that my amendment includes a 25-percent matching \nrequirement for grantees, as I heard the special interest lobbyists \nhave been calling and sending panicked messages to many Members in the \nSenate opposing the matching requirement, arguing it would shut off \nFederal money to many grantees.\n  This provision mirrors one recently included at a Judiciary Committee \nmarkup supported by all Judiciary Committee Democrats and some \nRepublicans. Matching requirements are often required by grant programs \nthat virtually all members have supported. The Government \nAccountability Office even reported in a 2006 report on grant \nmanagement that to strengthen grant management, Congress should \n``ensure mechanisms are of sufficient value'' when implementing grants. \nThis is GAO speak for including a matching requirement so grantees are \nfinancially involved, not simply spending Federal taxpayer dollars.\n  That said, I wanted to modify my amendment and strike this provision. \nHowever, I understand people on the other side of the aisle objected to \nthat request so it would be easier to defeat my amendment. Remember, \nthis is an amendment Republicans and Democrats accepted in the \nJudiciary Committee. This is big money at stake with Federal grants. \nTalk about special interests, the special interests have spoken. Those \nwho oppose my amendment oppose holding grantees accountable for how \nthey spend taxpayer dollars. Those who oppose my amendment are \nsupporting giving nonprofit charities with money in offshore bank \naccounts taxpayer dollars. It will be interesting to see who opposes \nthis provision, especially given the fact that everyone should oppose \ngiving taxpayer dollars to those who hold money offshore.\n  My amendment is a commonsense way to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nprotected. It is something we should have done long ago. I encourage \nall my colleagues to join me and send a signal that waste, fraud, and \nabuse of taxpayer dollars has no place in a Federal grant programs at \nthe Department of Justice. That would include all of them but \nparticularly to organizations that hold money offshore to avoid taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 879, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when our American government spends money \non infrastructure, core infrastructure, we should look first to \nAmerican companies and American workers. But this doesn't always \nhappen. In fact, recently, there was a bid proposal in Alaska to build \na bridge with America's taxpayer money and a Chinese company employing \nChinese steel outbid the American company using American steel. This \nwas a big surprise in that normally there is a framework that helps \nensure American companies and American workers are able to do the \ninfrastructure projects we are funding with our taxpayer dollars so we \nare creating jobs here at home.\n  It turns out there is a loophole; whereas, this basic framework \ncovers highways, it covers commuting rail, it covers passenger rail but \ndoesn't apply to freight rail. This was a freight bridge on tracks that \ndo not also have passenger trains on them. I don't know how many tracks \nin America only have freight and not passenger, but when everything got \nsorted out through the appeal process, that is what it came down to.\n  This afternoon, we will have a simple amendment that makes this piece \nof\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nthe infrastructure more consistent with the rest of the infrastructure \nworld. The industrial might of this Nation was built on American \nrailroads made from American steel. We often say: Wow, there is a \nloophole you can drive a freight train through. In this case, you \nactually can drive a freight train through the loophole. That is what \nwe need to fix.\n  At a time when Americans everywhere are searching for jobs, we should \nbe supporting American companies that employ and hire Americans, use \nAmerican steel when American taxpayer dollars are employed.\n  In the framework for infrastructure, there are some exceptions. Those \nexceptions in this amendment are exactly the same exceptions that are \nprovided in the rest of the infrastructure picture; that is, the \nSecretary of Transportation can waive this requirement for U.S.-\nproduced steel, iron, and manufactured products if the application is \ninconsistent with the public interest. That is a pretty broad ground on \nwhich the Secretary can make a determination; more specifically, if the \nmaterials and products are not available in sufficient quantity or \nquality from the American manufacturer or if the inclusion of the \ndomestic material would increase the cost of the project by my more \nthan 25 percent. This is a small change that fills in or eliminates a \nloophole you can drive a freight train through.\n  The bottom line is this: If we don't build things in America, we will \nnot have a middle class in America. Our taxpayer dollars should go to \ncreate good, living-wage jobs for our workers here at home in these \ncore infrastructure projects, not to create jobs in China.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Libya\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, we all saw the news, yet to be confirmed, \nthat General Qadhafi is dead. This is a victory for our men and women \nin uniform, for the United States, for the administration, but, most \nimportantly, for the people of Libya.\n  Senators McCain, Graham, Rubio, and I had the privilege 20 days ago \nof traveling to Tripoli. I was quite surprised at what I saw. \nConsidering other war zones, Tripoli did not appear to be one of them. \nThe rebels took the capital largely intact. Only the Qadhafi compound \nwas blown away. There was anti-Qadhafi graffiti--obviously \nspontaneous--everywhere, and some of the most popular people in the \ncity were U.S. citizens.\n  While many people in Libya do not fully know the position of Senator \nMcCain, they knew he was an American leader. Throughout our visit, they \ncame out to thank him for the aircraft they saw overhead that they felt \nequalized the battle between them and their government, between the \nprofessional army of Muammar Qadhafi, the people of Misrata, the people \nof Tripoli, and the people of Benghazi.\n  We have the makings of a very pro-U.S. ally. Millions of Libyans \nright now are very thankful for the United States. They feel the \naircraft overhead that equalized this battle were almost all American. \nIn reality, many of those aircraft were British and French from our \nNATO allies. But because of that pro-American feeling, the new \ngovernment there is likely to be overwhelmingly pro-American.\n  As we look to a now-secure post-Qadhafi environment, we have to make \nseveral points.\n  First, when we were there, leaders were obviously afraid that as long \nas he lived, Qadhafi could make a comeback. That now no longer looks \npossible at all.\n  Second, to head off Islamists who may try to form a party, Prime \nMinister Jibril wanted to call for early elections. We should help him \ncall early elections because right now the rebel TNC government is \noverwhelmingly popular and would be elected.\n  Next, we have to unify military authority with the new rebel \ngovernment. We were briefed that there are 28 separate militias in \nTripoli. We should unify military command under them to make sure any \nsectarian violence does not break out with the victory that has come at \nhand.\n  Libya is a unique country that does not need foreign assistance from \nthe United States. We have seized 34 billion of their dollars and over \n$100 billion in a seized account worldwide. They need assistance. They \nneed medical backup, training for their army, support for their \nelections, but they can pay for it.\n  One thing they asked of us that we should provide is a hospital ship. \nUSNS Comfort should be allowed to go to Libya to care for those who \nwere wounded in this battle. We were told 25,000 citizens of Libya died \nin this revolution and 60,000 were wounded. The United States should \nhelp care for them, and the Libyan Government should reimburse us for \nthat effort.\n  When we look to the future, we also have a couple of key challenges. \nWe were briefed that Qadhafi's chemical weapons stockpile was secure, \nand I think it is, but we need to keep it that way. We were also \nbriefed that the arsenals of Libya were looted, including thousands of \nhandheld surface-to-air missiles. It should be a top priority of the \nUnited States to buy or gain custody of those missiles again before \nthey become a threat to civil aircraft around the world.\n  In the end, as I said, this is a victory for the administration, for \nthe men and women of the U.S. military, but especially for the people \nof Libya. If we take the steps I just outlined--security for the \nchemical weapons arsenal, recovery of the surface-to-air missiles, \nsupport for early elections, and medical care with the provision of a \nU.S. hospital ship--I think we will lock in the winning of a new, very \npro-U.S. ally in the Middle East.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President. I rise to speak on amendment No. \n874, my amendment on housing discrimination. My understanding is, when \nwe assemble for a series of votes at 2 o'clock, this vote will be voice \nvoted, and I particularly appreciate the work of Senator Collins, the \nranking minority member of the subcommittee, and chairwoman Patty \nMurray for her work and Senator Sanders for his support and \ncosponsorship.\n  Housing discrimination, as we know, prevents hard-working families \nfrom buying homes in the neighborhood of their choosing. Housing \ndiscrimination not only violates Federal law, it is a barrier to \neconomic mobility. It is a morally wrong practice with real-world \nimplications.\n  A study by the Miami Valley Fair Housing Coalition, located in \nDayton, OH, found that foreclosed properties in predominately African-\nAmerican neighborhoods in that city are kept in significantly worse \ncondition than foreclosed properties in White neighborhoods. That is \nbad for local property values, and it is bad for local governments that \nrely on property tax revenues because we know what that does for home \nprices.\n  That is why the Department of Housing and Urban Development \ninstituted the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, so-called FHIP. FHIP \ninvests in the private fair housing organizations that help enforce \nantidiscrimination laws.\n  My amendment would put FHIP funding on equal footing with the House \nlegislation, increasing it to near its fiscal year 2011 level--exactly \nwhat the House did.\n  This is about maintaining level funding so fair housing organizations \nwill not be forced to lay off hundreds of employees across the country.\n  This amendment is effective. Fair housing organizations investigated \n65 percent of the Nation's complaints of housing discrimination--nearly \ntwice as many as all government agencies combined.\n  This amendment is efficient. It saves money by streamlining the \nclaims investigation process.\n  My amendment is fully paid for, transferring money from HUD's Working \nCapital Fund.\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\n  Discrimination should never be tolerated. Especially in these \nchallenging economic times, it would be particularly devastating to cut \nfair housing programs any further.\n  I again thank Senator Murray and Senator Collins, the top two \nmembers--one in each party--of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban \nDevelopment Subcommittee. I thank Senator Sanders for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues when this amendment comes \nforward for a voice vote in a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-affirmative vote \nrequirement under the previous order for the Brown amendment No. 874, \nas modified, be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and 32 cosponsors--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--I ask unanimous consent that the current \nmatter be set aside and amendment No. 875 be called up and made \npending.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand there is an agreement \nregarding the disposition of amendments already in place, but I believe \nthis amendment deserves consideration and a vote.\n  It is a noncontroversial matter, as far as I am concerned. It would \nsimply make permanent 10 separate appropriations riders relating to \nfirearms. The House CJS bill did the same thing, but these changes have \nbeen taken out of the Senate substitute amendment.\n  Each of these riders has been in place for a long time--some more \nthan 30 years. These clarifying provisions have been enacted year after \nyear to preserve the rights of law-abiding gun owners and prevent \nencroachments on the part of the executive branch.\n  It does not need to be a yearly exercise. There is widespread support \nfor each of these provisions contained in my amendment. Once again, \nthey have never been the subject of any significant controversy. My \namendment would simply make them permanent so we do not have to bring \nthem up all the time.\n  This amendment would likely pass with more than 60 or 70 votes. I \nhope the leadership and the managers on the other side of the aisle \nwill not simply accede to the wishes of a minority of Senators who are \nhostile to second amendment rights by preventing a vote on this \namendment.\n  I ask again for unanimous consent to set aside the pending matter and \ncall up amendment No. 875.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I object. We have a good number of \namendments already pending, and we have a list of amendments already in \norder to be made pending. Until we are able to dispense or dispose of \nsome of these pending amendments, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hope to be able to work with my \ncolleagues on the other side. This should not be a difficult exercise. \nIt is just a smart thing to do. Once again, I am certain this amendment \nwould have the support of a broad majority, a bipartisan majority, of \nmy colleagues.\n  If the other side wants to prevent a vote--keeping in mind that the \nvast majority of the American people support these provisions--I hope \nthey will be able to explain it to their constituents. I hope there \nwill be a reconsideration of this amendment and that we can get it up \nand get this matter solved once and for all. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator has to object, and I feel very disappointed in \nthat, but sooner or later we are going to vote on this amendment, one \nway or the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 860\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as chair of the \nJudiciary Committee to say I oppose amendment No. 860. It is a one-\nsize-fits-all approach. It would have catastrophic consequences to the \nJustice Department and on the important work the Justice Department \ndoes in supporting local law enforcement, crime victims, and justice \nacross the country.\n  I have worked with my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, on \nmany issues. We have been able to, in a bipartisan way, develop \naccountability measures to ensure that particular grants administered \nby the Department of Justice operate efficiently and effectively. That \nis particularly important at a time of budget austerity. We have done \nit in specific contexts when those measures make a lot of sense.\n  For example, in the course of our negotiations of a bipartisan \nversion of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, we \nworked out specific proposals. Nonetheless, six of the eight \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee opposed this bill.\n  But one size does not fit all. Measures that make sense in one \nprogram cannot willy-nilly be applied to others without careful \nconsideration of the consequences to the programs and, to the intended \nbeneficiaries in local law enforcement, and crime victims.\n  A one-size-fits-all measure actually might harm rather than help \nimportant functions at the Department of Justice.\n  For example, this amendment would prevent grants to the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America. I know some have criticized some aspects of the \nBoys and Girls Clubs, and I would be happy to work with any Senator to \nwork out these issues. But the Boys and Girls Clubs of America do great \nwork.\n  I remember one police chief in my State, when asked if I could help \nhim get a couple more police officers to help out because of crime \nproblems, said: No. Get me a Boys and Girls Club. Get me a place for \nyoung people to go.\n  I know in Vermont they do a great deal, as they do in most States. If \nthere are reforms that should be made, let's do them, but not just cut \nout the funding in a one-size-fits-all way at a time when we are doing \neverything possible to give young people a different goal than going \nout into a life where they might do things none of us would agree with.\n\n  This amendment would greatly restrict the Department of Justice's \nability to spend funds for salaries of its own people. Is that going to \nlead to huge cuts in prosecutors and agents? Are we going to be \nimposing a salary cap on top of the one the President has already \nimposed? Are we going to be losing some of our best people? Are we \ngoing to be unable to develop experienced law enforcement officers or \nprosecutors?\n  I know, in law enforcement and prosecution, we value experience. We \ndo not want to go for the lowest common denominator. We want people who \nare experienced.\n  Again, a willy-nilly amendment does not help.\n  The amendment includes a grant-matching requirement. But in some \nprograms, grant matching is not a good idea. Let me tell you about one, \nlegislation that former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I put \ntogether. It has worked very well. It is the Leahy Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program for local jurisdictions. We have, in some \nlocal jurisdictions, the ability to waive matching provisions.\n  We have seen a rise in the number of assaults and murders of police \nofficers across this country. Many officers' lives have been saved \nbecause they have had bulletproof vests under the Leahy program. They \nwould have died otherwise. But they are in small departments, in small \ndepartments in States that could not afford the $500 or $600 per \nbulletproof vest. Yet we expect these police officers to be out at 3 \no'clock in the morning, usually with no backup. But if they are in a \nsmall, rural park in West Virginia or Vermont or all these other \nStates, they do not have any backup. They are out there alone. We ought \nto give them the kind of protection they need.\n  I want our police officers in rural communities who do not have the \nbudgeting of a big city department to have this kind of protection. So \nif we put a matching requirement by fiat--again, one-size-fits-all--we \nhave a lot of rural police departments that are going to be badly hurt.\n  What about crime victims? Crime victims have already suffered great \nloss. Are we going to say: We can help you out, but pony up some money. \nPony up a matching requirement, and then we will come in and help you. \nWe are going to spend a fortune on the guy\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\nwe lock up who committed a crime. We will spend $30,000, $35,000 a year \non that person. We are not going to ask for any matching money from the \ncriminal. But we are going to say to the victim: We can help you, but, \nsorry--I know you lost all this money; I know you have been beaten, you \nhave been bruised, you have been injured--you have to come up with some \nmoney before we can help you. The guy who did it, we will take care of \nhim. We will pay for that. But we cannot help you.\n  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was a prosecutor for 8 years. I know \nhow these victims suffer. They are usually the forgotten person in the \ncriminal justice system. The headlines are: So and so was arrested. \nThey are marched off. We are going to prosecute them. That is good. \nThey should be. I prosecuted a lot of those people. But the victim is \nthe one forgotten. Victims and others most in need of assistance are \nthose least likely to be able to provide matching funds. Rural \ncommunities, small nonprofit providers, tribes, and States that are \nfacing their own problems should not have another funding mandate put \non them from Washington.\n  The new matching requirement and other requirements in this amendment \nwould impose new burdens on all money going to State and local law \nenforcement through the COPS Program and many of the Byrne-JAG \nprograms. It would prevent many police departments from hiring and \nkeeping the officers they need. That is why the National District \nAttorneys Association and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations have expressed their opposition to this amendment.\n  At one time, I had the honor of serving as vice president of the \nNational District Attorneys Association. They care. They care about law \nenforcement. They care about prosecutors. They care about victims. We \nought to listen to them.\n  It also would burden grants awarded through the Debbie Smith Act to \nreduce backlogs in testing rape kits. There are rapists who go free \nbecause we do not have the money to test the rape kits. Tell that to a \nvictim. Tell that to the victim: We do not have the money to go get the \nperson who did this. I am not going to vote in a way that I am going to \nbe telling that victim: We cannot help you. We cannot test that rape \nkit.\n  The Debbie Smith grant program has received bipartisan support. It \nhelps to ensure that rape victims will not have to continue to live in \nfear because somebody said: It is going to take a few months to test \nthis because we do not have the money. By the way, lock your door. He \nmight come back.\n  I am not going to vote for that.\n  The matching requirement would be devastating to the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, which works hard every day to keep \nour children safe from those who would do them harm. It is hard to \nthink of any work more important than protecting our children from the \nevils of abuse and exploitation, but this amendment would make that \nwork much harder because the National Center receives Justice \nDepartment grants, but it does not have matching funds.\n  Time is running out. I could tell some stories. I could tell some \nstories about what happens to these children who are exploited and \nabused, and it would have everybody in tears. It did me when I saw them \nas a prosecutor, and it does every day when I read these reports as \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  My God, if we can go and try to protect people around the world, \nlet's protect our children here at home.\n  I agree with Senator Grassley that we need rigorous accountability \nmeasures. Of course, we should. We do this in our hearings every week \nin the Judiciary Committee. GAO does it. The inspector general does it. \nBut do not do a one-size-fits-all that is going to say to our victims, \nthat is going to say to rape victims, that is going to say to exploited \nchildren or that is going to say to our police officers, who are told \nto go out there without a bulletproof vest but to defend you and me in \nthe middle of the night: Sorry, sorry, sorry. The wealthiest Nation on \nEarth cannot help you.\n  No; I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 879, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n879 offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 264, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 153. BUYING GOODS PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Compliance.--None of the funds made available under \n     this title to carry out parts A and B of subtitle V of title \n     49, United States Code, may be expended by any entity unless \n     the entity agrees that such expenditures will comply with the \n     requirements under this section.\n       (b) Preference.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Transportation may not obligate any \n     funds appropriated under this title to carry out parts A and \n     B of subtitle V of title 49, United States Code, unless all \n     the steel, iron, and manufactured products used in the \n     project are produced in the United States.\n       (2) Waiver.--The Secretary of Transportation may waive the \n     application of paragraph (1) in circumstances in which the \n     Secretary determines that--\n       (A) such application would be inconsistent with the public \n     interest;\n       (B) such materials and products produced in the United \n     States are not produced in a sufficient and reasonably \n     available amount or are not of a satisfactory quality; or\n       (C) inclusion of domestic material would increase the cost \n     of the overall project by more than 25 percent.\n       (c) Labor Costs.--For purposes of this subsection \n     (b)(2)(C), labor costs involved in final assembly shall not \n     be included in calculating the cost of components.\n       (d) Manufacturing Plan.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall prepare, in conjunction the Secretary of Commerce, a \n     manufacturing plan that--\n       (1) promotes the production of products in the United \n     States that are the subject of waivers granted under \n     subsection (b)(2)(B);\n       (2) addresses how such products may be produced in a \n     sufficient and reasonably available amount, and in a \n     satisfactory quality, in the United States; and\n       (3) addresses the creation of a public database for the \n     waivers granted under subsection (b)(2)(B).\n       (e) Waiver Notice and Comment.--If the Secretary of \n     Transportation determines that a waiver of subsection (b)(1) \n     is warranted, the Secretary, before the date on which such \n     determination takes effect, shall--\n       (1) post the waiver request and a detailed written \n     justification of the need for such waiver on the Department \n     of Transportation's public website;\n       (2) publish a detailed written justification of the need \n     for such waiver in the Federal Register; and\n       (3) provide notice of such determination and an opportunity \n     for public comment for a reasonable period of time not to \n     exceed 15 days.\n       (f) State Requirements.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     may not impose any limitation on amounts made available under \n     this title to carry out parts A and B of subtitle V of title \n     49, United States Code, which--\n       (1) restricts a State from imposing requirements that are \n     more stringent than the requirements under this section on \n     the use of articles, materials, and supplies mined, produced, \n     or manufactured in foreign countries, in projects carried out \n     with such assistance; or\n       (2) prohibits any recipient of such amounts from complying \n     with State requirements authorized under paragraph (1).\n       (g) Certification.--The Secretary of Transportation may \n     authorize a manufacturer or supplier of steel, iron, or \n     manufactured goods to correct, after bid opening, any \n     certification of noncompliance or failure to properly \n     complete the certification (except for failure to sign the \n     certification) under this section if such manufacturer or \n     supplier attests, under penalty of perjury, and establishes, \n     by a preponderance of the evidence, that such manufacturer or \n     supplier submitted an incorrect certification as a result of \n     an inadvertent or clerical error.\n       (h) Review.--Any entity adversely affected by an action by \n     the Department of Transportation under this section is \n     entitled to seek judicial review of such action in accordance \n     with section 702 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (i) Minimum Cost.--The requirements under this section \n     shall only apply to contracts for which the costs exceed \n     $100,000.\n       (j) Consistency With International Agreements.--This \n     section shall be applied in a manner consistent with United \n     States obligations under international agreements.\n       (k) Fraudulent Use of ``Made in America'' Label.--An entity \n     is ineligible to receive a contract or subcontract made with \n     amounts appropriated under this title to carry out parts A \n     and B of subtitle V of title 49, United States Code, if a \n     court or department, agency, or instrumentality of the \n     Government determines that the person intentionally--\n       (1) affixed a ``Made in America'' label, or a label with an \n     inscription having the same meaning, to goods sold in or \n     shipped to the United States that are used in a project to\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\n     which this section applies, but were not produced in the \n     United States;

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n (Purpose: To increase amounts made available to carry out section 561 \nof the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, and to provide an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 333, line 9, strike ``$35,940,000'' and insert \n     ``$42,500,000''.\n       On page 336, line 1, strike ``$199,035,000'' and insert \n     ``$192,475,000''.\n       On page 333, line 8, strike ``$64,287,000'' and insert \n     ``$70,847,000''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, housing discrimination not only \nviolates our laws, it is a barrier to economic mobility. This amendment \nwould put FHIP funding on equal footing with the House legislation. It \nis about maintaining level funding so that fair housing organizations \nwon't be forced to lay off hundreds of employees across the country. \nThe amendment is effective. Fair housing organizations investigated 65 \npercent of the Nation's complaints--nearly twice as many as all other \ngovernment agencies combined. It is efficient and saves money by \nstreamlining the claims process.\n  My amendment is paid for by transferring funds from HUD's working \ncapital fund. I thank the chair and ranking member, Senators Murray and \nCollins, for supporting this amendment, and Senator Sanders for \ncosponsoring it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is \nan amendment I offered yesterday, Moran No. 815.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n860 offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a good-government amendment, and \nit goes after the Justice Department grant management program because \nthe inspector general has had grant management at the top of his 10 \nmajor management challenges. The inspector general says that management \nof grants at the Justice Department is abominable, so this amendment is \ntrying to take care of what the inspector general has said is needed to \nbe done for a long period of time. Grant recipients would be held to \nbasic principles of accountability. There are only a handful of grants \naudited each year, but out of that handful 25 percent talk about \nmismanagement, fraud, and things of that nature.\n  A vote against my amendment would be a vote to allow fraud, waste, \nand abuse of taxpayer-funded grant programs. A vote against my \namendment would allow nonprofit charities to continue to hold money in \noffshore bank accounts for tax purposes and still receive Federal \ngrants. I have a letter in my office that justifies $54 million in \noffshore accounts.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this good-government amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked with my good friend from Iowa \non accountability measures and will continue to do so but not for this \namendment.\n  This is a one-size-fits-all. There is a reason the National District \nAttorneys Association and a reason the National Association of Police \nOrganizations oppose it. This would make it impossible for small, rural \ncommunities to get bulletproof vests under the Leahy-Campbell \nbulletproof vest program. This would make it impossible for some of the \nsmall departments to have the money to pay for rape kits, so they would \nhave to tell the rape victim: Sorry, we can't go after the person who \nraped you, even though they might come back, because we don't have the \nmoney. We don't have the money to test this rape kit.\n  This is a one-size-fits-all that is going to hurt law enforcement. It \nis going to hurt victims. We will pay the price of the person we lock \nup, but we won't do anything to help the victim? I oppose it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is supported by the National Taxpayers Union.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I stand with the prosecutors and the police who oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Grassley amendment No. 860.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to speak now against the pending \namendment of Senator Ayotte, which would prohibit the prosecution of \nterrorists in Federal courts.\n  We need all available tools against terrorists, including the \npossibility of prosecution in Federal courts or before military \ncommissions. While there is no doubt we have made use of military \ncommissions in the course of previous wars, we have never enacted \nlegislation closing the Federal courts to the prosecution of our \nenemies. We have always left it up to the executive branch to determine \nwhich tool best suits an individual case.\n  Indeed, both the Bush administration and the Obama administration \nhave repeatedly used the Federal courts to bring terrorists to justice. \nFor example, the Bush administration successfully used the Federal \ncourts to prosecute Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, in October \nof 2002. The Bush administration used the Federal courts to \nsuccessfully prosecute Ahmed Omar Abu, who was convicted and sentenced \nto 30 years in 2005. The Bush administration used the Federal courts to \nprosecute and sentence Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called twentieth \nhijacker, convicted in 2006, and sentenced to life in prison for his \nrole in the 9/11 attacks.\n  The Obama administration successfully used the Federal courts when \nthey prosecuted Najibulla Zazi in 2009 for his role in the New York \nsubway bombing plot; when they prosecuted Faisal Shahzad in 2010 in \nconnection with the Times Square bombing; and when they prosecuted Umar \nFarouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called underwear bomber, in 2011 in \nconnection with the attempted Christmas Day bombing in Detroit.\n  If the Ayotte amendment had been law, these successful court \nprosecutions would have been thrown into doubt. In fact, prosecution \nmight not have been possible in any forum, because if a court \ndetermined that a military commission lacked jurisdiction and if the \nAyotte amendment precluded jurisdiction of a Federal court, there \ncouldn't be prosecution in any forum whatsoever.\n  That could have actually been the outcome in the case of Ahmed \nWarsame, an accused member of the terrorist group al-Shabaab. He was \nindicted in Federal court earlier this\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\nyear on charges of providing material support to al-Shabaab and al-\nQaida in the Arabian Peninsula. In the Warsame case, our national \nsecurity and legal teams determined that the Federal courts provided \nthe best forum in which to prosecute Warsame for his alleged crimes.\n  This decision was reached for two reasons:\n  One, Warsame is alleged to have violated a number of Federal \nstatutes, including sections of the criminal code prohibiting \ntrafficking in explosives, use of dangerous weapons, acts of \ninternational terrorism, providing material support to foreign \nterrorist organizations, and receiving military type training from \nforeign terrorist organizations. Only the Federal courts have \njurisdiction to try violations of those sections. Those offenses are \nnot listed as crimes under the Military Commissions Act.\n  There is a second reason why it was decided that Warsame was best \nprosecuted in a Federal court, which could not happen under the \namendment of Senator Ayotte. Warsame appears to have engaged in acts of \nterrorism and material support to terrorism, both of which are crimes \nunder the Military Commissions Act, but--and this is the problem--only \nif they are committed ``in the context of and associated with \nhostilities'' against the United States.\n  The administration concluded it would have been difficult to prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt before a military commission that Warsame met \nthose jurisdictional thresholds. As a result, if the Ayotte amendment \nwere law, it might be impossible for the United States to prosecute \nWarsame in any forum.\n  Our Federal prosecutors have a proven track record of prosecuting \nterrorists in Federal courts. Two years ago, the Justice Department \ninformed us that there were 208 inmates in Federal prisons who had been \nsentenced for crimes relating to international terrorism, and an \nadditional 139 inmates who had been sentenced for crimes related to \ndomestic terrorism. Those were crimes which were prosecuted in Federal \ncourts.\n  By contrast, only four enemy combatants have been convicted by \nmilitary commissions since 9/11, two of them, by the way, as a result \nof plea agreements, sending them to Australia and to Canada.\n  Critics of the decision to try Warsame in Federal court apparently \nwould prefer that he be tried before a military commission even though \nhe might be less likely to be convicted there due to the jurisdictional \nissues.\n  The most appropriate forum for trial should be determined, as it was \nin Warsame, on the basis of the nature of the offense, the nature of \nthe evidence, and the likelihood of successful prosecution. The \nexecutive branch officials who make these determinations are more \nlikely to reach a sound conclusion after weighing those factors than \nwould be the result of a one-size-fits-all legislative restriction that \nwe would impose under the Ayotte amendment.\n  Yesterday afternoon we received a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense and the Attorney General expressing their ``strong opposition'' \nto the Ayotte amendment. The letter states as follows:\n\n       Whether a given case should be tried in an Article III \n     court or before a military commission is a decision that \n     should be based on the facts and circumstances of the case \n     and the overall national security interests of the United \n     States. It is a decision best left in the hands of \n     experienced national security professionals.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       If we are to safeguard the American people, we must be in a \n     position to employ every lawful instrument of national \n     power--including both courts and military commissions--to \n     ensure that terrorists are brought to justice and can no \n     longer threaten American lives. By depriving us of one of our \n     most potent weapons in the fight against terrorism, the \n     amendment would make it more likely that terrorists would \n     escape justice and innocent lives would be put at risk.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the \nCongressional Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEVIN. This issue, as the Presiding Officer may recall, came up \nin the Armed Services Committee during our markup of the Defense \nAuthorization Act. Our bill expressly allows the transfer of detainees \nfor trial by a court or competent tribunal having lawful jurisdiction. \nThe amendment of Senator Ayotte to delete that authority was defeated \nin the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 19 to 7.\n  The bottom line is that Congress has never before attempted to \nprevent the prosecution of terrorists in Federal court. We should not \ndo so now. We should continue to use military commissions in cases \nwhere they are the best place for prosecution and for trial. We should \nnot foreclose prosecution and trial in Federal courts.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader McConnell: We write to express \n     our strong opposition to the Ayotte amendment to H.R. 2112, \n     which would severely curtail the ability of the Executive \n     branch to prosecute alleged terrorists in Federal court.\n       The amendment represents an extreme and unprecedented \n     encroachment on the authority of the Executive Branch to \n     determine when and where to prosecute terrorist suspects. \n     Whether a given case should be tried in an Article III court \n     or before a military commission is a decision that should be \n     based on the facts and circumstances of the case and the \n     overall national security interests of the United States. It \n     is a decision best left in the hands of experienced national \n     security professionals.\n       If we are to safeguard the American people, we must be in a \n     position to employ every lawful instrument of national \n     power--including both courts and military commissions--to \n     ensure that terrorists are brought to justice and can no \n     longer threaten American lives.

Panetta,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I rise to speak today as \nin morning business for about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Withholding Tax Relief Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I rise to speak in \nstrong support of a bill we will be voting on, I hope, later today, S. \n1726, the Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2011, which has over 30 \ncosponsors. You are one of them, Madam President, and there are many \nothers. It is based on legislation I have introduced on three separate \noccasions which currently has almost one-third of the entire Senate \ncosponsoring it. As I said, I brought it up before, and I am glad it \nwill finally be getting a vote.\n  This is exactly the type of bipartisan jobs bill that the American \npeople are yearning for and that we should be focusing on, and I am \nglad we are finally able to bring the repeal of this job-killing tax \nprovision to the floor for a serious vote. This is a jobs bill, plain \nand simple. I don't know how else you can phrase it.\n  Section 3402(t) of the Tax Code will require, beginning in January of \n2013, Federal, State and local governments to withhold 3 percent of \nnearly all contract payments made to private companies, as well as \nMedicare payments, construction payments, and certain loan payments. \nThis is an arbitrary tax that is extremely expensive to implement and \npunishes the many for the bad acts of the few. What is more, this tax \nabsolutely promises to kill jobs at a time when we absolutely cannot \nafford to kill any jobs.\n  The Government Withholding Relief Coalition, a coalition of more than \n100 members--I have a sheaf here of 4 pages of groups: American Bankers \nAssociation, Americans for Tax Reform, National Association of \nManufacturers, wholesalers, National League of Cities, chambers of \ncommerce--4 pages of groups and entities, over 100 members, a cross-\nsection of America. They have estimated that a combined 5-year total \ncost to the States and the Federal Government in implementing this \nlegislation could be as high as $75 billion. The Department of Defense \nalone has estimated this provision could cost the DOD around $17 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\n  I know Chairman Levin, who spoke before me--we are wrestling with \ntrying to reinstate I think $20 to $25 billion from what the \nappropriations folks cut. That is real money.\n  Here is the catch: It is estimated to bring in only around $8 billion \nduring that same period. I am not sure about you, Madam President, but \nyou have the cost of approximately $75 billion, the cost to the States \nand the Federal Government of implementing the legislation, and then \nthe DOD is $17 billion, and yet we are only going to get $8 billion in \nreturn? I do not know how else to say it except that only on Capitol \nHill does something such as that make sense, where we are spending more \nthan we are actually going to be getting.\n  Unfortunately, there are many other reasons this provision should be \nrepealed as soon as possible. At a time when the State and local \ngovernments are under extreme financial stress, why would we want to \nforce another unfunded, costly mandate on them to recover minimal funds \nfor the Federal Treasury? It makes no sense. As I said before, only in \nWashington does spending $2 in order to recoup $1 make any sense.\n  I am encouraged by many of the cosponsors. As I said, it is a \nbipartisan group. At what point do you see Senator Franken and Senator \nPaul on the same bill together and everybody in between as well?\n  I am concerned, as are many others, that businesses that contract \nwith the government will simply pass on the costs of this provision to \nthe government in the form of higher bids on projects. I am also \nconcerned about the effects on small businesses as well. Senator Snowe, \nthe ranking member of the Small Business Committee, on which I serve, \nand my follow cosponsor on my original bill, recognized early on with \nme that this provision has destructive consequences for small \nbusinesses. Everybody here knows it.\n  At what point do we put politics aside and just agree to pass \nsomething that is so simple? This provision makes absolutely no sense. \nAs you know, it will restrict cashflow and discourage small businesses \nfrom participating in Federal contracting.\n  Members of the construction industry are equally worried. As you \nknow, that is an industry which has been devastated. They are equally \nconcerned that it will tax away all their anticipated profit on \ngovernment projects, thus diminishing competition and further raising \ncosts to the government.\n  There is a reason it has been delayed over and over since 2005. \nEveryone knows it can never go into effect because it will place an \nextraordinary cost burden on the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments as well. We cannot afford to shoulder that burden right \nnow; everyone agrees.\n  Once again, the 30 cosponsors of the original bill represent a \ndiverse cross-section.\n  The President proposed its delay in his most recent jobs package.\n  I said before, why don't we work on that which we can all agree? Why \ndon't we just take up the measures in a bipartisan, bicameral manner \nand get them out the door? I understand the House is working on this. \nWe are doing it now. It is a small piece, a small step, but let's get \nit right out the door. There is no reason we should not be able to do \nit.\n  Last week, I had an opportunity to speak before the Small Business \nCommittee with Secretary Geithner, who issued the provision's latest \ndelay in May, about the importance of fully repealing this provision.\n  This repeal is one of those rare opportunities we have around here \nwhere everyone can be on the same team. It is very similar to when we \npassed the Arlington Cemetery bill, with your leadership, Madam \nPresident. In the midst of all the problems we had last year, the \nlegislative bodies of both branches came together and passed the \nArlington Cemetery bill. I look at this as a similar provision where we \ncan actually do something in a bipartisan, bicameral manner and get it \npassed.\n  I urge my colleagues to rise above partisan politics and support this \ntruly bipartisan legislation. As I said before, we are Americans first. \nWe are Americans first. To me, that means it should not matter whether \nthis is a Republican bill or a Democratic bill. It matters that it is a \nbill that is going to help small businesses and Americans who are \nfighting on a daily basis just to make ends meet.\n  We have a great opportunity today to move forward on a piece of jobs \nlegislation and pass this portion of the bill that is, in fact, \nsupported by the President and scheduled, as I said, to be taken up in \nthe House next week.\n  I offer my complete support for the bill and appreciate the leader \nfor bringing it to the floor for a vote.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven pertaining to the introduction of S. 1751 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, yesterday, around 5:30 or so, we had all \nkinds of Members who suddenly wanted to come over and talk about their \namendments. Now is an opportunity to talk about these three \nappropriations bills. The floor is open. There are a number of pending \namendments. Hopefully, Members will come over and offer amendments or \ntalk about the amendments they have offered. We want to move through \nthis legislation as quickly as we can but, actually, no quicker than we \nneed to. There is plenty of time. If Members want to talk about this \nbill, if they want to support the bill or oppose the bill or maybe more \nlikely right now come and talk about the significant number of pending \namendments, this is a good time to do that.\n  I suppose the other thing I could and should talk about that I know \nthe Chair would be happy with would be the great Cardinals victory last \nnight. Even the cushions in the back of the Chamber seem to be a little \nbrighter red today than they normally are. So maybe the Texans need to \ncome and talk about their amendments and talk about the Rangers. But I \nwill say that the Cardinals team, from the last week or so of August \nuntil right now, has been one of the true miracles of baseball \nhistory--going from 10\\1/2\\ games to even qualifying to be the wildcard \nin the playoffs and almost every game from that moment on having the \nsense that this is the intensity of the final game of the season.\n  All Cardinals fans are proud. There is quite a bit of red on today \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  There is another Cardinals game tonight, and I wouldn't mind watching \nsome of it. My best chance of doing that is if Members will come over \nhere and talk about their pending amendments now and defend those \namendments.\n  It seems to me as though this week the Senate has been working as the \nSenate should work--bringing appropriations bills to the floor, \ndebating those bills, letting Members propose amendments--and hopefully \nwe will continue with these bills: the Agriculture, Rural Development, \nand Food and Drug Administration bill Senator Kohl and I brought to the \nfloor; the Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development bill; the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill--I think it may be Commerce-Justice now. So \nwe have a lot of topics. We don't want to let this appropriations \nprocess go to one huge bill that nobody understands, nobody has time to \nread, and nobody has time to debate. So hopefully, with all of these \npending amendments, we will have some discussion. We have had a number \nof votes already today, but a number of Members have things they would \nlike to see discussed and voted on, and hopefully we will begin to see \nmore of that happen.\n  With that, it does appear we don't have a quorum yet or other Members \nto speak, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to echo the comments of my \ncolleague from Missouri. I too invite Senators to come down. We are \nshowing that we can govern. We have our appropriations bills here, and \nwe have already disposed of 8 amendments--actually, I think we have \ndisposed of more than 8 by now--but we have 22 amendments pending. If \nMembers have an amendment, come and speak to it. If a Member has \nreviewed these 22 and opposes them, have your day, have your say, \nbecause that is what the Senate is--due diligence, due deliberation.\n  What we don't want is everybody--exactly as the Senator from Missouri \nsaid, who is the ranking member on Agriculture--coming at 5:30 or 6 or \n7 o'clock and wanting to speak. I know the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle would like to move expeditiously and even, if possible, \nfinish this bill tonight. I think we have agreed we are willing to work \nthrough the evening to dispose of amendments, but Senators have to \nspeak on their amendments.\n  So, again, on my side of the aisle, I would really encourage Members, \nif they have an amendment, to come and speak to it. Regardless of the \nside of the aisle a Member is on, if a person opposes an amendment, \ncome and speak on it as well.\n  Some of these are quite controversial. Again, we invite this due \ndeliberation.\n  Everybody has worked hard. We have done a lot in appropriations. We \nhave ended earmarks--a topic I know is of special interest to many of \nour colleagues. We have made significant cuts this year as a result of \nthe continuing resolution and other agreements. But at the same time, \nthe subcommittees have worked hard to follow the mission of what we are \ntrying to do in this country: have a more frugal government.\n  I know in my bill we have paid particular attention on how to curb \nwaste, and I will be speak about that shortly. But, again, I invite my \ncolleagues to come to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Withholding Tax Relief Act\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1726, the \nWithholding Tax Relief Act of 2011. I know we are currently debating \nseveral appropriations bills which we hope to be concluded sometime \nlater today. But in that process, my expectation is that we are going \nto get an opportunity to vote on a couple of amendments that deal with \nthe real issue I think that is on the minds of most Americans today, \nthat is, jobs and the economy.\n  The bill I referenced, S. 1726, is identical to the measure that was \nintroduced earlier this year by Senators Scott Brown and Olympia Snowe \nand of which I and 28 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \ncosponsors. Given that we may get a chance to vote on this legislation, \nperhaps in the form of an amendment to the bill that we are currently \non later today, I want to say a few words as to why I believe this \nrepresents the right approach to spurring our economy.\n  I think there is a right approach and there is a wrong approach to \ngetting people back to work in this country and getting the economy \ngrowing and expanding again. American businesses need access to \ncapital. They need to be able to deploy their existing capital as \nefficiently and effectively as possible.\n  If we do not act, come January 1, 2013, 3 percent of contracts \nbetween private businesses and Federal, State, and local governments \nwill be withheld. This means that dollars that could be reinvested by \nbusinesses in new equipment or new employees will instead be used \nessentially to give the IRS an interest-free loan.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that permanently \neliminating\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\nthis burdensome withholding requirement will allow taxpayers to keep an \nadditional $11.2 billion over the next 10 years. While 3 percent of a \ncontract may not seem like a large amount, consider that for many \nbusinesses 3 percent could be their entire profit margin. In effect, \nthe withholding requirement--if we allow it to take effect--will result \nin a large transfer of funds from local economies all across this \ncountry to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Imposing this new wealth transfer makes absolutely no sense while our \neconomy remains very fragile. The good news is that there is broad \nbipartisan support for repealing the 3-percent withholding requirement. \nThe Obama administration's Office of Management and Budget last month \nreleased the President's jobs plan entitled ``Living Within Our Means \nand Investing in the Future.'' On page 8 of this document it reads: \n``The President's plan calls for the Congress to remove burdensome \nwithholding requirements that keep capital out of the hands of job \ncreators.'' I could not agree more. Unfortunately, the details of the \nPresident's plan, as introduced by Majority Leader Reid only provides a \n1-year delay in implementation of the withholding provision.\n  American businesses need more than a 1-year delay. They need \ncertainty. This is the reason that a long list of businesses and trade \njob groups support this legislation. In fact, the documents prepared \nlast week by the House Ways and Means Committee lists 170 businesses \nand groups supporting repeal of the 3-percent withholding requirement. \nThis diverse list includes groups such as the American Farm Bureau, the \nAmerican Bankers Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, \nthe American Gas Association, the American Ambulance Association, to \nname a few.\n  It should be no surprise that this bill also enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport. The House version of the bill, likely to be voted on next \nweek, has 269 cosponsors, 62 of whom are Democrats. In the Senate bill, \nthere are a number of both Republican and Democratic cosponsors.\n  The bill is fully offset by rescinding unobligated discretionary \nfunds. This is the same offset we voted on in February when Senator \nStabenow proposed it to pay for repeal of the 1099 reporting \nrequirement. That vote passed by 81 to 17, with 34 Democrats voting \naye.\n  To summarize, we have a bill before us we will soon vote on that will \nallow businesses to keep more of their own funds rather than sending \nthem in advance to the IRS, that has broad bipartisan support, that is \nfully offset using an offset that is supported by a majority of both \nRepublicans and Democrats in this Chamber. So why would we not want to \nenact this legislation as soon as possible?\n  I would note that this approach stands in stark contrast to the \nministimulus bill that is being proposed by the majority leader. The \nReid bill goes in exactly the opposite direction. It would raise taxes \non the private sector to pay for new spending on the public sector. \nLet's think about that for a minute. We all agree that the private \nsector creates the vast majority of jobs in this country. And since the \nbeginning of the recession, there has been a decline of 5.4 percent of \nprivate sector jobs, or 6.2 million jobs lost. However, during that \nperiod, government jobs at all levels declined by less than 2 percent \nand Federal Government jobs increased by over 2 percent, or by 63,000 \njobs.\n  So the Federal Government is getting larger at the same time the \nprivate economy is shedding jobs.\n  While we all want to find ways to help public sector employees, let \nme suggest that we need to do it without imposing new burdens on the \nprivate sector at a time when we should be focused on finding ways to \npromote private sector job creation.\n  The Withholding Tax Relief Act will do just that. This measure will \npromote job creation by allowing businesses to keep more of their \ncapital, and it will send a message that Washington understands that \npromoting the private sector is the key to reviving our economy, not \nanother government bailout.\n  Only 8 days ago, we voted in favor of the three pending free-trade \nagreements, votes that garnered broad bipartisan support, which we all \nagreed will stimulate the economy and grow jobs in this country. During \nmy remarks as part of that debate on those agreements, I noted that we \nwere setting a precedent I hoped would be able to continue in the \ncoming weeks. I noted that instead of considering divisive and \ncontroversial measures, such as the President's new surtax on small \nbusinesses and job creators, we should be considering legislation that \nhelps our economy and can actually become law because it has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  That was true of implementing legislation for the three free-trade \nagreements that the President will sign into law tomorrow, and it is \ntrue in the Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2011.\n  Let's take this opportunity to demonstrate that when we are willing \nto work together, we can enact legislation that will help spur economic \nactivity and create jobs in the private sector economy. We can do this \nwithout new taxes and without new burdensome regulations. We can \naccomplish this simply by getting the government out of the way of \nAmerican entrepreneurs. Let's help Americans in a free and open society \ndo what they do best: take risks, create business opportunities, and \ngrow our economy.\n  We don't need yet another stimulus bill, heavy with government \nspending; we need a little common sense. Passing the Withholding Tax \nRelief Act is a good place to start.\n  When these votes come up later today, I hope my colleagues on both \nsides will recognize the importance of stimulating and spurring \neconomic activity in the private sector, giving our entrepreneurs in \nthis country incentives to create jobs by keeping the tax and \nregulatory burdens low and move away from this notion and idea that the \nway to get the economy growing again is to spend more government money, \ncome up with yet another stimulus plan, which we know doesn't work. We \nhave seen that picture before. We know many of these same types of \nideas were tried and they have failed.\n  Unemployment today is still over 9 percent. When the first stimulus \nbill was passed, the contention at the time was this would keep \nunemployment under 8 percent. Well, the opposite has happened. More \npeople are unemployed since the stimulus bill passed. There are over \n1.5 million more unemployed Americans than when it passed. We should \nrecognize that those are not the correct for our economy. It is to get \nour entrepreneurs, our small businesses back out there investing their \ncapital, buying new equipment, and creating jobs for American workers.\n  The way to do that is to make it less costly, cheaper, and easier for \nthem to create jobs rather than harder. What has been happening in \nWashington lately is making it harder, not easier, because of the \nuncertainty created by tax policy and regulatory policy. Putting in \nplace another withholding tax, having that to plan for, knowing that \nwill take effect come 2013, and now layered on top of those other \nthings--you have the new health care mandates, and many small \nbusinesses are saying they are not going to hire people until they know \nwith greater certainty what the impact of the health care reform bill \nwill be on them and their employees.\n  This is a clear winner, something that enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport. The way it is paid for enjoys broad bipartisan support. I hope \nwe will pass it and defeat what is the ill-conceived approach proposed \nby the majority leader, which is to try to put a tax on job creators, \nthe people who are out there and have the capital to put people back to \nwork, and to invest in more government spending, more government \nprograms, all of which have proven that they don't work. Let's do what \nworks and use a little common sense and get the American people working \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the three fiscal \nyear 2012 appropriations bills, I want to take a moment to congratulate \nthe managers of these individual measures, and to urge my colleagues to \ncontinue in the current bipartisan spirit as we seek to move additional \nbills in the coming weeks. Building on the progress we have made this \nweek would make it\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\nless likely that we will be forced to resort to an omnibus or year-long \ncontinuing resolution down the road.\n  The bills we are considering are both bipartisan and fiscally \nresponsible. Senators Kohl and Blunt worked together to produce an \nAgriculture bill that is $2.2 billion below the President's request and \n$141 million below the fiscal year 2011 enacted level. Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Hutchison have managed a Commerce-Justice-Science bill that \nis $5 billion below the President's request and $631 million below the \nfiscal year 2012 enacted level. Senator Murray and Senator Collins have \ncrafted a Transportation, Housing bill that is $677 million below the \nPresident's request and $117 million below last year's level.\n  As noted by the leadership of the respective subcommittees, all three \nof these measures were approved by the full committee with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. These measures reflect the austere fiscal \nenvironment we face. They are consistent with the framework established \nby the Budget Control Act, which establishes a discretionary spending \nlevel that is $7 billion below last year's level.\n  All of these bills present difficult choices. These bills are focused \non a number of basic priorities: job creation, public safety, \nnutrition, housing, and transportation. Yet, despite the importance of \nthese initiatives to the lives of every American, many worthy programs \nwere either reduced or eliminated to meet our austere limits.\n  Some have argued that our national debt demands even further cuts in \nthese vital areas. However, every credible nonpartisan analysis has \nconcluded that any real solution to our fiscal problems lies with \nreforming mandatory programs and raising additional revenues, not \ncutting investments in roads, bridges, and public safety any further. \nBut to date, the entire focus on deficit reduction has been on \ndiscretionary spending. Those who advocate further cuts must look \nelsewhere, even if it is more politically painful to do so. It is my \nfirm belief that another round of ill-advised cuts to discretionary \nspending will quite simply put our Nation's security and economic \nfuture at risk.\n  In addition to the managers of these three bills, I thank the leaders \non both sides of the aisle for their support in bringing these measures \nto the floor this week. As the House has not acted on the Commerce-\nJustice-Science or Transportation appropriations bills, the package we \nconsider today is a creative bipartisan solution that enables all \nSenators an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  As always, the closer we get to regular order, the better our final \nlegislative product will be. It is important that the Senate have an \nopportunity to debate these three measures and to focus on the matters \nthat are germane to the bill.\n  When we complete action on this bill, there will be seven outstanding \ncommittee-reported Senate appropriations bills. It is my hope and my \nintention to move forward with additional appropriations measures when \nthe Senate returns in November and demonstrate to the American people \nthat Congress is able to complete its work in a responsible manner.\n\n  Once again, I commend the chairmen and the ranking members and their \nstaffs for their fine work on this measure.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to take a minute to say I am \npleased that one of my amendments to eliminate the categorical \neligibility for food stamps concept has been called up.\n  I also look forward to calling up an amendment that's been referred \nto as the Medco amendment, which has real strong bipartisan support. It \nwas an amendment that many people felt they needed to vote against when \nthe patent bill came forward because they believed the bill would then \nbe required to go back to the House. So, it failed on a 51-to-47 vote.\n  But I am confident that there is an overwhelming number who would \nprefer to vote for this amendment now, if we can get it accepted. It \nwould not take a long time for us to consider it. I think it's an issue \nour members are familiar with. So I want to share my thoughts that it \nis very important to me, and I think perhaps it might have a majority \nvote on both sides of the aisle.\n  Basically, my amendment would say we want to prohibit the PTO from \nusing any funds to implement a provision of the patent reform bill that \nwould have the effect of deciding an ongoing civil litigation that is \non appeal now to the court of appeals. The merits of the matter are \nbeing argued. I believe it is the kind of matter that clearly should be \nallowed to stand in the courts. But this law firm that apparently \nfailed to follow the statute of limitations--and the courts ruled in \ntheir favor--is seeking to have the Congress overrule or shortcut the \nappellate process in this matter.\n  I wanted to say I look forward to debating the question of \ncategorical eligibility for food stamps, where if you are approved for \na number of other Federal programs, you don't have to make a formal \napplication to qualify for food stamps. CBO has indicated that it could \nsave as much as $10 billion over 10 years if that hole in the program \nis closed.\n  And I would note that food stamps are the fastest growing major item \nin the budget by far. There is nothing close to it. It has doubled in \nthe last 3 years. It has gone from $20 billion to $80 billion in the \nlast 4 years, a 400-percent increase. One in seven people are now \nreceiving food stamps. Originally, it was 1 in 50 when the program \nstarted. Nobody wants to deny people food, but the program has not been \nlooked at. We have not looked under the hood. I believe in this one \nreform that says if you want to get thousands of dollars in food \nbenefits from the government, you ought to at least fill out a form and \nqualify according to the standards the Food and Nutrition Service sets. \nThat is basically all it would do. Some of the programs, if you qualify \nfor them, are now automatically accepting food stamp recipients. They \nhave a lower qualification than food stamps do. For example, one person \nwon the lottery and that was counted as an asset to the person rather \nthan income to the person. He called and said: Do I still get food \nstamps, since I won a $2 million lottery? They said: Yes, the money you \nreceived is an asset, and we don't count assets under this other \nmechanism. But they should count assets under the Food Stamp Program.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Delaware, who is \nmoving the bill and allowing me to share these thoughts. I do hope we \ncan get agreement and move forward on the Medco amendment, along with \nthe categorical food stamp amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would say to my colleague from Alabama, I am the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Excuse me.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But Delaware is next door, and we share the Chesapeake \nBay and a whole lot of chicken farms, so that is OK.\n  I want to advise the Senator that his amendment 810 is pending, and I \nbelieve the leadership is negotiating on which group of amendments will \nbe voted on in the next phase, which we hope we will be able to \nannounce shortly.\n  The amendment which the Senator has on the Patent Office, is not a \npending amendment. Again, that would be subject to leadership on both \nsides of the aisle determining what would be called up. So I suggest he \nstay in touch with the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, and his \nfloor staff, as they are talking with Senator Reid. But the Senator's \namendment 810 is pending and I know he debated it yesterday and I know \nour colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee, commented on that.\n  I would just say to the Senator, because I believe him to be a \ncompassionate conservative--a phrase we once used a decade ago--maybe \nnot filing papers is one thing, but we do have 9 percent unemployment. \nGosh, in my State, we are seeing people come to food banks who used to \ndonate to the food banks. We are seeing an increase of people who have \nbeen laid off who either have no job or have taken now\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\npart-time jobs. So one of the reasons the food stamp population is \nincreasing is because of unemployment. Unemployment is increasing.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator on a bipartisan jobs bill, \nbut we also want the Senator to be able to speak to his amendment; and, \nhopefully, because it is pending, it will be included in the voting.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. She is correct. She has allowed the \nfood stamp amendment to be pending, and I am talking with staff on this \nside and the Senator from Maryland is not objecting at this point to \nthat amendment. So I hope that will happen.\n  I just wished to emphasize that there are a number of Members who \nfeel very strongly that this is a matter we have an opportunity now to \nfix; that is, we shouldn't be moving forward to intervene in an ongoing \nlawsuit. Under our rules, there is a way to get a special relief act, \nif somehow there is a miscarriage of justice that occurs in our \nAmerican system--an individual special relief act. But it has certain \nprocedures, and one of the key prerequisites of that is that your \nlitigation must be exhausted. Then, if the courts can't give you \nrelief, we might consider it under certain procedures.\n  So this litigation is ongoing, and that is why I am hopeful we can \nfix it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Are we still talking about food stamps?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, I am talking----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I kind of got lost here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, the Medco amendment. It was voted on in the House \ntwice, and on the second vote the amendment passed by a narrow margin. \nOur Members did not want to amend the House bill, even though many \nopposed that particular amendment. So this would give us an opportunity \nto vote on it, and it would be germane.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I remember that very well. I remember it was enormously \ncontroversial. It was significantly confusing, and there was much to be \nsaid on both sides. I believe somebody missed a filing deadline by 24 \nhours.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is basically correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. You were the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, so you \nare well versed on the patent issues. Why don't we turn it over to the \nleadership and see how it turns out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Fair enough. I just wanted, for the record, to indicate \nI was urging our leadership to make this matter pending.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We will turn it over to that higher power.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, at some point during consideration of \nthe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies \nappropriations bill, I expect there may be a motion to recommit the \nbill to the Appropriations Committee. Therefore, I want to take this \nopportunity, as we are attempting to work out amendments and proceed to \nsome additional votes, to give my colleagues some basic facts about our \nbill.\n  First of all, our appropriations bill took one of the largest \npercentage cuts to spending of any of the appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 2011. It is important to understand that our bill is nearly \n$13 billion below fiscal year 2010 enacted levels. This funding level \nrepresents a reduction of nearly one-fifth in just 2 years. When \ndisaster funding is not included, our bill total is $55 billion. That \nis $117 million below fiscal year 2011.\n  So I want to point out that this bill is a fiscally responsible bill. \nIt is a bill that required a lot of tough choices. It is a bill that \ndoes not fund some programs to the level I would have liked to have \nseen them funded, but it recognizes the reality of a $14.9 trillion \nFederal debt that is growing every day. Therefore, we have had to make \ntough choices. We cannot have the luxury of fully funding every \nprogram, even those programs that are very beneficial.\n  In the other cases, we put tough new restrictions on programs where \nwe felt the taxpayers have not been getting their money's worth, and \nthat includes some programs run by public housing authorities and the \nHOME Program, about which the Washington Post did an expose'. So we \nhave worked carefully and closely with the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to make sure there are new \nanti-fraud provisions and restrictions.\n  It is also important to understand that the $117 million difference \nfrom fiscal year 2011 does not take into account the $3.9 billion in \none-time rescissions taken in fiscal year 2011 that were not available \nin fiscal year 2012. So when you compare the appropriations for \nprograms spending, not including the offsets, our bill's appropriations \nare actually $1.1 billion below the fiscal year 2011 enacted levels.\n  I have just given a great deal of different numbers, but my point is \nthe same; that is, this is a fiscally responsible bill, it is a \nconstrained bill. Our subcommittee's allocation was cut quite severely; \nthus, it was a real challenge, but it is a challenge we have to meet in \nthese very difficult budget times. We don't have the luxury of fully \nfunding even very worthwhile programs.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with my colleague, Senator \nMurray, to produce a bipartisan bill, and that is what we have done. \nBut, again, our Transportation-HUD bill took one of the largest \npercentage cuts in spending of any of the appropriations bills that \nwill be brought before this body.\n  Finally, I am very pleased we are bringing the appropriations bills \nto the Senate floor. None of us, in my opinion, want to see the \nproblems we have had in the past couple of years where we have ended up \nat the end of the calendar year with a huge omnibus bill stacked on our \ndesks, no one completely sure of every provision that is in the bill. \nThat is a terrible way to legislate. It is much more responsible to \nbring the appropriations bills before the full Senate after they have \nhad their careful consideration by the Appropriations Committee. We \nhave extensive hearings and we have markups at both the subcommittee \nand the full committee level, but then the full Senate should have a \nchance to work its will on these bills.\n  I am pleased we have been considering these bills all week. We have \nhad several amendments offered by Members on both side of the aisle, \nand we have had constructive debate. As my colleague from Maryland has \npointed out, it has been a respectful, civil debate, and that is what \nthe people of this country deserve.\n  I hope this is going to set a precedent where we will bring every \nsingle one of the appropriations bills before this body so that Members \ncan work their will. It is the right way to legislate, and it avoids \nthe spectacle of our having a multiple thousands of pages omnibus bill, \nwhich does not serve the people of this country well.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded, and I ask to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nTeachers and First Responders Back to Work Act.\n  Rarely is our economy discussed without mention of the more than 14 \nmillion Americans who are currently out of work and searching for jobs, \nbut this statistic is really only the beginning of the story.\n  Two years after the recession officially ended or at least was at a \nplace of stability, unemployment remains stubbornly high at 9.1 \npercent. When you factor those who are working part time because they \ncan't find a full-time job and those who have stopped working \naltogether, that number\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nquickly climbs. In my home State, it is 2 points better, at 6.9 \npercent, but there are still too many people out of work.\n\n  It is my firm belief that the role of Congress is to promote the \ninterests of the American people, and the American people have said \nloud and clear that we need to focus on initiatives that are about \njobs, private sector jobs, jobs that pay people so they can support \ntheir families, jobs that strengthen our economy.\n  At a time when enormous budget shortfalls plague our States, many \nStates have been forced to make tough choices, including cutting the \njobs of those individuals on our front lines, law enforcement and \neducators.\n  In Minnesota, we have seen more than our fair share of crises in \nrecent years, but we have also seen the value of effective emergency \nresponse. We all witnessed the critical work of public safety personnel \nduring the minutes and hours following the 2007 bridge collapse in \nMinneapolis. That was just a few blocks from my house. During that \nemergency, the Minnesota first responders reacted swiftly and \neffectively, and they were aided by a strong local public safety \nnetwork. What we saw that day was a true show of American heroism, a \nwindow into the courage, skill, and selflessness first responders \npractice day in and day out. They did not run away from this major \nbridge collapse--an eight-lane highway in the middle of the Mississippi \nRiver--they ran toward it. They dove in and out of that water, rescuing \npeople from dozens of cars in that water. Thanks to their selfless \nefforts, while we lost too many lives, literally hundreds were saved \nbecause of that work. These men and women dedicate their lives to \nprotecting our families, supporting our children, and serving the \npublic. They perform critical jobs in our communities, jobs we cannot \nafford to lose.\n  I saw it again in Wadena, MN, a smaller town than Minneapolis, up in \nnorthern Minnesota. They had a tornado there that literally flattened a \nmile of their town. I was standing there in complete wreckage, a big \nhigh school where the bleachers were a block away, where there was \nnothing left of a public swimming pool. But not one person died in that \ntown even though this was in a completely residential neighborhood. Do \nyou know why? They got their siren out early. The teenage lifeguard at \nthat pool, which had a dozen kids, got their parents there within 10 or \n15 minutes, and she got the remaining kids in the basement across the \nstreet.\n  When I visited that town a few days later, I hugged a man whose \nentire agricultural business had been flattened. He saved his employees \nin a safe. He had always joked that since he didn't have a basement, \nthey could go in the safe. That is what I remember.\n  What I remember most is the mayor and the sheriff and how people--\ndespite being blocked from their houses, having their houses completely \nflattened, losing everything they owned in the world, all they could do \nwas hug those public officials and cry because they knew the planning \nthey had put in place and the acts of the sheriff and the police and \nthe emergency system had saved their lives. That is first responders at \ntheir best. That is public servants at their best.\n  That is why we need to pass the Teachers and First Responders Back to \nWork Act, which would support the hiring, rehiring, and retention of \ncareer law enforcement officers and first responders. I know State and \nlocal budget cuts have forced thousands of police officers and \nfirefighters off the beat. This bill provides $5 billion to keep police \nand firefighters on the job by creating or saving thousands of first \nresponder jobs across the Nation through competitive grants to State \nand local governments.\n  The Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act also saves or \ncreates jobs through critical investments in education. A good \neducation should be the basic right of every child. I know you know \nthat in Maryland, Mr. President, as I know it in Minnesota. It is one \nof the very best investments we can make in our future as a nation.\n  My mom taught second grade until she was 70 years old. She had 30 \nsecond graders in her public school class. We lost her last summer, but \nwhat I will never forget is all of those students, who are now grown \nup, who came to the visitation, came to the funeral, and told me all \nthose stories.\n  I always knew my mom had dressed up as a monarch butterfly when they \nhad the unit on metamorphosis. She would wear a butterfly outfit, and \nshe would hold a sign that said ``To Mexico or bust.'' What I did not \nknow was that she would go to that local grocery store, Cub Foods, and \nshop. When I first heard that story, I thought that was pretty funny \nand something that she would do. But what I finally realized was why \nshe went to that store. Because I met the parents of this young man who \nhad taken her class in the second grade. He had some pretty difficult \ndisabilities. He went on and graduated from high school, and his job \nwas to bag groceries at that store. She would go back every year to see \nthat kid in her butterfly outfit so that he would remember that class. \nThat is a public servant. That is what teaching is all about. It is \nsomething bigger than yourself.\n  Given the enormous budget shortfalls across the Nation, States and \nlocal school districts have been forced to cut back on education \nprograms and services, often laying off needed teachers and other \ncritical staff or raising additional revenue to cover the shortfall. As \na result, two-thirds of States were forced to slash funding for K-12 \neducation programs and services and are now providing less per-student \nfunding than they did in 2008, and 17 States have slashed funding by at \nleast 10 percent since 2008. In my State alone, since 2008 we have lost \n1,200 education jobs.\n  Cuts such as these hurt our children, but they hurt our communities \ntoo. We have to compete on an international stage. We are going up \nagainst countries that are actually upping their education funding, \ncountries that are making sure their kids are learning incredibly \ndifficult concepts in science and math and technology. We are not going \nto be able to accomplish that if they don't have schools they can learn \nin that work, if they don't have teachers with the expertise who can \nteach them these difficult ideas. That is why we need to pass the \nTeachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, which would offset \nprojected layoffs, providing for nearly 400,000 education jobs and \noffering a much needed jolt to State economies.\n  It would also provide funding to support State and local efforts to \nretain, hire, and rehire early childhood, elementary, and secondary \nschool teachers. It is a time when we recognize that educating our \nchildren is a shared responsibility.\n  Americans overwhelmingly support funding for teacher and first \nresponder jobs. One poll showed that 75 percent of Americans support \nproviding funds to hire police officers, teachers, and fire fighters.\n  But passing this bill is not right to do just because it is popular. \nIt is right to do because it will have a positive impact on our \nchildren. As we know, we pay for this bill, and we pay for this bill in \na way that shares the responsibility with those who can afford it the \nmost.\n  This bill will move our economy forward without adding to the Federal \ndeficit. With our economy struggling and 14 million Americans still out \nof work, the people in my State want Congress to put the politics aside \nand come together to move our economy forward and ensure that our \ncommunities stay strong and that our children remain safe. That is what \nthey want.\n  It is time to step up and show some leadership. I believe we need to \nbring this debt down. I am one who believes we need to bring it down by \n$4 trillion in 10 years, and I believe there is a way to do it with a \nbalanced approach that doesn't do it on the backs of these kids in \nschool and that doesn't do it on the backs of our people who need \nprotective services, who need our police, who need our firefighters. \nWhat would we have done when that 35W bridge collapsed if there had not \nbeen firefighters and police officers there ready to dive in and save \npeople? What would we have done if there had not been emergency workers \nready to take them in after they were injured? What would we have done \nin Medina if we did not have a proper public siren system in place? \nHundreds of people would have been killed. What would we have done for \nthat kid I talked about with disabilities if my mom had not been his \nteacher and cared about him and went back to visit him again and again?\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\n  These are people who devote their lives to public service, and we \nhave to show America that Washington is not broken; that, instead, we \nare willing to put the politics aside, we are willing to do something \nsmart on the debt and bring it down to the place where we need to bring \nit, but we are going to do it with a balanced approach.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation. It is \nthe decent and right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 859\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 859, \nwhich is a germane amendment to the underlying bill. It is one I \nintroduced that would restore fairness, encourage competition, and \nprevent many States around the country from seeing cost increases in \nthe price of guardrails. This amendment specifically addresses the \nTransportation bill we are talking about and addresses one of the new \nprovisions in the bill this year that is a mandate that I think is not \nappropriate.\n  A lot of States have infrastructure challenges right now, and the \nlast thing we should be doing here in the Congress is making it more \ndifficult for States to pay for their infrastructure with the limited \ntransportation dollars they have. With the fiscal crisis we have, we \nhave to make sure now more than ever that States have the flexibility \nto meet the requirements from the Federal Government.\n  At a time when unemployment is over 9 percent and we have over 14 \nmillion Americans out of work, we should be doing everything we can to \nprotect jobs. This amendment would hurt jobs, and this amendment I am \noffering would give States more flexibility to help keep some jobs.\n  There are countless miles of guardrails in our country, and many of \nthose are manufactured in my home State of Ohio. Those manufacturers \ngalvanize the guardrails to prevent corrosion, and they have two \noptions on the process they use to galvanize the metal as well as two \noptions with regard to the thickness of the zinc they use in the \ngalvanization process.\n  In terms of the galvanization process, the first method is called \ncontinuous galvanization, where a company treats the flat steel with \nzinc and then fabricates the guardrail afterward. The second method is \ncalled batch galvanization, where the company dips the final product in \na zinc bath after they have completed the fabrication.\n  In addition, there are two types of zinc thickness options for the \nguardrail. Type 1 requires a thinner coat of zinc, and type 2 requires \na thicker coat of zinc, which increases the life of the guardrail. A \nlot of States around the country, including Ohio, require type 2, which \nis the thicker kind of zinc, for all of their guardrails, and that is \ndue to the harsher conditions that cause metal to erode more quickly. \nHowever, Ohio is one of those States that, although they require type \n2, allow for continuous galvanization or the batch galvanization \nprocess--either one.\n  It was a great surprise to me to read the legislation before us. The \nunderlying bill says the States are prohibited from using any kind of \nguardrail unless it is type 2, plus it is produced through this batch \ngalvanization process. So it is a mandate. Again, it has never been in \nthis legislation before. It says it has to be type 2, meaning the \nthicker type zinc, and has to be applied using a particular process, so \nit is micromanaging the process.\n  The life of a guardrail, as you can imagine, is entirely dependent on \nthe thickness of the zinc but also on the environment into which it is \nplaced.\n  There are 15 States that still approve type 1. These States have less \nextreme environments where corrosion occurs more slowly, and the extra \nthickness of zinc is not needed. Without this amendment, they would be \nforced to buy a more expensive product that they don't want and don't \nneed. By the way, those States are Mississippi, Virginia, Delaware, \nOklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, New Jersey, Colorado, Utah, \nTexas, California, Montana, and Wyoming.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has weighed in on this issue. \nThey have said:\n\n       Requiring all galvanized steel to meet type 2 could add \n     unnecessary expense for many States where the added thickness \n     of galvanization is not needed. We know that type 1 \n     galvanizing will protect guardrail components in many \n     locations for the typical 20-year life design. The extra cost \n     of type 2 galvanizing may be unwarranted.\n\n  That is the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  The Ohio Department of Transportation has said that while they only \nuse type 2 materials, ``ODOT does not have a preference as to how \ngalvanizing occurs.'' They do not have a preference for a particular \nspecies of guardrail, as both have been found to have very similar \nproperties to one another. They would prefer that their flexibility to \nuse both kinds remains intact. That is the Ohio Department of \nTransportation. They don't want to be told they can't use the process \nmany of them use now, which is continuous galvanization.\n  The primary manufacturer of continuous galvanization guardrails is \nGregory Industries, located in Canton, OH. It was founded in 1896. It \nis a privately owned company currently run by the fourth and fifth \ngenerations of the Gregory family. These guardrails make up about 75 \npercent of the Gregorys' business, and about 99 percent of the \nguardrails they make are made through this continuous galvanization \nprocess that would be prohibited under the legislation. In addition, \nabout 30 percent of their sales come from type 1 guardrails, which \nwould be prohibited under the legislation. So the language as it stands \nwould be devastating for this one company and put 125 jobs in their \nCanton, OH, facility at risk.\n  By the way, the guardrails they produce are approved by the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials in a document \ncalled the M-180 that dictates what is acceptable and what is not.\n  The type of products the current language would prohibit, by the way, \nhave been in use in all 50 States in the country, and the continuous \nprocess for galvanizing guardrails that would be prohibited has been \naround for 50 years.\n  The bottom line is that we should not give this Ohio company or any \ncompany an advantage. We should allow competition to determine this and \nlet the States determine it. Why come up with a new mandate that \nmicromanages this process at a time when we are all trying to save \ndollars and use them more efficiently? So this amendment seeks to \nstrike the language that would limit the flexibility of States and \nplace additional costs in cases where it does make sense to use type 1 \nor it does make sense to use this continuous galvanization.\n\n  I urge the Senate take a commonsense approach, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. I know my colleague may have \nsome thoughts on this, but, in summary, I would ask through this \namendment to strike the language that would limit the flexibilities of \nStates and encourage support of amendment No. 859.\n  Mr. KOHL. I object to amendment No. 859 presented by my colleague \nfrom Ohio, the guardrail amendment. However, I wish to inform him that \nwe are trying to work out our differences so we can move forward. For \nthe moment I object to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that it is not currently \npending.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up my amendment No. 859.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KOHL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague for his comments and look forward \nto working with him. Again, it is a simple amendment. It is a jobs \namendment. It is perfectly germane to the bill. It is exactly the type \nof amendment that I think should not be blocked through this process.\n  I thank my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nRepublican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the junior Senator from \nNew Hampshire and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New \nHampshire for the issue she has raised with regard to the proper way to \ntreat enemy combatants. Her amendment, which we have been discussing \noff and on here on the floor today, has prompted predications of doom \nand gloom from our friends on the other side of the aisle, and a lot of \nvery excited rhetoric.\n  To be clear, I would ask my friend from New Hampshire: Is it not true \nthat the amendment she has offered does not apply to everyone--\nabsolutely everyone--who might be generally labeled a terrorist?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank our distinguished Republican leader, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, for that question. That is correct. My amendment \nonly applies to members of al-Qaida and associated forces who are \nengaged in an armed conflict against our troops and coalition forces \nand who are planning or are carrying out an attack against our country \nor our coalition partners. It does not apply to everyone who might be \ntermed a terrorist, and it does not apply to U.S. citizens who are \nmembers of al-Qaida.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend further, has the Congress authorized \nuse of military force against al-Qaida and associated forces?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would answer, yes, it has. My amendment only pertains \nto enemy combatants against whom Congress has declared we are in an \narmed conflict. And because we are in an armed conflict with al-Qaida \nand associated forces, the Congress has authorized the use of military \nforce to combat them, and that is why it is called the authorization \nfor the use of military force.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I cannot recall a time when Congress has declared we \nare in an armed conflict, has authorized the use of military force \nagainst the enemy in that conflict, and yet the executive branch has a \nbias against using the military for interrogation and, if need be, a \ntrial of these enemy forces. Can the Senator from New Hampshire recall \nsuch an occasion?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. No, I cannot.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Two days ago the President's top lawyer at the \nPentagon defended the administration's decision for use of lethal force \nagainst an American citizen who was a member of al-Qaida. In doing so, \nhe noted that using lethal force in such a case is perfectly \nappropriate because that person was an enemy combatant. Specifically, \nhe said: Those who are part of the congressionally declared enemy do \nnot have immunity if they are U.S. citizens.\n  Does it not strike my friend from New Hampshire as inconsistent for \nthe administration to authorize lethal force against a member of al-\nQaida even if he is a U.S. citizen because he is part of an enemy force \nas declared by the Congress but, on the other hand, not to trust the \nmilitary to try by military commission members of the same enemy force \nwho are foreign nationals?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. It certainly strikes me as very inconsistent. It is \nespecially odd given that the military commissions were enacted by \nCongress at the suggestion of our Supreme Court. They were passed on a \nbipartisan basis and were refined by the Obama administration to its \nliking. Yet the administration refuses to fully use them as they were \nintended.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire to \nthis appropriations bill makes clear that in the war on terror we \nremain at war with al-Qaida and associated groups, that these forces \nremain intent on killing Americans, and that in prosecuting this war, a \nhigher priority should be placed on capturing enemy combatants, \ninterrogating them for additional intelligence value and thereby \ntargeting other terrorists. That is the purpose, as I understand it, of \nthe amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. In military custody, \nour national security professionals would have a choice of prosecuting \nenemy combatants in a military commission, detaining them under the law \nof war, and periodically questioning them for intelligence as new \ninformation is developed without them being all lawyered up.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, and yesterday some of our colleagues came to the \nfloor to argue that my amendment would limit the choices available to \nour Commander-in-Chief in prosecuting terrorists.\n  I would ask the Republican leader the following: In January of 2009, \ndid President Obama, when he first came into office, issue Executive \norders ending the Central Intelligence Agency's detention program, \nending the CIA's option for using enhanced interrogation techniques, \nordering the closure of the secure detention facility in Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba, prior to any study being done concerning how to dispose of \nthe population of enemy combatants there--we now know that 27 percent \nof them are back in theater--and suspending military commissions?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, of course, the Senator from New Hampshire is \nentirely correct. President Obama has unilaterally restricted the tools \navailable to him for combating terrorism, including by ordering the \nclosing of Guantanamo Bay prior to having any plan for dealing with the \npopulation of the Yemeni detainees who are almost certain to return to \nthe fight if they are released from Guantanamo Bay.\n  It seems that once the President shut down the ability of the CIA to \ndetain enemy combatants and refused to transfer further detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay, that many of us were waiting for the obvious test case \nto come along in which a terrorist was captured outside Iraq or \nAfghanistan and needed to be interrogated and detained.\n  I know the Senator from New Hampshire is a member of the Armed \nServices Committee. Does she recall the case of Mr. Warsame, the Somali \nterrorist captured at sea?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I do, and the Republican leader is correct that this test \ncase shows that in capturing rather than killing terrorists, we can \ngain valuable intelligence. Instead of sending Warsame to Guantanamo, \nthough, he was held and interrogated at sea for approximately 2 months. \nThen law enforcement officials were brought in to read Warsame his \nrights.\n  I wish to take a minute to address arguments that were made on the \nfloor earlier by Senator Levin from Michigan, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. He claimed that if my amendment were to pass, Mr. \nWarsame would escape justice because we wouldn't be able to prove that \nhe was, in fact, planning an attack against the United States. I wish \nto point out that if that were the case, my amendment would not apply \nbecause my amendment applies to members of al-Qaida or affiliated \ngroups who are also planning or have carried out an attack against the \nUnited States, so he would be able to be held fully accountable in the \ncivilian court system.\n  I wanted to correct that because I think that leaves a misimpression \nthat Mr. Warsame would not be or could not be held accountable under \nour law.\n  The second problem with the analysis of the Senator from Michigan is \nthat it ignores what is going on here. The reason the United States had \nto take the unusual steps of holding Warsame at sea on a Navy ship and \nthen flying him to the United States over the Fourth of July weekend is \nbecause of the administration's refusal to use the top-rate detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that we have there for long-term \nmilitary detention. Because it refuses to use this valuable asset for \nnew captures, the administration has gone to great lengths to treat \nthese enemy combatants who are captured on an ad hoc basis instead of \nplacing them in a long-term detention facility, which places an \nartificial time period on when we can interrogate these individuals and \nhow long they will be available to gather information to protect \nAmericans.\n  As the Republican leader has noted, the President's top lawyer at the \nPentagon observed that members of al-Qaida are enemy combatants and \nthat Congress has passed an authorization for the use of military force \nto treat them as such. We need to do that on a consistent basis and use \nthe military\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\nassets we have. We should not have an ad hoc, haphazard approach to \ntreating enemy combatants. We should not Mirandize enemy combatants who \nare our military captures and then hold them on makeshift prison barges \nas if we were in the 19th century because the administration refuses to \nuse Guantanamo Bay and then import them into the United States so they \ncan be detained in our civilian court system, tried in our civilian \ncourts, with the possibility that they could be released into the \nUnited States if they are acquitted or given a modest sentence, as \nnearly happened with Ahmed Ghailani.\n  Now is the time to keep the pressure on al-Qaida, whether in the \ntribal areas of Pakistan or in Yemen. Our law enforcement officials \nhave done a tremendous job in contributing to the counterterrorism \nfight. But we cannot, for the first time in the history of this \ncountry, take the view of the Attorney General, which is that our \ncivilian court system is the most effective weapon in our conflict with \nal-Qaida, because that is simply not the case.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire on behalf of the leader. She has brought to the floor an \noutstanding amendment that needs to be addressed because this is an \nissue that is certainly on a lot of people's minds, as to why we would \nbe using our judicial system for enemy combatants. She has articulated \nit so well, as the former attorney general of New Hampshire, and we \nappreciate so much that she has brought this amendment. It is going to \nget a lot of support from the American people as well as Members of the \nSenate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked very hard to move through \nthis first tranche of appropriations bills we have. Progress is being \nmade but not nearly enough progress. I am going to move in just a \nminute to the Bryson nomination. But I want everyone within the sound \nof my voice to understand this cannot go on forever. People sometimes \nare unreasonable. We cannot have votes on all these amendments that \nhave been called up. I hope everyone understands there has to be some \ngive-and-take here, and we need to move through this. They need to be \ncooperative with the staffs, because when this matter regarding the \nSecretary of Commerce nomination is finished, we are going to have to \nmake a decision as to whether we can continue working on this \nappropriations bill.\n  This was a noble experiment. I am part of it. I want it to work very \nmuch, but it can't work without the cooperation of all Senators.\n  I say to everyone listening, this is the way it has always been. I \nwas a member of the Appropriations Committee the first day I came to \nthe Senate, and I managed many appropriations bills on the Senate \nfloor. For every one of them, we had more amendments than we had time \nto vote on them. That is where we are today. But the only way we can \nfinish them is to work through these amendments. We hope we can do \nthat; otherwise, we will have a cloture vote either tonight or tomorrow \nto determine whether we want to finish these appropriations bills--all \nextremely important--Commerce-State-Justice, Agriculture, and, of \ncourse, the Transportation bill. It would be good for us to be able to \nget this done.\n  I heard Senator Collins, the Senator from Maine, speak about this a \nlittle earlier today, and she did an extremely good job of explaining \nwhy it is important we do this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6819-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6819-S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF JOHN EDGAR BRYSON TO BE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Under the previous order, I move to executive session to \ncall up Calendar No. 410, the nomination of John Bryson, to be Commerce \nSecretary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Edgar \nBryson, of California, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are 4 hours under the order previously \nentered. We are hoping all this time will not have to be used. I ask \nunanimous consent that 20 minutes remain, equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees, regardless of any time consumed in \nquorum calls throughout the presentations made on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I wish to congratulate my friend, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the Senator \nfrom Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison. They both worked very hard in a fair \nway to move forward on this. It has been good for the Senate. When we \nconfirm this nomination, it will be good for the country.\n  I don't think we will use all this time. I hope we can vote on this \nmatter anywhere between 6:30 and 7:30 tonight, hopefully closer to \n6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of John \nBryson of California, whom President Obama has nominated to be his \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. Bryson's nomination comes at a very critical time for our country \nand for our economy. No one disputes the Secretary of Commerce is an \nimportant part of the President's economic team. That person is now \nmissing in the Commerce Department. Commerce has to do with jobs. There \nis nobody there. That dictates that we have a leader with strong, real-\nworld experience. This position has been vacant since Ambassador Locke \nleft for China in late July. It is stunning to think, with what the \ncountry is going through, we don't have a Cabinet Secretary who can \nattend to manufacturing and other kinds of jobs and job-related efforts \nthat he will do. But because of the insistence of the minority--and I \nhad no objection to this--we were unable to move this nomination until \nthe trade agreements were finished. The trade agreements had to come \nforward and passed, that was done, and then it was OK to proceed to the \nBryson nomination.\n  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee confirmed Mr. \nBryson by a voice vote. I recall no objections at all. Mr. Bryson will \nbe an excellent Secretary of Commerce, and America is entitled to have \na Secretary of Commerce on the job. Mr. Bryson possesses a rare \ncombination of actual real-life business experience and a very broad \nintellect. As an executive, he has proven himself to be a talented \nexecutive and has shown his dedication to public service. He cares \nabout public service. He has had to wait a long time to get this job, \nand he has been in and out of public service.\n  My colleagues should appreciate that Mr. Bryson's confirmation comes \nat an important crossroads for the country and for the Commerce \nDepartment itself. The challenges obviously are very important: high \nunemployment, a slow economic recovery. The Secretary of Commerce plays \na major role in promoting jobs and our economy. But to do that, he has \nto be in place and on the job. If confirmed, as I believe he deserves \nto be, he will have to face these deep challenges and looks forward to \nso doing.\n  But I believe Mr. Bryson's experience provides him with the capacity \nto help restore jobs in manufacturing in America as the Secretary of \nCommerce. I have long fought for a stronger manufacturing sector in \nthis country. Anybody from West Virginia would be crazy to do \notherwise. Manufacturing has been hit hard all over the country during \nthis past decade, losing one-third of its workforce, and the \ngovernment's response has been piecemeal.\n  This needs to change. If the next decade is as bad for manufacturing \njobs as the previous one, we are going to have very little left to work \nwith of the manufacturing sector if we are trying to save it. This has \ngrave national security implications and could cripple our ability to \noutinnovate and outcompete other countries. That is already happening.\n  In the Commerce Committee, we held three hearings on this issue this \nyear; that is manufacturing, and we also included a field hearing, \nwhich happened\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nto be in West Virginia--total coincidence--on exporting products made \nin America.\n  Mr. Bryson knows that if confirmed, I intend to work with him to make \nmanufacturing a high priority in our job-creation agenda.\n  A word on NOAA and NIST. Mr. Bryson will also bring his leadership to \nhelp NOAA innovate its essential services to help all Americans, from \ndaily weather forecasts to fisheries management, and from coastal \nrestoration to supporting marine commerce, and on and on. NOAA's \nproducts and services support economic vitality and affect more than \none-third of America's gross domestic product.\n  Americans in many States across the Nation have suffered record-\nbreaking weather disasters in 2011, and much of the gulf continues to \nrecover from the worst oil spill in our history.\n  Mr. Bryson's business-minded leadership is valuable now more than \never to help NOAA continue to improve its important services and keep \npace with scientific innovation.\n  The Department of Commerce also houses the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST--an extraordinary place. I think we have \nhad a couple of Nobel laureates out of NIST in the last year. NIST is \ncritical to U.S. innovation and economic competitiveness through its \nmeasurement science, standards, and technological development. NIST \nplays a critical role bringing together industry, government, and \nuniversities to advance everything from manufacturing to cybersecurity \nto forensic science standards. Mr. Bryson's own experience in both the \npublic sector and private sector will serve him well as he and his \ndepartment tackle such national challenges.\n  In closing, Mr. Bryson is eminently qualified to be Secretary of \nCommerce and to lead this important Cabinet Department during a time in \nwhich the American people are looking for innovative solutions to \nimprove our economy and create jobs. And we need all the good people we \ncan get.\n  I urge my colleagues to quickly support Mr. Bryson's confirmation so \nhe can begin his important work toward that end.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished friend from the State of \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I strongly support the nomination of John Bryson to serve as \nSecretary of Commerce. I think he is an exceptional choice by the \nPresident, and I am absolutely confident, having served with many \nCommerce Secretaries through the years, that he is going to be one of \nour best. I think he is the right person at this moment in time to be \ntaking the helm at the Department of Commerce. It is a critical, \ndefining moment in many ways for our economy. The challenges are well \nknown by everybody here in the Senate, and the decisions we make or \nfail to make on new energy sources, on infrastructure, technology, \nresearch--all of the items the Senator from West Virginia mentioned--\nall of those are going to play a critical part in defining the United \nStates leadership role in the global economy.\n  The experience of John Bryson in the private sector has won him broad \nsupport in the business community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from former \nSecretaries of Commerce serving both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n                                                 October 20, 2011.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader McConnell and \n     Members of the United States Senate: We are writing as former \n     Commerce Secretaries--who have served both Republican and \n     Democratic Administrations--to urge you to confirm John \n     Bryson as Secretary of Commerce.\n       At a time when the nation is focused on strengthening the \n     economic recovery and job creation, American businesses and \n     workers need a Commerce Secretary working for them.\n       For almost 18 years, as CEO of Edison International, John \n     was a widely respected business leader. He successfully led \n     Edison through crisis; he made tough decisions, and he \n     created jobs. Importantly, John understands the challenges \n     facing U.S. companies and what they need to prosper so that \n     they can create jobs.\n       John has served on the Board of Directors for a number of \n     U.S. companies--including Boeing and Disney--and has provided \n     counsel to many entrepreneurs in their early stage \n     businesses. This is the type of experience we need in \n     President Obama's cabinet.\n       We know what it takes to do this job and its importance to \n     the nation's economy. In these challenging economic times, \n     John Bryson has the experience that will help move our \n     country forward and provide an important perspective in the \n     President's Cabinet.\n       We strongly support him and ask you to support his \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carlos Gutierrez,\n       Former Commerce Secretary, 2005-2009.\n     Norman Mineta,\n       Former Commerce Secretary, 2000-2001.\n     Barbara Hackman Franklin,\n        Former Commerce Secretary, 1992-1993.\n     Donald Evans,\n       Former Commerce Secretary, 2001-2005.\n     Mickey Kantor,\n       Former Commerce Secretary, 1996-1997.\n     Peter Peterson,\n       Former Commerce Secretary, 1972-1973.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I would say to the Presiding Officer, this is a letter \nwritten to Senator Reid and Senator McConnell from Carlos Gutierrez, \nNorman Mineta, Barbara Franklin, Don Evans, Mickey Kantor, Pete \nPeterson, all former Commerce Secretaries, all of whom are strongly \nsupportive of this nomination.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Reid \nfrom the president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            United States Hispanic\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                 October 18, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the United States Hispanic \n     Chamber of Commerce (USHCC), which advocates on behalf of \n     nearly 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses through our \n     network of 200 local chambers throughout the nation, I am \n     writing to register our wholehearted support for President \n     Obama's nomination of John Bryson to serve as our next \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce.\n       As our next Commerce Secretary, Mr. Bryson will bring a \n     wealth of experience from the private sector. As a former \n     CEO, he understands the challenges that American companies, \n     both large and small, are facing in this economy and he will \n     be a strong business advocate in the Cabinet. As the \n     President and CEO of Edison International for 18 years until \n     he retired in 2008, Mr. Bryson led the company through the \n     electricity crisis of 2000-2001, a period which marked \n     California's most turbulent era in the power sector. His \n     stewardship proved that he is a sound business leader, who \n     can make tough decisions. Edison International endured the \n     crisis and remains a strong company today, largely due to his \n     efforts. During these difficult economic times, we need \n     people who have demonstrated their ability to lead during \n     crisis, those who can find viable solutions to our nation's \n     financial challenges.\n       As a former CEO and board member for non-profit \n     organizations, as well as Fortune 100 companies such as \n     Disney and Boeing, Mr. Bryson is aware of the challenges \n     facing our businesses and entrepreneurs. With small business \n     as the backbone of our economy, it is important that the new \n     Secretary intimately understand the challenges and \n     opportunities faced by our community. We are confident that \n     Mr. Bryson's background will enable him to approach this post \n     with our priorities in mind. For his proven record as a \n     business and civic leader, the USHCC urges a swift \n     confirmation of Mr. John Bryson as the next Secretary of \n     Commerce.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Javier Palomarez,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say, very quickly, that John Bryson \nbrings to this role the special qualities of somebody who has served as \nthe chairman and CEO of one of the Nation's largest utility companies \nfor almost 20 years, being the chairman and CEO of Edison \nInternational. He has been a board member for nonprofit organizations \nas well as for major corporations in our country: Boeing, Disney, some \nof the great success stories of our country.\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\n  He has extensive experience working on international issues through \nhis work at Edison International and as chair of the Pacific Council on \nInternational Policy. I am convinced that if he is confirmed as \nSecretary of Commerce today, he is going to focus on increasing \nAmerican exports, and he will be a superb ambassador, helping American \ncompanies that are looking to expand across the globe. This is a person \nwho has already proven his ability to be able to deal with people in \nother countries, with other companies, and I am confident about his \nability to perform this task.\n  His previous experience has exposed him to the importance of \ninnovation and technology at a vital time for the information economy. \nHis Department is now leading the administration in its efforts on \nissues ranging from privacy to spectrum reform. I am confident he is \nthe right person to help make that process work.\n  I also know his work on competitiveness means he will be at the \nforefront of helping to lead our country to, in fact, invest in the \nskills of our workers, the infrastructure of the Nation, and retain and \nbring the brightest people in the world to this task.\n  Finally, I want to close saying, in my conversations with whom I hope \nto be Secretary Bryson, we raised an issue that is of critical \nimportance to us in Massachusetts. Because of Federal regulations \nlimiting fishing in our waters, a lot of our fishermen have been put \nout of business or pushed to the brink, and there is a great \nfrustration that exists between the fishing community in our region and \nthe Federal Government.\n  When I met with John Bryson, he exhibited an understanding of the \nimportance of that issue and a willingness to come to Massachusetts and \nhelp us resolve this current situation. We are, frankly, here waiting \nfor his confirmation, months after those conversations took place, and \nhis talents could have been put to use in so much of the challenge we \nface in this Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in an overwhelming vote of support for \nthis outstanding, capable nominee, who I think is the right person for \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield time to the senior Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank Senator Rockefeller very much.\n  Mr. President, I believe John Bryson is well suited for this \nimportant role, particularly at a time when our economy is fragile and \njob creation is not occurring fast enough.\n  He has a lot of experience. Senator Kerry just pointed this out. He \nhas run a multibillion-dollar company, he has been a strong advocate \nfor business, he is ready to advance a jobs agenda--and all of that \nmakes him a perfect fit for Commerce Secretary.\n  I first got to know John when he served for 18 years as CEO of Edison \nInternational, one of the 200 largest corporations in the United \nStates, with more than 20,000 employees. Edison International is the \nparent company of Southern California Edison, which provides power to \n14 million Californians and nearly 300,000 businesses.\n  As my colleagues may recall, in 2000 and 2001, California was gripped \nby an energy crisis that resulted in rolling blackouts that left \nmillions of Californians in the dark. The period marked the most \nturbulent era ever for the California power sector. Price caps, \nmanipulation, rolling blackouts, deregulation, and Enron became the \nfocus of our attention.\n  During that difficult time, John's company was under siege. I watched \nclosely as he successfully fended off financial disaster, even as other \nCalifornia utilities were swept into bankruptcy. I met and spoke with \nJohn often during that energy crisis and remember well his intelligence \nand pragmatism, as utilities, State officials, and Washington worked \nour way through the crisis.\n  Some say that a crisis serves as the best test of a person's \ncharacter. If that is so, John Bryson is a man of exceptional \ncharacter. In my observation, he worked hard to hear from the people of \nCalifornia, his shareholders, and the many businesses that relied on a \nstable power grid. After emerging from the crisis, from 2003 to 2007, \nJohn turned Edison around completely. The firm was No. 1 among \ninvestor-owned utility companies for returning value to its \nshareholders. I believe he will carry this same thoughtful, sensible \nleadership style with him to the Commerce Department.\n  In addition to his time at Edison, he has served as director, \nchairman, or adviser for a wide array of companies, schools, and \nnonprofit organizations, including many institutions with deep roots in \nmy home State of California, such as the Walt Disney Company, \nBrightSource Energy, Boeing, and the asset manager KKR; the California \nBusiness Roundtable, the Public Policy Institute of California, and the \nUniversity of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine; the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, Stanford University, the California \nInstitute of Technology, and the California Endowment.\n  I am also proud to note that John and I share the same alma mater--\nStanford--where John earned his undergraduate degree. Later he attended \nYale Law School before returning to California.\n  John Bryson's experience paints a picture of a leader who focuses on \nthe practical and the achievable. I believe, if confirmed, he will \nsupport measures that meet those criteria.\n  At this time in our economic history, our No. 1 priority as a \ngovernment must be to grow the economy and get people back to work. I \nknow my Senate colleagues agree. In my view, John Bryson's combination \nof pragmatism, experience in the boardroom, and understanding of the \npublic sector will make him an outstanding Commerce Secretary. I expect \nhe will be a powerful voice inside the administration and a partner \nwith the business community to grow our economy and open international \nmarkets for American manufacturers.\n  I make these remarks on behalf of my colleague Senator Boxer as well. \nWe have a California candidate for Secretary of Commerce. We are the \nlargest State in the Union. We have 12.1 percent. We need job \ngeneration. So I trust that John Bryson is going to provide this, and \nprovide it as expeditiously as is humanly possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I listened to the statements made by my \ncolleagues, and I have come to a different conclusion. I think this \nnominee is actually the wrong person at the worst time. At a time when \nthe unemployment rate is 9.1 percent, when 14 million Americans are \nlooking for work, I would think the President would want to respond \nappropriately and nominate someone to lead the Commerce Department \nwhose record was consistent with the mission outlined for the Commerce \nDepartment. That mission is to promote job creation, to promote \neconomic growth, to promote sustainable development, and improve \nstandards of living for all Americans. So I would think the President \nwould want to nominate someone who has a record of robust job creation.\n  Instead, the President has nominated someone whose political advocacy \nis, in my opinion, detached from the financial hardships facing tens of \nmillions of Americans today.\n  Most Americans recognize that cap and trade--or, as I call it, cap \nand tax--is job killing. It is a job-killing energy tax. Yet this \nnominee has repeatedly advocated for cap-and-trade legislation. He even \ncalled the Waxman-Markey legislation a moderate but acceptable bill. \nThere are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support that \nlegislation. I do not. I view it as a tax. The nominee even went so far \nas to say the legislation was good precisely because it was a good way \nto hide--to hide--a carbon tax. But is that the role of the Secretary \nof Commerce: to hide taxes on American businesses, on American \nfamilies, to make American businesses less competitive, to make it more \nexpensive for them to hire new workers?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I want to find ways to make it easier and cheaper for \nthe private sector to create jobs, not for ways to hide taxes and make \nit more expensive and harder for the private sector to create jobs.\n  Finally, I wish to point out what happened during the confirmation \nhearing\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\nbefore the Senate Commerce Committee. The chairman of the committee, \nwho is here on the floor, questioned Mr. Bryson about coal. Coal is \nimportant to the chairman's State, and it is very important in my \nState, a big part of our economy. He asked for straight, direct \nanswers, which the chairman did not receive, to the point that he \nactually invited the nominee to visit with him privately in his office \nto discuss the issue.\n  So I come here today to say, we need a Commerce Secretary who is \ncommitted to making American businesses more innovative at home and \nmore competitive abroad--more innovative at home, more competitive \nabroad. We need someone who will address the problems of high \nunemployment, slow economic growth, and rising consumer costs \naggressively and dispassionately. In my opinion, John Bryson is not \nthat person. Therefore, I will not support nor will I vote for his \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, very shortly, we will vote on \nPresident Obama's nominee to be the Secretary of the Department of \nCommerce, Mr. John Bryson. This is the most senior position in the \nDepartment, which is tasked with promoting business, creating jobs, and \nspurring economic growth. While this has always been important, it is \nvery appropriate now, with the unemployment rate at 9.1 percent.\n  The administration has talked about job creation and the need for \nregulatory reform. But respectfully, I have not seen regulatory reform \nyet a priority on the President's agenda. You might not find a pricetag \nfor regulation, but there is no question that businesses know when they \nare overregulated. It stifles their ability to create jobs. This year \nalone regulations are projected to cost U.S. taxpayers $2.8 trillion, \nand new regulations imposed by the administration in 2011 would cost \nover $60 billion. So during the confirmation process, when Mr. Bryson \nwas before our committee, I asked him about his view on overregulation. \nHe stated that he would be a voice in the administration for \nsimplifying regulations and eliminating those where the cost of \nregulation exceed the benefits.\n  I believe his business background qualifies him to address that \nissue. It would give him the experience to be helpful in bringing back \nthe regulations that are stifling the growth of business and therefore \nthe job creation in our country.\n  I also appreciated that Mr. Bryson said in the confirmation hearing \nthat the National Labor Relations Board was wrong in trying to keep \nBoeing from choosing where it would manufacture its products. On the \ncorporate tax rate, the United States currently has the second highest \ncorporate tax rate in the world, behind Japan, which has said it will \nlower its rate, ultimately leaving the United States with the dubious \ndistinction of having the highest corporate tax rate in the world. \nLowering the U.S. corporate tax rate should be a substantial part of \nany tax reform, and although that tax policy is beyond the Commerce \nSecretary's responsibility, I did ask Mr. Bryson whether he believed \nour corporate tax rate was too high and would he be a voice for \nlowering it. He said he would. I thought that was a very important \nstatement for him to make, and important for the Secretary of Commerce \nto commit to doing.\n  We have now passed the free-trade agreements that held up \nconsideration of his nomination. If confirmed, I expect Mr. Bryson to \ntake advantage of the agreements and work to assist our businesses with \nthe efforts to reach out and expand new markets with these new free-\ntrade agreements. Mr. Bryson made statements before the Commerce \nCommittee supporting cap-and-trade legislation because he felt that the \nelectric utility industry--he was the chairman of a major corporation \nin that industry--needed regulatory certainty. That was his reason for \ncoming out for cap and trade. I disagreed with him on that. I agree \nwith many of my colleagues that that is not the right approach for \nAmerica. We should not have cap and trade, as some have called it, cap \nand tax. But Mr. Bryson again said that he had no interest in pursuing \nthat kind of legislation if he is confirmed as Secretary of Commerce.\n  I would point out that Mr. Bryson has the support of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. They will be major constituents he will \nrepresent in trying to build business for our country. He is also \nsupported by six former Secretaries of Commerce, including Secretaries \nthat served in the administrations of George W. Bush, George H. W. \nBush, and Richard Nixon.\n  In summary, I believe the President should be given deference in \nselecting the members of his Cabinet unless there are serious issues \nagainst the nominee. I have voted against a few of the nominees of some \nof the Presidents while I have been in the Senate, but I do it rarely \nand very carefully, because I think that elections have consequences. I \nbelieve the President has the right to make his decisions.\n  I do not believe there are issues that rise to that level in the case \nof John Bryson. He does have a business background. He is well regarded \nby many colleagues who have called me on his behalf, who have been with \nhim in the business world. I do not see any issue that would cause me \nnot to vote for his nomination. I will support his nomination. I will \nwork alongside him to be a voice for job creation in our country. I \nhope he is confirmed. I think he will be confirmed. I would hope he \nwould then work with other Members of Congress who want to help him be \nan effective voice for business and investment in America and create \nthe jobs that will get this unemployment rate back down and get people \nback to work.\n  I do not have people on my side yet who are going to speak, but there \nare two others who wish to speak. I will put us in a quorum call until \nthey get to the floor and then that will probably allow us to yield \nback. I will ask my colleagues, any who are listening, if they wish to \nspeak on behalf of or against Mr. Bryson to please come to the floor \nnow so we might be able to know that everyone has been satisfied and we \nwill be able to take this to a vote. I do think Mr. Bryson has waited \nvery patiently for a very long time to have this come to a conclusion. \nI hope we can do that on as quick a basis as we can, giving everybody \nthe ability to talk if they so choose.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee for their hard work on this \nnomination and their continued great work in the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich I once had the great honor of serving.\n  I rise today to support the nomination of Mr. John Bryson to be the \n37th Secretary of the Department of Commerce. As I mentioned, during my \ntime in the Senate I had the great honor of serving on the Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee, one of the most important \ncommittees in the Senate, in my view. It is a wonderful and broadening \nexperience to be a member of that committee.\n  I think what we are discussing today is important; that is, whether \nMr. Bryson should be confirmed by Members of my side of the aisle, \nbecause we may not agree with some of his views and some of his \nphilosophies and statements in the past.\n  I want to be clear. If I were President of the United States, I would \nprobably not have nominated Mr. Bryson, even though I am confident he \nis a fine man. We just have different views on issues. I think we all \nought to appreciate the fact that elections do have consequences. When \na President is elected, we have an important role to play of advice and \nconsent. But we also have a role to play in understanding that the \nAmerican people have spoken and elected a President of the United \nStates and placed on him the responsibility of the Presidency. The best \nway he can carry out those responsibilities in the most efficient \nfashion is to have members of his team around him, people in whom he \nhas trust and confidence. Mr. Bryson clearly has the trust and \nconfidence of the President.\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\n  There are times when all of us have opposed a nominee for an office \nthat requires the advice and consent of the Senate. But those occasions \nshould be rare. Those occasions should be when, in the judgment of a \nSenator, that individual is not fit to serve. That is a big difference \nbetween whether you think that individual should serve or not. In other \nwords, the President's right, in my view, to have a team around him so \nthat he can best serve the country is a very important consideration, \nwithout losing or in any way diminishing our responsibility of advice \nand consent.\n  Mr. Bryson has held a number of positions in business and in other \nwalks of life that are impressive. He may not have made statements or \ndone things that we particularly agree with, but I don't think you can \nquestion Mr. Bryson's credentials and background to fulfill the job of \nSecretary of Commerce. That should be the criteria, in my view.\n  Everybody is entitled to their opinions as to their role as a Senator \nregarding advice and consent. I don't try to tell any other Senator \ntheir role. But I think that the Senate, during most of its existence, \nwill find the President has been given the benefit of appointing \nindividuals to positions of authority and responsibility because the \nPresident has earned that right. So it has to be an overriding reason \nto vote to reject a nominee.\n  By the way, I point out that, in this particular case, because of \ninaction on the trade agreements, a group of us sent a letter to the \nmajority leader saying we would withhold support for the current \nnominee until the free-trade agreements were passed. The free-trade \nagreements were passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at Mr. Bryson's background and not \nwhether you agree with his statements or philosophy, but whether he is \ntruly qualified. I believe he is qualified to serve.\n  I will also mention to my colleagues on this side of the aisle that \nsome day, sooner or later--and I hope sooner rather than later--we will \nhave a Republican President who will be nominating individuals to serve \non his team or her team. Then I hope my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will also observe sort of what has been traditional in the \nSenate, which is that you give a President certain latitude to pick the \nmembers of his team who he thinks will help him serve this Nation \nthrough difficult times with the utmost efficiency and loyalty.\n  I thank both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison for their work \non this important and, in my view, all too controversial nomination. I \nurge my colleagues to vote in support of the nomination of John Bryson \nto be the 37th Secretary of the Department of Commerce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arizona. I want to say that he was chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and did a fine job. I am so appreciative that he put \na perspective on the role of advice and consent in the Senate, because \nthere are times when all of us have said the issues regarding a certain \nnomination are so great that they would not allow us to vote for \nconfirmation. But that is not the case here. I do think Senator McCain \nmade the eloquent statement that Mr. Bryson might not be his choice, \nbut that is not the question before us. He is qualified for this job. \nHe has the business background we need. We certainly need a Secretary \nof Commerce to be able to help our businesses grow and create jobs, and \nelections do have consequences.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for taking the time to come and make \nthat part of the record complete. I am pleased we are having this kind \nof discourse. I think the record will be complete, and I believe that \nwhen our colleagues think about the importance of the President having \nhis nominee for this job, and the qualifications that Mr. Bryson has, \neven if you disagree on issues--which I certainly do, Senator McCain \ndoes, and Senator Barrasso does, and we are going to disagree on \nissues; that happens every day. But does it rise to the level of voting \nagainst this nomination? That is the question we have to answer. I \nthought Senator McCain answered it very well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk on behalf of \nCommerce Secretary nominee John Bryson. Mr. Bryson testified before our \nCommerce Committee. I was impressed by his background and by his \nability to answer the questions and by his understanding of business. I \nthink everyone knows we are facing difficult economic times in this \ncountry and we need someone in that job that understands business.\n  Mr. Bryson has strong and broad support within the business \ncommunity, and his nomination has been endorsed by such groups as the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. Six former Commerce Secretaries, from the \nGeorge W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Nixon \nadministrations, have also joined in strongly supporting his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. Bryson, as we know, was reported favorably to the entire Senate \nby the Commerce Committee. But let's look at what some of the groups \nhave said about Mr. Bryson. The Business Roundtable says:\n\n       John Bryson is a proven, well-respected executive who will \n     bring his private sector experience to the Commerce \n     Department's broad portfolio.\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says Bryson has ``a strong \nbusiness background . . . which gives him the advantage of having \nexposure to the difficult issues manufacturers face in today's global \nmarketplace.''\n  The President and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, \nJay Timmons, said:\n\n       Mr. Bryson has a strong business background and serves on \n     the board of many manufacturing companies, which gives him \n     the advantage of having exposure to the difficult issues \n     manufacturers face in today's global marketplace.\n\n  I believe the way we get out of this downturn is manufacturing, it is \nmaking things in America again, it is inventing stuff, and it is \nexporting to the world. These business groups know that Mr. Bryson \nunderstands their issues.\n  The Chamber of Commerce says Bryson has ``extensive knowledge of the \nprivate sector and years of experience successfully running a major \ncompany.''\n  From Edison International we hear that Bryson was ``a visionary \nleader of Edison International, and we know that he will bring that \nsame leadership to the Department of Commerce.''\n  Boeing says this:\n\n       John Bryson's global business experience and strong \n     leadership skills are a great match for the position of \n     Secretary of Commerce.\n\n  The Acting President pro tempore serves on the Commerce Committee, as \nI do. I head the Subcommittee on Competitive Innovation and Export \nPromotion, and I have seen firsthand the need to make sure the Commerce \nCommittee is thinking every single day--as the Commerce Department \nshould--about how we get more jobs in this country, how we make sure we \nare working with business as partners, how we make sure we get through \nthe redtape, and that we put forward a competitive agenda for this \ncountry. That is why I am supporting Mr. Bryson for Commerce Secretary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nMr. John Bryson to be the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of \nCommerce plays a key role in overseeing a department that is \nresponsible for spurring innovation, supporting small business, and \nproviding our Nation with operational scientific information. In tough \neconomic times we need strong leadership in this key cabinet position \nin order to ensure that our Nation's needs in these areas are met.\n  To that end, Mr. Bryson brings with him a strong record of business \nleadership and a sense of the importance of resource stewardship, a \nrare combination that I believe will serve him extremely well. \nUnfortunately, there are those who believe that his past association \nwith certain environmental groups\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nor his eminently sensible support for a solution to our reliance on \nfossil fuels, should disqualify him from this post. I would suggest \nthat these naysayers consider that Mr. Bryson has been endorsed by the \nBusiness Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce. The support shown by these groups ought to \ndemonstrate the nominee's commitment to growing American business and \nthe American economy. I also suggest we should not fear a nominee who \nhas shown a willingness to explore novel solutions to grappling with \nour dependence on foreign oil and the larger issue of climate change. \nBoth of these issues are likely to be among the most important and, \npotentially, the most disrupting problems that we leave to our children \nand grandchildren. No one in this Chamber will deny that we must reduce \nour dependence on fossil fuels, which are a finite resource whether \nfound here or abroad, and no one in this Chamber should deny that the \nclimate is changing. To do so is to deny that which is in front of our \neyes and history does not look kindly on those who ignore the obvious. \nWe should therefore embrace those such as Mr. Bryson who have shown a \nwillingness to work with the business community in seeking a solution \nto these issues.\n  In sum, I believe Mr. Bryson can provide the leadership we need at \nthe Department of Commerce and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting and confirming Mr. Bryson's nomination.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nthe nomination of John Bryson to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The Department of Commerce includes a diverse collection of agencies \nthat work on everything from predicting the weather to issuing patents.\n  But the Department's over-arching mission is to promote job creation \nand economic growth. Today, that mission is more important than ever.\n  With the national unemployment rate hovering around 9 percent, we \nshould have a Secretary of Commerce in place who can lead the \nDepartment in meeting its important mission.\n  After considering his nomination in the Senate Commerce Committee, I \nbelieve Mr. Bryson is well qualified to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  Bryson knows something about job creation from his experience as a \nbusiness leader in the energy sector. He also served on the boards of \nwell-known companies such as Boeing and the Walt Disney Company.\n  Those experiences will help Bryson meet the challenges of leading the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  I know firsthand some of the good work that the Department of \nCommerce has done to help businesses in my home State through the \nEconomic Development Administration, EDA, manufacturing extension \npartnership, MEP, and trade adjustment for firms initiatives.\n  I have visited small businesses that received assistance from these \nDepartment of Commerce agencies and know how vital such support can be \nfor entrepreneurs who want to grow their business or maybe export for \nthe first time.\n  The Department of Commerce already faces enough challenges to meet \nits vital mission. Delaying Mr. Bryson's nomination any further would \nonly add to those challenges at a time when we can ill afford it.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise in support of John Bryson of \nCalifornia, President Obama's nominee to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. Bryson will bring a wealth of experience in both the private \nsector and the public sector to this very important job of Commerce \nSecretary. Lord knows, we are in a recession and we are fighting hard \nto get out of it. We need a Commerce Secretary, and we need someone who \nunderstands the private sector and the public sector and we have that \nin John Bryson.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, he served as the chairman of the California \nWater Resources Board and as the chairman of the California Public \nUtilities Commission. There, he helped California navigate droughts, \noil shortages, and other crises during a critical period in my State's \nhistory.\n  For more than 20 years, Mr. Bryson has utilized his talents in the \nprivate sector, first as chairman and CEO of Southern California \nEdison, and later as chairman and CEO of Edison International.\n  Mr. Bryson has also served on the boards of many companies, both \nlarge and small, and he will bring to the job of Commerce Secretary a \nunique expertise on what it takes for businesses to grow and expand.\n  Mr. Bryson's top priority is job creation. As Commerce Secretary, he \nwill be working closely with the President to meet the goal of doubling \nour Nation's exports by 2015 and creating hundreds of thousands of new \njobs right here in the United States. He will be working with the \nprivate sector to drive innovation and economic growth, and he will be \nworking to make the United States a leader in the clean energy economy.\n  At Edison International, Mr. Bryson helped California become a hub \nfor clean energy development and clean energy jobs by making \ninvestments in those renewable technologies. He understands new clean \nenergy technologies will create millions of jobs here at home and that \nthe Nation that rises to this challenge will lead the world because the \nwhole world is looking for these kinds of technologies.\n  I think Mr. Bryson comes to us with varied experiences which will \nserve us well and will serve President Obama well. Mr. Bryson's \nnomination has been applauded by all sides of the political spectrum, \nfrom environmentalists to business interests.\n  Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce praised Mr. Bryson's \n``extensive knowledge of the private sector and years of experience \nsuccessfully running a major company.''\n  The Business Roundtable called Mr. Bryson ``a proven, well-respected \nexecutive who will bring his private sector experience to the Commerce \nDepartment's broad portfolio that includes technology, trade, \nintellectual property and exports, which will be crucial to expanding \nour economy and creating jobs.''\n  The Natural Resources Defense Council, which Mr. Bryson helped found \nin the 1970s, called him:\n\n     . . . a visionary leader in promoting a clean environment and \n     a strong economy. He has compiled an exemplary record in \n     public service and in business that underscores the strong \n     linkage between economic and environmental progress.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom the Los Angeles Times, titled ``Commerce Department nominee \ndeserves the job.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From latimes.com, Jun. 21, 2011]\n\n              Commerce Department Nominee Deserves the Job\n\n       John Bryson's nomination to be President Obama's next \n     secretary of Commerce has been met with the predictable \n     combination of delusion and obstructionism that characterizes \n     the modern confirmation process. Some Senate Republicans vow \n     to hold him hostage to the passage of several long-sought \n     free-trade agreements; others insist they will reject him \n     based on his presumed politics, which they wish were more \n     like theirs. None has advanced an argument worthy of \n     defeating this nomination, and though sensible people will \n     withhold a final judgment until after Bryson is questioned, \n     his credentials are encouraging, as are the endorsements of \n     those who know him.\n       Bryson is a familiar figure in Los Angeles. A longtime \n     chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison \n     and Edison International, he is a pillar of the region's \n     business community, admired by the Chamber of Commerce and \n     his fellow executives. He also was a founder of the Natural \n     Resources Defense Council, where his work earned him respect \n     and appreciation from California's environmental movement. \n     He's been president of the California Public Utilities \n     Commission and even served as a director of Boeing,\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n     dipping his toe into the nation's military-industrial \n     complex. He is thus the rare nominee to present himself to \n     Congress with endorsements from the Chamber, military \n     suppliers and the nation's leading environmental \n     organizations.\n       Within a rational political universe, that would entitle \n     Bryson to confirmation by acclamation. But zealots are \n     suspicious. His critics question his support for regulation \n     to address climate change and see his NRDC leadership (more \n     than three decades ago) as evidence that he's a ``job \n     killer'' and an ``environmental extremist'' rather than a job \n     promoter as the Commerce secretary traditionally is. Never \n     mind that Bryson's record is one of both serious business \n     development and responsible environmental stewardship.\n       Then there's the issue of the free-trade agreements. Yes, \n     Obama has moved too slowly to forward the South Korea, \n     Colombia and Panama trade pacts that will create jobs and \n     expand the reach of American business. And yes, Obama's labor \n     allies are principally to blame for obstructing those pacts. \n     But those objections are irrelevant to Bryson's nomination \n     and shouldn't be used as an excuse to hold it up.\n       Many Republicans undoubtedly would prefer a nominee who \n     championed drilling as the answer to America's energy needs \n     or who countenanced their anti-scientific challenge to global \n     warming. They have their chance: Elect Sarah Palin. In the \n     meantime, Obama deserves a Cabinet secretary of impeccable \n     credentials and broad support. Bryson has a chance to prove \n     that he's all of that at the hearings that begin Tuesday. \n     Republicans owe him the opportunity.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Mr. Bryson's unique background will serve \nhim well as he works with President Obama, the Senate, and the House to \ncreate jobs. I applaud our President for choosing such a well-\nqualified, experienced individual to be Commerce Secretary, and I want \nto thank Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison for working \ntogether so we could get to this vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, let me thank my good friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, for speaking because I asked her to do it. A \nlot of people are surprised on how well we get along.\n  The committee she chairs is called the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and I am the ranking member. When Republicans were in the \nmajority, I was the chairman. I look forward to being chairman again, \nbut that is another conversation for another day.\n  But the reason I wanted to speak is, because we do. A lot of people \nare surprised to see this. We get along very well. Right now, we are \ndoing everything we possibly can to get a highway reauthorization bill. \nShe prides herself on being a very proud liberal and I pride myself on \nbeing a very proud conservative. Yet we both know that one of our \nprimary functions here is to do something about infrastructure.\n  I have often been ranked as the most conservative member of this \nbody, the Senate. I often have said I may be conservative, but I am a \nbig spender in two areas: national defense and infrastructure. That is \nwhat we are supposed to be doing.\n  Right now, we have the most deplorable problem in the condition of \nour roads and highways and bridges. My State of Oklahoma goes back and \nforth being dead last or next to the last behind Missouri as having the \nworst conditions of our bridges.\n  We had a lady not too long ago in my State of Oklahoma, in Oklahoma \nCity, the mother of two small children, who was driving under one of \nthe big interstate bridges and a block of concrete fell off and it \nkilled her. She was the mother of two small children. We have people \ndying every day on the highways because of the condition of the \nhighways. For that, I applaud Senator Boxer for joining me to put \ntogether this coalition.\n  I don't want to say anything that would be improper at this time, but \nit is my expectation--not just hope but expectation--that we are going \nto be able to come up with a highway reauthorization bill, and it is \ngoing to be one that is at least holding the current spending level.\n  If we are to have to go back to the level of the proceeds of the \nhighway trust fund, that would be about 34 percent less than what we \nare spending today. I defy any one of my fellow Senators from all the \n50 States to tell me one State that isn't having just as serious a \nproblem as my State of Oklahoma is having.\n  I think that it is important we recognize there are some things the \ngovernment is supposed to be doing and some things that bring us all \ntogether. Again, that is what is going to happen.\n  I can remember back, the last reauthorization bill we had was 2005. \nAt that time, I was the chairman of the committee. We all worked \ntogether. We came up with a $284.6 billion, 5-year bill. Yet as robust \nas that was, that did very little more than just maintain what we have \ntoday--no new bridges, all these new things we need to have.\n  I think a lot of the people who are my good friends, and primarily \nover in the House, who came under the banner of the tea parties and all \nthat, they recognize, yes, they can be a conservative. But when they \ngot home, they said: Wait a minute. We want to not be spending on these \nbig things, but we weren't talking about transportation. So we have to \nsingle out transportation for my friends to recognize there is a place \nwe need be spending more money, not less money.\n  So I look forward to that, and I hope we will have an announcement to \nmake, as one of the most liberal and one of the most conservative \nmembers joining and coming up with a highway reauthorization bill. \nThere is not unanimity in what it will look like, other than the \nspending level should remain where it is today and it should be \nsomething that is going to address these problems.\n  There will be a lot of sacrifices along the way. I know that when we \nmark up a bill there are going to be a lot of things in it that I don't \nlike and that Senator Boxer doesn't like and we are going to have to \ngive up some of these things.\n  I have made it very clear that back in the early days, when I was \nactually serving in the other body, we always had surpluses in the \nhighway trust fund and we were able to take care of these needs. Then, \nas typical as politicians are this way, they see a pot of money and \nthey want in on it. So we had all these groups, and a lot of them were \nenvironmental groups that wanted to have their own agenda attached to \nit. We are going to have to get serious and make this a highway bill.\n  By the way, this would also be certainly the biggest jobs bill we \nhave had during this administration, since this administration has done \na lousy job of providing jobs.\n  But having said that--and I said that because I want to draw a \ncontrast. We are about to consider and vote on the President's nominee, \nJohn Bryson, to be Secretary of Commerce. He is President Obama's \nchoice, and there is a clear indication he has no indication of backing \ndown on his job-killing war on affordable energy.\n  But I have to say this. With John Bryson, this isn't Van Jones we are \ntalking about. This is a guy who is a nice guy, and we have a lot of \nmutual friends. I have been contacted by people who are friends of mine \nwho are friends of his, and clearly he is a person who is well received \nin terms of being a good person. But he is dead wrong on the issues \nthat will provide jobs for America.\n  At a time when unemployment is sky high, President Obama chooses the \nfounder--and I will characterize it differently than my friend from \nCalifornia did--of one of the most radical, leftwing, extreme \nenvironmentalist groups, the National Resources Defense Council. It is \na leftwing organization which, in the name of global warming, seeks to \ncut off access to our natural resources and increase drastically the \nprice of electricity and gasoline across America.\n  We know this is true, because we know that if they would merely \ndevelop the resources we have today in the United States of America, we \nwouldn't have to be dependent upon the Middle East for one barrel of \noil, and we wouldn't have to worry about our supply of gas and coal, \nbecause as I will explain in just a minute and document, we have the \nlargest recoverable resources in coal gas and oil of any country in the \nworld.\n  Mr. Bryson once called the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill moderate. \nThis particular cap-and-trade bill was probably the most liberal of all \nthe cap-and-trade bills that were there.\n  By the way, I have to say this one thing. I understand I am the last \nspeaker tonight. What do all the speakers who are in favor of this have \nin\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\ncommon? They are all supporting cap and trade, with the exception of \nSenator Hutchison, and she is retiring. But stop and think about it: \nBoxer, Feinstein, Rockefeller, Kerry, McCain, they are all strong \nsupporters of cap and trade. That is what I am going to talk about \ntonight because I know where John Bryson is on cap and trade.\n\n  He told some students at the University of California Berkeley last \nyear that ``cap-and-trade has the advantage politically at sort-of \nhiding the fact that you have a major tax.''\n  To me, the fact that they are supporting something that is a major \ntax increase on the American people is bad enough. But when they say \none of the good things about cap and trade is you can hide the fact \nthat it is a major tax increase--and we know now what this would cost. \nCap and trade is cap and trade. It doesn't make any difference if it \nwas back during the Kyoto days. It doesn't make any difference if it \nwas in any of the bills that were passed. Still, the analysis is that \nthe cost of a cap-and-trade bill would be between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion a year.\n  Again, this is legislation that would cost the taxpayers $300 billion \nto $400 billion a year and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nhurt families and workers by raising the price of gasoline and \nelectricity. Yet the nominee for Secretary of Commerce believes that \nwas a moderate bill, the Waxman-Markey bill.\n  The Secretary of Commerce should have a record of promoting, not \nstifling, economic growth. John Bryson's career shows he has a clear \nrecord of the latter, and it makes no sense to have the Secretary of \nCommerce who is against commerce.\n  I am not the only one who thinks so. Let me just share. An editorial \nin the Wall Street Journal states:\n\n       President Obama nominated John Bryson to head the Commerce \n     Department on Tuesday, praising the Californian as a business \n     leader who understands what it takes to innovate, to create \n     jobs, and to persevere through tough times. That's one way of \n     describing someone with a talent of scoring government \n     subsidies.\n\n  We keep hearing--and I think they hit the nail on the head there and \nthey answered the question. People say: This man has been very \nsuccessful for 18 years. He ran one of the major utilities out in \nCalifornia, and one of the interesting things about it is this utility \nout there is not one that is using coal; it is using renewables. \nObviously, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out: If they have the \nvery heavy expenses and they raise the price of energy, it doesn't hurt \nthe utilities. They pass it on. They pass it on to the consumers who \nultimately have to pay for it.\n  Quoting the Washington Examiner:\n\n       But there is another side of Bryson, one that fits squarely \n     in the tradition of radical Obama appointees like green jobs \n     czar Van Jones, a self-proclaimed Marxist; Medicare head \n     Donald Berwick, who swoons over Britain's socialized National \n     Health Service; and National Labor Relations Board member \n     Craig Becker, the former labor lawyer who never met a union \n     power grab he couldn't back.\n\n  Here is Investors Business Daily:\n\n       The nominee for commerce secretary founded an anti-energy \n     group and believes in redistribution of wealth to help poorer \n     nations. At this rate, we will be one of them. If personnel \n     is policy, there can be no better choice to help implement \n     President Obama's anti-growth energy policy and \n     redistribution of wealth plans than his choice to be the next \n     Secretary of Commerce, John Bryson.\n\n  Again, that is the Investors Business Daily.\n  The ACU came out and said: ``Putting John Bryson in charge of the \nCommerce Department is the dictionary definition of putting the fox in \ncharge of the hen house.''\n  That is exactly what it is, and that is one reason I would prefer we \nnot have this vote tonight. I would like to have all of us go back for \nthis 1-week recess and let the people know this is about to be voted \non, and I think that is one reason they are going to be doing it \ntonight.\n  By the way, I am not critical of the leadership, certainly not the \nDemocratic or Republican leadership. In fact, I went to them and said: \nAs long as you give me a 60-vote threshold, I would waive going through \nall the loops of filibustering and having cloture votes and all that. \nSo I appreciate that. But my intent was to wait, and I still would ask \nformally if they would change this UC under which we are operating and \nallow this vote to take place when we come back from this 1-week \nrecess.\n  The choice of Bryson is also part of President Obama's green energy \njobs push. In fact, the President said he specifically nominated--\nlisten to this--he specifically nominated Bryson because he is a \n``fierce proponent of alternative energy.'' But with more than 9 \npercent unemployment and the complete collapse of the solar company \nSolyndra, the President's green agenda is clearly not creating jobs. In \nthe end, Solyndra is more than just a bankrupt company, it is a \nmetaphor for the failure of Obama's war on fossil fuel jobs.\n  I have already called for hearings in the Senate on Solyndra and I \nhope it will not be long before they occur.\n  President Obama has received the message loudly and clearly that his \nglobal warming green agenda no longer sells, but that doesn't mean he \nhas given up trying to implement it. Bryson is just one figure in \nObama's green team. He follows in the footsteps of Carol Browner and \nAnthony Van Jones, who also supported increasing taxes on America's \nenergy, as well as Energy Secretary Steven Chu. You remember Stephen \nChu, the President's Energy Secretary, who said, ``[s]omehow we have to \nfigure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels of gasoline \nin Europe.'' That is about $8 a gallon.\n  It is the intention of this administration to raise gas prices, to \neither force them into some other type of energy or to stop people from \nhaving the freedom of driving as we have always had in this country. \nThat was Energy Secretary Steven Chu who said we have to bring our \nprice of gasoline at the pumps up to that of Europe.\n  Then we have also Alan Krueger. His nomination by President Obama to \nbe the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is yet another \nexample. During his time at the Department of Treasury under President \nObama, Mr. Krueger made clear his opposition to the development of \ntraditional domestic energy. He even went so far as to say ``the \nadministration believes it is no longer sufficient to address our \nNation's energy needs by finding more fossil fuels. . . .''\n  I am still quoting Alan Kreuger. This is when he was in the Treasury \nDepartment. He is the nominee now for the Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, the advisory council. He even went so far as to say:\n\n       The administration's goal is to have resources invested in \n     ways which yield the highest social return.\n\n  That is the current nominee to be Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers for the President. He doesn't need that advice, he is already \ndoing it.\n  The Congressional Research Service reports America has the largest \nrecoverable resources of oil, gas, and coal in the world. The Obama \nadministration's failure to appreciate this fact is one of the many \nreasons why they are not making progress in creating jobs and improving \nour economy.\n  This is a key here. When this discovery was made, the Congressional \nResearch Service--nobody has denied this. That was less than a year ago \nwhen they said America has the largest recoverable resources of oil, \ngas, and coal in the world. That means we could be totally self-\nsufficient. All we have to do is develop our own resources.\n  I defy anyone on this floor to tell me there is any other country \nthat does not develop its own resources. We are the only one. So we \nhave 83 percent of our non-shore public lands off limits. We have these \nhuge reserves out there but we cannot go after them.\n  Then there is Rebecca Wodder, who President Obama has chosen to be \nthe Assistant Secretary for the Fish and Wildlife Department. That \nwould be for the Department of Interior. As CEO of American Rivers, \nwhich works actively to shut down energy production in the United \nStates, she--Rebecca Wodder--is a strong advocate for the Federal \nregulation of hydraulic fracturing, a process which is efficiently and \neffectively regulated by States.\n  This is interesting. It was not long ago that President Obama was \nlauding the virtues of natural gas, and at the end of his speech he \nsaid we have to do something about hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic \nfracturing started in my State of Oklahoma in 1948. I can't quantify \nthe hundreds of thousands of wells that have been hydraulically\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nfractured, but it has been in the hundreds of thousands--maybe 1.5 \nmillion. I have heard that figure. With the exception of one well back \nin 1986, where somebody actually went into an aquifer, there has not \nbeen one documented case in over a million hydraulic fractured wells \nwhere it has contaminated groundwater. Yet they are using that, knowing \nfull well if you kill hydraulic fracturing you kill all the oil and gas \nin tight formations because you cannot get it without that.\n  The selection of Ms. Wodder is a clear departure from her \npredecessor, Tom Strickland, who in testimony before the EPW Committee, \nour committee, said we should actively and aggressively develop our \nenergy resources. Unfortunately, Ms. Wodder's support for regulation \nand advancement suggested she would do the opposite, which exposes the \nreality of President Obama's agenda of increasing energy prices and \ndestroying jobs.\n  These nominations--of course we are talking tonight about another \nnomination of a person who is a good guy and all that, but John Bryson, \nto be in a position to follow all the rest of these who are doing \neverything they can to kill fossil fuels, and when you kill fossil \nfuels, we know, and the President admitted, it would cause the price of \nelectricity in America to skyrocket.\n  These nominations are not surprising when you remember that President \nObama said himself that he wants electricity rates to skyrocket. As he \ntold the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, ``If somebody wants to build \na coal-fired plant they can. It's just that it will bankrupt them. . . \n.''\n  That is what the Obama EPA regulations intend to do.\n  The EPA is moving forward with an unprecedented number of rules for \ncoal-fired plants and industrial boilers that have now become known as \nthe infamous train wreck for the incredible harm they will do to our \neconomy. They are set to destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nsignificantly raise energy prices for families, businesses, and \nfarmers--basically anyone who drives a car or flips a switch.\n  The President himself has now publicly acknowledged this. When we \nstopped the Agency from tightening the national ambient air quality \nstandards for ozone, his statement couldn't be more clear: The EPA \nrules create regulatory burdens and uncertainty.\n  Just last week, EPA also pulled back on its plan to tighten \nregulation on farm dust, undoubtedly due to bipartisan concern that it \nwould cause great harm to our farmers.\n  I have given the speech on the floor, and I am not going to repeat it \ntonight, about what all the regulations this President is trying to put \nforth will cost, in terms of his maximum achievable control technology. \nHe has the refinery MACT, he has the boiler MACT, he has the farm dust \nMACT. These are the things he is trying to do where the technology is \nnot even there.\n\n  I found out something the other day in Broken Arrow, OK. I can't \nrecall the name of the company now. They make platforms for hydraulic \nfracturing. I don't know if the Senator from California has ever seen \none of these platforms. I have seen a lot of them. They make a lot of \nthem in Oklahoma. This young man who is the president of this company \nshowed me these platforms. These platforms are about--you could put \nmaybe four of them in this Chamber, that is how big they are.\n  On these platforms, to do hydraulic fracturing, they have a great big \ndiesel engine. This diesel engine is necessary to do hydraulic \nfracturing of oil wells. They came out with a regulation the other day \nI didn't even know about. They said, after a certain date--exactly \nwhere it was, in the next couple of months--that you would not be able \nto use the diesel engine on your platform that does hydraulic \nfracturing unless it is a tier 4 diesel engine.\n  Here is the problem. They don't make them. They are on the drawing \nboard. They are making them but they are not on market yet. So they are \nshutting down the people who are building the platforms to do hydraulic \nfracturing through regulations.\n  Every day we run into new regulations. I can remember on the farm \ndust regulation, I had a news conference in the State of Oklahoma. In \nOklahoma we went back--I had people coming out from Washington, DC, who \nhad never been west of the Mississippi. We went down southwest in the \ntown of Altus, OK. I said in my news conference, when the cameras were \nrolling: This President is trying to do something to regulate farm \ndust. Let me explain something to you. If you look down here, that \nbrown stuff down there, that is called dirt. If you look at that round \ngreen thing down there, that is cotton. Put your finger in the air, \nthat is called wind. Are there any questions?\n  What I am saying is they all realized there is no technology to \nregulate farm dust. Yet they are trying to do it. Right now the major \nfarm organizations such as American Farm Bureau, they are the ones who \nare saying that is the No. 1 concern right now, what they are trying to \ndo to shut down farms in America. The EPA continues to push regulations \nto harm the economy, the Cross-Air State Pollution Rule, the so-called \nutility MACT--rules that are poised to destroy jobs.\n  Let's not forget the economic ramifications of global warming.\n  But before we leave the utility MACT, we have right now utilities \nthat are notifying coal producers, saying if this goes through we are \nnot going to be able to honor our contracts to buy coal from you. That \nis how serious it is. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of \nemployees.\n  Let's go to the big one now, the economic ramifications of global \nwarming, regulations imposed by Obama which cost American consumers \nbetween $300 and $400 billion a year. The reason I want to mention this \nis because there have been attempts since the Kyoto treaty--of course \nwe didn't ratify the Kyoto treaty for a good reason, and that is it \nwould cause extreme economic harm to the United States of America. It \nwould only affect the developed nations such as the United States and \nsome of the European nations, but not the developing nations. It would \nnot have any effect of reducing CO2 if you wanted to reduce \nCO2.\n  Ever since the 1990s there have been about seven or eight different \nbills to try, here in the United States, to do away with--impose some \nkind of cap and trade. But they were not able to do it because the \npeople in this body will not vote for it. In this body, right now you \ncould not get maybe 25, maybe 30 votes. It would take 60 votes to pass \nit. You could not get more than 30 votes on a cap-and-trade bill.\n  The President realized this. He realized with all the jobs that would \nbe lost and the cost of this, the fact it would impose a tax of around \n$300 to $400 billion a year on the American people. I remember back in \n1993, that was during the Clinton-Gore years, I remember when they came \nout with their big tax increase. I will never forget it because I was \nserving at that time in the other body. They were raising marginal \nrates, raising capital gains taxes, raising all the taxes, retirement--\nall of it. The cost of that was some $30 billion a year. I remember \ncoming down to the floor of the House of Representatives, saying: We \ncannot afford $30 billion a year.\n  This tax would be 10 times that, between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion a year. That is what they are trying to do.\n  When the President realized that he was not able to pass this \nlegislatively, he decided through regulations he was going to pass his \nown cap and trade.\n  I have to say this. There are people out there who still believe--not \nvery many--somehow we are having catastrophic global warming and it is \ndue to anthropogenic gases or CO2 emissions.\n  I remember. I am very fond of Lisa Jackson, who is the EPA \nAdministrator appointed by President Obama, because I asked her this \nquestion. I said: If we were to pass any of these cap-and-trade bills, \nwould this reduce worldwide CO2 emissions?\n  She said: No, because it would only affect the United States of \nAmerica. This is not where the problem is. If it is a problem, that \nproblem is in Mexico, in China, in India, in places that do not have \nany kind of restrictions. So that is what it is. He is trying to impose \nthat tax.\n  I know people get worn out when they hear talk about billions or $1 \ntrillion. I am not as smart as most of these guys around here so I do \nit a little differently. I keep track of the number of families in my \nState of Oklahoma who file an income tax return. Then I do my math. If \nwe were to\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\npass cap and trade, or if he is able to do it through regulations--\nwhich are sponsored, by the way, by John Bryson, the nominee we are \ntalking about--if he were to do it, it would increase the taxes by \nbetween $300 and $400 billion a year. Now do your math with the number \nof people who file a tax return in the State of Oklahoma. It would be \napproximately $3,000 a family. What do you get for it? You get nothing \nby their own admission because it would not reduce the worldwide \nemissions.\n\n  What this President fails to realize is that affordable, reliable \nenergy is the lifeblood of a healthy economy and the foundation of our \nglobal competitiveness. Instead, he continues to favor the radical \nenvironmental agenda ahead of turning around our economy and putting \nAmericans back to work.\n  On the other hand, in my State of Oklahoma, oil and gas development \nhas led to a tremendous economic boost in the creation of good-paying \njobs. Right now in my State of Oklahoma--there is a 9.2-percent \nunemployment rate nationwide. In my State of Oklahoma, it is 5.5 \npercent--I am sorry, it is about 5.5 percent or 5.2 percent. That is \nabout half of the national average. It is due by and large to the fact \nthat we have this growth and people are in the energy business.\n  So we can continue going down the path of President Obama's job-\nkilling agenda or we can start to develop our Nation's vast natural \nresources, which are the key to the Nation's recovery. That is jobs. \nThat is cheap gas at the pumps. We certainly have plenty of them.\n  The CRS report I mentioned shows that America's combined recoverable \nnatural gas, oil, and coal endowment is the largest on Earth. In fact, \nour recoverable resources are far greater than those of Saudi Arabia, \nChina, and Canada combined.\n  We have 163 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the United States \nof America. That is enough to maintain our current levels of production \nas the world's third largest producer and replace our imports from the \nPersian Gulf for more than 50 years. In other words, on oil alone, if \nwe just developed what we have here, it would take care of our needs--\nwhat we know is down there--for 50 years.\n  We could say the same thing for natural gas. At the current \nconsumption, America's future supply of natural gas is 2,000 trillion \ncubic feet, and at today's rate of use, that is enough to run the \nUnited States of America for 90 years. Just imagine that. The only \nproblem is that our politicians will not let us develop our own \nresources.\n  Finally, the report I referred to, which is a fairly recent report, \nalso reveals that America is No. 1 in coal reserves, with more than 28 \npercent of the world's coal. That is a real solution to the energy \nsecurity and the key to economic prosperity.\n  John Bryson, if he were to become Secretary and the vote would take \nplace, energy development and economic growth in Oklahoma and across \nthe Nation could be in jeopardy, and that is why I am doing everything \nI can to tell the truth to the American people.\n  It has been said to me by Democrats and Republicans alike that their \nphones have been ringing off the hook by people who serve on boards \nwith John Bryson. And I said from the very beginning that he is a good \nperson, but he is of the philosophy that he is an outspoken proponent \nof cap-and-trade, and that is what we can't afford.\n  I know there is a lot of pressure put on Members of this body. I \nwonder where all of the conservatives are tonight. I appreciate Senator \nBarrasso coming here and talking, as I am talking, and telling the \ntruth about the problem we have. Sometime, someplace, we have to draw \nthe line. I named all of these appointments the President has made, the \nnominations he has made. We have to draw the line, and I think this is \na good place to do it.\n  I recognize there is going to be a lot of pressure on conservatives \nto kind of sit this one out, but I want them to keep in mind that this \nis the No. 1 concern of most of the conservative groups right now. I \nread the editorials that were out there. Everybody knows. Our eyes are \nopen. This is not a vote where later on you say: Oh, I wish I had known \nthat; I would have voted no. This is your chance to do it.\n  Have I had calls from people on boards? Yes, I have. They have all \nsaid: He is a good friend of ours, and I don't want to weigh in.\n  One of them was kind of interesting. He called up and went through \nthis whole thing, and then after he told me how great John Bryson was, \nhe said: Have you got that down? I called. You have written that down.\n  Yes, that is right.\n  Well, just ignore everything I said.\n  We know the phone calls come in. These are important people. There \nare leaders out there, and I love them all. I love John Bryson, but we \nare going to have to draw the line.\n  If you want to have an advocate for the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of America; that is, a tax increase that is called cap and \ntrade, then this is the nominee for the Secretary of Commerce who is \ncommitted to cap and trade in America.\n  I wish we were not going to take this vote until the end of the \nrecess because I would love to have people go home and try to answer \nquestions from people who are out there in the real world as to why is \nit that someone is not standing up for us to develop our own natural \nresources, our own energy, and reduce the price of electricity, reduce \nthe price of gas, and think about us for a change. That is what is \ngoing to happen.\n  I think right now, by rushing this vote before people have time to \nrealize it, that very likely it is going to pass. I don't want anyone \nto say they were not informed because I am informing you right now.\n  I thank Senator Barrasso for joining me.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

So people who have concerns, bring \nthem to David Schiappa or Gary Myrick because otherwise I might come \nhere and offer a consent request. Either we are going to move this bill \nforward or move off this bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for my colleagues who are here, I wish to \nexplain the reason for an amendment which I have filed, No. 912, along \nwith the cosponsors, my colleagues Senator McCain and Senator Cornyn \nfrom Texas, an amendment which seeks to add some money for the U.S. \nMarshals Service. I wish to explain why we think this is a good idea, \nbut first to say that in speaking with Leader Reid, we are trying with \nour staff and the majority staff to see if we can work out the \nappropriate pay-fors for this in an appropriate amount of money that \nwould assist the U.S. Marshals Service. Hopefully we can work something \nout. I am just trying to explain the basis for this at this time.\n  As you know, we have done a lot of work on the borders to try to \nsecure them, and that has required us to add money for the U.S. Border \nPatrol and several other accounts in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We have added money for the Department of Justice. We need \nnew judges, courtrooms, prosecutors, defenders. It has taken a lot of \nmoney to secure the border with all of the different aspects that are \ninvolved.\n  The one area we have not kept up with is the U.S. Marshals Service. \nAll of us know the U.S. Marshals Service. It is a great organization. \nThese people do tremendous work. But sometimes we forget them. And what \nwe have learned here is that while we have an increased ability to \napprehend illegal immigrants and to try them in court, and even jail \nspace to hold them, the group that does the holding and the \ntransporting and the keeping of the judges and the courtrooms safe \nduring the process, the U.S. Marshals Service, has not had funding to \nkeep up with this. As a result, they are way low in terms of both \npersonnel and also some facilities that need to be upgraded to accept \nthe much larger numbers of illegal immigrants and other prisoners who \nare in their custody.\n  To give you one illustration, when prisoners are brought to a \ncourthouse, obviously there are huge security measures that have to be \nfollowed to ensure that jurors, judges, the public at large, witnesses, \nand so on, are not in jeopardy because of the existence of the \nprisoners. So they are generally brought in vehicles, appropriately \naccompanied, to secure facilities in the court building and then at the \nappropriate time brought to the courtroom, and all in the custody of \nthe marshals, and with appropriate security for all.\n  However, because of these increased numbers, what we found is, by way \nof example, they bring the prisoners from the holding facility, the \nprison, the jail, wherever it might be. They literally have to \ndisembark in a public parking lot where jurors are parking to come up \nto be involved in cases, where the public at large, where witnesses, \nwhere victims and families, judges and lawyers are coming to park to go \nto the courthouse, and go up the elevators and so on right with these \nsame people. That is not a secure situation.\n  In most situations the marshals have the ability to take their \nprisoners directly to a secure port, a place in the courthouse where \nthey can immediately put them into custody in a secure locked-down \nfacility. Construction of some court buildings need to keep up with \nthis demand, and it requires some money, in this case, about $16 \nmillion. I know this is a small matter in the overall budget that we \nare talking about. But for the Marshals Service to do its job, this is \nimportant for them.\n  They need additional personnel. The cost of that far exceeds $10 \nmillion. But that is what we thought we would try to ask for in this \namendment to at least bring the Marshals Service up to a level where \nthey can accommodate the new numbers of prisoners.\n  In our amendment, $20 million is provided for additional deputy \nmarshals and security-related support staff to assist in overall \nSouthwest border enforcement. We have narrowed this down to the five \njudicial districts on the border that have--well, in fact, these \ndistricts have about half--49.7 percent, to be exact, of all the \nprisoners nationwide brought into the custody of the Marshals Service \nare brought in by way of those five Southwest border judicial \ndistricts. And about half of those in the Marshals' custody along the \nSouthwest border are or were held for immigration-related offenses.\n  So this is the need that we are trying to satisfy with this \namendment. The Marshals Service employs only about 80 percent of what \nthey need in terms of Marshals and support staff in these court \nfacilities. A recent Department of Justice hiring freeze has prevented \nthe Marshals Service from reaching even 90 percent of its personnel \nneeds along the Southwest borders. To reach 100 percent of staffing \nwould require $43 million, to hire an additional 162 deputy marshals \nand 71 support staff.\n  We all know the constraints we are all operating under here, so we \ncut that back to simply try to reach 90 percent of their requirement \nfor hiring needs. And that, as I said, would require just about $20 \nmillion for these hiring purposes.\n  On the construction side of it, the amendment provides for $16.5 \nmillion for these detention upgrades at the Federal courthouses located \nin this border region. Of the $16.5 million, $1.5 million would \nspecifically be allocated for courthouse security equipment. I have \ntold you a little bit about the problem with the security at the \ncourthouses. Some of this would obviously be used for construction of a \nport that would allow these vehicles to unload detainees and prisoners \nright next to cellblock doors and so on. I described that.\n  But this is the least we can do, both to protect the public and to \nassist the Marshals Service. There has been some dichotomy of views, \nshall I say, expressed by the Department of Justice and Department of \nHomeland Security about whether they have what they need to secure the \nborder. We have heard the Secretary of Homeland Security say, we have \nall we need. But we also know that the Secretary has said, we have to \nprioritize our detention policy, for example, because we do not have \nthe facilities and the money we need to detain and deport all of the \npeople who are deportable, so we have to focus on the most serious \ncrimes, the felons primarily, who are now the top target for \ndeportation.\n  Obviously if you have to prioritize, we would agree with that \nprioritization. But what that means is that they do not have enough \nmoney to do all that they are trying to do. So on the one hand, it is \nkind of distressing that the Department says we have all we need and, \non the other hand, we do not have enough, so we have to prioritize what \nwe do.\n  What we are trying to do in this appropriations bill is to attack the \none part of the problem that we can in this bill, and that is to help \nthe U.S. Marshals. As I said, I do not think there is\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\none of us here that would not be supportive of that. I want to avoid \nthe situation where, God forbid, someone is at a courthouse or entering \nthe courthouse or whatever and innocent people are harmed because we \ndid not have the appropriate security. That is what we are trying to \nprovide in this amendment.\n  As I said, this is cosponsored by my colleagues Senator McCain and \nSenator Cornyn. Obviously the three of us are very aware of the problem \nthat we have in our judicial districts on the border. So I reiterate, I \nappreciate the offer of the majority leader to make majority staff \navailable to see if there is some way that with my staff we can work \nout some appropriate amount of money, with the appropriate pay-fors. I \nhope I will be able to announce that a little bit later on. I will not \ntake any more of my colleagues' time right now.\n  But if anyone has questions about this and wishes to talk to us about \nit, since I am hoping that we will have something to support a little \nbit later on this evening, I would appreciate them either contacting me \nor Senator Cornyn or Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Has Pastore time expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Pastore time has expired.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the priorities \nfacing Montana and this Nation, creating jobs, responsibly cutting our \nspending, cutting the deficit, rebuilding our economy. I appreciate the \nproposal that will be put forth I think later this evening to attempt \nto create jobs. When that proposal gets to the floor, I will vote to \nhave the debate on S. 1723, because only then will I be able to offer \nmy amendments to that bill, because as it is written, I cannot support \nthat bill.\n  Having debate will allow us an opportunity to amend it so that it \nwill guarantee jobs in Montana and across America. The perspective I \nbring to the table is a little different than most. I am someone who \nlives in, works in, represents a rural State. My responsibility is to \nmake sure every decision I make works for not only Montana but the \nentire country.\n  I expect full accountability for every penny of taxpayer dollars we \nspend. I expect that when you invest in something, you get what you pay \nfor. A lot of folks know I am a farmer, but many do not know I am also \na former schoolteacher. I used to teach elementary music at Big Sandy \nElementary, in Big Sandy, MT. I fully understand the importance of \nmaking sure all of our Nation's teachers have the resources they need \nto do their job, to lead our most important resource, our children.\n  As a teacher, I also know that when rural schools are asked to \ncompete with urban schools for Federal funding, rural schools often get \nleft behind. The same goes for emergency responders. Their service \nsometimes is--even as volunteers, it is very important to rural States \nsuch as Montana, whether it is firefighters, police officers, EMTs, \nthey are on the clock whenever they are needed.\n  In Montana, as everywhere else, firefighters are respected for their \ncourage and their hard work for doing whatever is expected of them to \nsave property and save lives. But when Montana's rural fire departments \nand rural police departments have to compete for Federal funding, guess \nwho often gets the short end of the stick. That is right, it is the \nemergency responders in rural States such as Montana, the folks who \noften do not have the professional grant writers to help them secure \nthe basic equipment that they need to do their jobs safely.\n  That brings me to my proposal. I want to state again, as 1723 is \nwritten, I cannot support it. I am not convinced it will create the \njobs it must create. And $30 billion in this bill is meant to go to \nStates to boost education, to hire teachers. Yes, investing in \neducation is a powerful short-term and long-term way to create jobs. \nBut as written, this bill fails to give taxpayers any guarantee that \ntheir money would actually be used to hire teachers and invest in our \nschools.\n  The fact is, this money could be used to supplant funds instead of \nsupplement funds. A State would get loads of money with little guidance \nthat they spend the money on teachers. But we all know what happens. A \nlot of smart folks who work in State budget offices can find their way \naround guidance, because money is pretty darn easy to move from one \nbudget account to another. In other words, there is no guarantee that \nthis bill will create the jobs.\n  Montana is one of two States that has a budget surplus right now. We \nhave been living within our means. There are other States such as \nKansas that are considering broad-based tax cuts. That is fine. Kansas \ncan do that if it wants. But I am not convinced that we should be \nwriting checks to States so they can cut taxes. Montanans should not be \npaying for tax cuts for people in our States, nor should we be giving \nprecious taxpayer money for States to build up their rainy day fund.\n  I am all for individual States making smart choices with their own \nmoney. But giving them Federal money and hoping they will use it for \neducation and teachers, well, that is not good enough. With that kind \nof money, we need a guarantee. If the motion to proceed is adopted, I \nplan to offer two amendments to address my concerns. One will address \nthe $5 billion in this bill meant to provide aid to the Nation's first \nresponders. My amendment is a simple one. It requires that 20 percent \nof the competitive grant funding goes specifically for rural \ncommunities. That is only fair because rural communities make up 20 \npercent of our Nation.\n  The other amendment puts sideboards on the remainder of the money in \nthis bill, to guarantee that it will be used in a way that it is \nsupposed to be used, to create jobs in education, to invest in our \nkids. My amendment will prohibit States from pulling their own State \nmoney out of education programs when they take this Federal money. How? \nBy putting the money into Part B of the Individual with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA, otherwise known locally as special education.\n  When I traveled around Montana after the passage of the Recovery Act \nin 2009, school administrators told me the money that made it to the \nground was very much appreciated, but that special education was their \ntop priority. IDEA funding is still one of the biggest unfunded \nmandates the Federal Government has on local school districts.\n  When it was first enacted, the Federal Government promised to pay 40 \npercent of the cost of this important law. Today, we pay less than half \nof that promise. This amendment will help bridge that gap somewhat. \nSpecial education funding is not only a top priority for the folks in \nMontana, it also guarantees that the funding gets to the local level.\n  It also guarantees that its funding gets to the local level. If the \nmoney in this bill is supposed to be for teachers, then let's make sure \nit ends up there. This amendment is a good way to do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these two amendments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a portion of grants be awarded to entities in \n                              rural areas)\n\n       At the end of section 203, add ``The Attorney General and \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall award not less than 20 \n     percent of the total amount awarded by the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary, respectively, using amounts made available \n     under this section to entities that are located in areas that \n     are not designated by the Bureau of the Census as urbanized \n     areas.''.\n\n  (Purpose: To allot funds for special education and related services)\n\n       Strike the title heading for title I and all that follows \n     through the section heading for section 111 and insert the \n     following:\n\n                TITLE I--SPECIAL EDUCATION STABILIZATION\n\n     SEC. 101. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide funds to States for \n     special education and related services for the 2011-2012 \n     school year.\n\n     SEC. 102. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this title, the term ``State'' has the meaning given the \n     term in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401).\n\n     SEC. 103. STATE ALLOTMENT.\n\n       (a) Allotment.--For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall \n     allot to each eligible State an amount bearing the same \n     relationship to the amount of funds appropriated under \n     section 106 for that fiscal year, as the amount that State \n     receives under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n     U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) for that fiscal year bears to the total \n     amount all such States receive under that part for that \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) Grants.--From the funds allotted under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary shall make a grant to the Governor of each \n     eligible State.\n       (c) Eligible State.--To be eligible to receive an allotment \n     and grant under this section, a State shall submit and obtain \n     approval of an application under section 104.\n\n     SEC. 104. STATE APPLICATION.\n\n       The Governor of a State desiring to receive a grant under \n     this title shall submit an application to the Secretary \n     within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, in \n     such manner, and containing such information, as the \n     Secretary may reasonably require.\n\n     SEC. 105. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       A State that receives a grant under this title shall use \n     the funds made available under the grant in the same manner, \n     and subject to the same requirements, as funds allotted to \n     the State under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act.\n\n     SEC. 106. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. I would like to talk about one other thing that is \nmissing from the bill, and that is a reauthorization of the Secure \nRural Schools Program and the Payment-in-Lieu of Taxes Program, \notherwise know as PILT.\n  These two programs will do more to ensure that thousands of teachers \nstay on the job than anything else we can do around here. Here is the \nkicker: In the middle of this partisan debate, Secure Rural Schools and \nPILT are bipartisan programs.\n  Under the leadership of Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Baucus, Crapo, \nWyden, and Risch, we have a bill that can pass right now--today.\n  It would keep 4,000 teachers on the job at a cost of $3.5 billion \nover the next 5 years. That is small potatoes compared to the $35 \nbillion in the bill that is before us today.\n  It is a very reasonable bill. But because it is so reasonable, nobody \nwants to see it appear in the middle of such a partisan debate. Once \nagain, too many folks in Washington are looking for ways to point \nfingers.\n  Quite frankly, I don't have as many fingers as most folks around \nhere, so I would rather use mine to solve some problems. Only after \nthis final bill is amended to guarantee job certainty will it be able \nto earn my vote.\n  In order to amend it, I am going to vote for the motion to proceed. \nMy vote is a vote for a debate we ought to have. It is an important \none, so we can truly create jobs and focus on rebuilding our economy.\n  I look forward to that debate.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from West Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nspeaking on behalf of the rural States. It is clear our Nation is \nfacing two grave economic threats: a job crisis and a debt spiral. As \nmuch as some people may wish, we cannot ignore one threat over the \nother. For the sake of our Nation's economic future, we must work \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, and try to find a commonsense \nsolution that protects and creates jobs but does so without adding to \nour growing deficit and debt.\n  In a more sensible legislative process, we would be able to sit down \nand work out compromises that make sense. It is what legislators \nthroughout the Nation's history have done.\n  Unfortunately, looking at where things stand now, it is clear the \nlegislative process in Washington has gotten so dysfunctional that it \ndoesn't make much sense at all.\n  I came here to try to fix things, not to make excuses. I sure didn't \ncome here to play the blame game. I have never fixed a thing by blaming \nsomeone else. As I have said many times before, it is time for all of \nus who have been given the great privilege to serve to focus on what is \nright for the next generation, not worry about the next election.\n  It is why--as frustrating as this legislative process can be--I will \nnot lose hope that we can make this legislation better.\n  With respect to the current Teachers and First Responders Back to \nWork Act, there is no doubt about the fact that our teachers and first \nresponders have a critical role in our Nation. From the classroom where \nteachers educate our children to the streets where first responders put \ntheir lives on the line to keep our communities and Nation safe, these \ngreat Americans are so important to the future of this Nation.\n  They and the American people deserve better than a temporary 1-year \nlegislative proposal that does nothing to fix the long-term fiscal \nproblems that led so many States to lay off thousands of teachers and \nfirst responders in the first place.\n  What will we do next year when States come back again asking for more \nFederal money? Will we give out more money and go further in debt? Will \nwe borrow more money? What will we do?\n  As it stands, without any changes, this bill will not solve the \nfiscal problem that will come once the aid ends. But this bill is not \nhopeless. It can be made better. I know it.\n  In my State of West Virginia, we didn't have major layoffs of \nteachers or first responders during this brutal recession. As difficult \nas it was, we balanced our budget based on our values and priorities. \nWe made difficult decisions, but we kept our teachers in the classroom \nand our firefighters protecting our citizens.\n  Make no mistake, we cut back our spending, but we did so responsibly. \nWe spent where it was needed--on our priorities.\n  That is the commonsense approach that works in West Virginia because \nthat is how people run their lives. It is how they operate their small \nbusinesses, and it is how we should run this country.\n  We make budget choices based on what is important in our State, to \nour family, to our business, and to our country.\n  In West Virginia, this simple, commonsense approach paid off. Every \nyear I was Governor, we ended the fiscal year with a surplus. Every \nyear for the past 3 years, West Virginia has seen its credit rating \nupgraded.\n  But now, because of the impact of this recession and the fact that \nother States did not make the difficult decisions years ago, the \ntaxpayers of West Virginia are being expected to foot this bill for \nother States.\n  I believe there is a better way. I believe there is a better way \nwhere we can balance the fiscal constraints that States face with the \nneed to protect these vital jobs.\n  I believe there is a better way we can balance the need to keep \nteachers and firefighters working, while not asking West Virginia \ntaxpayers--or any taxpayer in any State--to pay for more than is \nnecessary.\n  That is why I am offering a commonsense amendment that would \ntransform this $35 billion in funding to keep teachers and first \nresponders working into a loan program instead of a grant.\n  The loan program would allow any State to borrow at very low--or no--\ninterest the money they need to keep teachers and firefighters employed \nand pay it back over time, when this recession basically ends.\n  I don't know of any State that wouldn't put their teachers and \nfirefighters as one of the highest priorities and budget that first.\n  So this loan program would ensure that States are making the \ndecisions on how much money they actually need and not the Federal \nGovernment's willingness to put us further into debt by giving away \nmore money.\n  It would also ensure that States make smarter and more responsible \ndecisions about what they can and cannot afford to do.\n  Such a loan program would help protect these jobs and would protect \nthe fiscal future of States when they get in trouble. In short, it just \nmakes common sense.\n  I encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to embrace this \ncommonsense amendment. I encourage them to help me make it even better.\n  I hope they will support this cloture motion, not because they \nsupport the bill as it stands but because they believe in what this \nlegislation could be if we all put politics aside and work to make it \nbetter.\n  If we can get past a filibuster, I hope the amendment process will be \na testament to the great legislative moments this body has seen in the \npast.\n  As I have been assured by my leadership, this bill, if it gets to the \nfloor, will have an open amendment process that will give us all an \nopportunity to make this legislation better. It is the\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\nreason why I will vote for this motion to move on with debate.\n  To my Republican and Democratic friends who may not support this bill \nas it stands, I respectfully ask them to seize this opportunity to work \ntogether to make this bill better.\n  Trust me, I share many of their concerns. To be clear, if we cannot \nand do not adopt this commonsense approach that stops throwing money at \nthe problems we have in this country, I will join them and vote against \nit.\n  This country is looking to us to do what is right. It is not about \nthis vote or this bill. It is about the fact that so many Americans \nhave lost confidence in this great body. They have lost confidence in \nthe process that they see as broken and incapable of working. They have \nlost confidence in a legislative process that has become so political \nit doesn't matter what we do, it just seems all we care about is \nscoring political points to be used in the next election.\n  It is a fact that some folks in this town are so busy trying to make \nthe other side look bad that they don't realize they are making us all \nlook bad.\n  I don't believe for one minute that anybody in this Chamber--\nDemocratic or Republican--is rooting for our economy to fail or jobs to \nbe lost. We just all have different ideas. While we should question \neach other's ideas and policies, we should never question each other's \nconvictions.\n  Shame on us if the blame game is the best thing we can do. We are \nbetter than that. I came here to fix things, not to play politics. It \nis time for us to stop with the bickering and remember one thing: We \nmay be members of different political parties, but we are all party to \nthis great Nation. We are all Americans.\n  As difficult as it may seem, America and the future of the American \npeople are more important than politics or an election.\n  I ask again, let's work together on commonsense, bipartisan ideas to \nget this country on a responsible financial path that will strengthen \nthe economy and create jobs.\n  Let's work together on making America's future brighter--not just for \nus but for the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Yes.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Manchin that I think \neverybody in this body wants to have real job creation. They want to \nsee this unemployment rate go down. I think most everybody realizes \nthat if we cannot get the unemployment rate to go down, the chances of \npaying off our debt and getting the budget under control will be \nseverely diminished. The Senator has offered some potential amendments \nto S. 1723, as I have--assuming we get cloture on this bill. In a \nprevious life, the Senator from West Virginia was a Governor. When I \nwas in the State legislature, oftentimes, money came to us from the \nFederal Government, and we very much appreciated it. But we took an \nadministrative cost right off the top, as a natural procedure--anywhere \nfrom 3 to a much higher percentage rate than that. Is that something \nthey did in West Virginia? How would the Senator's amendment impact \nthings such as administrative costs and will you be able to get more of \nyour money to the ground out of these dollars?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend that the way the \nsystem is set up and the bill, we are able to use this money where \npossible. An example of where money was used prior--we had two rounds \nof stimulus funding. This is our third. It was for a very worthy cause. \nFor my State and your State, which didn't have the layoff of teachers \nor have the cutbacks in education, they would short that into their \nbudget proposal, so when the Governor made his proposal, that money \nwould backfill. That is how it was used. We only created 33 new jobs \nthat first round, but that was $217 million.\n  The bottom line is--that is why I said we need a loan program. If \nspending money will fix our problems in America, we have no problems. \nWe have to do it wisely. The Senator's amendments are appreciated, and \nI hope to support them.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nmy amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To establish a Federal loan program to carry out the \n                   activities provided under the Act)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                     TITLE IV--FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 401. FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of title I \n     or title II, the President, acting through the appropriate \n     Secretary, shall ensure that any funds provided under this \n     Act shall be used to award loans to States and localities to \n     carry out the activities described in the appropriate title.\n       (b) Amount.--The amount of a loan authorized under \n     subsection (a) shall be based--\n       (1) under title I, on the allocations determined for a \n     State under title I; and\n       (2) under title II, on the grant programs cited under such \n     title.\n       (c) Repayment.--A State or locality shall not be eligible \n     for further assistance under this section during any period \n     in which the State or locality is in arrears with respect to \n     a required repayment of a loan under this section.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a bill that I believe \nand hope----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before my colleague begins, I ask \nunanimous consent to be recognized after Senator Blunt.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the bill I hope we get to tonight is part \nof the President's jobs package. It would repeal an action taken by the \nCongress a few years ago that I think has proven to be a harmful \ndecision on the part of the Federal Government.\n  This would repeal the 3-percent withholding tax, which has a dramatic \nimpact on anybody who does business with the government. That includes \nlocal governments and State governments and anyone who contracts with \nthe government--and the government basically pays 97 percent of the \nbill.\n  The President, rightly, pointed out that one of the things we can do \nto get more money in the economy--and in many cases, simply to create \nprofit where profit is not there otherwise--there are government \nprojects for many businesses, and the profit margin is less than 3 \npercent on big projects. There is only so much work one can do to stay \nin business. If a person is not making money, they cannot stay in the \nbusiness of doing what they are doing. So for those large projects that \nhave a huge overall number, often the profit doesn't even equal the 3-\npercent withholding, and businesses have determined they cannot do \nthat. Obviously, it impacts the bidding process for Federal work.\n  The tax revenue generated by this mandate is thought to be only \naround $200 million a year, and that $200 million left in the economy, \nleft in the bidding process, left in the granting process could make a \nreal difference. The only thing this job-killing tax increase does is \ndelay recovery and stop us from getting on with the business of making \nAmerican private sector job creation a reality.\n\n  The repeal is strongly supported by dozens of groups, including the \nFarm Bureau, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe National League of Cities, the Corn Growers Association, the \nAssociated General Contractors, the American Trucking Association, \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, and the Federation of American \nHospitals.\n  Think about that group, and the fact that you have the Federation of \nAmerican Hospitals, the National League of Cities, and the Corn Growers \nAssociation. This must be a government policy that has broad impact on \nlots of different segments of the economy. It is not all that unusual \nto see the National Manufacturers Association or the Chamber of \nCommerce or the National Federation of Independent Business on a list \nsupporting a bill. But when they are on the list with the other people \nI mentioned, plus the truckers and the Associated Builders and \nContractors, something must be happening.\n  And why have all of these groups come together and said let's support\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nthis part of that package? Medicare payments to hospitals and \nindividual physicians will be affected when this goes into effect in \nJanuary of 2013. Medicare payments to individuals and hospitals will \nhave 3 percent withholding. This causes a lot of cashflow problems for \nboth the physician and for the hospital.\n  Farm payments. Even loan deficiency payments, beginning January 1, \n2013. You get 97 percent of the partial solution to the problem you \nalready have.\n  Grants for for-profit companies, regardless of whether they are State \nor Federal, will have 3 percent withheld. Grants, by their definition, \nare allocated to an entity for a specific purpose, such as research. \nAnd if you have a research budget that is grant dependent, what happens \nif you get 97 percent of the budget? Do you get 97 percent of the \nsolution or does that mean you never get to the full solution? What if \nthe grant is for a facility of some kind or a delivery of a service? \nWhat happens when you can only deliver 97 percent of that? And again, \nback to these big construction projects, where 3 percent withholding \nmay be more than the profit.\n  This is one of the pieces of the President's jobs bill that I and \nothers wish to see become a reality so that people could look out a \nyear from now and not have to begin to plan on what happens when you \nonly get 97 percent of what you expected it would cost to complete a \njob or to complete a project.\n  I believe we are going to be able to vote on this later this evening. \nI think we are going to have that opportunity, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote on it. I think it is one of those things, if we actually let it \noccur in the first of January 2013, people would wonder: Why couldn't \nthey figure out during the interim period of time when this was passed \nand was going to go into effect that no matter what the intention was \nthis will not work? In a bipartisan way, we should step forward and \nclarify this problem before it becomes a real problem with real \nconsequences and, in fact, probably already having an impact on \nbidding, on requesting grants, and on other things. People are probably \nalready beginning to think about what happens if this project is agreed \nto or approved or our bid is accepted for work that would be done \nbeyond 2012.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is not here, and until he gets back, \nseeing no one else on the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are two amendments that are likely \nto be called this evening, and I want to address them briefly because I \nbelieve both these amendments should be carefully scrutinized.\n  One amendment is by Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire. What she would \ndo in her amendment is restrict the authority of the President of the \nUnited States to refer suspected terrorists to our criminal justice \nsystem to be investigated, prosecuted, and tried. She would make it \nmandatory those terrorists--particularly associated with al-Qaida--\nwould be tried before military commissions and tribunals.\n  I listened as she and Senator McConnell came to the floor to explain \ntheir point of view. It is an interesting point of view, that we are at \nwar with al-Qaida and, therefore, any trials of suspected terrorists \nassociated with them should be before a military tribunal. \nUnfortunately, the logic of their argument falls flat when you look at \nreality. Here is the reality.\n  Since September 11, 10 years ago, President Bush and President Obama \nhave faced time and time again allegations that individuals are \nsuspected terrorists. Each President--Bush and Obama--has had to \nconsult with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and other \nleaders in their administration to determine the appropriate place to \ninvestigate and try these cases.\n  Here is the record. Since 9/11, the Department of Justice advises us \nthat on as many as 300 separate occasions--300--these suspected \nterrorists have been taken to the article III criminal courts of \nAmerica and successfully tried and prosecuted. In that same period of \ntime, exactly three suspected terrorists have been sent to military \ncommissions and tribunals.\n  For the Senator from New Hampshire to now argue that all cases have \nto go to military commissions is to ignore the obvious. The President, \nas our Commander in Chief, with the premier responsibility to keep \nAmerica safe, should decide the best place to try those who are \naccused. This has been a recurring theme on the Republican side--to \ntake the terrorist cases out of our criminal courts. In fact, almost on \na weekly basis Senator McConnell has come to the floor making this \nargument.\n  The argument goes something like this: Do you mean to tell me we are \ngoing to take a suspected terrorist in and read them their Miranda \nrights; that they have the right to remain silent? You know what is \ngoing to happen. They will lawyer up and shut up and we won't get the \ninformation we need to keep America safe. That is why, he has argued \ntime and time again, we shouldn't allow the FBI to be involved and we \nshouldn't refer these cases to article III criminal courts. And that is \nwhy Senator Ayotte is offering her amendment this evening.\n  The fact is that argument isn't borne out by the facts. Look what \nhappened 2 weeks ago. Remember the underwear bomber--the somewhat \ncrazed individual--maybe crazed--who got on an airplane and was \napprehended over Detroit with the argument that his clothing was on \nfire, and when they apprehended him and took him in, the FBI asked him \nquestions? He answered questions for some period of time and at that \npoint stopped talking.\n  The scenario at that point would have ended, according to Senator \nMcConnell. He lawyered up and shut up. But it didn't end.\n  The FBI continued the investigation. They went overseas and brought \nthis man's mother and father to the United States and they sat down and \ntalked to him. After they talked to him, he said he would cooperate \nfully with the FBI. He talked for day after day after day, telling them \nall the information about al-Qaida. Then his case was referred to a \ncriminal court in Detroit, and 2 weeks ago he pled guilty.\n  If you follow the logic that has been given to us by Senator Ayotte \nand Senator McConnell, this never would have happened. The fact is, it \ndid. The FBI did its job, the Department of Justice did its job. The \nman was prosecuted in our criminal courts; he pled guilty; he is likely \nto be sentenced in January to life in prison. It is because the \nPresident had the authority, as Commander in Chief, to pick the forum \nto try the individual. He picked the most effective forum, and when he \ndid, we ended up in a situation where this man pled guilty and is going \nto be sentenced. It isn't an isolated case. In fact, it is the \noverwhelming likelihood that when a person is suspected of terrorism, \nthey are more likely to be successfully prosecuted in one of our \narticle III courts.\n  I note today that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Levin of Michigan, pointed out on the Senate floor that when \nSenator Ayotte raised this issue in the Armed Services Committee markup \non the Defense authorization bill, her amendment was defeated on a \nbipartisan rollcall. Six Republicans voted against her, including \nSenator McCain, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and \nSenator Graham, the only military lawyer serving in the Senate. But the \namendment will still come to the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues, whatever they think of President Obama--and I \nrespect him very much. Whatever they think of him, do not tie the hands \nof any President when it comes to picking the proper forum to try a \nterrorist. If the proper forum is a military commission and tribunal, I \nwill back the President. If the proper forum is an article III criminal \ncourt, let's proceed that way as well.\n  The evidence overwhelmingly tells us that going through our criminal \ncourt system, terrorists pay a price--a heavy price--with up to 300 \nconvictions since 9/11 and more than 100 convicted since President \nObama took office. Let's respect the President's authority. Let's do \nthe best thing to secure our Nation.\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nLet's not let the Senate presume to know exactly where every suspected \nterrorist defendant is to be tried.\n  Mr. President, there is also another amendment that is likely to be \nconsidered this evening, and that I wish to speak to. Senator Stabenow \nof Michigan, as chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee, has a \nspecial responsibility when it comes to nutrition programs and \nespecially the program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, the SNAP program, which is known to most Americans as the Food \nStamp Program.\n  Senator Sessions has introduced an amendment that would eliminate the \nuse of what is known as categorical eligibility for people to qualify \nfor the SNAP program. Forty States use it. What they basically say is \nif you are eligible for some other programs, then we believe, in \nestablishing that eligibility, you are also eligible for the SNAP \nprogram. It turns out that only 1 percent of SNAP households have net \nincomes over 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Federal \npoverty level, incidentally, is $22,350 per family of four. So when \nthese people are judged to be part of a program, such as Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, LIHEAP, Low Income Heating and \nEnergy Assistance Program, and the Social Security disability benefit \nprogram, they are eligible then for the SNAP program, the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  The Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, would change that. What \nhe would add to it is a new redtape requirement that these people, who \nare by and large some of the poorest people in America, will now have \nto go through another bureaucratic process and fill out another \napplication. I don't think that is necessary, and I am urging my \ncolleagues not to support Senator Sessions' amendment.\n  He recently said on the floor something I want to point out. He said: \nNo program in our government has surged out of control more \ndramatically than food stamps. Then he went on to say: We need people \nworking with jobs, not receiving food stamps.\n  I will readily concede to the Senator from Alabama that the number of \nhungry Americans has increased. It is not only evident in the Food \nStamp Program; it is evident at the food pantries, at the breakfast and \nlunch and dinner feeding programs that are available across Illinois \nand across America. I have been there and I have watched who comes \nthrough the door, and I want to tell you it is a heartbreak for them \nand for me to watch. Many of these people have never in their lives \nasked for anything, and now they have no choice. And many, to the \nsurprise, I think, of many Senators, are actually working. But they \nmake so little money that they have to go in and ask for help.\n  I agree, we need to put Americans back to work in good-paying jobs. \nThe Senator from Alabama and others will have the chance to vote for \npart of President Obama's jobs program this evening. The fact is, 14 \nmillion Americans are currently unemployed, another 10 million \nunderemployed, and these feeding programs are essential for them to \nkeep their families together.\n  The Senator from Alabama points out one example to give a reason why \nwe need to change the law across America. He talks about a case where \nsomeone actually won the lottery and then went on to get food stamps. \nThat case got a lot of media attention, but the fact is it was highly \nunusual. If the Senator from Alabama wants to ensure that people who \nwin the lottery and a windfall of income are not eligible for SNAP, I \nwill be glad to work with him. Let's get that job done. But this \namendment is not that legislation. That single, highly unusual \nsituation doesn't merit kicking people who are out of work or in a low-\nincome job out of a program that feeds their families. To impose that \nnew obligation, new paperwork, new redtape obligation on families who \nare struggling because one person abused the system I think goes too \nfar.\n  SNAP, in fact, has one of the lowest error rates of all Federal \nprograms. The U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows us that over 98 \npercent of those receiving SNAP benefits are eligible, and over 95 \npercent of payments are accurate. The system has good quality controls, \nand I will work with the Senator from Alabama and any other Senator to \nmake them even better.\n  The problem isn't food stamps in America. The problem is hunger in \nAmerica. Let's address the hunger problem and put people back to work. \nWe will have less demand for food stamps and food pantries.\n  I think what we face in this country is serious. I know it is in my \nState. In Senator Sessions' home State of Alabama, 17.3 percent of \nresidents live in poverty and the same percent live in households that \nhave food insecurity. Sadly, children are disproportionately impacted \nwith hunger. In Senator Sessions' home State, it is over one out of \nfour kids who is in a situation with food deficiencies. And 873,174 \npeople in Alabama rely on food stamps, the SNAP program. Are we going \nto make their life more difficult because one person who won the \nlottery abused the system? I think that goes too far.\n  I hope we can work together to make this a better program. For those \nwho are angry about food stamps or angry about food pantries, direct \nyour anger toward hunger, toward unemployment. That is what is driving \nup the numbers in this system. We can work together to make it a better \nsystem. But the approach being suggested by the Senator from Alabama \nwill just add redtape, paperwork, and unnecessary hardship to a lot of \npeople who are already struggling.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader for his comments. And I will disagree, but I think we \ncould agree, because my proposal is not to cut off anybody who ought to \nreceive food stamps. My proposal wouldn't cut off any benefits to \nanybody who deserves food stamps. My proposal would not cut off anybody \nwho qualifies for food stamps. It would say that just because you \ncomplied with the requirement for TANF or you complied with the \nrequirement for LIHEAP or you sought assistance for some family \nplanning issue, that those don't automatically qualify you. I don't \nthink it is too much to ask someone who would be given thousands of \ndollars over a period of time in food stamps to fill out a form. That \nform would say what your income is and what your assets are. And if you \nhave substantial assets that are higher than the food stamp law allows, \nyou should not get it.\n  So I don't believe this proposal does anything but help tighten up \nthe act. I don't believe it is too much to ask that somebody fill out a \nform to demonstrate they are qualified before they receive free money \nfrom the U.S. Government for the purchase of food, and certainly I \nwould emphasize that dramatically.\n  I don't think the Senator disagrees that any program in the U.S. \nGovernment of any real size has surged faster than this program has. It \nhas gone up, since 2010, $20 billion. In 2009 or so, unemployment hit \n9.8 percent. It is now 9.1. It is too high, and people need food stamps \nand they should get them. And perhaps there are more people out there \nwho qualify even than in 2009, or whenever our unemployment hit almost \n10 percent. Maybe there are more people today. I don't know. But I \ndon't think there are huge numbers more. You go from $59 billion to $79 \nbillion, that is about a 38- or 40-percent increase in 2 years in this \nprogram. One of the reasons is we have made people automatically \neligible.\n  So if you are eligible for any of these programs, you have received \nany assistance, you may not have even filled out a form that has \nanything like the same qualifications that the Food Stamp Act requires, \nyou are automatically, categorically, qualified.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says if this change in the law that \nhappened recently were to be eliminated, it would save $10 billion over \n10 years. It would not reduce food stamps; it would just reduce a \nlittle bit the growth in food stamps. The $10 billion over 10 years \nrepresents $1 billion a year in the first year. It would be less than \nthat, according to the score we have seen. But let's say in the first \nyear that this program reduced spending by $1 billion, that is $1 \nbillion out of the proposed $79 billion. So we are expecting to spend \n$79 billion this year, and we would only\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nspend $78 billion. But that adds up over time. And food stamps need to \nbe looked at across the board much more carefully, because we don't \nhave that many more people who are in poverty today than we have had. \nBut we have many more people receiving food stamps.\n  I would stress that this year's increase in food stamps by another 14 \npercent is not an acceptable figure, because we know that there are \nproblems within the program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say one thing briefly about Senator Ayotte's \nproposal on terrorism prosecution. As a Federal prosecutor for almost \n15 years, I truly believe she is correct on this issue. It is something \nwe have been debating in Congress for a long time. Congress has made \nclear its view about it.\n  I would simply say this. The Presiding Officer is a former Attorney \nGeneral. But if you make the presumption that an individual who is \narrested is to be tried in article III courts, even though they are an \nenemy combatant against the United States, against the laws of war, an \nunlawful enemy combatant, those individuals should be treated as \nwarriors and they should be treated as enemies of the country, and they \nshould be arrested and detained, and presumptively in military custody. \nThis is the tradition of the United States from its founding. This is \nworldwide accepted law. And I do believe we need to understand the \nreason this is important.\n  An individual who is arrested attacking the United States and who is \ngoing to be tried in a Federal court must be given Miranda warnings \nbefore they are interrogated, must be provided a lawyer, must be \npromptly taken before a U.S. magistrate, must be provided discovery in \nthe government's case, and must have a public hearing. You don't do \nthat for people who are at war with you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have heard it argued on the floor here in connection \nwith this issue that somehow because the Christmas Day bomber pleaded \nguilty in an article III court, that was an argument for putting him in \nthe article III court. As a distinguished former prosecutor, I wonder \nif my friend from Alabama could address the issue of whether because \nsomebody happened to end up in an article III court and happened to \nplead guilty, how that was an argument for his placement there in the \nfirst place.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a very important question. This individual \nperhaps looks like he just fell off a turnip truck or something. He was \nnot a very solid person and he decided to plead guilty, and that was \ngood.\n  Many of these individuals are very tough, very clever, very devious. \nThey have, we know for a fact, used the civil justice system to find \ndiscovery against us, how we discover their activities, what kind of \nsurveillance techniques we use, and made the trials dangerous places \nand have made the trials showcases. So I think that just because one \nindividual decided to plead guilty, it has no bearing on the overall \nprinciple that if you arrest people on the battlefield, they are not \nrequired to be taken immediately to a judge and given a lawyer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend further yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have heard it said on the floor that because a \nnumber of terrorists have been tried in article III courts in the \npast--and I have heard people add up the number of times--that is \nsomehow an argument for continuing to do it.\n  Is it not the case, I ask my friend from Alabama, that we just set up \nthese military commissions a few years ago at the insistence of the \nSupreme Court in order to deal with this issue, and only since that \ntime have we had a defined alternative for dealing with these enemy \ncombatants who are also not citizens of the United States?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is so correct. We went through a number of \nactions. The Supreme Court found the law inadequate, and Congress \nresponded to the Supreme Court's concerns and passed clear laws that \nare certainly adequate within the Constitution as described by the \nSupreme Court. We now have an entire system set up to meet the Supreme \nCourt's concerns about the trial of these individuals. It is safe. It \nis secure. It is consistent with Supreme Court requirements and \ninternational law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend, is it not also the case that the \namendment of Senator Ayotte has in it a national security waiver? I \nhave heard it said that we have eliminated all the President's options. \nIs it not the case that even if the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire were adopted and the President felt strongly, for some \nreason--it's hard for me to contemplate such a set of circumstances, \nbut it is possible--he could, in fact, issue a national security waiver \nand go ahead and do it anyway, could he not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely correct. I think Senator Ayotte really \nreached out to Members of this Senate to make sure they knew there was \nan option to do it another way, and it does provide the President that \noption.\n  With regard to the FBI and their involvement, they are a great \ninvestigative agency. If they participate in the arrest of one of these \nindividuals and they were turned over to the military, the FBI can \nstill work with the military to investigate the case. It would just be \ntried under military commissions according to the lawful system \nCongress, in a bipartisan way, passed several years ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have also heard it said--I am going to pose another \nquestion to my friend--that it is kind of ludicrous to assume this \nultimately leads to reading Miranda rights to a foreign terrorist on \nforeign soil. I think it strikes the Senator from Kentucky that that \nmight be the logical extension of where we are going. If, in fact, we \nare saying that, routinely, foreigners, enemy combatants are going to \nbe mainstreamed into article III courts, when do these protections, if \nyou will, we afford to American citizens under the Constitution attach?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a very good question. Under the law of the \nUnited States, if you are to interrogate an individual who has been \ntaken into custody, the police have to give them Miranda rights before \nthey interrogate them. As long as that person is in custody, if you are \ngoing to try them in a civilian court--and Director Mueller of the FBI, \nin response to questions I asked him, acknowledged that if you are \ngoing to try the person in the civilian courts and you conduct \ninterrogation, you must give them Miranda warnings.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So would it not be the case, then, that all of these \nissues in terms of the timing of the attachment of these rights would \nsoon be before courts in the United States for interpretation--\nultimately, I guess, by the Supreme Court--as to at what point do these \nrights now afforded a foreign enemy combatant attach?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There have been suggestions that somehow the terrorist \ncases would allow the interrogation to go on a few hours, but I have \nnot seen any real authority that would justify that. The clear Miranda \nstandard for any police officer in America is that if you arrest \nsomeone, before you ask them questions, they must have been given their \nMiranda rights. That is the rule in the trial of any Federal court. I \nthink it would be very dangerous to assume the court is going to give \nsome extraordinary new rights that they have never indicated they \nwould.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator, the Republican leader, for his \ngood questions.\n  I would just say I think Senator Ayotte has worked very hard on this \namendment. She herself is a skilled prosecutor. I believe the \nlegislation would be helpful to us.\n  I will just say that as a matter of policy, you can be absolutely \nsure it will be more difficult to prosecute a case, more likely to \ncomplicate matters significantly, if they are given Miranda warnings, \nif they are given lawyers, if they are brought publicly before a \njudge--perhaps revealing to the other coconspirators the fact that you \nhave been arrested before they can be apprehended. It would cause many \nmore difficulties than are necessary.\n  Of all people we ought not to give extra rights to, it would be \nterrorists bent on killing and maiming innocent Americans.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the minority leader wish to speak? I will yield to \nhim if he does. No.\n  Mr. President, I am going to respond very briefly. This argument is \nso upside-down. If during the last 10 years we had successfully \nprosecuted terrorists--300 of them--in military commissions and only 3 \nin our criminal courts, then all of their arguments would make sense \nbecause you would have to argue that is the best place to go, that is \nwhere you can investigate and prosecute and successfully incarcerate \nthose accused of terrorism. Exactly the opposite is true.\n  President Bush and President Obama, given the authority to choose a \nforum to try a suspected terrorist, have overwhelmingly and \nsuccessfully chosen the article III criminal courts of America. Here is \nthe score. They don't like to hear me say this, but I am going to give \nthem the score again. It is important to know. Since 9/11, we are told \nby the Department of Justice, as many as 300 suspected terrorists have \nbeen successfully prosecuted in our criminal courts and 3 before \nmilitary commissions, 2 of whom--before the military commissions--were \nreleased within a year to return to their home countries of Australia \nand Yemen. When you look at where terrorists are in jail in America \ntoday, you will find 300 to 1 they were terrorists who were prosecuted \nin our criminal courts.\n  In comes the Ayotte amendment and the arguments by Senator McConnell \nand Senator Sessions to argue that clearly this system is upside-down, \nthat we should be going to the military commissions, not to the \ncriminal courts. Their argument is, incidentally, Miranda warnings--\nwhen you give an alleged defendant, a suspected criminal defendant, \nMiranda warnings, end of story, they stop cooperating. The problem they \nhave is the facts, and the facts are that all 300 prosecuted terrorists \nin article III courts were given their Miranda warnings, the \ninvestigation continued, and the prosecution continued successfully. It \ndid not end the case.\n\n  They do not like to talk about the details about this Christmas \nbomber, the Underwear Bomber. He was read his Miranda rights, and he \nshut up. Then the FBI brought in his mother and father, who said, ``Why \ndon't you cooperate?''According to the head of the FBI, the Director of \nthe FBI, he talked nonstop for days about everything he knew about al-\nQaida. He did it after he was read his Miranda rights. Then he was off \nto court, where he is going to defend himself in this criminal case, \nand he pled guilty.\n  I have heard the Senators on the floor dismiss this--well, he pled \nguilty, so they didn't really prosecute him. They prepared the case--a \ncase he knew he couldn't win. He fully cooperated with the \ninvestigation, and he conceded that he was guilty. Now he faces a life \nsentence in prison.\n  Is that a good outcome? It is the best outcome, and I will tell you \nwhy because they will not acknowledge this fact, and they should. All \nacross the world, when they look at the way we prosecute terrorists in \nthe United States, they have to say: You know, they are following the \nsame rules and laws for alleged terrorists as they are following for \nanyone accused of crime in their country, and it is public, and he had \nan opportunity for a lawyer, and he was given the same warnings as any \nprospective criminal defendant.\n  You can't argue that this was done behind closed doors or done any \ndifferently from any other criminal defendant. There is something to be \nsaid for that. It is a bragging right, or at least something we should \nbe proud of, that in the United States we use that system and use it so \nsuccessfully.\n  For those who want to pass the Ayotte amendment and make it more \ndifficult for any President to decide the appropriate forum to \nprosecuter terrorists, I just leave them one last reminder: The score \nis 300 to 3 since 9/11, 300 suspected terrorists successfully \nprosecuted in our criminal courts, 3 before military commissions.\n  Give this President, give every President the tools and the authority \nto make the right decision to keep America safe. Defeat the Ayotte \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am just going to make one final point \non this issue, and then I want to address another amendment we will be \nvoting on at some point.\n  One thing we have not discussed is what happens if the foreign enemy \ncombatant in the article III court in the United States is actually \nacquitted. If he is, he, of course, has to be released. The deportation \noption is only available if some other country is willing to take him. \nThere is not a whole lot of clamoring for these kinds of folks anywhere \nelse in the world. We have had that experience. The courts then cannot \nkeep them. They are released into the United States as a result of an \nacquittal in an article III court in the United States, and there is a \nsituation where you cannot deport them because no one will take them.\n  I think the point is that this is all totally unnecessary. These are \nforeigners; these are not citizens of the United States. They have no \nright to be in an article III court. We don't dispute that the \nPresident can put them in an article III court, but why would he want \nto do that? We responded to the decision of the Supreme Court to set up \nthese military commissions for this precise purpose, and it is clear \nthis administration does not want to use them.\n  I also would like to make some brief comments about a matter we will \nbe voting on later this evening. Everybody here in this body knows the \nAmerican people want us to do something about the jobs crisis. What \nRepublicans have been saying is that raising taxes on business owners \nis not the way to do it. So what we have done is we have combed through \nthe President's latest stimulus bill looking for things we can actually \nsupport, for things that do not punish the very people we are counting \non to create jobs. In other words, since the President never asked if \nthere was anything in this legislation we could support, we have \nactually done it ourselves.\n  It turns out there is a very sensible provision in the President's \nsecond stimulus bill that would help businesses across the country. In \nfact, it is absolutely identical to a bill Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts introduced with 30 cosponsors earlier this year, many of \nthem Democrats, among them Senators Franken, Begich, Klobuchar, Pryor, \nTester, and McCaskill. They are all cosponsors of Senator Scott Brown's \nbill.\n  What this bill does is it repeals an existing requirement that \ngovernment agencies at the State, local, and Federal level withhold 3 \npercent of every payment to any contractor with whom they do business. \nThis is money contractors may very well end up getting back from the \nIRS at some point long after the job is done, but in the meantime the \ngovernment gets to hold on to it instead of allowing the businesses to \ninvest it in jobs and the economy. This is money these companies could \nbe putting toward hiring workers and growing their businesses, but it \nis going to the IRS instead, basically as a zero-interest loan to the \nFederal Government here in Washington.\n  I know Members on both sides of the aisle are hearing from \nconstituents about how burdensome this regulation is. That is why \nPresident Obama himself already embraced delaying its implementation in \nhis first stimulus bill and proposed delaying it again in his latest \nstimulus bill. That is why Senator Scott Brown got so many Democratic \nsponsors when he proposed a full repeal.\n  Like the President's bill, this bill is fully offset, and the offset \nwe are proposing has been supported by our friends across the aisle. In \nfact, the last time I saw a vote, I think 81 Senators actually voted \nfor it. So the bill we are proposing is bipartisan. The offset we are \nproposing is bipartisan. There is no reason in the world that our \nDemocratic friends, including the President, certainly, should oppose \nit. If delaying this legislation was a good idea before, repealing it \nshould be an even better idea now. The bill is supported by hundreds of \nbusiness groups representing job creators across America. We should \ncome together and act right now and make it easier for them to create \njobs for a change, and not harder.\n\n  The President asked us to come together and pass pieces of this bill. \nHere\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nis one that all Senators should be able to agree on. Let's vote on it \nand prove the skeptics wrong by acting in a bipartisan fashion on \nsomething that the job creators in this country actually want.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the provision my friend talks about is \nplaced in legislation as a result of the study made during the Bush \nadministration--second Bush administration. GAO did a study. They found \nthat 33,000 contractors, in effect, cheated on their taxes, and they \nowed some $3 billion. This money, they also determined, went mostly to \ngiving the owners more salary and building them second and third homes.\n  There is no question that a lot of people, in addition to the 33,000 \nwho cheated, were found to be burdened by this withholding 3 percent of \nwhat they had coming to them. What my friend fails to acknowledge is \nthis bill that was amended that my friend has before the Senate has no \nchance of accomplishing anything. Constitutionally it will be killed in \nthe House in a matter of a millisecond because constitutionally it will \nbe what we call blue slipped here. It is a revenue measure. It cannot \nstart in the Senate.\n  It costs $11.6 billion to take this money out--I am sorry--take that \n3-percent provision out, and we need to do that. It costs $11.6 \nbillion. What my friend fails to alert the Senators to is that since \nthis matter has come up in years past and months past, things have \nchanged. We have burdened the American people--especially the American \nmiddle class--with all of these cuts we have made. We did them. It was \ndone by Democrats and Republicans, but they have given enough.\n  My friend's bill is offset by reducing discretionary spending by $30 \nbillion. Senator McConnell's bill does nothing to address contractors \nwho cheat on their taxes and still get Federal contracts. Nothing, \nzero.\n  Our alternative--and I will offer a unanimous consent request of this \nat a later time before we get to these two cloture motions we have. It \nrepeals the 3-percent withholding tax, and we acknowledge it should do \nthat. The Democratic alternative also addresses the problem of tax \nevaders receiving government contracts by expressly prohibiting \ncontractors who are delinquent on their taxes being eligible for \nFederal contracts. That way all contractors are not punished, only \nthose who are, in effect, cheating.\n  The Democratic alternative offsets the costs of repealing the \nwithholding requirement by closing the loophole that allows companies \nto claim excess foreign tax credits and the famous corporate jet \npreference. It has a 1-year delay in implementing worldwide interest \nallocation which allows taxpayers to claim greater tax credits for the \nforeign taxes they pay; fair, reasonable, not a burden on the middle \nclass.\n  A vote for Senator McConnell's amendment would do nothing to repeal \nthe withholding requirement because the House, I repeat, will blue slip \nthis. The House will send us a repeal bill. They told us, the \nRepublican leadership, soon, and I mean soon rather within a matter of \nweeks. We will have a real opportunity to repeal the withholding \nrequirement when we get the House bill. We would, of course, put our \namendment on that.\n  Let's be honest about this. This is nothing more than a misdirected \nstunt by my friend, the Republican leader. This provision will be \nrepealed, but it should be done the right way. We all agree that it is \nunfortunate that the Bush administration did that. They had a good \nintent. They were trying to get rid of some people who were cheating, \nbut it was too broad and overreaching and has hurt a lot of people. \nThat GAO report said 33,000 people, civilian contractors, owed more \nthan $3 billion. I repeat, that 2005 GAO report said $3 billion in \ntaxes. I didn't make this up. The GAO report also found that these \nfirms, many of them diverted these payroll taxes to increase an owner's \nsalary or building him a new home or two.\n  So by withholding a small amount of a contractor's payment and \nsending it to the IRS, the belief was that the contractors would have \nmore motivation to comply with the law. It didn't work well. It was too \noverreaching and too broad.\n  I would hope that we would look at the consent I will offer. \nProcedurally there is no way we can have a second-degree or side by \nside with what we are doing here. I would hope my friends, Democrats \nand Republicans, would do something that is real, not something that is \nonly figurative. What we are doing is real. We agree it should be done. \nIt should be done right. It should not be done by burdening the middle \nclass with more domestic discretionary cuts.\n  I will say this generally. Here it is 9:30 at night. The decision is \ngoing to have to be made very quickly as to whether we will be here \ntomorrow. The two matters that the Republican leader and I have spoken \nabout, we could vote on those right now. I offered to vote on those \nearlier today, but we were unable to do that. We can come tomorrow. It \nis getting late here, and I am not sure what we are accomplishing by \ntrying to work through all of this tonight. We are trying to be \nreasonable. As I indicated, my friend the Republican leader said he \nneeded 10 or 12 votes. We agreed to that a long time ago. I cannot \nimagine why we cannot move forward.\n  I repeat, we cannot be stalled so we come back with a very short work \nperiod. We have a continuing resolution and many other things to deal \nwith when we come back with the short work period. I wish to do another \nappropriations bill, but we cannot do another appropriations bill while \nthis one is still floundering here.\n  This was an experiment that I was happy to engage myself in because I \nbelieve we should try to do our work here. But this CR business and \nholding us up from doing the work we have done for 10 months this year \nwas not our doing. This has been as a result of my friends who are the \nmajority in the House and the minority over here. So we have spent all \nof these months on two major issues, CRs and raising the debt ceiling. \nI would hope we can work something out on this appropriations bill and \nget it done tonight.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would ask my friend, did you propound \na consent agreement?\n  Mr. REID. No. What I said I would do is when we get ready to schedule \nthese votes, I will do it. I will make sure you are here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Fair enough. I want to echo the comments of the \nmajority leader. In my time in the Senate some of our best work has \nbeen done on Thursday night. Usually when we are passing bills around \nhere, we are working on Thursdays into the evening and finishing them. \nIt is my hope that we will continue on that path and finish this bill \ntonight. Frequently coming back on Friday is counterproductive, and I \nwould encourage all of the Members to cooperate to the greatest extent \npossible. I think we were, the last time I checked, making progress \ntoward getting a lot of amendments in the queue hopefully to be voted \non tonight.\n\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 771\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I rise in support of amendment No. 771 sponsored \nby Senator Bingaman. It will strengthen our Nation's competitiveness. \nAs I heard the majority leader and the Republican leader talk about job \ncreation, this will matter, strengthening our Nation's competitiveness \nby ensuring we enforce trade laws better than we have.\n  American workers, American farmers can compete with anyone. We can \ncompete on productivity, we can compete on skills. When workers are \nforced to compete against unfair export subsidy, that is cheating, as \nwe showed on the China currency bill, which passed with 63 votes--a \ngood, strong bipartisan effort. We cannot compete against unfair export \nsubsidies. Our workers cannot compete against that kind of cheating.\n  Fortunately, we have tools to do something about that. Our trade laws \nare the last line of defense to retain and create jobs in American \nindustries. Paper, steel, tires--President Obama\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nhas actually enforced trade laws in those three industries which \ndirectly created jobs in Finley, OH, in Lorain, OH, in Youngstown, OH, \nincluding the construction of a new steel mill.\n  Our trade laws are critical if we are going to compete for advance \nmanufacturing jobs. Jobs in solar, wind, and clean energy component \nmanufacturing in the auto supply chain all rely--or should rely--on an \nactive U.S. Trade Representative who will initiate more cases.\n  I proposed an amendment to this appropriations bill, No. 865, that \nwould provide the office of the U.S. Trade Representative an additional \n$5 million to initiate cases on China's subsidies to solar producers \nand China's hoarding of rare earth materials, an increasingly important \nproblem that is eroding American manufacturing.\n  I support Senator Bingaman's amendment, which provides funds for \ngeneral trade enforcement. But here is why I wanted to specify solar \nand rare earths in my amendment. According to the U.S. International \nTrade Commission, our solar producers, like those in Toledo--and there \nare three of them--are facing an expected 240-percent increase in the \nimport of Chinese solar panels this year. Yesterday a number of solar \ncompanies filed a complaint with the Commerce Department and the ITC, \nasking them to seek duties on Chinese solar panels sold below cost. \nUnderstand, the Chinese sell these into our market as they sold coated \npaper, as they sold tires, as they sold oil country tubular steel. They \noften undercut our prices because they are subsidizing energy and water \nand capital and land and, of course, the currency subsidy, which this \nbody spoke about and voted on a couple of weeks ago.\n  On rare earths, China is artificially using export restraints or \nquotas to raise the cost of rare earths internationally while keeping \nthem low domestically so producers in Ohio and the Presiding Officer's \nhome State of Delaware simply cannot compete because of how they are \nsubsidizing their production.\n  Ohio companies such as Electrodyne in Cincinnati saw their costs go \nup 59 percent in June and 68 percent in July of this year alone on \naccount of these price changes. How can we possibly compete when they \nare cheating that dramatically and to that degree? These policies have \nfundamentally turned rare earths into a spot price market. I want to \nsee the USTR litigate on these protectionist policies. This is not \nAmerican protectionism. This is our serving our own interest as a \nnation against answering the protectionism they have exhibited.\n  Every country in the world practices trade according to their \nnational interest. Too often in the United States we practice trade \naccording to a college economics textbook that is 20 years out of \nprint. These two enforcement initiatives, critical to my State and many \nothers of my colleagues here, will absolutely matter. This amendment \nwill ensure that USTR has the resources to investigate and to act on \nblatant, unfair trade practices. Trade enforcement is critical if we \nare going to compete for advanced manufacturing jobs and so many other \nindustries that are in our States.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I applaud Senator \nBingaman for his leadership on amendment No. 771.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation \nto the following amendments and motions: Landrieu No. 781, as modified \nwith the changes that are at the desk; Kohl No. 755; Vitter No. 917 to \nMenendez No. 857; Menendez No. 857; Gillibrand No. 869; Lautenberg No. \n836; Bingaman No. 771, as modified; Sessions No. 810; Coburn No. 791; \nCoburn No. 792; Coburn No. 796; Coburn No. 800; Paul No. 821; Portman \nNo. 859; McCain No. 892; Cantwell No. 893, as modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk; Cochran No. 805, as modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk; Burr No. 890; DeMint No. 763; Inouye No. 918; \nAyotte No. 753; Crapo No. 814; Kyl, as modified with the changes that \nare at the desk; and Lee motion to recommit; that there be no \namendments or points of order in order against any of the amendments \nprior to the votes other than budget points of order; that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote; that the \nVitter, Menendez, Sessions, Paul, Ayotte, Crapo, and the Coburn \namendments Nos. 792 and 796 be subject to a 60-affirmative vote \nthreshold; that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; that upon \ndisposition of these amendments, the remaining pending Coburn \namendments be withdrawn with the exception of amendment No. 801; that \nno other motions or amendments be in order to the bill, the Senate \nproceed to the cloture vote on the substitute amendment No. 738, as \namended; that if cloture is invoked, the substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to and be considered original text for the purposes \nof further amendment; that the majority leader then be recognized to \nraise points of order against any pending nongermane amendments; \nfurther, if cloture is invoked, the Senate resume consideration of the \nbill at 4 p.m., Monday, October 31, and proceed to votes in relation to \nany remaining germane pending amendments in the order they were \noffered; further, that upon disposition of any pending germane \namendments, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or \ndebate; that when the Senate receives a message from the House with \nrespect to H.R. 2112, the Senate insist on its amendment, request, or \nagree to, a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the \ntwo Houses; and the Chair be authorized to appoint the following \nconferees: Kohl, Harkin, Feinstein, Johnson of South Dakota, Nelson of \nNebraska, Pryor, Brown of Ohio, Inouye, Murray, Mikulski, Blunt, \nCochran, McConnell, Collins, Moran, Hoeven, Hutchison, and Shelby; \nfinally, that if cloture is not invoked on the substitute amendment No. \n738, as amended, cloture on the underlying bill be vitiated and the \nbill be returned to the calendar in status quo. I failed, Mr. \nPresident, to identify the Kyl amendment. It is No. 912.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the leader's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all of these amendments that are \npending, there is no requirement that we have to have rollcall votes. \nEveryone should understand that.\n  Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on a bill introduced by \nmy friend, the Republican leader.\n  While I have great respect for my friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, I believe in this case he is playing political games.\n  The Republican leader has inserted a poison pill for Democrats into \nhis proposal.\n  To offset the $11 billion cost of his legislation, the Republican \nleader proposes we slash $30 billion in programs that help the middle \nclass and get our economy back on track.\n  What is more, this is a backdoor violation of the debt ceiling \nagreement we reached after months of negotiation this summer.\n  This is not a serious attempt to repeal the rule requiring the \ngovernment to withhold 3 percent from all government contractors. It is \nan attempt to circumvent the rules.\n  And even if we passed the Republican leader's bill tonight, the House \nwill not act on it. Revenue bills like this one must originate in the \nHouse, a prerogative that body guards jealously.\n  So our action on this bill this evening is nothing more than a \nmisdirected stunt by Republican leadership.\n  But let me be clear: this provision will be repealed before it takes \neffect.\n  The Senate will have a real opportunity to repeal this provision, \nwhen the House sends us a bill that repeals the 3-percent withholding \nthe week we return from the in-State work period.\n  In 2 short weeks, we will have an opportunity to work together on a \ncommonsense way to both repeal the withholding requirement and address \nthe underlying problem it was enacted to address.\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\n  It is important to review the history of this proposal to understand \nwhy we are in this situation today, and how to move forward.\n  A 2005 GAO report found that 33,000 civilian contractors owed more \nthan $3 billion in taxes. The GAO report also found that some of these \nfirms diverted payroll taxes to increasing the owner's salary or build \nhim a new house.\n  By withholding a small amount from a contractor's payment and sending \nit along to the IRS, the belief was that contractors would have more \nmotivation to comply with the tax law.\n  The withholding requirement was enacted with overwhelming Republican \nsupport. Only a couple of Democrats supported the legislation.\n  But this withholding has turned out to be more trouble than it is \nworth for a number of reasons, and now many on both sides feel it \nshould be repealed.\n  But Democrats also believe we must address the underlying problem. \nThe Republican leader's bill does nothing to prevent taxpayer dollars \nfrom going to contractors who fail to pay their taxes.\n  Democrats have offered alternative legislation that would address the \nproblem of noncompliant contractors without targeting those who pay \ntheir taxes.\n  The Senate will take action on this worthy alternative in just a \ncouple weeks, after the House sends us its bill.\n  Voting on this measure today is nothing more than a diversion by my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  I am confident that Senate Democrats and Republicans will be able to \nwork together next month to repeal this provision.\n  We should be successfu1 at working together to stop an unfair tax \nincrease that will hit middle-class families.\n  This month, Republicans blocked our attempt to keep payroll taxes low \nfor families and businesses who are still struggling as our country \nfights its way out of a serious recession.\n  I hope they will be as willing to work with Democrats on finding \nsolutions that work for middle-class families as they are on finding \nsolutions for government contractors.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 674\n\n  Mr. President, I want to get the Republican leader's attention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from the House \nH.R. 674, the Senate proceed to its consideration; that the Reid \nsubstitute amendment, the text of which is at the desk, be agreed to.\n  This amendment would do the following: It repeals the 3-percent \nwithholding requirement; prohibits contractors who are delinquent on \ntheir taxes from being eligible for Federal contracts; offsets by \nclosing a loophole that allows oil and gas companies to claim excess \nforeign tax credits, eliminating a tax preference for corporate jets, \nand a 1-year delay in implementing worldwide interest allocation.\n  I then ask consent that the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with all of the \nabove occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  We have both given our statements in this regard, Mr. President, \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this \nwould implement a tax increase. It also would be subject to the same \nblue-slip concern the majority leader expressed with regard to the vote \nwe are going to have on the 3-percent withholding. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say there would be no blue-slip \nproblem whatsoever because, as I indicated, this would be an amendment \nto a revenue bill we have received from the House, and I identified \nwhich one that would be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote with \nrespect to the Reid motion to proceed to Calendar No. 204, S. 1723, \noccur at 9:55 tonight; further, that if cloture is not invoked on the \nReid motion to proceed, the Senate then proceed to a vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the McConnell motion to proceed to Calendar No. \n205, S. 1726; finally, that if cloture is invoked on either motion to \nproceed, that notwithstanding cloture having been invoked, the Senate \nresume consideration of H.R. 2112, and upon disposition of H.R. 2112, \nthe Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed, postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express strong support \nfor the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, a bill that \nprovides funding to hire and prevent the layoff of tens of thousands of \nteachers, police officers, and firefighters.\n  Difficult economic times have devastated the ranks of these critical \npositions. Since 2008, California alone has seen more than 70,000 \neducators laid off. The resources in this bill will help cities and \ntowns across the country avoid more layoffs and start rebuilding their \nworkforce.\n  Nationwide, some 300,000 education jobs have been lost in the past 3 \nyears, and State and local budget cuts will endanger as many as 280,000 \nteacher jobs next year.\n  The difficult economy has also strained police departments across the \ncountry. In the past 18 months, 10,000 police officers have been laid \noff around the country, while 30,000 vacancies have gone unfilled.\n  I have heard from many police departments in my home State of \nCalifornia that fear that this understaffing will jeopardize public \nsafety. They are concerned that with fewer officers for patrols, \ninvestigations and other critical tasks, crime will increase.\n  Fire departments face similar problems. Thousands of firefighters \nwere laid off in 2009 and 2010, and another 7,000 face layoffs this \nyear.\n  This legislation will help communities address staffing shortages in \nthese critical positions.\n  To help our schools, the bill would provide $30 billion to States and \nschool districts to protect and create up to 400,000 education jobs \nnationwide, which would prevent the layoffs of up to 280,000 teachers \nand hire tens of thousands more.\n  In my home State of California, this will safeguard more than 37,000 \neducation jobs.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, 72 percent of \nschool districts expect to have less funding in the 2011-2012 school \nyear as compared to last year.\n  In California, public schools are suffering from State budget cuts. I \nhave heard from thousands of teachers in my State who have received \npink slips each spring over the last several years warning that their \njobs are in danger.\n  Many teachers wait for months to find out whether they will still be \nteaching the following year. Many pink slips are rescinded, sparing \njobs, but others are not as lucky. Our teachers should not have to deal \nwith such uncertainty, and this bill helps safeguard those jobs.\n  With so many teachers losing their jobs in California, classrooms are \nbecoming crowded and the school year is becoming shorter. On average, \nK-3 classrooms in California are up to 25 students, up from 20 students \n2 years ago.\n  Average class sizes for higher grades have risen from 28 students to \n31. The more we squeeze students into one classroom, the more difficult \nit is to provide standards-based instruction, and the harder it is for \nstudents to focus on their education.\n  This bill invests in education to keep educators on the job, \ncontinuing to provide students with a supportive learning environment.\n  In a country that prides itself on providing children with every \nopportunity, it does not make sense to lay off the very teachers who \nprepare our children for the future.\n  Another casualty of budget cuts is the many talented individuals who \nare being driven away from the teaching profession because of the lack \nof job stability. I fear that a deteriorating education system means \nmore children will slip through the cracks and be unprepared for \ncollege or to compete in the global economy.\n  The quality of education is a direct reflection of how firmly we \nsupport our teachers.\n  In addition to supporting thousands of teaching jobs, the Teachers \nand First Responders Back to Work Act also provides $4 billion for \ncommunities to hire police officers. These\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nfunds will support more than 17,000 positions over the next 3 years, \nincluding about 2,600 in my home State of California.\n  There is also $1 billion for firefighters, supporting about 6,300 \npositions nationwide.\n  These funds go to support the dedicated first responders we depend \nupon in emergencies--the firefighters who enter burning buildings to \nsave lives and the police officers who risk everything to keep our \nstreets and homes safe.\n  In recent years, firefighters and police officers have taken on even \nmore responsibilities as they prepare for--and respond to--terrorist \nattacks. We are reminded of the importance of these first responders \nwhen we remember the brave men and women who worked so heroically to \nsave lives after the 9/11 attacks, including more than 400 \nfirefighters, police, and other emergency personnel who lost their \nlives that day.\n  Now is the time to stand with our first responders and give them the \nsupport they need. We must make sure our emergency personnel are not \nrisking their lives because too many of their colleagues have been laid \noff.\n  While this legislation will strengthen our schools and protect our \nstreets and homes, it will not add a penny to the deficit. This is \naccomplished by paying for the bill with a half-percent tax on \nAmericans with an adjusted gross income over $1 million.\n  I have long said that those people who have benefited from this \neconomy and can help out should do so. Millionaires can afford to help \nbuild a smarter, safer, stronger nation.\n  It is not the wealthiest Americans who have been bearing the brunt of \nthis recession; it is the middle class and the poor who have suffered.\n  Our Nation continues to face serious economic difficulties. The \nunemployment rate is over 9 percent, and remains stuck at 12 percent in \nCalifornia. This lack of employment is causing severe financial strain \nwith too many families losing their homes and too many families \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  Congress needs to help Americans get back to work and get our economy \nmoving forward. And this bill will help.\n  With the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, we will \nstrengthen our schools, help our children get the education they \ndeserve and give our first responders the support they need to keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6840-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TEACHERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS BACK TO WORK ACT OF 2011--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all agree that the contractors who \ncontract with the Federal Government should pay their taxes. I don't \nthink there is any dispute on that. There is also agreement that we \nshould not overburden small businesses which are paying their taxes. \nThe bill before us would repeal the provisions scheduled to go into \neffect in 2013 to require a withholding of 3 percent of payments from \nthe U.S. Treasury to the government contractors. There are two flaws in \nthis. One, it lets all government contractors off the hook, even those \nwho refuse to pay taxes. Those contractors would not be subject to the \nmechanism to make sure they pay. Second, this is paid for by rescinding \n$30 billion of appropriated funds, which is, frankly, contrary to the \nagreement reached with the President on the deficit reduction.\n  I ask colleagues to oppose the cloture motion to proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, this is a no-brainer. This \nis where political theater stops and we actually do something the \nAmerican people want and need. Three percent withholding is good for \nsmall businesses. We have viewed this pay-for\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nmany other times. It passed one time with 81 votes, another time, I \nthink, 37-plus of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle used the \nsame funding we are using to pay for this, but now all of a sudden it \nis not appropriate.\n  We have six cosponsors on the Democratic side.

Mr. President, I will do my best to start the pace \naround here. I am going to ask for a voice vote, and I would hope \npeople would give a shout out for a ``yea'' vote for a narrow exception \nto a wetlands project for nonprofits with a permit to build.

The question is on amendment No. 917, the \nVitter second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up the Vitter second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 917 to amendment No. 857.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reestablish the maximum aggregate amount permitted to be \n        provided by the taxpayers to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac)\n\n       On page 5, strike line 14 and insert the following:\n\n     2011'' and inserting ``December 31, 2013''.\n\n     SEC. __. REESTABLISHMENT OF MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT \n                   PERMITTED TO BE PROVIDED BY THE TAXPAYERS TO \n                   FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC.\n\n       (a) Maximum Aggregate Amount of Commitment.--No funds may \n     be provided by the Department of the Treasury or any other \n     agency or entity of the Federal Government to the Federal \n     National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan \n     Mortgage Corporation, as part of the Amended and Restated \n     Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated September \n     26, 2008, amended May 6, 2009, and further amended December \n     24, 2009 (as such agreement may be further amended), between \n     the Department of the Treasury and the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n     Corporation, as applicable, under any other agreement between \n     the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home \n     Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Department of the Treasury, \n     or otherwise, that exceed a maximum aggregate amount of \n     $200,000,000,000.\n       (b) Payments to Treasury.--Any dividend or interest payment \n     made by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the \n     Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to the Department of \n     the Treasury pursuant to any applicable contract, agreement, \n     or provision of law shall not be included in the calculation \n     of the aggregate amount of a commitment under subsection (a).\n       (c) Enforcement.--The Director of the Federal Housing \n     Finance Agency shall take such actions as the Administrator \n     determines are necessary to prevent the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n     Corporation from requesting or receiving any funds that \n     exceed the limit provided in subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the terms \n     ``deficiency amount'' and ``surplus amount'' have the \n     meanings provided such terms in the applicable Senior \n     Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement described in subsection \n     (a), as amended through December 24, 2009.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the \nMenendez amendment. The Menendez amendment would actually expand the \nalready dominant role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the mortgage \nmarketplace when there is an unlimited taxpayer bailout liability \ntoward that.\n  My amendment would simply say, particularly if there is going to be \nthis expansion, we should limit taxpayer liability to $200 billion, and \nthe taxpayer should definitely be paid the dividend they were promised. \nI think that is a very reasonable taxpayer protection.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the ranking member of Banking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 45 seconds on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Vitter \namendment. The amendment will limit the taxpayers' exposure to the \nbailout of Fannie and Freddie. No more blank checks. We have already \nspent $169 billion in taxpayer dollars; $200 billion is more than \nenough. Think about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, this amendment would \nessentially force the wind-down of\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac prematurely without any structure to take \ntheir place. The Banking Committee has heard from witnesses, including \nDwight Jaffee and Mark Zandi, that taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac were the only options the government would have to avoid a complete \nmarket collapse. This amendment could plunge us back into the panic of \n2008, when credit was unavailable and the economy was on the verge of \ncollapse. Mortgages would not be finalized, home sales could not go \nthrough, and the home owners would be unable to refinance.\n  The Vitter amendment would eliminate any stability we have achieved \nin the housing market. The Vitter amendment is an irresponsible \nresponse to the housing crisis, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe National Association of Realtors, and a letter from the Mortgage \nBankers Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Mortgage Bankers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, US Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, US Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: I am writing to express \n     the Mortgage Bankers Association's strong opposition to an \n     amendment being offered by Senator Vitter to the Menendez/\n     Isakson amendment #857 to the Transportation, Housing and \n     Urban Development Appropriations Bill currently being \n     considered by the Senate. The Vitter amendment would \n     reestablish the cap on the amount of capital Treasury could \n     provide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If adopted, this \n     amendment would severely undermine investor and market \n     certainty in our nation's housing markets.\n       Private capital has yet to return to the secondary market \n     at volumes that would sustain a sufficient level of \n     liquidity. Establishing an arbitrary cap on the amount \n     necessary to preserve the GSEs' presence in the market would \n     unnecessarily constrain some of the only sources of liquidity \n     during this volatile period in the nation's economy. MBA \n     urges a no vote on the Vitter second degree amendment to the \n     Menendez amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             David H. Stevens,\n\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer,\n     Mortgage Bankers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of Homebuilders and National \n           Association of Realtors,\n                                                 October 20, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: It has come to our attention that Senator \n     Vitter is asking for a second degree amendment to Menendez/\n     Isakson #857 that will cap the lending authority for Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac from the US Treasury. Please be aware \n     that the National Association of Homebuilders and the \n     National Association of REALTORS adamantly oppose the Vitter \n     Amendment.\n       Housing markets remain fragile. Despite record low interest \n     rates, existing home sales for September were down and \n     contract failures are more than double last year's rates. The \n     Vitter amendment would devastate any housing recovery. The \n     amendment would shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at the \n     very time that they are providing valuable support to a \n     struggling housing market.\n       At their current rate, including the punitive ten percent \n     dividend they are required to pay, they may reach this cap in \n     short order, ending their ability to provide liquidity to \n     mortgage markets. Private entities simply do not have the \n     capacity to fill the void. Passage of this amendment would be \n     catastrophic to housing markets and would most likely cause a \n     relapse recession.\n       Please vote NO on the Vitter Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Association of Homebuilders,\n     National Association of REALTORS.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I yield back the time, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. 917.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate amendment requires 60 votes for \nadoption.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BURR (when his name was called). ``Present.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 41, the nays are 57. \nOne Senator responded ``present.''\n  Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this \namendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 857\n\n  The question is on the underlying Menendez amendment. There is 2 \nminutes, evenly divided. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me when 30 \nseconds has passed by.\n  The Menendez-Isakson amendment would temporarily restore conforming \nloan limits to the level that existed under the law as of September 30 \nbut expired. The drop in loan limits has reduced consumer credit in 669 \ncounties across 42 States. The amendment as we have drafted it will \nsave taxpayers $11 million over 10 years, including $2 million in \nfiscal year 2012, according to the CBO, by creating a premium that \nborrowers have to pay as a result of getting the loan, therefore \nputting the risk on the borrower, not the taxpayer. If we want to get \nour economy moving, the housing market has to be part of it.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety seconds.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is going to be tough, but let me say there is a 15-\nbasis point fee on every loan that closes on this that goes into the \ncredit that is issued by Fannie, Freddie or FHA; it makes the taxpayer \nwhole, plus $11 million. It is right for the housing market. It takes \nus back to where we were. It doesn't add any additional liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the Menendez amendment. If this amendment \nbecomes law, taxpayers will be forced to subsidize individuals who make \nupward of $200,000 a year so they may buy homes worth nearly $1 \nmillion. That is what this is about. Increasing the loan limits will \nonly benefit those who do not need Federal subsidies.\n  This is simply not a good use of scarce taxpayer dollars. Even the \nadministration does not support higher loan limits here. It is a bad \namendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, 60 votes are \nrequired for the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is a point of personal privilege or \na parliamentary inquiry. Due to the rate at which we are voting on \namendments that are pending, can the Parliamentarian or the leadership \nshare with us, after, say, 1 hour and 45 minutes on four votes, what it \nmight look like for the rest of the night?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know how frustrating it is for everyone. \nThis is not a question for the Parliamentarian. We are doing our best \nto work through these votes. They are 10-minute votes. We are doing our \nutmost to maintain that time and will continue to do that. We are sorry \nthat close votes, as everyone knows, sometimes take a little bit \nlonger. So I apologize to my friend from Louisiana and everyone else. \nWe will move through the votes as quickly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. May I respectfully make one suggestion. Three options: \nStick to 10 minutes, we can voice vote, or we can withdraw, all of \nwhich would rapidly speed up the process.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish I had thought of saying that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 869\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the Gillibrand amendment \nNo. 869.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment because we have all seen how these storms have destroyed \ncrops, farmland. There have been enormous economic losses in State \nafter State.\n  Texas: 98 percent of the State is experiencing drought.\n  Mississippi: Farmers wade through acres of murky water; timber, \ncatfish farms inundated.\n  New York State: Crops destroyed, cows destroyed.\n  Tennessee: Unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n  This money is literally the difference between life and death for \nthese farmers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I request a voice \nvote.\n  Would Senator Blunt like to address the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the Gillibrand amendment.\n  All those in favor, say aye.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, would the clerk please call the roll and \nsee if a quorum is present. I believe a quorum is present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Point of personal privilege. Could we call the roll \nfaster?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of the \nquorum be terminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Gillibrand amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we would be much more efficient here if we \nhave 10-minute votes. It is very difficult for those who are doing the \nwork for us to determine who is voting which way, to hear us. People \nare moving around. I think it will be to everyone's advantage if we all \nsit down and make sure these are really 10-minute votes. It would make \nit so much easier for the tally clerks and for everyone concerned. So I \nwould ask that we all be ladies and gentlemen, take our seats. This \nwill move much more efficiently.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 836\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Lautenberg amendment \nNo. 836. There is now 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this amendment increases funding for \ndisaster relief grants at the Economic Development Administration. \nForty-eight States have received a Federal disaster declaration this \nyear and may be eligible for this relief. EDA funds rebuild sewers and \ndrinking\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nwater systems, coordinate response and recovery plans, and help \nbusinesses to recover. This year alone, we have experienced a record 10 \nnatural disasters costing more than $1 billion each. Hurricane Irene \ncaused more than $7 billion in damage alone.\n  In 2008, we gave EDA $500 million to respond to disasters in the \nSouth and the Midwest. This amendment would give EDA the same amount \nthis year. The amendment complies with the disaster relief provision in \nthe Budget Control Act and is not offset with cuts from other programs.\n  Senators Sanders, Menendez, Gillibrand, Blumenthal, and Leahy are \ncosponsors, and Chairman Mikulski supports it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  If all time is yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 836) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 771, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the next amendment is amendment No. \n771; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment will increase funding \nfor the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to the level the President \nrequested, also to the level the House appropriators have proposed. It \nadds nearly $4.5 million to the budget for the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office. This is funding that is needed to enforce our \ntrade agreements. We just entered into three new free-trade agreements. \nThey need the personnel in order to try to enforce these. We have a \ngreat many trade disputes with China--all of us are aware of that--and \nother major industrial countries as well.\n  This amendment has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nFarm Bureau, and the National Pork Producers Council.\n  This is good legislation which I hope all Senators will support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  If all time is yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 771), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the Sessions amendment \nNo. 810.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the fastest growing large program we \nhave by far is the Food Stamp Program. It has gone from $20 billion to \n$80 billion since 2001, grown four times. It has doubled since 2008. \nThis year proposes another $10 billion increase--14 percent. One of the \nbig reasons is that we have a growing utilization of categorical \neligibility where if one qualifies for LIHEAP, TANF, counseling \nprograms, and any number of other governmental relationships, one also \nqualifies for food stamps. CBO scores this as costing as much as $10 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  This is a good-government amendment. You can get food stamps. Nobody \nwould be eliminated. You simply have to go to the office and fill out \nthe form and show that you meet the food stamp qualifications and not \nget by having met other qualifications that are less stringent. I \nreally believe it is a good amendment and would help us save some money \nand make this program more effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first of all, I completely agree with \nSenator Sessions. We need to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nsupplemental food program, as in every Federal program.\n  I wish to commend the USDA now for having less than a 4-percent error \nrate, and we are going to continue to push them to go down even \nfurther. Why? Because right now we have people who have paid taxes all \ntheir lives, who had never in their wildest dreams thought they would \never need help putting food on their table, and they do. We cannot \nafford to waste even one dollar.\n  My colleague mentioned on the floor several times a lottery winner in \nMichigan who got food assistance. He is right, it was outrageous. The \nState changed it, and we are changing it in the upcoming farm bill. But \nthe reality is that this amendment, the Sessions amendment, completely \nchanges the structure of the food assistance program, putting up \nbarriers to hard-working, honest men, women, and children who need \nhelp, most of them for the first time in their entire lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am disappointed that with so many \nAmericans struggling in difficult economic times, we are considering \namendments that will greatly reduce the ability of the neediest among \nus to put food on the table for their families. The amendment numbered \n810 filed by Senator Sessions would eliminate the ability of States to \nalign the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, eligibility \nrules with the temporary assistance to needy families to reduce \nadministrative costs and simply enrollment.\n  Since 2008, Vermont has used categorical eligibility to reach more \nhouseholds and more needy individuals by simplifying enrollment. \nReducing administrative costs and simplifying paperwork should be a \ngoal we all share for Federal programs. But by adopting this amendment, \nabout 1 million low-income Americans would lose their benefits and many \nmore families that are newly eligible during these difficult economic \ntimes would have their benefits delayed because of the increased \ncomplexity of the additional processing time for applications.\n  Low-income working families with children are the majority of those \nwho would be affected by the elimination of categorical eligibility. \nAdditionally, roughly 200,000 children in these families would lose \naccess to free school meals.\n  Improving the error rate even further in the SNAP program is an issue \nthat the Agriculture Committee is committed to addressing in the \nupcoming farm bill negotiations, and one that we have already heard to \nchairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee speak about this week. \nEliminating State flexibility through categorical eligibility programs \ndoes not address error rates in any meaningful way. Supporters of this \namendment cite limited examples as proof that categorical eligibility \nis at the root of erroneous enrollments in SNAP. But allowing millions \nto go hungry because of a few anecdotal stories is shortsighted at \nbest.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee, which I am proud to be a senior \nmember of, will be looking for additional ways to improve SNAP in the \ncoming months, but eliminating categorical eligibility as this \namendment does is not the answer. I urge all Senators to oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The next amendment is the Coburn amendment No. \n791.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we have 2,705 people in this country who \nhad adjusted gross incomes in excess of $2.5 million last year who got \nfarm payments--direct farm payments. This is an amendment that will \nlimit adjusted gross incomes above $1 million from receiving direct \npayments.\n  We hear we are going to change that system. We may change that \nsystem. But that has not happened yet. All this amendment says, if you \nmake more than $1 million, you should not be eligible to receive a \ndirect farm payment from this government. Rather than taxing the \nmillionaires, the first thing we ought to do is quit giving them \nsubsidies.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me just indicate that the House and \nSenate Agriculture Committee leaders have come together in a \nbipartisan, bicameral basis to recommend reforms in our farm commodity \nprograms that will, frankly, make this amendment a moot point. I would \nask my colleagues to vote no and to give us the next 10 days to come \nforward with the new approach we will be offering.\n  I will now yield to my friend and colleague on the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the chairwoman for yielding. The Senator from \nOklahoma has a good intent, but he is adding in a payment limit on top \nof two others. It is going to be difficult to implement and \nadministrate from the Department of Agriculture's standpoint. The \nSenator from Michigan is exactly right. He is limiting programs for \nwhich there probably will not be any programs. I suggest we do this \nduring the reauthorization of the farm bill, and then I would encourage \nthe Senator to come at that particular time and figure out what is in \nthe farm bill and what is not, what payment limitation is appropriate \nand what is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, $1 million a year and we are giving them \nmoney. We have a $1.3 trillion deficit, and we continue to hear the \ndefense of that. It would be great if we do a new farm program. But the \nfact is, that is not a given. If we pass this amendment and we do a new \nfarm bill, this amendment has no effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponent's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on the Coburn amendment No. 792.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there are 4,000 properties in the United \nStates that get money from HUD for housing to help people whom we want \nto help. There are 450 owners who are chronically on the list of \nslumlords, who put the people who live in these houses in danger; they \nare at high risk for losing their lives in that property.\n  This amendment only says that if you are going to continue to put \nthese people at risk of losing their lives, then we are not going to \npay you anymore. We are not going to send you money if you continue to \nbe in this group of slumlords who are not spending any of their money \nbringing their properties up to date and you are leaving people at risk \nof significant harm. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his passion on \nthis issue. He has raised valid concerns about the bad actors who are \npart of the Federal program.\n  The problem is, the way this is drafted, it goes too far. This \namendment puts the tenants at risk. It will put the tenants out of a \nplace to live.\n  Earlier, I offered to work with the Senator to address the issue in a \nway that would make sure we protect residents. We were not able to get \nto a resolution. I hope we can continue to work on this. This \namendment, as drafted, will put the tenants at risk and out. If once in \n5 years a HUD property falls under the troubled category, the tenants \nwill be at risk.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment. I offer to work with \nthe Senator to address this in a way that gets after the problem he has \ndefined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, they did offer, but they told us they \ndidn't have the time to work it out.\n  The fact is, these are life-threatening emergencies. If one person \ndies because we don't do this, it is on our hands.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. There is a 60-vote threshold on this \nvote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

We have a lot of great \nprograms that help a lot of cities and States out by creating loans \nthat allow the cities and States to do something. What is happening is, \nwhen the project we gave the loan for fails, they turn around and take \nFederal grants to repay the loan.\n  All this amendment does is to prohibit us from allowing grants to be \nused to repay Federal loans on local or city or State projects.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have concerns about the way this amendment \nis worded. It may have serious consequences on disaster funding.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent notwithstanding the \nprevious order the Senate now proceed to vote in relation to the Ayotte \namendment No. 753, and all other provisions of the previous order \nremain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I had a meeting \nhere a few minutes ago. Following this vote we will have more \ninformation for the body.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, our country continues to be at war with \nmembers of al-Qaida, enemy combatants who want to kill Americans and \nthat is why Congress authorized the use of military force to combat \nthese individuals. My amendment applies to the worst of the worst. It \nwould prohibit the use of funds for fiscal year 2012 for the \nprosecution of enemy combatants in civilian article III courts. This \nprohibition would extend to members of al-Qaida or affiliated entities, \nand who have participated or carried out an attack against our country \nor our coalition partners. It does not apply to American citizens.\n  These individuals, enemy combatants, are not common criminals who \njust robbed a liquor store. When we detain a member of al-Qaida who is \nplanning an attack on our country, the priority has to be on gathering \ninformation to protect Americans. I have great respect for our civilian \ncourt system, but it was not set up to allow the time to interrogate \nmembers of al-Qaida. We should not be trying these individuals in our \ncivilian system but in military commissions. We should not be providing \nthese terrorists Miranda rights and speedy presentment rights that come \nwith our civilian system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. This is a very \ndifferent amendment from the one we adopted in our Armed Services \nCommittee relative to detention. This amendment was rejected on a \nstrong bipartisan vote in the Armed Services Committee. The reasons are \nset forth in a letter from the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Panetta, who \nwrote us:\n\n       If we are to safeguard the American people, we must be in a \n     position to employ every lawful instrument of national \n     power--including both courts and military commissions--to \n     ensure that terrorists are brought to justice and can no \n     longer threaten American lives. By depriving us of one of our \n     most potent weapons in the fight against terrorism, the \n     Ayotte amendment would make it more likely that terrorists \n     would escape justice and innocent lives would be put at risk.\n\n  They have been successfully prosecuted. Recently in Detroit a \nterrorist was successfully prosecuted in an article III court. We \nshould not deny the prosecutors this tool.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there have been over 300 successful \nprosecutions of accused terrorists since 9/11; 200 under President \nBush, 100 under President Obama, all in article III courts; only 3 \nprosecutions in military commissions. Give the President the power he \nneeds to keep America safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Lindner, Jr.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to mourn the passing of a \ngreat American and a man who did much to benefit the people of Kentucky \nas well as Ohio. Carl Henry Lindner, Jr., was Greater Cincinnati's most \nsuccessful entrepreneur and a self-made man. He passed away this \nOctober 17. He was 92 years old.\n  Carl Lindner was born in Dayton, OH, in 1919, the son of a dairyman. \nHe quit high school to help out in his father's dairy. That store grew \ninto United Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores that \nmany northern Kentuckians frequent to this day to buy their famous ice \ncream.\n  Mr. Lindner made much of his living in the banking and insurance \nbusiness. His name became famous across northern Kentucky and Ohio and \nnationwide as the owner of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005. Carl \nalso ran an amusement park and his hometown newspaper, the Cincinnati \nEnquirer.\n  Always the optimist, Carl was famous for carrying cards with him that \nhe would hand out to anyone he met with motivational sayings printed on \nthem. One frequent version of the card would read: ``Only in America! \nGee, am I lucky!''\n  Carl spent much of his time working for his community, bringing \nthousands of high-paying jobs to Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. He \nhas been called a ``one-man Chamber of Commerce.'' He also was renowned \nfor his philanthropic efforts. He gave generously of his time and \nresources to charities, churches, universities, museums, organizations \nserving the underprivileged, and even children in Sri Lanka orphaned by \nthe 2005 tsunami.\n  I had the benefit of knowing Carl for a long time very well. He was \nan amazing man, and his loss will be deeply felt by many. Elaine and I \nsend our condolences to his wife Edyth; his sons, Carl III, Craig, and \nKeith; his 12 grandchildren, 5 great grandchildren, and many other \nbeloved family members and friends.\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\n  The passing of Carl Lindner is a true loss for the people of northern \nKentucky, Ohio, and the Nation. I know my Senate colleagues join me in \nremembering and honoring Carl for his very American success story, his \nservice to his community, and the example he leaves behind for others \nof a full life well lived.\n  Madam President, the Cincinnati Enquirer recently published an \nobituary of Carl Lindner. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nfull in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Oct. 18, 2011]\n\n                     Carl Henry Lindner: 1919-2011\n\n Billionaire Investor, Dead at 92, Was Cincinnati's Biggest Benefactor\n\n                            (By Cliff Peale)\n\n       From humble beginnings running his father's dairy store in \n     Norwood, Carl Henry Lindner Jr. grew into a billionaire, a \n     friend of U.S. presidents and Greater Cincinnati's most \n     successful entrepreneur.\n       For nearly a century until he died late Monday at age 92, \n     the former Reds owner never shed the fierce competitiveness \n     and loyalty that made him a hometown icon.\n       His influence ran to every corner of Greater Cincinnati. \n     The high-school dropout bought and sold Kings Island, the \n     Reds, Provident Bank and the Enquirer. His name is on \n     buildings from the University of Cincinnati's business school \n     to the tennis center at Lunken Playfield.\n       But it was the banking and insurance business that made him \n     a billionaire. At his death, his American Financial Group \n     Inc. controlled assets of nearly $32 billion and he was \n     routinely listed as one of the richest men in America.\n       Ever the optimist, Lindner often carried an inch-thick \n     stack of cards with motivational sayings--one was ``Only in \n     America! Gee, am I lucky!''--that he handed out to anyone he \n     would meet.\n       He was a teetotaler, physically unimposing yet with a \n     prominent shock of white hair and a penchant for wearing \n     flashy neckties.\n       Even to his closest friends and colleagues, he was soft-\n     spoken and rarely confrontational. Yet some business partners \n     complained about unfair treatment and he flashed a harsh \n     temper when confronting reporters who wrote what he perceived \n     as unfriendly stories or criticism of his business dealings.\n       A devout Baptist and a longtime member of Kenwood Baptist \n     Church, Lindner used his wealth and influence behind the \n     scenes to become Greater Cincinnati's largest benefactor and \n     economic development force. At the height of his personal \n     giving he contributed millions of dollars a year to \n     charitable causes, and brought thousands of high-paying jobs \n     to downtown Cincinnati.\n       His companies brought thousands of employees to the region, \n     and the annual Christmas party that he threw at Music Hall \n     attracted some of the nation's biggest acts, including Bill \n     Cosby and Frank Sinatra.\n\n\n                      Considered himself outsider\n\n       At the same time, Lindner thought of himself as an \n     outsider, building his business career outside of \n     Cincinnati's old-money elite. He was never a member of many \n     of the most exclusive business and country clubs and his bar-\n     the-doors business style, starting with a hostile takeover of \n     Provident Bank in the mid-1960s, was out of place in always \n     polite Cincinnati.\n       Perhaps the most public role of his career was his \n     ownership of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005. Lindner \n     owned a minority stake both before and after that period but \n     was the Reds' CEO for six seasons, and each of those years \n     the team lost more games than it won.\n       He approved the trade for Ken Griffey Jr. in 2000, even \n     sending his private jet to bring Griffey to Cincinnati and \n     then personally driving the hometown star back to Cinergy \n     Field from Lunken Airport in his Rolls-Royce.\n       But as the Reds' losses mounted, Lindner never spoke \n     publicly to fans and privately bristled at talk-radio \n     criticism.\n       That period ended in late 2005 when Lindner sold a \n     controlling stake in the Reds to a group headed by Bob \n     Castellini.\n       Shy and scornful of reporters, Lindner nevertheless became \n     a focus of media attention because of his substantial wealth \n     and his far-flung business dealings.\n       The controversies included millions of dollars in political \n     contributions as his Chiquita Brands International Inc. was \n     waging a trade war with European countries, a bevy of \n     lawsuits and federal charges over business deals that \n     benefited Lindner and his company more than other \n     shareholders, and a high-profile battle with the Enquirer in \n     1998 over a series of critical stories on Chiquita.\n       Lindner built a national reputation in the 1980s as a high-\n     risk trader, becoming a business partner of symbols of the \n     decade's excess such as junk-bond king Michael Milken and \n     Cincinnati's own Charles Keating.\n       He was the classic ``value investor,'' buying properties \n     few other investors wanted and waiting years, or even \n     decades, to reap the benefits.\n       That gave him a portfolio including the old Penn Central \n     railroad, Circle K convenience stores and New York City \n     landmark Grand Central Station.\n       But Lindner spent the two decades before his death shedding \n     assets that didn't deal with insurance and transferring \n     others to his three sons. That left American Financial as \n     mostly an insurance and financial services company.\n       He lost his stake in Chiquita in 2002 when that company \n     emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2004, Lindner, his \n     family and American Financial reaped nearly $1 billion in \n     stock when they sold Cincinnati's Provident Financial Group \n     Inc. to Cleveland-based National City Corp.\n       The moves consolidated the business around safer insurance \n     businesses. Lindner also transferred tens of millions of \n     dollars to his three sons and their families, solidifying for \n     generations a wealth that he never enjoyed growing up.\n\n\n                         Starting from scratch\n\n       Born April 22, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio, Carl Henry Lindner \n     Jr. was the firstborn of a modest dairyman and his wife, \n     Clara.\n       Lindner quit high school to help in his father's Norwood \n     dairy store. Along with his father, he and his brothers \n     Robert and Richard, and sister Dorothy, built it into United \n     Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores.\n       When the family founded what now is UDF on Montgomery Road \n     in Norwood in 1940, the first day's sales amounted to $8.28.\n       Lindner often talked about the modest surroundings of his \n     childhood, noting more than once that he picked up dates in \n     an ice-cream truck.\n       Robert Lindner's family eventually took control of UDF, and \n     Richard Lindner became sole owner of the Thriftway \n     supermarket chain before selling it to Winn-Dixie Stores.\n       Lindner married the former Ruth Wiggeringloh of Norwood in \n     1942. They divorced seven years later with no children. He \n     then married the former Edyth Bailey in 1951, and they have \n     three sons who all went into the family business: Carl III, \n     Craig and Keith.\n       Lindner cautiously entered the savings-and-loan and \n     insurance business, founding his flagship company American \n     Financial Corp. in 1959. In the early 1970s the company \n     gained control of Great American Insurance, which would \n     become its chief operating business.\n       Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the company bought and sold \n     companies in a variety of industries. Lindner took the \n     company private in 1981 and released little financial \n     information to the public, but in 1995 the company sold stock \n     to public shareholders under the new umbrella of American \n     Financial Group Inc.\n       In 2003, Keith Lindner left American Financial to \n     concentrate on the family's charitable pursuits. In 2004 Carl \n     and Craig Lindner were named co-CEOs of the company while \n     Carl Lindner Jr. remained chairman.\n       Lindner was a conservative icon, lobbying against Robert \n     Mapplethorpe's 1990 exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Center \n     here and funding the Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy.\n       But he was pragmatic as well, contributing more than $1 \n     million to Democratic President Bill Clinton during Chiquita \n     Brands' battle over European banana quotas. He was well known \n     as one of the biggest givers in the country to both political \n     parties.\n\n\n                             The good life\n\n       Lindner developed a taste for the good life, including a \n     sprawling home in Indian Hill and nearly a dozen Rolls-Royce \n     automobiles--with the trademark ``CHL'' license plate--that \n     he drove himself well into his 80s.\n       He also owned a home in the exclusive Ocean Reef community \n     of North Key Largo, Fla. There, he entertained lavishly, \n     including hosting former President George Bush in the early \n     1990s.\n       Lindner traveled around the country in his own private jet. \n     He dined often at exclusive restaurants like the Maisonette \n     or the Waterfront--where he was an investor--and also became \n     a regular at Trio in Kenwood.\n       Lindner received nearly every award Cincinnati has to \n     offer, including induction into Junior Achievement's Greater \n     Cincinnati Business Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Great Living \n     Cincinnatian award in 1994.\n       He was also on the board of directors of Citizens for \n     Decency through Law, an anti-pornography group headed by \n     American Financial co-founder and one-time Executive Vice \n     President Charles Keating.\n       Among numerous awards and honors throughout his career, \n     Lindner was named Man of the Year of the United Jewish Appeal \n     in 1978 and received the Friars Club Centennial Award in \n     1985. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by UC in 1985 and \n     by Xavier University in 1991.\n\n\n                       Services not scheduled yet\n\n       Lindner's family has not yet scheduled memorial or funeral \n     services.\n       American Financial Group, where Lindner was chairman, said \n     Tuesday that the family had requested memorial gifts be made \n     to Kenwood Baptist Church.\n       Lindner is survived by wife Edyth, sons Carl III, Craig and \n     Keith, 12 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, in that en bloc group of amendments \nwas an important amendment, amendment No. 893, as modified, that was \nsponsored by my colleagues from the Northwest--obviously myself, \nSenator Murray, Senator Wyden, Senator Merkley, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Feinstein. We thought it was very important that this amendment \npass tonight because scientists are calling it a disease emergency; \nthat is, that the Pacific Northwest wild salmon might be threatened by \na virus that has already decimated fish farm salmon from around the \nworld.\n  So we want to see, first of all, important scientific questions \nanswered about the impacts of this virus, and the threat they pose to \nPacific Northwest salmon. Second, we want to make sure there is an \naggressive management plan and an effective rapid response plan to deal \nwith the threat of this virus. And, third, we want to make sure we are \nprotecting the wild salmon and the important economy that goes with it.\n  I know many people know the Northwest is known for a healthy salmon \npopulation, but this salmon population is also an economy for us. It is \ntens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars as it \nrelates to our economy. So being able to detect this virus and make \nsure we are assessing the potential threat to the wild salmon \npopulation is something we want to see happen immediately.\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\n  This makes sure the task force, which is a joint task force already \nin place between NOAA and the USDA, works effectively in a very short \ntime period to make sure we are getting this accurate assessment.\n  As I mentioned, this virus in the farm fish population around the \nworld--in Chile and other places--has decimated salmon. We cannot risk \nhaving this impact the Pacific Northwest wild salmon. So we need \nanswers quickly from the scientific community. We need an action plan \nimmediately. And we need to make sure we are formulating a rapid \nresponse as to what to do if we do detect this virus is spreading, with \nthe potential impact we have seen in other areas.\n  I thank my colleagues for making sure this amendment was adopted \ntonight. I know Senator Murkowski had planned earlier to talk about \nthis. I want to thank Senator Hutchison from Texas for helping us move \nthis along in the process.\n  I hope now, as we move this legislation, we will also get the \ncooperation from NOAA and Secretary Lubchenco and others, and those at \nNMFS, to make sure we are responding very rapidly to this very serious, \nwhat people have called the scientific need to get these questions \nanswered as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to say a few words about the \nbill that we are currently considering and, in particular, a very \nworthwhile program funded by this bill that I believe is critical to \nmoving our Nation forward.\n  One very important agency funded by the fiscal year 2012 Commerce-\nJustice-Science bill that has not been getting much attention in the \ndebate this week is NASA. Senators Nelson, Hutchison, Rockefeller, and \nothers worked incredibly hard to get a balanced reauthorization bill \npassed last year, and I commend them for their hard work in getting it \nsigned into law. One aspect of that bill that I worked particularly \nhard on was ensuring that we are doing what we can to advance NASA's \nmission while also promoting the development of the commercial space \nsector. In negotiations on that authorization bill, Senator Nelson and \nI arrived at what I believe is a fair compromise that will allow us to \npursue advances in the commercial cargo and commercial crew fields and \nharness the innovation and cost savings that the private sector can \nprovide. In a recently released study, in fact, NASA estimated that the \nFalcon 9 launch vehicle being developed by the private sector company \nSpaceX will cost less than half what it would cost for NASA to develop \nthe launch vehicle itself. In the current fiscal climate, it is \nimperative that we partner with commercial companies to pursue the \ncost-effective innovation that can only be achieved through the \ncompetition that exists in the private sector. Supporting development \nof the commercial space industry will also help create steady, well-\npaying jobs and spur economic growth--not only in urban tech corridors, \nbut also in more rural areas where launch facilities are located such \nas the Wallops Island facility in my home State of Virginia.\n  By appropriating funding at the authorized level of $500 million for \nthe commercial crew development, CCDEV, program, I believe the fiscal \nyear 2012 Commerce-Justice-Science bill honors the commitment we made \nin the authorization bill to move forward in that field. I commend \nSenator Mikulski for her leadership in that regard, and I am excited by \nthe opportunities to come. While NASA develops our next heavy lift \nvehicle and a host of other important research duties, the private \nsector has the capability to quickly and cost-effectively deliver \nvehicles for our astronauts to access the International Space Station, \nISS, and minimize our dependence on Russia for those trips. Given what \nwe will be paying Russia for those trips to the ISS, there is the \npotential that we can actually save money in the long run by investing \nin commercial space to develop a competitive vehicle, rather than \ncontinuing to pay the Russians for seats on their vehicles.\n  Moving forward with the CCDEV program will also result in additional \nopportunities for development at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility, the \nVirginia Commercial Space Flight Authority, and the Mid-Atlantic \nRegional Spaceport. I have supported the Wallops facilities in Virginia \nsince my time as Governor, and from my recent visits, I can attest that \nthey are making tremendous progress in developing their launch \ninfrastructure. Providing funding for the CCDEV program at authorized \nlevels, as we have done in this bill, will help us drive competition in \nthe commercial space industry and will provide opportunities for \nfacilities such as Wallops to further develop their launch \ninfrastructure and provide steady, high-wage employment in areas that \nsorely need it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about amendment No. \n855, which I filed with Senators Coburn, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, and \nBrown.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce \nadjusted gross income limits on farm subsidies that were established in \nthe last farm bill by:\n  Pursuing thousands of individuals flagged by the IRS as potentially \nillegal recipients of farm subsidies; reclaiming subsidies from \nmillionaires and other illegal recipients; and auditing subsidy \nrecipients who claim they are in compliance with income limits but \nwhose IRS tax returns suggest otherwise.\n  I do not intend to ask for a vote on this amendment at this time, but \nI would like to explain to my colleagues why I am calling upon the USDA \nto more vigorously enforce the adjusted gross income limits in law.\n  In the 2008 farm bill, Congress capped the income of farm bill \nsubsidy payment recipients at $500,000 for non-farm income and $750,000 \nfor farm income.\n  The limits were imposed because there had been increasing concerns \nthat direct payments, countercyclical payments, and marketing loan \nbenefits had been going to corporate agriculture and millionaires.\n  These subsidy programs are designed to provide a safety net to \nfarmers whose industry suffers from dramatic swings in prices from year \nto year.\n  Congress intended to prevent individuals who could provide their own \nsafety net from drawing funds they didn't need from taxpayers.\n  The final enacted limits--$500,000 for non-farm income and $750,000 \nfor farm income--prevent payments only to farmers and absentee farm-\nowners who are doing extremely well financially.\n  Less than 2 percent of Americans make this much money in a given \nyear.\n  And Congress applied the caps flexibly.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n  Income can be averaged over a 3-year period, standard income tax \ndeductions apply, and farmers can deduct their expenses related to \ntheir entire farm operation.\n  Congress gave the U.S. Department of Agriculture clear direction to \ninvestigate and enforce the income caps.\n  But the USDA has been very slow to enforce this provision.\n  First, USDA did not thoroughly review subsidy recipients to prevent \nillegal payments from going out the door in 2009, 2010, or 2011, even \nthough the farm bill instructed that ``the Secretary shall deny the \nissuance of applicable payments and benefits'' to farmers who fail to \ncertify compliance.\n  Second, the USDA has not yet aggressively pursued thousands of \npayment recipients that the IRS has identified as likely violators.\n  Third, the USDA has not conducted a single audit of a subsidy \nrecipient, even though the farm bill states:\n\n       The Secretary shall establish statistically valid \n     procedures under which the Secretary shall conduct targeted \n     audits of such persons or legal entities as the Secretary \n     determines are most likely to exceed the limitations . . .\n\n  Finally, USDA has made no attempt to identify those who lied about or \nconcealed their income in order to receive subsidy payments. Such an \nact would constitute fraud against the U.S. government.\n  USDA has taken the initial step by working with the IRS to identify \npotentially illegal payments in 2009 and 2010, and I commend them for \nthis action.\n  The preliminary results of their investigation are staggering:\n  The IRS ``flagged'' 13,000 individuals in USDA's database with tax \nreturns that suggest they exceed congressionally mandated income caps.\n  When USDA reached out to 200 randomly selected ``flagged'' \nindividuals, more than 15 percent returned the money--with no questions \nasked.\n  Another 30 percent of those contacted by USDA didn't bother to \nrespond, suggesting a lack of respect among payment recipients for \nUSDA's enforcement ability.\n  This preliminary effort demonstrates that enforcing this law is both \nfair and fiscally responsible.\n  Thousands of recipients could be receiving tens, even hundreds, of \nmillions of Federal dollars each year, illegally.\n  Wealthy farmers--and absent farm owners--are still claiming payments \nfrom the farm bill's safety net programs, and the USDA is not doing \nenough to stop them.\n  Some of my colleagues believe we should wait for the next farm bill \nto address this problem. But I doubt they recognize that failing to \nenforce this provision wastes this much money.\n  Furthermore, the next farm bill is likely to include some form of \npayment regime, as every farm bill has for more than 50 years.\n  It might not be direct payments, but some form of subsidy payment \nregime is expected to remain.\n  Vigorous income limit enforcement makes the farm safety net stronger, \nnot weaker. It assures that funding is available for those who need it, \neven in a time of severe cuts.\n  Our constituents are suffering through the longest economic downturn \nin a generation. And government resources to help those truly in need \nare dwindling.\n  And yet despite congressional direction to conduct audits and \noversight of fraudulent payments to individuals already making hundreds \nof thousands of dollars per year, the Department of Agriculture has not \ndone enough to ensure that our limited resources are being spent \nwisely.\n  I urge our colleagues to join me in speaking out about this issue. I \nurge them to demand that the USDA enforce the law.\n  We need to send a clear message that fraudulent claims and subsidies \nto the rich are unacceptable.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, though I support the goal of sensible \nreform to the Federal criminal justice system, I opposed the Webb \namendment, No. 750, for several reasons.\n  First, I am concerned that the National Criminal Justice Commission \ncreated by this amendment would not be required to adopt unanimous \nrecommendations. As a result, it is likely that this commission would \nfracture into partisan camps instead of working toward the types of \nbipartisan consensus recommendations that would truly help solve the \nproblems facing our justice system. The experience of the 9/11 \nCommission is instructive. Despite the widely divergent policy views of \nthe ten 9/11 Commission members, they came together to produce a 567-\npage report containing 37 recommendations--without a single voice of \ndissent. As a result, Congress passed nearly all of that commission's \nrecommendations within 2 years. I am not confident that a nonunanimous \nNational Criminal Justice Commission will have the same success.\n  Additionally, I believe the broad jurisdiction of the National \nCriminal Justice Commission could lead it to examine highly \ncontroversial policy areas better left to the elected branches of \ngovernment. This would create an opportunity for certain interest \ngroups to pressure the commission to make divisive recommendations on \nissues such as narcotics legalization and the repeal of mandatory \nminimum sentences. While these interest groups may believe that their \narguments have merit, they should make these arguments to their elected \nrepresentatives, rather than unelected commission members. The Congress \nand the House and Senate Judiciary Committees are the proper venue in \nwhich to examine controversial criminal justice policy issues.\n  Furthermore, I have strong federalism concerns with the commission's \njurisdiction to make recommendations concerning State and local \ncriminal justice systems. Though Congress has the legitimate authority \nto appropriate funds to examine the federal criminal justice system, it \ndoes not have the authority to order the same examination at the State \nand local level. In my home State of Texas, the State government \nundertook sweeping reforms to its criminal justice system that will \nsave taxpayers billions of dollars. While I am proud of this \nachievement, I do not believe that the Federal Government should push \nother States to do the same thing. If another State looks at the \nsuccess of the Texas reforms, but decides not to enact them, then that \nis the choice reserved to them by the United States Constitution. \nFederal taxpayer dollars should not be used to interfere with this \ndecision.\n  Given the major concerns I have noted, it is almost certain that the \nmoney appropriated by this amendment would amount to little actual \nchange in the criminal justice system. In fact, the proposed National \nCriminal Justice Commission, in its current form, would likely only \nlead to more partisan bickering. Given the financial state of the \nNation, I believe that it would be unwise to spend $5 million on a \ncommission whose recommendations will likely be so divisive and \ncontroversial that they will never even be acted upon by Congress.\n  I believe that we should have a serious discussion about the federal \ncriminal justice system and reducing out-of-control incarceration \nrates. Unfortunately, this amendment would not advance that goal. For \nthis reason, I voted against the Webb amendment No. 750.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon we voted on a \ngood government proposal that would have improved accountability for \ntaxpayer dollars. That amendment focused on grants awarded by the \nDepartment of Justice. Soon we will be voting to repeal another good \ngovernment measure; that is, the provision to ensure that government \ncontractors pay their taxes by requiring that governments withhold 3 \npercent from payments to contractors as prepayment for their taxes. The \nprovision was enacted in direct response to a series of Government \nAccountability Office, or GAO, reports about Federal contractors not \npaying their taxes.\n  I have always said that taxpayers should pay what they owe--not a \npenny more, and not a penny less. And several GAO reports indicate that \ninformation reporting and upfront withholding significantly improve \ncompliance. In fact, that is why the Federal Government withholds taxes \nfrom individual paychecks.\n  Since the provision was enacted, I have heard repeatedly about the \ncosts of implementation. I am disappointed by the misinformation that \nhas been spread by the various outside groups--just like the ones that \nlobbied against my Justice Department grant amendment today.\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\n  Specifically, one fictitious estimate by an outside group states that \nthe cost to implement this provision is $75 billion. There is another \nmade-up estimate that it would cost the Department of Defense $17 \nbillion to implement this provision.\n  I have a very long history, over 30 years in the Senate, of doing \noversight of various Federal agencies. I cut my teeth in oversight by \ncombating waste, fraud, and abuse at the Defense Department. I knew \nboth the 75 billion and 17 billion numbers were bogus the first time I \nheard them.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, or the CBO, the nonpartisan, \nobjective scorekeeper for Congress, has estimated the cost of \nimplementation to the Federal Government, including the Defense \nDepartment, to be $85 million over 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I am a firm believer in reviewing laws that aren't \nworking. This provision never even had a chance to work. However, I \nhave heard from small business owners across Iowa about the burdens the \nwithholding provision would impose on them, particularly with the \neconomy still being in the dumps.\n  For that reason, I support repealing this provision. My preference \nwould have been to fix the provision so that small businesses and State \nand local governments would be exempted. However, that would have \nlikely created even more complexity.\n  Let me just say that, despite the rhetoric, large corporations would \nnot have been impacted in the same way that small businesses would have \nbeen.\n  They, especially defense and Medicare contractors, are not operating \non a cash flow basis or on profit margins of 3 percent. They are just \nriding the coattails of small businesses in pushing for repeal of this \nprovision.\n  As we proceed to vote on repeal of this provision, let me remind my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle that tax cheats are a very real \nproblem. Tax delinquent contractors continue to be awarded Federal \ncontracts, despite the administration's efforts to clamp down on \nawarding contracts to them. The most recent example is the award of \nstimulus contracts.\n  A GAO report from May of just this year indicated that $24 billion in \nFederal contracts were awarded to contractors who owed more than $750 \nmillion of back taxes. This is not chump change.\n  In the past year or so, Members of the House and Senate have \nsupported measures to ensure that Federal employees pay their taxes. \nWell, Federal contractors should not be treated any differently. The \ncountry is in the midst of an unprecedented fiscal crisis. Tax \nincreases are off the table so we need to ensure that we are collecting \nevery dollar that is owed to the Federal Government.\n  Senator Baucus and I continue to work on an alternative to 3 percent \nwithholding. This alternative would prohibit the Federal Government \nfrom awarding contracts to tax cheats.\n  In order to assist contracting agencies in identifying tax cheats, we \nwould enable those agencies to check a contractor's tax status with the \nInternal Revenue Service. This new approach would be much narrower in \nfocus than the 3 percent withholding provision. It should only impact \nthe bad actors. When we have an opportunity to consider this provision, \nI would hope that my colleagues would support us in enacting it. \nPreventing tax cheating should be a bipartisan issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE--CHANGE IN AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION ARISING FROM SECTION 511 OF THE TAX INCREASE PREVENTION AND RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005\n                                                         [In millions of dollars by fiscal year]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          2012             2013             2014             2015             2016            Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFederal Implementation Costs:\n    Nonrecurring..................................               35                0                0                0                0               35\n    Recurring.....................................               10               10               10               10               10               50\n                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Total.....................................               45               10               10               10               10               85\nCosts to Federal Contractors:\n    Nonrecurring a................................            7,500              400              400              400              400            9,100\n    Recurring b...................................\n        Financing.................................              550              550              550              550              550            2,750\n        Reporting.................................              100              100              100              100              100              500\n                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Total.................................            8,150            1,050            1,050            1,050            1,050           12,350\n \nTotal Costs.......................................            8,195            1,060            1,060            1,060            1,060           12,435\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSources: Congressional Budget Office, Department of Defense, Federal Procurement Data System.\na. Implementation costs of federal contractors are not directly billable to federal agencies. CBO expects that such costs will eventually be passed on\n  to federal agencies in the form of higher prices for goods and services, although not necessarily in the same year that those costs are incurred.\nb. Ongoing implementation costs arise from regular turnover of federal contractors. New vendors will need to modify their accounting systems to provide\n  goods and services to federal agencies.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Kohl and \nSenator Blunt for their hard work on this bill. They had to make tough \nchoices because of their tight allocation. I commend them for the \nchoices they made and agree with them. They have my full support for \nthis bill.\n  I especially want to thank them for increasing the Food and Drug \nAdministration's budget. They provided $2.5 billion which is $50 \nmillion over this year's funding level. Twenty-five cents for every \ndollar spent by consumers is for FDA-regulated products, over $1 \ntrillion worth of goods bought each year.\n  This funding increase will strengthen our food safety infrastructure \nso that the FDA can meet its increased responsibilities. It gives the \nFDA new defense capabilities to hold imported and domestic foods to the \nsame standards. It also will help Federal, State, and local officials \nprevent and more efficiently detect food safety problems. Finally, it \nincreases the FDA and State and local workforce capacity to prevent \ndeadly outbreaks.\n  Employees at the FDA are on the front lines every day to stop food \nsafety outbreaks in their tracks and get unsafe foods off of \nsupermarket shelves. We rely on the FDA more than ever to make sure the \ndrugs and medical devices we depend upon are safe and effective.\n  I have been a longtime fighter for the FDA. I have fought for years \nfor the right facilities and the right resources. I will continue to \nfight for these hard-working employees. This increase will help the FDA \ncontinue to be the gold standard in upholding drug, device, cosmetic, \nand food safety.\n  They also make nutrition assistance programs a priority, which is so \nimportant in these difficult economic times. For Women, Infants and \nChildren, they provide $6.6 billion. This funding level will meet the \nneeds of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under 5 by \nproviding nutritious foods, dietary supplements, healthy eating \ninformation, and medical referrals.\n  This bill is also very important to Maryland. It supports the hard-\nworking Federal employees at FDA and the Beltsville Agricultural \nResearch Center. Headquartered in Silver Spring, MD, FDA employs 9,400 \npeople, while BARC, located in Beltsville, MD, employs 975 Federal \nemployees, including 250 scientists. BARC is the flagship campus of the \nAgricultural Research Service. It conducts cutting-edge research to \ndevelop and transfer solutions to our Nation's most pressing \nagricultural problems. This research is impacting not just farmers but \nevery American as it relates to food safety, nutrition, and obesity. \nThey keep BARC funded at existing funding levels and protect these \njobs.\n  They also provide $16.5 million for farmers market nutrition \nprograms. This program gives WIC recipients vouchers to use at farmers \nmarkets and roadside stands to buy locally\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\ngrown fruits and vegetables. This program helps low-income women and \nchildren as well as our local farmers. In 2009, Maryland distributed \n$403,000 vouchers to 42,000 WIC clients. This also helped 260 Maryland \nfarmers sell their crops.\n  In addition, Maryland is home to two land grant institutions: \nUniversity of Maryland at College Park and University of Maryland \nEastern Shore. They rejected the House cuts to land grant university \nresearch and extension programs and keep them in good standing. These \nprograms support food and agriculture research, provide peer-reviewed, \ncompetitively awarded grants, help attract top-notch scientists, fund \nyouth programs, including 4-H, and reach out and solve community needs \nfor small farmers and business owners.\n  Maryland's No. 1 industry is agriculture. We have both the \ntraditional industry sectors and nontraditional: everything from \npoultry, to dairy to organic farms and vineyards and a specialty \nnursery industry. This bill supports these farmers and small business \nowners, but it also supports all Americans by protecting our public \nhealth and safety when it comes to our food supply, drugs, and medical \ndevices.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to thank Chairman Murray and Senator \nCollins for their hard work on this bill. I say to the Senators, you \nworked together in a bipartisan way and with collegiality. You had a \ntight allocation and had to make tough choices. But you did an \noutstanding job, and you have my full support for this bill.\n  I support this bill because it is a jobs bill. It provides formula \nfunding to the States for our highways, byways, and subways. According \nto the U.S. Department of Transportation, every $1 million spent on \ntransportation creates 13 jobs.\n  This bill will hire the construction workers and engineers to widen \nour highways and build new bridges. The bill also provides $550 million \nfor TIGER Grants, the discretionary grant program begun in the economic \nrecovery bill. This competitive grant program funds road, rail, \ntransit, and port projects.\n  This bill provides nearly $16 billion for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the current year funding level. This funding supports \nour air traffic controllers, air safety personnel, and construction \njobs at our airports.\n  This bill also provides funding to maintain the Maritime Security \nProgram. This program maintains 60 U.S. flagships, crewed by U.S. \ncitizens, to service both commercial and national security needs.\n  This bill provides $120 million for Choice Neighborhoods. Choice \nNeighborhoods uses the lessons of HOPE VI. It builds upon them to reach \nmore communities and turn ZIP Codes of poverty into healthy, vibrant \ncommunities.\n  It also provides much-needed funding for veterans' housing, a total \nof $75 million, to get them the housing help they need. Our Nation owes \nour vets a debt of gratitude, and I will keep fighting to show that \ngratitude not just with words, but with deeds.\n  For Maryland, this bill guarantees $750 million in Federal \ntransportation formula funding. Within this amount, Maryland receives \n$600 million for highways and $150 million for transit. It also \nsupports 9,750 jobs. About half of Maryland's highway and transit \ncapital projects are funded with these Federal dollars.\n  In addition, this bill funds Metro here in our Nation's capital, \nproviding $150 million for safety improvements, including new rail \ncars, track, and signal upgrades. It also guarantees Metro's $228 \nmillion in Federal formula funding for capital improvements. This \nfunding combined supports nearly 5,000 public and private sector jobs.\n  Infrastructure and housing investments are vital to sustain economic \ngrowth and create jobs. I support Senate action on multiyear \ntransportation and aviation authorization bills and infrastructure bank \nlegislation. But agreement and passage of these bills is going to take \nsome time. This appropriations bill is a jobs bill we can pass now to \nget Americans back to work in the near term.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. I am further adjusting some of those levels, specifically \nthe allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2012 \nand the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2012.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nSenator Lautenberg has offered Senate amendment No. 836 to the \nappropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and related agencies. That amendment includes $365 \nmillion in 2012 funding that is designated for disaster relief pursuant \nto the Budget Control Act of 2011. CBO estimates that budget authority \nwould result in $18 million in outlays in 2012.\n  In addition, Senator Gillibrand has offered Senate amendment No. 869 \nto the Agriculture appropriations bill. That amendment includes $110 \nmillion in 2012 funding that is designated for disaster relief pursuant \nto the Budget Control Act of 2011. CBO estimates that budget authority \nwould result in $44 million in outlays in 2012.\n  Therefore, in total, I am revising the allocation to the Committee on \nAppropriations and to the budgetary aggregates by $475 million in \nbudget authority and $62 million in outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n DETAIL ON ADJUSTMENTS TO FISCAL YEAR 2012 ALLOCATIONS TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 106 OF\n                                         THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                     Overseas\n         $s in billions               Program        Disaster        Emergency      contingency        Total\n                                     integrity        relief                        operations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmendments--Lautenberg SA 836 &\n Gillibrand SA 869:\n    Budget Authority............           0.000           0.475           0.000           0.000           0.475\n    Outlays.....................           0.000           0.062           0.000           0.000           0.062\nMemorandum 1: Breakdown of Above\n Adjustments by Category:\n    Security Budget Authority...           0.000           0.000           0.000           0.000           0.000\n    Nonsecurity Budget Authority           0.000           0.475           0.000           0.000           0.475\n    General Purpose Outlays.....           0.000           0.062           0.000           0.000           0.062\nMemorandum 2: Cumulative\n Adjustments (Includes\n Previously Filed Adjustments):\n    Budget Authority............           0.893           8.588           0.000         126.544         136.025\n    Outlays.....................           0.774           1.669          -0.007          63.568          66.004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                                                  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6853-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it has been said no one is indispensable and \nthat may be true, but next week we will test that theory after the \ndeparture of my chief of staff, Lisa Wolski. Lisa has been on my whip \nstaff since January of 2003. She started as tax counsel in my personal \noffice, because I serve on the Finance Committee, and then moved to the \nwhip office in late 2007.\n  We refer to people around here as staffers. She is more than that. \nThat name doesn't begin to encapsulate what we think of those people \nwho work with us every day and provide us with all the things we need \nto try to be successful. That certainly is Lisa Wolski. She is and \nalways has been one\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\nof my most trusted advisers. She is the gold standard of expertise and \nprofessionalism. Everything I have asked her to do she has done and \ndone well. More important, she brings to me the things she thinks I \nshould be thinking about, and more often than not that is exactly what \nI end up doing. She knows what she is talking about. She knows what I \nwant and what I need.\n  Those who work with her know she is smart, she is articulate, and \nthrough her mastery of complex policies and political savvy, she has \naccomplished great things in my whip office during the time I have been \nwhip.\n  I cannot tell you the number of people who have told me, over the \nlast several weeks since they learned she is going to be departing, how \nmuch they will miss working with her.\n  Other than her extraordinary competence and work ethic, one of the \nmany reasons I will miss her is because, as I said, I think she and I \nthink alike. That is not because she accommodated her views to mine but \nbecause she came to her views separately, from a basis of understanding \nand reason and experience and knowledge and it happens our views \ngenerally coincide. That is a happy coincidence for Member and staff, \nand in my case to have a chief of staff who shares those views with me \nhas made my job much easier and it makes work much more comfortable, to \nbe able to work in great harmony with someone on whom you rely.\n  She instinctively knows what I will think about a particular issue \nand she has always been there with good counsel and advice.\n  I wish to conclude by saying Lisa Wolski leaves behind a great \nexample for all the other staff people who work here, as well as the \nlegacy of achievement and professionalism. I know she will be a great \nsuccess in her new job--she doesn't need good luck. Her new employer \nwill be very fortunate to have her wise counsel--undoubtedly more than \nthey even know at this point. But I do know in the Senate we are going \nto miss Lisa Wolski very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6854-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6854-S6855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J.

Mr. Reinke tragically passed away on October \n18 after an accident several days earlier while he was covering the \nIndyCar race at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, KY. He was 60 years old.\n  Ed Reinke was a mentor to countless photographers throughout his \nillustrious career and leaves behind him a legacy in the photo-\njournalism industry that is admired and respected throughout the world.\n  Edward J. Reinke was born and raised in Howard County, Indiana, and \nwas a graduate of the University of IN. Ed began his photo-journalism \ncareer as an intern with the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1972. Ed worked as \na full-time staffer until 1979 when he left to work for the Associated \nPress in Cincinnati. Ed also spent several years in the Washington, DC, \nbureau and on August 31, 1987, he came to Louisville, where he became \nthe Associated Press's first staff photographer in Kentucky in 25 \nyears.\n  During his 25-plus-year career, Ed built an impressive network of \nKentucky AP-member photographers who encourage and help each other to \nthis day by contributing pictures that can be shared among all AP-\nmember newspapers. ``He was the hub of a very close-knit community,'' \nsaid John Flavell, Ed's personal friend of 25 years and photo editor at \nthe Daily Independent in Ashland, KY.\n  Ed was driven by the philosophy that good photographers make \nthemselves better by making pictures that mattered over long periods of \ntime. He spent each day attempting to fulfill his motto: ``You don't \njust take pictures, you make good pictures.'' And Ed did just that.\n  He was often selected for special events around the world such as \nSuper Bowls, World Series championships, Final Four tournaments, Summer \nand Winter Olympics, Masters and PGA Championships, President Bill \nClinton's first inauguration, and Hurricane Andrew. In Kentucky, Ed was \nthe Associated Press's lead photographer for almost every major event \nin my State's modern history, including the 2006 crash--of Comair \nFlight 5191, the 1988 Carrolton bus crash the Nation's deadliest drunk-\ndriving accident--and the Kentucky Derby every year since 1988.\n  In stark contrast to covering these somber and significant events, Ed \nhad also had the remarkable ability to find the ``quiet dignity'' in \ntobacco farmers, racetrack workers, and short-order cooks. Ed was a man \nof passion and compassion, and his life revolved around his commitment \nto his family and his work. ``His family was most important to him and \nhe wasn't shy about telling it to those who understood,'' said Flavell. \n``It was his family that made him.''\n  ``There's a big black hole in my soul and at the center of the photo-\njournalism universe with Ed Reinke gone, but it's his influence that \nwill shine the brightest,'' Flavell says in remembrance of his friend.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \nextending my greatest condolences to Mr. Reinke's mother, Margaret L. \nHarmon Reinke, his wife, Tori, and his two sons, Wilson and Graham, for \ntheir loss. Edward J. Reinke was a true inspiration to the people of \nour great Commonwealth, and photo-journalists throughout Kentucky and \nthe rest of the world owe him a debt of gratitude for the work and \nlegacy he leaves behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in \nthe Ashland Daily Independent highlighting Ed's life and achievements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [The Daily Independent, Oct. 19, 2011]\n\n                           A Great One Passes\n\n                           (By John Flavell)\n\n       Chances are you don't know the name Ed Reinke, but you've \n     seen his work grace this newspaper for decades as a venerated \n     photo-journalist with the Associated Press. He passed away \n     early Wednesday morning after suffering a brain injury at \n     Sparta Racetrack two weeks ago.\n       Ed taught the lesson that good photographers make \n     themselves better by making pictures that mattered over long \n     period of time. Within that wisdom is his credo: ``You don't \n     just take pictures, you make good pictures.'' All within the \n     confines of journalism ethics.\n       Even though he covered great events like the Olympic Games, \n     World Series, and Super Bowls, Ed could quickly find the \n     quiet dignity in tobacco farmers, racetrack workers, and \n     short-order cooks.\n       Ed was a great teacher. A college student approached Ed and \n     wanted to know why she couldn't get the nice close-ups with \n     her normal lens, pointing to his long glass. He told her she \n     was lucky, with her short lens she could get really close to \n     her subject, saying, ``The rest of us don't remember how to \n     do that.''\n       And to see him work was like watching a master's class in \n     photo-journalism far beyond the classroom or textbook. During \n     a break one Derby Week morning at Churchill Downs, Ed struck \n     up a long conversation with an elderly African-American \n     gentleman who wiped dew off the seats around the paddock. \n     After the conversation, Ed said, ``makes me wish I worked for \n     NPR.'' The photo he filed of the worker put the guy in \n     exactly the dignified light Ed brought out in the \n     conversation.\n       I repeated that story to Ed last year after he asked about \n     audio recordings I made for slideshows. He wanted to know why \n     so much effort went into the audio track and I reminded him \n     of his paddock conversation and the influence it had on me. \n     He was genuinely touched. And I was touched when he once \n     drove from Louisville to Morehead to see a show I had at \n     Morehead State University, where we had the gallery to \n     ourselves. He looked at the seemingly endless row of images \n     and said, ``You probably should have edited tighter, but I'm \n     glad you didn't. We should talk about these.'' It was a nice \n     afternoon.\n       That's the way our relationship grew over the 25 or so \n     years. Conversations were long in-between, but lasted long as \n     we caught up with the professional and personal sides of our \n     lives. We started with the utmost respect for our ingrained \n     craft and took it to the personal level as we learned--\n     through maturity--that our photography was made by what we \n     are.\n       As Ed's family grew, so did Ed. We rarely see a man of his \n     stature in photo-journalism stop in the middle of talking \n     shop to talk about his wife and sons. When they hurt, it \n     showed in his voice and mannerisms. Most of the time, though, \n     times were good and his eyes would light up. His family was \n     most important and he wasn't shy about telling it to those \n     who understood it was his family that made him.\n       When Ed and I last spoke, he called to ask if I would be \n     attending a reunion at our alma mater, Indiana University's \n     School of Journalism. We both had other commitments\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\n     that weekend, and the conversation settled into a former \n     teacher there. Although we attended the school at different \n     times, we had similar stories about the Pulitzer nominee, who \n     had photographed the desegregation clashes in Arkansas. After \n     the obligatory words of praise for our mentor, we went \n     directly to the obligatory stories about him that made us \n     laugh the most.\n       Probably what I'll miss the most are those phone calls out \n     of nowhere that started with the words, ``I sure enjoyed that \n     picture you made.'' When I told Ed I'd miss the reunion \n     because I was taking a 45 field camera to the coast, he said, \n     ``I'd sure like to see those.'' It rarely mattered what the \n     pictures were about, we had reached a point when we knew the \n     pictures were about us. I'll miss that.\n       There's a big black hole in my soul and at the center of \n     the photo-journalism universe with Ed Reinke gone, but it's \n     his influence that will shine the brightest.\n\n\n                             More on Reinke\n\n       Ed used to wear a bright red jacket, which is how people \n     could quickly find him. Early one morning at Churchill Downs, \n     Ed spotted a former Kentucky Derby winner on the track on a \n     workout. He took off the jacket, stuffed it in his camera \n     bag, and snuck away from the crowd. A couple of us watched as \n     he stalked the backside to wait for the horse to come back \n     around. Ed wasn't particularly competitive, but he didn't \n     like finding a situation only to have another photographer \n     crash in.\n       The Kentucky Derby brings in photographers from all over \n     the world. During an early morning meeting of photographers, \n     Ed spotted a well-known group standing together. ``There \n     isn't many people I really dislike at the Kentucky Derby, but \n     they're all standing right there.''\n       During a conversation at a recent Kentucky Legislative \n     session, I commented to Ed his pictures were getting better \n     with age. After the obligatory expletive, which is what I was \n     after, he said, ``Well, if it has my name on it, I'm going to \n     keep trying.''\n       Ed liked using a Wild West vocabulary. The cameras were his \n     shootin' irons. Film rolls and the cards that came later were \n     his bullets or ammo.\n       Whenever asked if he got a dunk at a basketball game, Ed \n     would point to the stands and reply, ``Nah, but you see that \n     guy up there in the stands with the white shirt? Tack \n     sharp!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6855-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6855-S6856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DREAM SABBATH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 10 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act \nlegislation that would allow a select group of immigrant students with \ngreat potential to contribute more fully to America.\n  The DREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn legal status \nif they: came to the United States as children; are long-term U.S. \nresidents; have good moral character; graduate from high school; and \ncomplete 2 years of college or military service in good standing.\n  The DREAM Act would make America a stronger country by giving these \ntalented immigrants the chance to serve in our military and contribute \nto our economy. Tens of thousands of highly qualified, well-educated \nyoung people would enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM Act becomes \nlaw. And studies have found that DREAM Act participants would \ncontribute literally trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy during \ntheir working lives.\n  These young people have overcome great obstacles to succeed. They are \nvaledictorians, star athletes, honor roll students, and R.O.T.C. \nleaders. Now they want to give back to their country. The DREAM Act \nwould give them that chance.\n  For the last 10 years I have been working on the DREAM Act, there has \nbeen one constant: strong support from the faith community. The DREAM \nAct is supported by almost every religious group you can imagine: \nCatholic, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Evangelical Christians; \nOrthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews; and Muslims, Hindus, and \nSikhs.\n  The faith community supports the DREAM Act because it is based on a \nfundamental moral principle that is shared by every religious \ntradition--it is wrong to punish children for the actions of their \nparents.\n  These students were brought to this country as children. They grew up \nhere pledging allegiance to the American flag and singing the only \nnational anthem they have ever known. They are American in their hearts \nand they should not be punished for their parents' decision to bring \nthem here.\n  During the past two months, people of faith all across this country \nhave been showing their support for the DREAM Act by observing the \nfirst-ever ``DREAM Sabbath.''\n  During the DREAM Sabbath, at churches, synagogues, mosques, and \ntemples around the country, Americans of many religious backgrounds \nhave been offering prayers for the immigrant students who would be \neligible for the DREAM Act. At many of these events, these DREAM Act \nstudents have told their stories.\n  In all, there have been more than 400 DREAM Sabbath events in 44 \nStates.\n  In June, when I announced the DREAM Sabbath, I was joined by \nreligious leaders from a great variety of faith traditions, including: \nCardinal Theodore McCarrick; Bishop Minerva Carcano of the United \nMethodist Church; Reverend Samuel Rodriguez of the National Hispanic \nChristian Leadership Conference; Reverend Derrick Harkins of the \nNational Association of Evangelicals; Bishop Richard Graham of the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America; Bishop David Jones of the \nEpiscopal Church; Rabbi Lisa Grushcow; Imam Mohamed Magid of the \nIslamic Society of North America; Sister Simone Cambell, Executive \nDirector of NETWORK; Rabbi Doug Heifetz; Dr. Fred Kniss, Provost of \nEastern Mennonite University; and Father Jacek Orzechowski, Franciscan \nFriar, the Holy Name Province.\n  The DREAM Sabbath events reflect this great religious diversity. To \ngive a few examples of the congregations who observed the DREAM \nSabbath: The First Presbyterian Church of Cheyenne, Wyoming; The \nCentral United Methodist Church in Fairmont, West Virginia; The \nUnitarian Church of Lincoln, Nebraska; Galloway Memorial Episcopal \nChurch in Elkin, North Carolina; Grace United Methodist Church in \nMissoula, Montana; Trinity Episcopal Church in Winner, South Dakota; \nThe Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops; The Florida Catholic \nConference of Bishops; and many Catholic dioceses.\n  In Tucson, AZ, the DREAM Sabbath was recognized at the National \nHispanic Evangelical Immigration Summit, a gathering of 1,200 \nEvangelical ministers. This summit was convened by Reverend Sam \nRodriguez and the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. In \nmy home State of Illinois, I observed the DREAM Sabbath at, among other \nplaces, Anshe Sholom B'nai Israel Congregation.\n  I worked with a remarkable team of leaders to put the DREAM Sabbath \ntogether. This team was led by Bill Mefford, director of civil and \nhuman rights at the United Methodist Church; Jen Smyers, associate \ndirector of immigration and refugee policy at Church World Service; and \nLiza Lieberman, grassroots policy associate at the Hebrew Immigrant Aid \nSociety. I thank them, and the Interfaith Immigration Coalition, for \ntheir leadership.\n  I would also like to thank the following individuals for their \ntremendous efforts in ensuring that the DREAM Sabbath was observed in \nnearly every State in this country:\n  Kevin Appleby and Antonio Cube, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; \nNora Skelly, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service; Patrick Carolan, \nFranciscan Action Network; Tammy Alexander, Mennonite Central \nCommittee; Larry Couch, National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the \nGood Shepherd; Sr. Mary Ellen Lacy, NETWORK: A Catholic Social Justice \nLobby; Regina McKillip, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas; Kat Liu, \nUnitarian Universalist Association; Robert Gittelson, Conservatives for \nComprehensive Immigration Reform; Jenny Yang, World Relief; and Ana \nWhite, Episcopal Church.\n  I would like to offer special thanks to Diana Villa, from United We \nDream, for working to make sure that DREAM Act students could attend \nmany of these DREAM Sabbath events and share their moving stories.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all of the Dreamers, as DREAM Act \nstudents call themselves, for having the courage and persistence to \ncontinue the fight for the DREAM Act.\n  If anyone is interested in becoming part of this important national \nmovement, they can visit www.dreamsabbath.org or call my office at 202-\n224-2152.\n  The DREAM Sabbath is putting a human face on the plight of \nundocumented students who grew up in this country and will help build \nsupport for passage of the DREAM Act. Again, I thank all those who \nworked so hard to make DREAM Sabbath a reality. Because of these \nleaders, DREAM Act\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\nstudents remain in the prayers of the many thousands of Americans who \nhave attended DREAM Sabbath events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6856-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6856-S6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LIVESTOCK COMPETITION RULE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout the decades since the Packers \nand Stockyards Act was enacted in 1921, livestock and poultry producers \nand growers have depended upon the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nenforce basic rules of honest dealing, fairness, and nondiscriminatory \ntreatment when livestock and poultry growers and producers engage in \nsales and contractual transactions with meat and poultry packers, \nprocessors, and dealers.\n  The underlying justification for the Packers and Stockyards Act, and \nthe regulations that have been issued to carry it out, is basic and \nstraightforward. There is inherently a substantial inequality in \nbargaining power and economic leverage between the individual producer \nor grower of hogs, or cattle, or poultry, on the one hand, and the \npacking or processing company on the other hand. That is not to accuse \nor disparage the packers and processors, but simply to recognize the \ninherent disparities in economic power in the real world. It is \naccordingly only reasonable to have some basic Federal rules of the \nroad, so to speak, because livestock and poultry production and \nprocessing is a national industry of huge importance to our country and \nits economy.\n  For many years we have heard repeated testimony before Congress that \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act is not being carried out by the \nDepartment of Agriculture, specifically by the Grain Inspection, \nPackers and Stockyards Administration, in a manner that fully and \neffectively lives up to the language of the statute, its intent, and \npurposes. For that reason, in crafting the Food, Conservation, and \nEnergy Act of 2008, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, I was proud to work with my colleagues in the \ncommittee and with our counterparts in the House of Representatives to \ninclude language directing the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new \nregulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act that would clarify \ncriteria and interpretations for carrying out and enforcing the act. \nThese new regulations are required to establish criteria that the \nDepartment of Agriculture will use in determining whether the actions \nof a packer or processor constitute an undue or unreasonable preference \nor advantage for one or more producers or growers to the disadvantage \nof others, in violation of the act; whether a live poultry dealer has \nprovided reasonable notice for suspending the delivery of birds to a \ngrower under a poultry growing contract; under what circumstances it \nwould be an unfair practice in violation of the act for a packer or \nprocessor to require a swine or poultry grower to make additional \ncapital investments during the life of a contractual arrangement; and \nwhether a live poultry dealer or swine contractor has provided a \nreasonable period of time for a swine or poultry contract grower to \nremedy a breach or failure to perform in order to avoid termination of \nthe contract.\n  In accordance with the farm bill, the Department of Agriculture \nissued a proposed rule on June 22, 2010, and kept the public comment \nperiod open until November 22, 2010. Some 61,000 comments were \nsubmitted, which the department has been reviewing and responding to in \nthe process of developing a final rule. The proposed rule is not \nperfect, of course. That is why there is a public comment process so \nthat anyone who is interested can comment and make recommendations. \nSecretary of Agriculture Vilsack has made it very clear that the \ncomments were being carefully reviewed so that the proposed rule can be \nappropriately modified and improved in response to the comments.\n  Contrary to some of the arguments that are being made, the topics and \nsubject matter covered in the proposed rule, and which therefore likely \nwould be encompassed in the final rule, are entirely consistent with \nthe rulemaking process that the 2008 farm bill directed the Secretary \nof Agriculture to conduct and with the authority provided by the \nPackers and Stockyards Act. It is not at all correct to assert that the \nDepartment of Agriculture has exceeded its authority or in some manner \nor contradicted the farm bill's directive to issue regulations on \nspecified matter.\n  It is true the proposed rule would do more to interpret and clarify \nterms in the Packers and Stockyards Act than is specifically required \nin the farm bill. Most important, the proposed rule would clarify what \nmany believe to be a misinterpretation of the act by some courts that \nhave held that an individual grower or producer cannot succeed on a \nclaim for harm suffered from a violation of the act without an \nadditional showing of harm to competition in the broader market. The \neffect of these holdings is effectively to deny relief to independent \nproducers and growers for harm caused by unjust, discriminatory, or \nunfair practices, which are clearly in violation of the act's \nprotections, unless they can show the broader injury to competition. \nThat showing of injury to competition in the broader market is usually \nvery hard or impossible to make. What is lost in these decisions is \nthat the Packers and Stockyards Act was written and intended to provide \nprotection to individual producers and growers against harm from \nunfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices and similar \nactions by packers, processors, and dealers. The act was not written or \nintended to require that harm to competition in the broader market must \nbe shown in order to establish a violation.\n  The Department of Agriculture clearly has the authority to issue \nregulations to clarify interpretations of the Packers and Stockyards \nAct in order to ensure that it is properly carried out. This authority \nof a department or agency to issue regulations that will clarify the \ninterpretation of a statute within its purview is fully supported by \nbasic principles of administrative law established in the decisions of \nthe Supreme Court and other Federal courts. Claims that in some way the \nproposed rule exceeds the authority of the Department of Agriculture \nare plainly unfounded.\n  As for the details of the proposed rule, it is not designed or \nintended to put an end to systems in which packers pay premiums for \nhigher quality or distinctive livestock, for example, ``Certified \nAngus'' beef, or assess a discount if animals fail to meet standards. \nThe proposed rule is quite clear that it is not designed to prohibit \npremiums and price differentials that are based on the quality of the \nlivestock or poultry or similar features or circumstances. Because \nthere is a valid economic justification for quality-based premiums and \ndiscounts, they are not prohibited by the Packers and Stockyards Act. \nAccordingly, the proposed rule is clear that such quality-based \npremiums or discounts are entirely valid and won't be prohibited or \njeopardized by the final rule. It just stands to reason, that since \nthere is now obviously economic justification and reward to packers as \nwell as producers for these systems of quality-based premiums and \ndiscounts, there will still be incentives and motivation to keep them \nin place after the final rule is issued.\n  Finally, regarding the claims that the proposed rule will be very \ncostly and eliminate jobs, the short answer is that these studies, as I \nunderstand them, are founded on basic misreading and \nmischaracterization of the terms and intent of the proposed rule and \nupon misguided and exaggerated predictions of the effects of carrying \nit out. They are undoubtedly very extreme predictions of the effects of \na rule that is designed and intended, fundamentally, to do no more than \nsimply to ensure fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of livestock and \npoultry producers and growers in the market.\n  This rule is vitally important to producers and growers across our \ncountry. We should not in legislation prevent the Department of \nAgriculture from going ahead to make improvements and modifications and \nissue a final rule that is greatly needed to enhance the effectiveness \nof the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I rise to reiterate \nand again offer my full support of the United States Department of \nAgriculture Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration's, \nGIPSA, authority to continue promulgating its proposed rule concerning \nlivestock competition. There have been some comments made with concern \nabout both the substance of GIPSA's proposed rule as well as the \nauthority of\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nthe Department to continue its rulemaking process. I would like to \nrespond to some of those concerns and to discuss the critical \nimportance of the protections afforded under the proposed rule.\n  The 2008 Farm Bill, more formally known as the Food, Conservation, \nand Energy Act of 2008, was enacted by overwhelming majorities in both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate with amendments to the \nPackers and Stockyards Act of 1921 as well as directions to USDA to \nconduct rulemaking with respect to additional issues relating to \nimplementation and enforcement. As a result of this rulemaking \nauthority, as well as given the authorities permitted explicitly in the \nPackers and Stockyards Act, GIPSA in 2010 issued a proposed rule that \nwould provide a variety of new protections for livestock producers. \nAmong these protections would be to further define practices that are \nunfair, unjustly discriminatory or deceptive, establish new protections \nfor producers required to provide expensive capital upgrades to their \ngrowing facilities, prohibit packers from purchasing, acquiring or \nreceiving livestock from other packers, and bar them from communicating \nprices to competitors, as well as including arbitration provisions that \ngive contract growers opportunities to participate in meaningful \narbitration. The Department has not yet published a final rule.\n  In August 2010, I joined with Senator Harkin in leading a bipartisan \nletter with 19 of our Senate colleagues to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack \nthat reiterated our belief that GIPSA has the authority to promulgate \nsuch rules as is consistent with its responsibilities under the Packers \nand Stockyards Act and that the rules should and will allow for \ncontinued marketing opportunities including pricing premiums and \ncontracting.\n  I am fully supportive of the proposed rule as I have consistently \nsupported efforts to strengthen our anti-trust and competition laws. \nIndependent farmers and ranchers must have an opportunity to leverage a \ndecent price for their products. Market consolidation has done a severe \ndisservice to our producers, and it is critically important that we \nmaintain market access and price discovery options for independent \nfarmers and ranchers. I am also fully supportive of GIPSA's authority \nto continue the rulemaking process as directed in the 2008 farm bill. \nThe proposed rule takes an important first step toward finally enabling \nlivestock producers to get a fair shake in the marketplace.\n  Opponents of the rule were able to include a provision in the House-\npassed version of the Fiscal Year 2012 Agriculture Appropriations bill \nwhich prohibits GIPSA from spending funds to finalize the proposed \nrule. A letter written by 190 organizations from across the country, \nincluding the South Dakota Farmers Union, the South Dakota Livestock \nAuctions Markets Association, and the South Dakota Stockgrowers \nAssociation, was recently sent to Congress outlining the important \nprotections provided for in the proposed rule and urging Congress to \nallow the rulemaking process to continue. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter be printed in the Record. Fortunately, the Senate version \ndoes not contain this provision. As the appropriations process \ncontinues, I will work to defend GIPSA's ability to continue the \nrulemaking process, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   August 3, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: In the 2008 Farm Bill, Congress directed USDA \n     to propose rules to address unfair, deceptive and anti-\n     competitive trade practices that have become rampant in the \n     livestock and poultry sectors. Congress included these \n     provisions to address concerns over the increasingly abusive \n     and anti-competitive trade practices employed by meatpacker \n     and poultry companies that have harmed farmers, ranchers, \n     growers and consumers. Meatpacker and poultry companies \n     opposed these provisions in the Senate, but compromise \n     language was included in the final Farm Bill requiring USDA \n     to use their existing authority under the 1921 Packers & \n     Stockyard Act to take action.\n       USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \n     Administration (GIPSA) issued a proposed rule in June 2010. \n     USDA received more than 66,000 public comments on the \n     proposed rule, most of which were supportive. The same \n     meatpacker and poultry companies that opposed the strong \n     farmer and rancher protection provisions in the 2008 Farm \n     Bill are now fighting the regulations to implement those \n     provisions. These special interests, joined by purported farm \n     groups that have meatpackers entrenched on their boards, have \n     launched a misleading public relations campaign that distorts \n     the provisions of the proposed rule.\n       The proposed rule includes many commonsense measures that \n     protect farmers, growers and ranchers from abusive and unfair \n     treatment at the hands of the meatpackers and poultry \n     companies. These safeguards include:\n       Prohibitions against company retaliation against farmers \n     for speaking out about problems within the livestock \n     industry, joining other farmers to voice concerns to seek \n     improvements, or raising concerns with federal officials. \n     Today, meatpackers and poultry companies can and do \n     economically retaliate against farmers that exercise these \n     legal rights;\n       Sensible protections for contract poultry and hog growers \n     that make expensive facility investments or upgrades on their \n     farms to meet packer or poultry company requirements;\n       Requirements to provide growers and ranchers with \n     information necessary to make wise business decisions \n     regarding their operations;\n       Disclosure and transparency requirements to eliminate \n     deception in the way packers, swine contractor and poultry \n     companies pay farmers;\n       Eliminating collusion between packers in auction markets;\n       Clarification of the types of industry practices the agency \n     considers unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or a granting of \n     unreasonable preference or advantage.\n       These are all terms used in the existing statute to prevent \n     unfair trade practices, but these broad terms have never been \n     defined in regulations.\n       Clarifying the ambiguity in interpretation of the terms of \n     the Packers & Stockyards Act. Such ambiguity can lead to \n     litigation as farmers and packers attempt to clarify the \n     intent of the Act. Moreover, added clarity would enable the \n     agency to address unfair trade practices, which likely would \n     further reduce litigation.\n       Expressly ensuring that meatpackers can pay premium prices \n     for premium livestock, but prohibit companies from unfairly \n     offering select producers sweetheart deals but paying other \n     producers less for the same quality, number, kind and \n     delivery of livestock.\n       Recordkeeping requirements that would enable regulators to \n     identify unfair trade practices while ensuring that livestock \n     producers and companies can offer justified premiums or \n     discounts.\n       Unfortunately, under pressure from meatpackers and poultry \n     companies, the House approved a legislative rider in its FY \n     2012 Agriculture Appropriations bill that would prevent USDA \n     from taking any further action on this regulation. The \n     provision would even prohibit USDA from analyzing the 66,000 \n     public comments received on the proposed rule and from \n     completing an economic analysis of the rule. The meatpackers \n     and poultry companies oppose the sensible transparency and \n     disclosure provisions of the proposed rule that would shine \n     sunlight onto their unfair practices. The two largest general \n     farm organizations in the United States--the American Farm \n     Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union--have joined \n     with over 140 farmers, consumer and community groups across \n     the nation to oppose this rider.\n       The 190 undersigned groups urge you to stand with our \n     nation's farmers, ranchers, growers and consumers to oppose \n     the meatpacker and poultry special interest efforts to \n     insulate themselves from federal scrutiny of their anti-\n     competitive behavior and unfair treatment of farmers and \n     ranchers. Congress should allow USDA to move forward \n     expeditiously to implement a final rule that will strengthen \n     and clarify the Packers & Stockyards Act with commonsense \n     protections for farmers and ranchers.\n       8th Day Center for Justice (IL), Adams County North Dakota \n     Farmers Union, Added Value (NY), Alabama Contract Poultry \n     Growers Association, Alliance for a Sustainable Future (PA), \n     Ambler Environmental Advisory Council (PA), American \n     Agriculture Movement, American Federation of Government \n     Employees (AFL-CIO), Local 3354, USDA-St. Louis, American Raw \n     Milk Producers Pricing Association (WI), Ashtabula, Geauga, \n     Lake Counties Farmers Union (OH), Assateague Coastal Trust \n     (MD), Assateague COASTKEEPER (MD), Black Farmers and \n     Agriculturalists Association (BFAA) (NC), BLK ProjeK (NY), \n     BUGS: Black Urban Growers (NY), Bronx Food and Sustainability \n     Coalition (NY), Brooklyn Food Coalition (NY), Buckeye Quality \n     Beef Association (OH), Bull Mountain Landowners Association \n     (MT), California Dairy Campaign, California Farmers Union, \n     California Food & Justice Coalition, California Institute for \n     Rural Studies, Campaign for Contract Agriculture Reform, \n     Campaign for Family Farms & the Environment (CFFE), Carolina \n     Farm Stewardship Association, C.A.S.A. del Llano (TX), \n     Catholic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri, Cattle \n     Producers of Louisiana, Cattle Producers of Washington, \n     Center for New Community (IL), Center for Rural Affairs,\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\n     Church Women United of New York State, Citizens for \n     Pennsylvania's Future (PennFuture) Citizens for Sanity.Com \n     (FL), Colorado Independent CattleGrowers Association, and \n     Columban Center for Advocacy and Outreach (MD).\n       Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF) (CA), \n     Community Farm Alliance (KY), Community Food Security \n     Coalition, Community Vision Council (NY), Contract Poultry \n     Growers of the Virginias, The Cornucopia Institute (WI), \n     Crawford Stewardship Project (WI), Cumberland Countians for \n     Peace & Justice, (TN), Dakota Resource Council (ND), Dakota \n     Rural Action (SD), Dawson Resource Council (MT), Delta \n     Enterprise Network (AR), Earthworks Urban Farm, East New York \n     Farms!/United Community Centers, Endangered Habitats League \n     (CA), Environment Maryland, Environmental Health Watch (OH), \n     Family Farm Defenders (WI), Farm Aid, Farm and Ranch Freedom \n     Alliance (TX), Farmworker Association of Florida, Fay-Penn \n     Economic Development Council (PA), Federation of Southern \n     Cooperatives, First Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbus \n     (OH), Flatbush Farm Share (NY), Food Chain Workers Alliance \n     (CA) Food Democracy Now!

    \n\n[Pages S6858-S6859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               YOM KIPPUR'S LESSONS IN IRENE'S AFTERMATH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently in my State, as throughout the \nworld, Yom Kippur was celebrated. This beginning of the Jewish year \ncomes as Vermonters and residents of other States are struggling to \nregain their footing and to renew their lives and livelihoods after the \ndevastation wrought by Hurricane and Tropical Storm Irene.\n  Vermonters of all faiths can take heart and inspiration from the \nthoughts about the meaning of the Yom Kippur observance, in the context \nof the aftermath of this natural disaster, which were presented in a \nrecent essay published in the Rutland Herald and the Huffington Post. \nIt was written by my good friend, Rabbi Michael Cohen. Vermonters' \nresilience in the face of this devastation and its lingering challenges \ntruly has been remarkable. I commend Rabbi Cohen's message to the \nSenate's attention, and I ask unanimous consent that his essay be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be prined in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Beginning the Jewish Year in the Aftermath of Hurricane Irene\n\n                        (By Rabbi Michael Cohen)\n\n       Acting as a leitmotif rain lightly showers the beginning of \n     the Jewish year. The powerful song Avinu Malkeiyu, Our \n     Father, Our King sung on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur was \n     written by the first and second century Rabbi Akiva as a \n     prayer for rain during a drought (Babylonian Talmud Taanit \n     25b). During the holiday of Sukkot, while the ancient Temple \n     stood in Jerusalem, the ceremony of drawing of the water, \n     Simchat Beit Ha-Shoeva was performed. It was said in the \n     Babylonian Talmud (Sukkot 51b), the rabbinic discussion of \n     Jewish law, that ``One who has not seen the joy of Simchat \n     Beit Ha-Shoeva has never seen true joy.'' Finally on Shemni \n     Etzeret, the one day holiday after Sukkot, Tefilat HaGeshem, \n     the Prayer for Rain is recited even to this day. With Judaism \n     arising out of a parched region of the world when it comes to \n     rain and water it is not surprising that such an emphasis is \n     placed on them.\n       For those of us living in parts of the United States where \n     the effects of Hurricane Irene are still an all too real \n     reality the thought of praying for rain can be somewhat \n     jarring. That being the case, what can the holidays at the \n     beginning of the Jewish year offer us in the wake of Irene? \n     The symbol most associated with the Jewish New Year is the \n     shofar, the ram's horn blown during Rosh Hashanah and at the \n     end of Yom Kippur. In the Torah, the five books of Moses, \n     Rosh Hashanah is actually called yom teruah, the day of \n     blowing (the shofar). There are numerous explanations why the \n     shofar is blown on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; it is also \n     blown every weekday during the month of Elul, the month \n     before Rosh Hashanah. One explanation that addresses those of \n     us who felt the wrath of Irene is taught by Rabbi Art Green. \n     In the Machzor, a prayerbook for the Jewish holidays, of the \n     Reconstructionist movement called Kol HaNeshamah Rabbi \n     Green writes:\n       The shofar sound represents prayer beyond words, an \n     intensity of longing that can only be articulated in a \n     wordless shout. But the order of the sounds, according to one \n     old interpretation, contains the message in quite explicit \n     terms. Each series of shofar blasts begins with tekiyah, a \n     whole sound. It is followed by shevarim, a tripartite broken \n     sound whose very name means ``breakings.'' ``I started off \n     whole'' the shofar speech says, ``and I became broken.'' Then \n     follows teruah, a staccato series of blast fragments, saying: \n     ``I was entirely smashed to pieces.'' But each series has to \n     end with a new tekiah, promising wholeness once more. The \n     shofar cries out a hundred times on Rosh Hashanah: ``I was \n     whole, I was broken, even smashed to bits, but I shall be \n     whole again!''\n       Hurricane Irene literally and figuratively broke in some \n     cases, and smashed in other cases, people, their lives, and \n     their possessions. The road to wholeness for some was quick, \n     for others longer, and for some they are still a traveler on \n     that journey. The message of the shofar, as taught by Rabbi \n     Green, can help remind us not to lose hope along that path. A \n     similar message is also taught during the Jewish High \n     Holidays, but in a different way.\n       According to the traditional reading of the Bible, Moses \n     received the Ten Commandments, called Aseret HaD'varim, \n     literally the Ten Words, (Exodus 34:28) on the 17th of\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\n     the Hebrew month of Tammuz. On that same day, ``Moses came \n     near the camp and saw the calf (idol) and the dancing, he \n     became enraged; and he hurled the tablets from his hands and \n     shattered them at the foot of the mountain.'' (Exodus 32: 19) \n     One can argue that the pinnacle of his life's work was the \n     receiving of the Ten Commandments; and there they lay \n     shattered at his feet. Moses could have given up then, but he \n     did not. Rather he climbed back up Mt. Sinai on the 1st of \n     Elul and remained there for 40 days. Remember, according to \n     the text he is 80 years old at the time. While up there he \n     asked to see God face to face, but God told him that that \n     would be impossible as he could not survive such an encounter \n     and live.\n       God tells Moses, after Moses carves a second set of blank \n     tablets that God will write the Ten Commandments on again, to \n     go to a crack in the mountain. At that point, as God's back \n     passes before Moses God reveals his essential attributes, \n     ``The Lord! the Lord! a God compassionate and generous, slow \n     to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness, extending \n     kindness to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, \n     transgression, and sin.'' (Exodus 34: These attributes are \n     sung as part of the liturgy of the Jewish holidays at the \n     beginning of the year, as well as at other holidays during \n     the year. At the beginning of the year they remind us when \n     Moses was back up on Mt. Sinai and when he returned to the \n     people with the new set of tablets 40 days later on Yom \n     Kippur.\n       Moses climbing back up the mountain serves as an important \n     model for all of us, not just those dealing with the \n     aftermath of Hurricane Irene. We all have moments in our \n     lives when something has been shattered. Often the easiest \n     way to deal with that new reality is to run away from it. \n     That is not what the actions of Moses tell us to do. When \n     Moses finds his life's work shattered in front of him he \n     turns back and retraces his steps up that steep mountain. The \n     word for repentance, the main theme of the holidays at the \n     beginning of the Jewish new year, in Hebrew is teshuvah which \n     means to return. Both the cycles of the shofar's notes and \n     the model of Moses returning to get a new set of tablets \n     provide us with a way to address what may have been shattered \n     by Hurricane Irene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6859-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6859-S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 20 years ago this week Justice Clarence \nThomas took his seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. With \nthe expectation that these are only the first two of his decades on the \nCourt, I want to offer a few thoughts about Clarence Thomas, both as a \njudge and as a person.\n  Clarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pinpoint, GA. Poverty \nand segregation contributed to how he understands the past, present, \nand future of our country but, as he has often said, rising above and \ngrowing beyond difficulties is more important than the difficulties \nthemselves. That is a powerful part of his life and the hope that his \nlife represents for us all. Helping him on that path were his maternal \ngrandparents, Myers and Christine Anderson, with whom he lived after \nthe age of 7 and whose influence shaped his character. Few books have \nhad a more poignant title than Justice Thomas' autobiography, My \nGrandfather's Son, for that is exactly what he was then and remains \ntoday.\n  Clarence Thomas was an honor student in high school and the first \nperson in his family to attend college. He graduated cum laude from \nHoly Cross College with a degree in English literature and in 1974 \nreceived his law degree from Yale. After serving as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of Missouri under then-Missouri Attorney General John Ashcroft \nand a stint with the Monsanto Corporation, Thomas accompanied Senator \nJohn Ashcroft here to this body as a legislative assistant specializing \nin energy issues.\n  President Reagan appointed Clarence Thomas first to be an Assistant \nSecretary of Education and then Chairman of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission. He remains the longest serving chairman in EEOC \nhistory. After he left for the judiciary, EEOC employees used their own \npersonal funds to purchase a plaque for the lobby.\n  Here is what it said:\n\n       Clarence Thomas, Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission . . . is honored here by the \n     Commission and its employees, with this expression of our \n     respect and profound appreciation for his dedicated \n     leadership exemplified by his personal integrity and \n     unwavering commitments to freedom, justice, and equality of \n     opportunity, and to the highest standards of government.\n\n  President George H.W. Bush appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit in 1990 and to the Supreme Court in 1991.\n  So much can be said about any life and career, let alone one that is \nalready so full and rich. Analysts and pundits, admirers and enemies, \nlawyer or layman, nearly everyone has at least an impression of Justice \nThomas, and nearly as many have an opinion. The Internet and library \nshelves are rapidly filling with commentary, analysis, biography, and \neven psychoanalysis. I will not attempt to do anything so sweeping, but \nsimply offer a few observations about Clarence Thomas as a judge and as \na person.\n  Professor Gary McDowell wrote at the time of Justice Thomas' \nappointment that the ``true bone of contention here is . . . the proper \nrole of the Court in American society, and the about the nature and \nextent of judicial power under a written Constitution.'' That is the \nbone of contention in every judicial confirmation because the debate \nover judicial appointments is really a debate over judicial power.\n  In general, the judicial power provided by Article III of the \nConstitution means that Federal judges interpret and apply written law \nto decide cases. The main source of judicial appointment controversy is \nabout how judges should do the first of these tasks, how they should \ninterpret written law such as statutes and, especially, the \nConstitution.\n  Legislatures choose the words of statutes, and the people choose the \nwords of the Constitution. Judges may not pick the words of our laws, \nbut they do have to figure out what those words mean so that they can \ndecide cases. The dispute over judicial appointments is over whether \nthe meaning of our laws comes from those who make our laws or from \njudges who interpret them.\n  There are innumerable variations and applications of these two \ngeneral approaches. After all, we lawyers spend three or more grueling \nyears learning how to make words mean whatever we want, to split a \nsingle legal hair at least six different ways, and to make the simple \nmasquerade as the profound. But at its core, the battle over judicial \nappointments is about whether statutes mean what the legislature meant, \nand whether the Constitution means what the people meant. The \nalternative is an increasingly powerful judiciary, able to change our \nlaws by changing their meaning.\n  Justice Thomas refuses to go there. Shortly after he became an \nappeals court judge in 1990, he was speaking to a friend and reflecting \non his new judicial role.\n  He had, as I described a minute ago, worked in the legislative and \nexecutive branches and was actively involved in the process of \ndeveloping policy and making law. Now, he told his friend, ``whenever I \nput on my robe I have to remind myself that I am only a judge.''\n  Only a judge. That statement almost does not compute in 21st century \nAmerica. Judges today are asked, and many gladly accept the invitation, \nto solve our problems, heal our wounds, revise our values, reconfigure \nour rights, and even restructure our economy. We have traveled far from \nAlexander Hamilton calling the judiciary the weakest and least \ndangerous branch to Charles Evans Hughes saying that the Constitution \nis whatever the judges say it is.\n  That is the wrong direction for Justice Thomas. His view that he is \nonly a judge means that while judges alone may properly play the \njudicial role, that judicial role is part of a larger system of \ngovernment, which operates within a much larger culture and society.\n  Liberty requires that government, including judges, stay within their \nproper bounds and allow people to make their own decisions and live \ntheir own lives. Justice Thomas' view that liberty requires limits on \ngovernment, including on the judiciary, parallels the very principles \non which our country was founded and which are necessary for us to \nremain free.\n  But for him this is more than theoretical. James Madison had said \nthat if men were angels, no government would be necessary and if angels \ngoverned men, no limits on government would be necessary. Justice \nThomas not only knows those as axioms, but literally as life lessons. \nGrowing up in poverty and segregation, he experienced the dark side of \nhuman nature. Studying and working in government, he knows the damage \nit can do when government exceeds its proper limits.\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\n  The Senate knew from the beginning what kind of Judge Clarence Thomas \nwould be. While still EEOC chairman, he had written about a judiciary \n``active in defending the Constitution but judicious in its restraint \nand moderation.'' At the Judiciary Committee hearing for his appeals \ncourt appointment, he said unambiguously that the ultimate purpose of \nboth statutory construction and constitutional interpretation is to \ndetermine what the authors of the law intended. And he would later \nwrite in a concurring opinion on the Supreme Court: ``Though the \ntemptation may be great, we must not succumb. The Constitution is not a \nlicense for federal judges to further social policy goals.''\n  In my opening statement at Justice Thomas' hearing, I said that ``I \nam confident that Judge Thomas will interpret the law according to its \noriginal meaning, rather than substitute his own policy preferences for \nthe law.'' That is the kind of judge America needs, and that is what \nJustice Thomas has consistently been for the past two decades.\n  Those who opposed Justice Thomas' appointment, and who continue to \ncriticize his service, take the opposite view. They believe that the \nConstitution is a license for Federal judges to further social policy \ngoals. When I look at the social policy goals these folks want to \nfurther, I am not surprised. Their political agenda is, to put it \nmildly, unpopular with the American people and, therefore, unsuccessful \nin legislatures. The only way for them to win is to impose their agenda \nthrough the courts and that requires judges willing to do the imposing. \nJustice Thomas is not their kind of judge.\n  Those whose political fortunes depend on political judges went to \nextraordinary lengths to keep Justice Thomas off the Supreme Court. \nWhen their efforts failed, they have gone to great lengths to belittle \nand smear his service on the Court. For years, they said that Justice \nThomas was simply parroting his fellow originalist, Justice Scalia, \nsince they vote the same way so often. As recounted in the book Supreme \nDiscomfort, Justice Scalia said that this criticism is nothing but a \nslur on both him and Justice Thomas. He said: ``The myth's persistence \nis either racist or it's political hatred.''\n  Liberals never even mentioned, let alone criticized, that Justice \nThurgood Marshall voted even more often with fellow activist Justice \nWilliam Brennan. Why the double standard? Because liberals like \nactivist judges such as Marshall and don't like restrained judges such \nas Thomas. The real point, after all, is not that two Justices agree \nbut what they agree on.\n  Or some take pot shots at the fact that Justice Thomas asks few \nquestions in oral argument. Needless to say, if he did speak up more \noften, these same folks would nit-pick what he said. Justice Thomas has \nsaid that the purpose of oral argument is for him to listen to the \nlawyers, not for the lawyers to listen to him.\n  Other critics just call him names. In 1992, the New York Times called \nhim the youngest, cruelest justice for his dissent in an Eighth \nAmendment case. Fast forward to this year, with Slate writer Dahlia \nLithwick calling him cruel and saying that he wrote ``one of the \nmeanest Supreme Court decisions ever.'' Anyone who knows Justice Thomas \nknows that he just does not care how papers or pundits feel about his \nopinions. The way many of them report or comment on his work, it's \ndoubtful they even read his opinions.\n  No, Justice Thomas does not care how critics feel, he cares only \nwhether he gets each case right and applies the law impartially. \nJustice Thomas believes that our system of government and our written \nConstitution define his judicial role and that he has no authority to \ndo otherwise. He is both principled and independent.\n  These are not attacks on Clarence Thomas the man, or even on Clarence \nThomas the Justice. Many times, they are really attacks on the kind of \nJustice that he represents. Many times, they are attacks on the idea \nthat the Constitution is fixed and sure rather than malleable, that the \nConstitution belongs to the people rather than to judges, that the \nConstitution trumps politics.\n  I believe today what I said in Justice Thomas' hearing, that these \nopponents actually fear that he will in fact be faithful to the \nConstitution and to federal laws as we enact them, rather than to their \npolitical agenda. Frankly, I am pleased to say that he has confirmed \nthat fear because Justice Thomas has steadfastly kept the Constitution, \nrather than any political agenda, as his guide. The truth is that he is \nwriting some of the most persuasive, profound, and powerful opinions on \nthe Supreme Court today.\n  As a Justice, Clarence Thomas has had a significant impact on our \ncountry and on the law. As a person, Clarence Thomas has similarly had \na profound impact on people's lives. These certainly include the dozens \nof women and men who have served as his law clerks through the years. I \ninvited some of them to write letters offering their own reflections \nand I will ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks. I urge my colleagues to read them. Some of \nthem include erudite analysis of Justice Thomas' approach to judging. \nYou don't get to be a Supreme Court clerk, after all, without at least \nthe potential for erudition. But every one of them includes personal \nanecdotes and memories about how Justice Thomas continues to impact \ntheir lives.\n  Federal judges in general, and Supreme Court Justices in particular, \nreceive dozens and even hundreds of invitations to speak at events of \nall kinds. Justices appear at grand podiums in the great halls of the \nnation's most prestigious academic institutions. Justice Thomas, \nhowever, is more likely to be found speaking at schools known little \nbeyond the communities they serve.\n  Or speaking to young people who are trying to get their lives back on \ntrack. On June 17, 1997, Justice Thomas gave a most memorable \ngraduation address. The institution was Youth for Tomorrow, a \nresidential program for at-risk youth founded by former Washington \nRedskins head coach Joe Gibbs. The website of this wonderful program \nstates its mission: to provide these young people the opportunity and \nmotivation to focus their lives and develop the confidence, skills, \nintellectual ability, spiritual insight and moral integrity to become \nresponsible and productive members of society.\n  June is the busiest month of the Supreme Court's term, with Justices \nand clerks working longer and longer days to complete opinions for the \nterm's hardest cases. This graduation was on a weekday, and Youth for \nTomorrow is located out in Prince William County. But none of that \nmattered to Justice Thomas. On that day, just one young man received a \nhigh school diploma.\n  That's right, Justice Thomas was the commencement speaker for a high \nschool class of one. When that young man says that Justice Thomas was \nhis high school graduation speaker, he really means it.\n  Justice Thomas applauded the decisions that the young men in the \nYouth for Tomorrow program were now making. He was proud to come to \nthem as a speaker, he said, rather than to have them come before him as \na judge.\n  Let me close by returning to the words of that plaque placed by EEOC \nemployees.\n  Through turbulence and calm, highs and lows, controversy and \nconsensus, Justice Clarence Thomas continues to exemplify personal \nintegrity and unwavering commitment to freedom, justice, and equality \nof opportunity, and to the highest standards of government. He may be \nonly a judge, but Justice Clarence Thomas is truly a force for good in \nour country.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n         University of California, Berkeley, School of Law,\n                                    Berkeley, CA, October 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     United States Senator,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for your speech commemorating \n     the twentieth anniversary of the United States Senate's \n     confirmation of Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of \n     the United States Supreme Court. I am honored that you asked \n     me, a former clerk to Justice Thomas and former general \n     counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee during your \n     chairmanship, to contribute this letter for the Congressional \n     Record. Without your irreplaceable leadership, Justice Thomas \n     could never have been\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\n     confirmed, so you have been responsible for the two most \n     important years of my career.\n       Historians will always record that Justice Thomas was the \n     second African-American to serve on the Supreme Court, \n     following the great Thurgood Marshall. But this symbolism is \n     of secondary importance. Justice Thomas's contribution to our \n     Supreme Court is his powerful intellect and his unique \n     commitment to the principle that the Constitution means what \n     the framers thought it meant.\n       This can make Justice Thomas unpredictable to those who \n     view Supreme Court decisions through a partisan lens. He \n     agrees, for example, that the use of thermal imaging \n     technology by police in the street to scan for marijuana in \n     homes violates the Constitution's ban on unreasonable \n     searches. He opposes the Court's effort to place caps on \n     punitive damages as a violation of our federal system of \n     government. He has voted to strike down literally thousands \n     of harsher criminal sentences because they were based on \n     facts found by judges rather than juries, as required by the \n     Bill of Rights. He supports the right of anonymous political \n     speech, and wants advertising and other commercial speech to \n     receive the same rights as political speech, because he \n     believes them protected by the First Amendment.\n       No one, of course, would deny that Justice Thomas has \n     strong conservative views on constitutional law. He rejects \n     much of affirmative action, believes Roe v. Wade was wrongly \n     decided, recognizes broad executive powers in wartime, and \n     allows religious groups more participation in public life. \n     But I have long thought that there is a deeper principle of \n     political philosophy at work in Justice Thomas's thought that \n     goes beyond the close interpretation of disparate \n     constitutional text. What he brings to the Court as no other \n     justice does is a characteristically American skepticism of \n     social engineering promoted by elites--whether in the media, \n     academia or well-heeled lobbies in Washington--and a respect \n     for individual self-reliance and individual choice. He writes \n     not to be praised by professors or pundits, but for the \n     American people.\n       As his memoir, My Grandfather's Son, shows, Justice \n     Thomas's views were forged in the crucible of a truly \n     authentic American story. This is a black man with a much \n     greater range of personal experience than most. A man like \n     this on the Court is the very definition of the healthy \n     diversity that our misguided affirmative action programs \n     seek. As a result, Justice Thomas opposes affirmative action \n     not just because it violates the guarantee of racial equality \n     in the Equal Protection Clause, but because it subordinates \n     individual energy, ambition, and talents to misinformed and \n     misguided social planning. In his dissent from the Court's \n     approval of the use of race in law-school admissions, he \n     quoted Frederick Douglass: ``If the negro cannot stand on his \n     own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance \n     to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!'' Justice Thomas \n     observed: ``Like Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in \n     every avenue of American life without the meddling of \n     university administrators.''\n       In a 1995 race case, Justice Thomas explained why he \n     thought the government's use of race was wrong. Racial quotas \n     and preferences run directly against the promise of the \n     Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal. \n     Affirmative action is ``racial paternalism'' whose \n     ``unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious \n     as any other form of discrimination.'' Justice Thomas speaks \n     from personal knowledge: ``So-called `benign' discrimination \n     teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable \n     handicaps, minorities cannot compete with them without their \n     patronizing indulgence.'' He argued that ``these programs \n     stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause \n     them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that \n     they are `entitled' to preferences.''\n       One of the most admirable traits that I have witnessed in \n     Justice Thomas is his focus on speaking honestly about his \n     views, rather than concerning himself with the politics of \n     winning votes on the Court. By foreswearing the role of \n     coalition builder or swing voter, Justice Thomas has used his \n     opinions to highlight how the latest social theories hurt \n     those they are said to help. Because he both respects \n     grassroots democracy and knows more about poverty than most \n     people do, he dissented vigorously to the Court's 1999 \n     decision to strike down a local law prohibiting loitering in \n     an effort to reduce inner-city gang activity. ``Gangs fill \n     the daily lives of many of our poorest and most vulnerable \n     citizens with a terror that the court does not give \n     sufficient consideration, often relegating them to the status \n     of prisoners in their own homes.''\n       Justice Thomas is an admirer of the work of Friedrich Hayek \n     and Milton Friedman, both classical liberals. His firsthand \n     experience of poverty, bad schools and crime has led him to \n     favor bottom-up, decentralized solutions for such problems. \n     He rejects, for example, the massive, judicially-run \n     desegregation decrees that have produced school busing and \n     judicially-imposed tax hikes. A student of a segregated \n     school himself, Justice Thomas declares that ``it never \n     ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume \n     that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.''\n       To Justice Thomas, the national government's command-and-\n     control policies have failed to make the poorest any better \n     off. Rather, they have simply suppressed innovation in \n     solving the nation's problems. He believes that the \n     Constitution allows not just states and cities, but religious \n     groups, to experiment to provide better education. In a 2002 \n     concurrence supporting the use of school vouchers, Justice \n     Thomas again quoted Frederick Douglass: Education ``means \n     emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the \n     uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of \n     truth, the light by which men can only be made free.'' \n     Justice Thomas followed with the sad truth: ``Today many of \n     our inner-city public schools deny emancipation to urban \n     minority students.''\n       ``While the romanticized ideal of universal public \n     education resonates with the cognoscenti who oppose \n     vouchers,'' Justice Thomas wrote, ``poor urban families just \n     want the best education for their children, who will \n     certainly need it to function in our high-tech and advanced \n     society.''\n       These are not the words of an angry justice, or a political \n     justice, but of a human justice. Justice Thomas's personal \n     story shows him to be all too aware of the imperfections in \n     our society and mindful of the limits of the government's \n     ability to solve them. That kind of understanding and \n     humility, and personal courage in the face of incessant \n     unjustified attack, is what most Americans would want on \n     their Supreme Court. Read a Thomas opinion on a subject like \n     affirmative action, religion, crime, or free speech, and you \n     cannot miss its authentic voice, unmistakable in its clarity, \n     logic and moving language.\n       During the administration of George W. Bush, in which I \n     served, there was speculation that the President might \n     elevate Justice Thomas to the Chief Justiceship to replace \n     Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. That position, of course, \n     went to Chief Justice John G. Roberts. In the end, I believe \n     that the President did Justice Thomas and the country an \n     unintentional favor. I believe he can do more good for the \n     country as an outspoken associate justice than he could as \n     Chief Justice. Because he is not the Chief Justice, Thomas \n     has more freedom to speak his mind--and he does so on a \n     regular basis. Clarence Thomas, growing up in the segregated \n     South, beating poverty and hardship to succeed in his \n     education and survive in the political shark pool of \n     Washington, brings a unique outsider's perspective to the \n     Court and the Constitution. Without the burden of the chief \n     justiceship, Thomas can pull aside the curtain of clever \n     legal and intellectual argumentation to reveal the stark and \n     real policy choices being imposed by the Court on the nation.\n       Thank you for commemorating the twentieth anniversary of \n     Justice Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court. I am \n     honored that you asked me to contribute a few thoughts on the \n     occasion, and I continue to feel myself lucky to have worked \n     for both you and Justice Thomas in the years since.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                         John Yoo,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           George Mason University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, October 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write on the occasion of Justice \n     Clarence Thomas' twentieth anniversary on the Supreme Court. \n     It was my great privilege to serve as a law clerk to Justice \n     Thomas during the October Term 2001.\n       In the past two decades, Justice Thomas has blazed an \n     influential path, focusing on the text and history of the \n     Constitution and following these wherever they may lead. Many \n     perceived his potential from the beginning of his tenure, but \n     now even his critics and skeptics have acknowledged his \n     distinct and important impact on the Court.\n       Lawyers, friends, and students often ask what it was like \n     to clerk for Justice Thomas. In his commitment to hard work \n     and careful thinking, Justice Thomas taught his clerks many \n     lessons in the law. The Justice encouraged us to debate the \n     merits of each case, digging into the finer points of law and \n     its particular application to the facts before the Court. We \n     provided our best assessments to the Justice while he was \n     deliberating. But once he decided, the debate ended. Whatever \n     points of disagreement may have remained, a clerk could \n     proceed knowing that the decision was based on the Justice's \n     honest judgment. The integrity of this process, without \n     intellectual compromise or concern for newspaper editorials, \n     reflected Justice Thomas' unwavering commitment to the law \n     and to his oath to uphold the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       Yet the clerkship was more than legal training. Justice \n     Thomas shared rich experiences from his own life. He spent a \n     great deal of time talking with us--about our professional \n     futures, our families, and, of course, sports. In the years \n     following my clerkship, Justice Thomas has remained a mentor \n     and inspiration, providing professional and personal advice \n     whenever needed. He has an excellent way of helping one see \n     what is important.\n       Justice Thomas' generosity of spirit extends beyond his \n     ``clerk family.'' He regularly speaks to student groups and \n     takes time from his busy schedule to meet with young people. \n     I have seen how this inspires them. A few years ago, he \n     volunteered to speak to my constitutional law class. No topic \n     was out of bounds as students asked the Justice about his \n     judicial philosophy, the\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n     role of the Supreme Court, the dynamics between the justices, \n     and his personal history. With good humor, Justice Thomas \n     stayed after class until every student who wanted a signature \n     or picture had a turn.\n       This was not an unusual event--but simply one example of \n     the Justice's graciousness and engagement in a wider public \n     dialogue. In this regard, he elevates the role of the Supreme \n     Court through his public appearances and meetings. Although \n     he does not seek commendation or attention from the usual \n     sources, Justice Thomas seeks to inspire others by example, \n     just as he recognizes the importance of those who inspired \n     him along the way. Those who have met him, even just in a \n     public lecture, know his intelligence, candor, and bellowing \n     laugh.\n       Justice Thomas' tremendous jurisprudential contribution can \n     be read in the decisions of the Court-- his influence \n     increasingly documented by academics and justly recognized by \n     lawyers and the public. In this short letter I have shared \n     some personal reflections on Justice Thomas because this \n     record is less public and often obscured. Justice Thomas \n     presents a rare example from public life that one's \n     intellectual and personal legacies need not be inversely \n     related.\n       I am grateful for your leadership in the confirmation of \n     Justice Clarence Thomas. Having served as counsel to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee under your Chairmanship during the \n     year before my clerkship, I am especially honored to have the \n     opportunity to join you in commemorating Justice Thomas' \n     first twenty years on the Supreme Court.\n           Best regards,\n     Neomi Rao.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This past weekend, we watched on CSPAN \n     key excerpts from the October 1991 U.S. Senate Judiciary \n     Committee confirmation hearings for justice Clarence Thomas. \n     It made us recall the critical role that you played in those \n     hearings, methodically debunking the absurd accusations \n     raised by liberal left interest groups and Senate staffers \n     who would stop at nothing to bring down a black man who \n     strayed from the ideological plantation. As Justice Thomas \n     said presciently at the time, America herself was harmed by \n     those attacks far more than he was. Our great institutions of \n     government--the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Court--were \n     harmed. Sadly, those injuries perdure.\n       But we share your joy in celebrating this day in 2011, as \n     you mark on the Senate floor the happy occasion of Justice \n     Thomas's twentieth anniversary on the Supreme Court. As two \n     of his former law clerks, who knew him from the days even \n     before he was on the Court, we speak for all Americans who \n     love Justice Thomas, our country, and our Constitution when \n     we say ``thank you'' for what you did in 1991, for your \n     prominent role in averting the ``high-tech lynching'' in the \n     Judiciary Committee, and for marking this milestone today.\n       The passing of these 20 years has only confirmed what you \n     knew back then: that Justice Thomas is an extraordinary \n     American, one of the greatest of his generation--indeed, of \n     any generation, and as our friend Bill Bennett recently said, \n     ``the greatest living American.'' He has taught us to \n     understand the Constitution, this great gift the Founders \n     gave us, in its fullness and integrity: for example, that \n     without proper respect for private property (what the \n     Founders called ``the pursuit of happiness'' in the \n     Declaration of Independence), there can be no real freedom; \n     that freedom and equality are really two sides of the same \n     coin; and that if we are to be a nation of laws and not of \n     men, judges must look not from the point of view of their own \n     race, sex, religion, or other personal characteristics in \n     deciding cases, but to the truth of the law and the rule of \n     law, which is for all persons, at all times.\n       Justice Thomas reminds us that interpreting the U.S. \n     Constitution is ``not a game of cute phrases and glib remarks \n     in important documents.'' It is, rather, ``a deadly serious \n     business.'' He approaches each case with no preconceptions, \n     only an honest and incisive intellect and a dogged commitment \n     to ``get the law right'' based on a clear understanding of \n     the Constitution and the principles it was created to \n     vindicate--preservation of life, liberty, and property--and \n     to the structural Constitution that created a system of self-\n     government for the first time in history based upon a clear-\n     eyed view of human nature. He treats the great gift given to \n     us, and to all civilization, by the Founders as it should be \n     treated: as a precious treasure, not something to be twisted, \n     played with, or destroyed.\n       And those of us who have been his employees and friends \n     have been doubly blessed by having a boss of intense personal \n     loyalty, who sees us all as family, who not only guides and \n     encourages us in our legal and other professional endeavors, \n     but is always there for us in our personal lives when we need \n     advice or support--through cancer diagnoses, the illnesses \n     and deaths of family members, the births and baptisms and \n     deaths of children, and all the other joys and tragedies of \n     life.\n       We look back on these 20 years with pride--but not \n     surprise--at what the Great Man has accomplished on the \n     highest Court in the land. It is now undeniable, even to the \n     liberal left and the mainstream media that Justice Thomas is, \n     in fact, a leader and a powerful intellectual force on the \n     U.S. Supreme Court. America has learned from the \n     investigative reporting and writing of Jan Crawford, in \n     Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for \n     Control of the Supreme Court, that Justice Thomas was a \n     powerful, independent, and influential voice on the Court \n     from the very first day he walked through the door, shortly \n     after the 1991 confirmation hearings ended and he was seated \n     as the junior Justice on the Court.\n       We can't let the moment pass without also noting that \n     Justice Thomas, notwithstanding his greatness, has always \n     been a man of deep and sincere humility, as befits a servant \n     of the law. He continues to be strengthened by his favorite \n     prayer, the Litany of Humility, which asks Jesus to ``deliver \n     me . . . from the desire of being loved, extolled, honored, \n     praised, [and] approved,'' and ``from the fear of being \n     humiliated, despised, ridiculed, [and] wronged. . . . ''\n       May all of our great Country's public servants, and all of \n     us citizens, pray with him the same prayer. We join you today \n     in honoring and praising a truly great man.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                             Laura A. Ingraham and\n     Wendy Stone Long.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The University of Georgia\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                                  August 31, 2011.\n     Sen. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for honoring the twentieth \n     anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the \n     Supreme Court of the United States. I had the privilege of \n     serving as one of Justice Thomas's law clerks during October \n     Term 1998. I cannot possibly hope to distill into a single \n     letter the lessons, reflections and memories of that \n     remarkable year. Hopefully, though, this letter in some small \n     way may give you, your colleagues in the Senate and the \n     American public some sense of this remarkable man.\n       October Term 1998 was not, to borrow an unfortunate term \n     from the media, a ``blockbuster'' It did not produce a slew \n     of decisions whose holdings made headlines. Of course, this \n     is not to say that the cases were insignificant--they surely \n     were for the litigants before the Court, for the broader \n     constituencies affected by the Court's decisions and for the \n     country. Perhaps precisely for this reason, we digested a \n     lesson that Justice Thomas taught us early in the term--our \n     job was to help him decide cases and to serve the Court. We \n     should not worry about the political impact of a decision or \n     its media significance. Nonetheless, we had to understand \n     that, for the litigants, the case may well be the most \n     important matter in their lives. Our job was to ``call them \n     like we see them'', to master the facts of a case and to \n     examine the relevant legal authorities.\n       This workmanlike approach infused everything we did--from \n     drafting memos for the ``cert pool'' to preparing bench \n     memoranda. He taught us to leave no stone unturned and to run \n     down obscure but potentially important jurisdictional snags \n     in cases. Consequently, when the day of oral argument came \n     around, he was prepared for everything. Thus, it was \n     unsurprising when he did not ask a lot of questions--he \n     already knew the answers!\n       Justice Thomas also taught us not to be afraid of the \n     truth. It would have been unforgivable for any of us to shade \n     a fact or twist a precedent in support of some preordained \n     result. There were right answers, and there were wrong ones. \n     To be sure, there were hard cases, and sometimes the right \n     answers were difficult to discern or required, ultimately, a \n     judgment. That process of discernment, however, required hard \n     work--to dig into the history of a constitutional amendment, \n     to focus on the language of the laws enacted by Congress and \n     not to be afraid where that research led us. When we met with \n     him--either privately or as a ``chambers team''--we presented \n     the results of our work with directness, honesty and \n     forthrightness. The result of a working atmosphere was a work \n     product that everyone could understand and believe in because \n     no corners had been cut.\n       These were not the only lessons that Justice Thomas taught \n     us. He also taught us the importance of treating people with \n     respect. As his elbow clerks, we often had the privilege of \n     accompanying him places--whether morning mass, breakfast in \n     the Court cafeteria or sometimes lunch over at his old \n     stomping ground in the Senate. On these outings, it never \n     ceased to amaze me how many people the Justice knew. Not only \n     did he know their names, he also asked after their families; \n     he could recall the names of their spouses, the activities of \n     their children and the last joke that they told. This was \n     true whether the person addressed was a former Senate staffer \n     or a cafeteria worker. Think about how often each of us \n     passes one of the countless, hardworking individuals like a \n     janitor or security guard--men and women who work often \n     without recognition, acknowledgement or a word of thanks. How \n     many of your Senate colleagues could name the janitors who \n     sweep the floors, clean the bathrooms and, on a daily basis, \n     ensure that the appearance of the building reflects the \n     dignity of the institution? Without exception, I know Justice \n     Thomas could name them all those who serve in the Court, \n     those who serve in the Senate and countless others into whom \n     he has come into contact. The example he set for us was \n     powerful, and I am reminded of it on a regular basis when I \n     try\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n     to accord the same respect to every individual with whom I \n     come into contact, just as he did.\n       Finally, no letter praising Justice Thomas would be \n     complete without reference to his family, especially his wife \n     Virginia. As you undoubtedly know, she is a rock for him, and \n     their marriage is an incredibly strong, indeed inspiring, \n     one. I had the privilege firsthand of benefiting from Justice \n     Thomas's keen insight into the importance of a strong \n     marriage as I faced a difficult dilemma during the end of my \n     clerkship. My fiancee and I were due to be married after the \n     clerkship, and I had already accepted a job in the Criminal \n     Division of the Justice Department (fulfilling a lifelong \n     dream to serve as a federal prosecutor). I had also made a \n     ``prenuptial'' promise to my fiancee (who was from Europe) \n     that if the opportunity ever came along to live and work in \n     her home country, I would do so. In March 1999, I received an \n     offer from a law firm in Europe and confronted a dilemma--\n     pursue my dream job or fulfill that prenuptial promise? After \n     stewing on the dilemma for several hours, I sheepishly \n     knocked on Justice Thomas's door and asked if we could have a \n     ``throwdown'' (his term for a conversation where we could put \n     all our concerns about a matter on the table). He listened \n     patiently as I laid out my dilemma to him. At the end of my \n     monologue, he looked me directly in the eye. and uttered \n     words I will never forget: ``Bo, a man goes where his wife \n     will be happy. The Justice Department will always be there, \n     but if you break this promise, you may wake up one day and \n     find your wife is not.'' The moral certainty behind his \n     advice helped me make the right decision. I called the \n     Justice Department, withdrew my application (a decision that, \n     to the Department's credit, was graciously accepted) and \n     accepted the position in Europe. My wife and I recently \n     celebrated our tenth anniversary, and not a day goes by when \n     I do not reflect on (and sometimes share) Justice Thomas's \n     advice.\n       As I read over this letter, I realize it does not begin to \n     scratch the surface of all the memories, reflections and \n     impressions created both during my year of service with \n     Justice Thomas and in the intervening thirteen years (for the \n     relationship endures long after the clerkship ends). All I \n     can say is thank you--for your unflagging support of this \n     true patriot and to Justice Thomas for his willingness to \n     serve the country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Peter B. Rutledge,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         University of Notre Dame,\n\n\n                                               The Law School,\n\n                                 Notre Dame, IN, October 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, 104 Hart Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing on the occasion of the \n     twentieth anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas's \n     confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. During the \n     Supreme Court's 1998-1999 term, I had the great privilege of \n     serving as Justice Thomas's law clerk. The experience was one \n     of the most important and formative of my life. During my \n     year in his chambers, Justice Thomas--whom I had long admired \n     as a jurist--became my mentor, teacher, and friend. He taught \n     me, as he teaches all of his clerks, to be a better lawyer--\n     the kind of lawyer who always honors the law by seeking and \n     applying the correct answer, even when the correct answer \n     does not comport with personal preferences. But even more \n     importantly, Justice Thomas taught me, as he teaches all of \n     his clerks, to be a better person--the kind of person who \n     chooses right over wrong, serves when called, and always \n     treats every individual, regardless of rank or station, as \n     their equal.\n       In the years since his confirmation, Justice Thomas's \n     critics have begun to give him his due as a jurist. Legal \n     academics and public intellectuals, many of whom disagree \n     virulently with his approach to the law, now grudgingly \n     acknowledge the intellectual weight of his opinions, the \n     consistency and clarity of his jurisprudential approach to \n     constitutional questions, the respect accorded to him by his \n     colleagues, and the increasing evidence of his intellectual \n     leadership on the Court. Most importantly, Justice Thomas's \n     opinions reflect an unwavering fidelity to the Constitution \n     as it was intended to be understood, a steadfast commitment \n     to religious liberty and free expression, and a firm \n     insistence that equality of opportunity is best promoted \n     (indeed must be promoted) by equal treatment under the law.\n       I know that law professors usually write tributes about \n     Justices as jurists, so I hope you will understand if I \n     depart from the mold and begin with a few words about the \n     Justice as a man. I do so in part because I am sure that \n     there will be no shortage of reflections about Justice Thomas \n     as a jurist in the days and years to come. But I also do so \n     because, during my year as his law clerk and in the years \n     since, I was, and have been, impressed and formed by Justice \n     Thomas's humanity, as much as (or more than) his judicial \n     philosophy or the careful crafting of his opinions.\n       As you undoubtedly remember, during his confirmation \n     hearings, then-Judge Thomas described watching, through his \n     chamber's window, as shackled prisoners were led into the \n     federal courthouse. ``I say to myself almost every day,'' he \n     introspectively reflected, ``But for the grace of God there \n     go I.'' In the intervening years, more than one commentator \n     has accused Justice Thomas of reneging on his implicit \n     promise--embedded in his self-identification with the \n     prisoners--to look out for the little guy. According to these \n     critics, Thomas has turned out to be anything but empathetic \n     to the plight of the downtrodden. This view--that Justice \n     Thomas exhibits a disregard, even contempt, for the \n     difficulties facing the least fortunate among us--pervades \n     the popular imagination. These criticisms reflect a profound \n     misunderstanding of Justice Thomas and his jurisprudence. \n     There is a reason why Justice Thomas, upon his nomination to \n     the Supreme Court, first thanked his grandparents and the \n     Franciscan nuns who educated him in Savannah's segregated \n     Catholic schools: He sincerely believed that they saved his \n     life. And one need only spend a day with Justice Thomas to \n     realize that he still believes that, but for their \n     intervention--or perhaps more accurately, but for God's \n     intervention through them--his life might well have taken a \n     very different path.\n       In his years on the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas's \n     generosity has become increasingly difficult to ignore. Even \n     his critics have begun to acknowledge publicly his personal \n     efforts to help ``the little guy''--from his decision to \n     raise his sister's grandson, to his practice of welcoming \n     groups of poor and predominantly minority school children to \n     the Court, to his record of mentoring young people, to his \n     involvement in a scholarship program that sends first-\n     generation professionals to New York University School of Law \n     on a race-blind basis. It was one of the great privileges of \n     serving as his law clerk to witness these efforts up close--\n     and to see that these public acts of generosity were coupled \n     with dozens more private acts of kindness, each as natural as \n     it was reflective of Justice Thomas's generosity and \n     character. A few examples: Justice Thomas not only knew every \n     member of the Supreme Court's staff by name, he also knew the \n     names of their spouses and many of their children. (I arrived \n     early one morning to find six custodians crowded into his \n     office teasing him about a Dallas Cowboy's loss.) Walking on \n     the hill one day, Justice Thomas stopped to talk to a \n     homeless man whom, he explained, he had known for years. \n     Another day, he stopped in front of the Hart Senate Office \n     Building to ask a police officer about his son, who had just \n     started college. When we asked how he knew that the officer's \n     son was entering college, he explained he remembered the \n     officer from his days as a staffer for Senator Danforth. \n     (Justice Thomas worked for Senator Danforth from 1970 until \n     1981; I clerked for him seventeen years later.)\n       Contrary to elite opinion, Justice Thomas's concern for the \n     metaphorical ``little guy'' is also reflected in his \n     jurisprudence. Critics often overlook this fact because his \n     views about how the law can properly help the poor, the \n     marginalized, and (perhaps especially) racial minorities are \n     profoundly contrarian, at least as measured against \n     prevailing elite sentiments. But properly understood--that \n     is, understood in the context of Thomas's history and \n     teleology--the evidence of his attentiveness to the underdog \n     is undeniable. Opinions reflecting Thomas's concern for ``the \n     little guy'' contain at least three overlapping themes. The \n     first is an unwavering respect for, and faith in, the \n     competence and ingenuity of all people, regardless of race or \n     station. Consider, for example, his scathing indictment of \n     the compulsory integration programs at issue in Missouri v. \n     Jenkins (1995):\n       ``It never ceases to amaze me,'' he began, ``that the \n     courts are so willing to assume that anything predominantly \n     black must be inferior.'' The second theme is a distrust of \n     many social programs designed to ``help'' the disadvantaged, \n     which is frequently interpreted as reflecting either \n     callousness, naivete or both. But Justice Thomas is acutely \n     aware of historical lessons suggesting that government \n     actions ostensibly designed to help sometimes mask illicit \n     motives, and he is deeply suspicious of ``window dressing'' \n     efforts that enable elites to avoid rolling up their sleeves \n     and engaging in the difficult task of equipping the \n     disadvantaged with the skills they need to succeed. As he \n     observed in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), which upheld the \n     University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action \n     program, ``It must be remembered that the Law School's racial \n     discrimination does nothing for those too poor or uneducated \n     to participate in elite higher education and therefore \n     presents only an illusory solution to the challenges facing \n     our Nation.'' The third theme reflects, in my view, the \n     genuineness of Justice Thomas's ``window dressing'' concern. \n     Thomas is jealously protective of the kind of ``back-to-\n     basics'' efforts that he believes will actually help the \n     disadvantaged. His frustration with opponents of these \n     efforts is palpable, and reflected in several opinions that \n     warning that decisions invalidating such efforts will have \n     devastating consequences for our most vulnerable citizens. \n     For example, he began his concurrence in Zelman v. Simmons-\n     Harris (2002), which upheld a school choice program in \n     Cleveland, by quoting Frederick Douglass: ``[E]ducation . . . \n     means emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the \n     uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of \n     truth, the light by which men can only be made free.'' He \n     continued, ``[M]any of our inner-city public schools deny \n     emancipation to urban minority students. . . . [S]chool \n     choice programs . . . provide the greatest educational \n     opportunities for . . . children in struggling communities.''\n       I do not make these observations to prove the wisdom of \n     Justice Thomas's views on the\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\n     merits, but rather to respond to a particularly pernicious \n     and deeply misguided criticism of his life and his \n     jurisprudence. Nor should my reflections be interpreted as \n     evidence that he is, as some have claimed, a results-oriented \n     jurist. That Justice Thomas's expressed constitutional \n     commitments are both genuine and self-binding is, in my view, \n     established in an undeniable record of reaching conclusions \n     that run counter to his personal preferences. And, I think it \n     important to note, Justice Thomas himself has spoken on the \n     subject of how a judge best serves the ``little guy'' and \n     that is to maintain fidelity to the law. As Thomas once \n     explained, ``A judge must get the decision right because, \n     when all is said and done, the little guy, the average \n     person, the people of Pinpoint, the real people of America \n     will be affected not only by what we as judges do, but by the \n     way we do our jobs.'' And, in living out that aspiration, \n     every day, Justice Thomas has become a model jurist, worthy \n     of our commendations on this day.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Nicole Garnett,\n     Professor of Law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6864-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     US-RUSSIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to note the importance of \ngrowing Russian-American cooperation in the field of civil nuclear \nenergy. Our common interests in this area are a significant opportunity \nto enhance energy security and economic growth for both nations. Just \nas importantly, building on a good record of cooperation on nuclear \nenergy can form a basis for improving our relationship with the Russian \nFederation more broadly.\n  As the two largest nuclear complexes, the United States and Russia \nplay an essential role in setting global standards. We have worked \neffectively together on non-proliferation initiatives through the Nunn-\nLugar program for nearly a generation. But our cooperation in nuclear \nenergy is not as well known.\n  Russia has long been America's largest foreign partner in nuclear \npower through the HEU-LEU Agreement of 1993. Better known as the \n``Megatons-for-Megawatts'' agreement, Russia's nuclear corporation \nRosatom has converted fissile material from thousands of weapons into \nenergy for American homes and businesses. Nearly half of the fuel used \nin U.S. reactors is of Russian origin, which accounts for 10 percent of \nthe electricity produced in this country.\n  In terms of nuclear technology, we have a lot to learn from one \nanother. If the event at the Fukushima reactors in Japan has taught us \nanything, it's that nuclear safety is an issue that crosses borders. \nThe recent signing of the ``Joint Statement on the Strategic Direction \nof U.S.-Russian Nuclear Cooperation'' between Rosatom and the \nDepartment of Energy is a good example and will take advantage of \nRussian technological leadership on advanced reactors with passive \nsafety systems. It recognizes that the long-term answers on nuclear \nsafety will be a new generation of inherently safe reactors.\n  I applaud the work of the Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Security Working \nGroup led by Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Poneman and Rosatom Director \nGeneral Sergey Kirienko. By expanding their joint efforts to include \nnuclear safety and development of a global framework for nuclear \nenergy, they are bringing the world's best technical expertise to bear \non critical issues that must be addressed to sustain public confidence \nin nuclear energy.\n  Mr. President, cooperative efforts between the United States and \nRussia in civil nuclear energy are a success story in an often complex \nrelationship. Building on this relationship should be a priority for \nboth countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6864-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. On October 21 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of \nthe enactment of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, one \nof the Nation's premiere privacy laws for the digital age. Since the \nECPA was first enacted in 1986, this law has provided privacy \nprotections for e-mail and other electronic communications for millions \nof Americans who communicate and transact business in cyberspace.\n  Today, the many rapid advances in technology that we have witnessed \nmake this key privacy law more important than ever if we are to ensure \nthe right to privacy. Just in the past few months, we have witnessed \nsignificant data breaches involving Sony and Epsilon that impact the \nprivacy of millions of American consumers. We are also learning that \nsmartphones and other new mobile technologies may be using and storing \nour location and other sensitive information, posing new risks to \nprivacy.\n  When I led the effort to write the ECPA 25 years ago, no one could \nhave contemplated these and other emerging threats to our digital \nprivacy. But today, this law is significantly outdated and outpaced by \nrapid changes in technology and the changing mission of our law \nenforcement agencies after September 11. At a time in our history when \nAmerican consumers and businesses face threats to privacy like no time \nbefore, we must renew the commitment to the privacy principles that \ngave birth to the ECPA a quarter century ago. That is why I am working \nto update this law to reflect the realities of our time.\n  Before the end of the calendar year, the Judiciary Committee will \nconsider legislation that I have drafted to update the ECPA and to \nbring this law fully into the digital age. My bill makes several \ncommonsense changes to the law regarding the privacy protections \nafforded to consumers' electronic communications. Among other things, \nmy bill gets rid of the so-called ``180-day rule'' and replaces this \nconfusing mosaic with one clear legal standard for protection of the \ncontent of e-mails and other electronic communications. This bill also \nprovides enhanced privacy protections for American consumers by \nexpressly prohibiting service providers from disclosing customer \ncontent and requiring that the Government obtain a search warrant based \non probable cause to compel the disclosure of the content of an \nindividual's electronic communications.\n  The ECPA Amendments Act also gives important new privacy protections \nfor location information that is collected, used, or stored by service \nproviders, smartphones, or other mobile technologies. To address the \nrole of new technologies in the changing mission of law enforcement, my \nbill also provides important new tools to law enforcement to fight \ncrime and protect cybersecurity including--clarifying the authority for \nthe government to temporarily delay notice to protect the integrity of \na law enforcement investigation and allowing a service provider to \ndisclose content that is pertinent to addressing a cyberattack to the \ngovernment to enhance cybersecurity.\n  I drafted this bill with one key principle in mind--updates to the \nElectronic Communication Privacy Act must carefully balance the \ninterests and needs of consumers, law enforcement, and our Nation's \nthriving technology sector. I also drafted this bill after careful \nconsultation with many government and private sector stakeholders, \nincluding the Departments of Justice, Commerce and State, local law \nenforcement, and members of the technology and privacy communities.\n  As the ECPA approaches its silver anniversary, I join the many \nprivacy advocates, technology leaders, legal scholars, and other \nstakeholders who support reform of the ECPA in celebrating all that \nthis law has come to symbolize about the importance of protecting \nAmericans' privacy rights in cyberspace. I hope that all Members will \njoin me in commemorating this important milestone anniversary and in \nsupporting the effort in Congress to update this law to reflect the \nrealities of the digital age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6864-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6864-S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BARRIE DUNSMORE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont benefits both by the people who \nwere born there and those who come to Vermont and make us even better.\n  One of those people who has chosen Vermont is Barrie Dunsmore, who \nbefore his change in careers had been one of the foremost reporters and \ncommentators on the national news scene. When he and his wife, Whitney \nTaylor, and his daughter, Campbell, came to Vermont, we Vermonters have \nbenefitted by his columns in The Rutland Herald and his commentary on \nVermont Public Radio. Recently Barrie took a number of his columns and \ncollected them in a book, ``There and Back.'' I could not begin to do \nhis writings justice, but my wife Marcelle\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\nand I were privileged to be at a reception for Barrie and Whitney in \nBurlington and we heard him speak. I asked him if I could have a copy \nof his notes from that evening, and he shared them with me. The notes \noffer only a hint of what awaits in the book, which I read with \npleasure at our home in Vermont.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Barrie Dunsmore's remarks be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             There and Back\n\n                          (By Barrie Dunsmore)\n\n       Thank you Senator Leahy for being here tonight with your \n     wife Marcelle, and for your kind words. I also thank you for \n     your constant support for my columns and comments over many \n     years. Having you in my camp has been an inspiration.\n       Thank you to Holly Johnson, the proprietor of Wind Ridge \n     Publishing. If you had not had faith that my writing deserved \n     a wider audience outside Vermont, there would be no book and \n     we would not be here this evening.\n       Last, but certainly not least, I wish to thank my wife, \n     Whitney Taylor. She is tireless in encouraging me and \n     steadfast in supporting me. She is an excellent editor and my \n     most important audience. She always reads my material before \n     I send it out. And if she doesn't get something I know nobody \n     will--so I make changes accordingly.\n       There are others who are deserving of my thanks but I \n     promise I won't bore you kind folks who probably aren't \n     interested in my high school Latin teacher who made me such a \n     great writer.\n       Seriously I make no such claim, but I am a writer. In fact \n     over the last decade--including my columns, radio and \n     television commentaries, book reviews and speeches--I have \n     written about a half a million words. To put that into \n     perspective, Tolstoy's War and Peace in Russian runs 460,000 \n     words.\n       I'm not talking about quality here, but in quantity, my \n     body of work is greater than War and Peace. But you'll be \n     happy to know the book contains only a fraction of that.\n       Let me explain the title of the book, ``There and Back.''\n       The first section, called THERE, contains columns and \n     commentaries that deal largely with events taking place in \n     foreign lands over THERE in this century--but seen through \n     the prism of events I covered in the last century. For \n     example, I wrote about the Arab Spring in Egypt last \n     February, in the context of my long experience in Egypt and \n     particularly my contacts with the late president Anwar Sadat.\n       The section called BACK contains articles addressing the \n     politics, culture and media of America--since I've been in \n     retirement, BACK here in the United States.\n       The items in this section reflect a somewhat detached view \n     of America as a former foreign and diplomatic correspondent \n     might see it. The title of the book, and the concept, were \n     suggested by my principal editor Emily Copeland to whom I am \n     most grateful.\n       I promise you, this is not going to be a long speech, but \n     I've been asked to reflect a bit on my impressions of how the \n     mainstream media have fared since I retired in the mid-1990s.\n       When I took early retirement, I vowed I would not fall \n     victim to the affliction that hits many old men and induces \n     them to claim that everything that has happened in their \n     field since they retired is a disaster. I confess in recent \n     years being true to that vow has been a real challenge. \n     Actually, when I did a series of lectures to the journalism \n     classes at Vermont's Saint Michael's College last year, I \n     suggested the students look at me as an archeologist might \n     view a relic from the past that is more or less intact, and \n     might provide some useful information.\n       During my four decades as an active reporter, there were \n     major technological changes in network television news--going \n     from black and white film to color; shifting from film to \n     videotape; the advent of high-quality hand held cameras. And, \n     finally of course, the coming of the communications \n     satellite. That significantly changed everything. It meant \n     there would be no more waiting for three days for the film \n     from Vietnam or the Middle East to arrive in New York. But \n     much more important, it became possible to have live coverage \n     of news events virtually anywhere in the world.\n       Yet as great as those changes were, they pale in comparison \n     to how the new information technologies have totally \n     revolutionized the media. The Internet and the almost \n     universal use of the personal computer and the cell phone \n     have had an extraordinarily profound impact on the reporting \n     of news, not to mention redefining what constitutes news--and \n     who or what is a reporter. Many consider this a good thing--a \n     notion I do not entirely share.\n       I will say this about the new technologies--they are not \n     inherently good or bad. Like all of their revolutionary \n     predecessors, such as the telegraph or moveable type, they \n     are neutral instruments. Whether they serve society--or \n     subvert it--depends on how these new tools are being used, by \n     whom and to what ends.\n       For me, one of the more troubling consequences of this \n     latest revolution is that by siphoning off huge portions of \n     ad revenues, the Internet and its social networks have \n     threatened the financial viability of the mainstream media--\n     and as a consequence, have undermined the credibility of the \n     news media as one of the key institutions that make democracy \n     work.\n       Thomas Jefferson repeatedly said it. And the philosophers \n     of ancient Greece apparently believed it: In order to \n     survive, democracy needs to have a relatively well-informed \n     electorate. The people cannot wisely choose their leaders if \n     they don't have at least a basic understanding of the issues \n     and of the consequences of the choices they are making.\n       What worries me most about the declining role of the \n     mainstream media in today's world, is that in spite of all \n     the various new platforms to provide and dispense \n     information--ironically, maybe because of all these choices--\n     there is evidence that the electorate is less well informed \n     than it was in other times in history. As I see it, these \n     days more people than ever hold passionate, partisan \n     opinions--that are largely free of facts. At another time, \n     those necessary facts would have been available in the major \n     news media, and most people would have accepted them as such. \n     Sad to say, that is something which large and growing numbers \n     of people no longer do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6865-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6865-S6866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a memorial \nto the extraordinary life and service of Jerry Hildebrand printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExcerpts Taken From a Senate Finance Committee Hearing Titled Reducing \n    Overpayments and Increasing Quality in the Unemployment System \n                       Conducted on May 25, 2010\n\n       Senator Baucus: Last week, the Obama Administration \n     announced a proposal to address these issues. The proposal \n     seeks to rein in overpayments by making the unemployment \n     insurance program more efficient. Today, we will walk through \n     that proposal.\n       Under the administration's proposal, states could use a \n     portion of the money that they recover from overpayments to \n     strengthen their program integrity activities. States would \n     also be required to impose financial penalties on people who \n     defraud the program.\n       Under the proposal, employers would be required to report \n     the start dates of new employees. That will help to identify \n     beneficiaries who have returned to work in a different state \n     but continue to receive unemployment benefits.\n       The administration's proposal is just one solution. States \n     and private industry have also devised systems that reduce \n     overpayments. They also have ideas on how to streamline \n     unemployment insurance. I look forward to learning more about \n     these proposals today.\n       Let's recognize the problem that we have in our Nation's \n     safety-net programs. Let's grab the chance to do our best to \n     correct the overpayments, and let's redouble our efforts to \n     make the government work more efficiently.\n       I would like to turn to our witnesses. First, we will hear \n     from Jane Oates, Assistant Secretary of Employment and \n     Training at the Department of Labor. Ms. Oates, it is a \n     pleasure to welcome you back. I was saddened not to see Jerry \n     Hildebrand sitting behind you. His passing is a great loss. \n     He provided tremendous advice and information honestly and \n     accurately to all of us who asked; he was a tremendous public \n     servant. We wanted you to know personally, and his family to \n     know that we're thinking of him and very saddened that he is \n     no longer with us.\n       Mrs. Oates: We cannot thank you enough for that. My career \n     spans from the 1970s. A loss of that magnitude is just hard \n     to get over. The whole career staff is remarkable but Jerry \n     was the high water mark. He is sorely missed every day, \n     particularly by me when we were prepping for this hearing.\n       Senator Baucus: Well he was a tremendous man.\n       Mrs. Oates: Thank you so much Senator. And we will make \n     sure his wife and daughter get your----.\n       Senator Baucus: We just want you to know how much he meant \n     to all of us.\n       Mrs. Oates: Thank you very much.\n       Senator Baucus: You're very welcome.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Eulogy for Jerry Hildebrand\n\n                     (Written by Suzanne Simonetta)\n\n       I'm speaking this evening on behalf of those of us who had \n     the privilege of working with Jerry Hildebrand in the \n     Unemployment Insurance (UI) program to give you a sense of \n     what he meant to us.\n       Jerry was a scholar. One of Jerry's most impressive \n     professional gifts was the depth and breadth of his \n     knowledge. I was constantly awed by him--particularly by how \n     much he remembered without even having to check his files. \n     More important than his knowledge, and love of learning in \n     general, was his ability to critically think about the \n     information he knew--What does this mean? Why is it \n     important? What are the implications? He always had the \n     answer. The English major in Jerry made him an excellent \n     writer as well--always pruning a document to reduce it to its \n     essential elements and clarifying its intent.\n       Jerry was a passionate advocate for the Unemployment \n     Insurance program. He was a worthy heir to the Wisconsin \n     intellectual tradition that led to the creation of the UI \n     program in 1935. Jerry truly believed UI was the most \n     important program in the Employment and Training \n     Administration. He felt strongly about the insurance \n     principles upon which it is based--payments to individuals \n     who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Jerry \n     believed in the importance of upholding the original intent \n     of the UI program and protecting workers' rights. He \n     dedicated his entire career to achieving these goals.\n       Jerry was a dedicated public servant. He was a consummate \n     professional. Everyone with whom he worked knew that they \n     could count on Jerry to give them his best effort. Jerry \n     cared very deeply about his work and held himself to the \n     highest standards. Though he might grumble and grouse to us \n     about the fire drill du jour, he always got the job done. \n     During the last two years in particular, with so much \n     attention being paid to unemployment and so much UI \n     legislation being enacted, so much had been demanded from \n     Jerry. And he always delivered. He was one of the hardest \n     working people I know.\n       Jerry touched the lives of millions of Americans without \n     them ever knowing it. Jerry was a very modest, humble man. \n     Some of you may not be aware that during the last 10 years, \n     Jelly wrote many of the Federal laws relating to unemployment \n     insurance and much of the guidance for states that operate \n     these programs. When you think back on some of the major \n     events in our nation's recent history--the terrorist attacks \n     on September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina, the current \n     recession--Jerry worked to support the people affected. \n     Whether it was the new benefits program for airline workers \n     after 9/11, modifications to the disaster unemployment \n     assistance program after Katrina, the seemingly countless \n     benefit extensions we currently have, or certifying billions \n     of dollars of payments to states that expand eligibility for \n     UI benefits, Jerry's contributions helped make it happen. His \n     efforts lessened the burden that so many individuals and \n     families face because of unemployment.\n       Jerry was a truly decent human being. Though a reserved \n     man, Jerry's actions spoke volumes about his character. He \n     was honest, fair, reasonable, reliable and dedicated. Jerry \n     was well respected by all who knew him. I couldn't have asked \n     for a better boss.\n       Jerry was taken from us too soon. We all feel his loss so \n     profoundly--both personally and professionally. The void left \n     behind is unbearable and the daunting task of carrying on \n     without him seems insurmountable. However, I am confident \n     that the wisdom Jerry shared and the lessons we learned from \n     him will enable us to achieve what now feels almost \n     impossible. Our greatest tribute to Jerry will be to continue \n     his legacy of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6866-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6866-S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL CREDIT UNION DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nimportance and many achievements of credit unions worldwide in \ncelebration of the 63rd annual International Credit Union Credit Day.\n  The difference credit unions make in the United States by providing \naffordable and safe financial services to many Americans of moderate \nmeans has been significant and widely recognized.\n  However, the contributions credit unions have made on an \ninternational scale are equally notable. Since the mid-1800s, credit \nunions have established themselves in communities around the world \nstruggling with social dislocation, political unrest, and economic \ndepression as a means to promote economic growth and democratic \npractices at the local level. Today, more than 54,000 credit unions \nprovide financial services to more than 186 million members in 97 \nnations. Nationally, credit unions provide financial services to more \nthan 93 million Americans.\n  Credit unions make a difference on a global scale by providing access \nto affordable financial services for those who otherwise would have \nbeen excluded from the financial sector. Such financial services \ninclude the provision of small savings and loans, which enable some of \nthe poorest individuals in the world to start their own \nmicroenterprises, improve household stability and stimulate growth in \ntheir communities. Credit unions are the largest source of these \nmicrofinance services in countries as diverse as Colombia, Kenya, \nRussia, Mexico, Thailand, and Rwanda.\n  Credit unions are also at the forefront of expanding access to \nfinance for people living in rural areas who can't afford the time or \nmoney it takes to visit a financial institution. Credit unions are \nworking with the World Council of Credit Unions, WOCCU, to introduce a \nvariety of innovative technology solutions to bank the unbanked in \nrural areas. In Mexico, credit union officers carry hand-held personal \ndigital assistant, PDA, devices to conduct financial transactions with \nmembers in communities located up to 90 minutes from the credit union \noffice. In Kenya, Peru, and Mexico, point-of-sale devices enable credit \nunions to partner with local merchants in rural areas, allowing members \nto deposit and withdraw money from their credit union accounts. \nFinally, mobile banking capabilities in Mexico will enable members to \ncheck their balances and transfer funds without leaving their homes.\n  In addition, credit unions throughout the world are filling the \nagricultural\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nlending gap that has kept the vast majority of small farmers stuck in \nlow-production, low-return cycles. In countries such as Peru, Kenya, \nand Colombia, credit unions are taking an integrated, value-chain \napproach to financing that includes access to agricultural training and \nmarkets for farmers to sell their products. As a result, farmers are \nnot only increasing their incomes and producing more food for their \nfamilies, they are also playing a role in securing their nations' food \nsupply.\n  U.S. credit union members, staff and leagues, along with the Credit \nUnion National Association and the U.S. Government support the global \nwork of credit unions and WOCCU. Through WOCCU's International \nPartnerships Program, 25 U.S. credit union leagues are matched with \ndeveloping credit union movements overseas to encourage the direct \ntransfer of technology, skills, and experience among peers across \nborders.\n  I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in \ncommending the work of credit unions, both domestically and \ninternationally, for providing vital financial services that improve \nthe lives of people demonstrating the greatest need around the world. \nBy providing the world's poor with the most basic financial services, \ncredit unions help expand job opportunities, improve local economies \nand promote democracy. In short, credit unions offer a sustainable \ndevelopment solution to some of the world's poorest countries, and this \nis the ``credit union difference.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6867-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            UDALL FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in 1992, Congress \ncreated the Udall Foundation, to honor the service of Mo Udall, my \nuncle, and father of the Senator from the great State of Colorado, Mark \nUdall. In 2009 that mandate was expanded to also honor the service of \nmy dad, Stewart Udall, and a legacy of two brothers who fought to \npreserve and protect our environment and advocate on behalf of Native \npeople.\n  The Udall Foundation would not be what it is today without the \ntireless work of one man--Terrence L. Bracy. Terry's been there since \nthe very beginning and has served as chairman of the foundation for 17 \nyears, appointed by both President Clinton and President George W. \nBush. At the end of this year, Terry will step down from the board, \nclosing the first chapter of the Udall Foundation . . . and I rise \ntoday to express my deep gratitude to him for his service to the \nFoundation and honoring the Udall legacy.\n  What started as only a vision is now an organization dedicated to \neducating a new generation of Americans to preserve and protect their \nnational heritage through scholarship, fellowship, and internship \nprograms that focus on environmental and Native American issues, as \nwell as promoting environmental conflict resolution.\n  I know Senator Mark Udall agrees with me when I say that Terry Bracy \nis the Udall Foundation. Over the past 17 years, he has continually \npushed the Foundation to new heights--developing new programs, \nproviding new opportunities for young people, and finding new ways to \nmake a difference on issues relating to the environment and tribal \ncommunities.\n  He created an organization to inspire young people to tackle the \ntough policy problems that confront our nation. And Terry deeply cares \nabout the students that are touched by the foundation's various \nprograms.\n  After the Washington internship program, Terry and his lovely wife, \nNancy, always got us all together. Early on, it was at their house in \nVirginia. The Senator from Colorado and I would answer questions and \nshare our experiences with these exceptional young people, getting to \nknow a new generation of leaders who, thanks to Terry, were inspired to \ncarry on the torch of public service.\n  Under his leadership, the foundation also created the Native Nations \nInstitute, accepted stewardship of the U.S. Institute for Environmental \nConflict Resolution from Congress, and most recently, established the \nStewart L. Udall Parks in Focus Program.\n  And while he has always looked forward to what the foundation could \nbecome, he has also continually reinforced the legacy of the two Udall \nbrothers. It was Terry who pursued changing the name of the \norganization to the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation, \nafter two brothers whose joint legacy as public servants and \nenvironmental visionaries will endure through the ages. The dedication \nceremony in 2009 was the final public appearance of my father before \nhis passing, and I know he was deeply honored and appreciative of the \nhard work of his friend Terry.\n  I would like to extend my thanks to Terry for his service to this \nnation in preserving the legacy of two American brothers who fought to \nchange the world, and for continuing to champion the causes to which \nthey dedicated their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6867-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALBERT KELLY\n\n Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \ncommend an outstanding citizen of my State.\n  Next Tuesday, October 25, Albert ``Kell'' Kelly of Bristow, OK, will \ntake office as the new chairman of the American Bankers Association. \nMr. Kelly is CEO Of SpiritBank in Bristow, part of a family-owned \ncluster of businesses which includes farming, ranching and banking \nenterprises. In fact, even now, Kell continues to work his 900-acre \nranch whenever he is not traveling.\n  Mr. Kelly is equally active in community affairs. He once served as \nan assistant district attorney and also was chairman of the Oklahoma \nBankers Association, and he is currently chairman of the Oklahoma \nTurnpike Commission. No wonder Kell Kelly has been called the most \ninfluential non-politician in Oklahoma. Education, transportation, and \nlocal business development are all key elements of Kell's community \ninvolvement. He understands that the purpose of a community bank is to \nbuild a community.\n  Kell is also a champion of empowerment.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an outstanding public servant, Terrence L. Bracy, who has \nchaired the Udall Foundation board of trustees for 17 years.\n  In 1 week, Terry, as his friends call him, will step down from his \nlongtime role as chair of the board.\n  In light of his impending retirement from the Udall Foundation board, \nit is fitting that we commemorate Terry's groundbreaking work on behalf \nof the foundation.\n  For those of my colleagues who may not be familiar with the Udall \nFoundation, Congress created the foundation as an independent Federal \nagency in 1992, in honor of my late father, former Arizona Congressman \nMorris K. ``Mo'' Udall. The foundation, in fact, is headquartered in \nTucson, AZ, in the congressional district that Mo Udall proudly served \nfor 30 years.\n  In 2009, Congress enacted legislation to honor Stewart L. Udall, Mo's \nolder brother, by adding his name to the foundation. It is now known as \nthe Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation. My uncle Stewart \nwas a congressman and also served for 8 years as U.S. Secretary of the \nInterior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and Uncle Stewart's son \nis none other than Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, with whom I am \nproud to serve in this Chamber.\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\n  The foundation was conceived as one way to carry on what has been \ndescribed as the ``Udall ethic''--a reverence for the natural world, a \ndeep commitment to public service, and a respect and admiration for \nNative American communities.\n  With this ethic as his lodestar, Terry has led the board of the \nfoundation, whose members are appointed by the President and confirmed \nby the Senate, from its inception. And over the past two decades, Terry \nhas helped define and hone the foundation's mission, enabled it to grow \nand flourish, and ensured that it had the necessary resources to do its \nwork.\n  As set forth in its founding legislation, the purposes of the \nfoundation are many: to increase the awareness of, the importance of, \nand promote the benefit and enjoyment of, the Nation's natural \nresources; to foster a greater recognition and understanding of the \nrole of the environment, public lands, and resources in the development \nof the United States; to identify critical environmental issues; to \ndevelop resources to train professionals properly in environmental and \nrelated fields; to provide educational outreach regarding environmental \npolicy; to develop resources to train Native American and Alaska Native \nprofessionals in health care and public policy; and through the U.S. \nInstitute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, provide assessment, \nmediation, and other related services to resolve environmental disputes \ninvolving Federal agencies.\n  In pursuit of these purposes, under Terry's leadership, the \nfoundation has instituted several programs, including the following: \nannual scholarships and fellowships to outstanding students who intend \nto pursue careers related to the environment; annual scholarships and \ninternships to outstanding Native American and Alaska Native college \nstudents who intend to pursue careers in health care and tribal public \npolicy; Parks in Focus, which takes young people into national and \nState parks to expose them to the grandeur of the Nation's natural \nresources and instill a sustainable appreciation for the environment; \nand the Native Nations Institute for Leadership, Management, and \nPolicy, NNI, which focuses on leadership education for tribal leaders \nand on policy research. The Udall Foundation and the University of \nArizona cofounded NNI, building on the research programs of the Harvard \nProject on American Indian Economic Development.\n  Moreover, the foundation works in cooperation with the Udall Center \nfor Studies in Public Policy at the University of Arizona on various \nactivities, including environmental research and conflict resolution.\n  One of the foundation's most outstanding initiatives is the Native \nAmerican Internship Program. This program provides Native American and \nAlaska Native students with an opportunity to learn about Congress, \nCabinet departments, and the White House. I am always proud to host \nthese students in my Senate office as interns, where they put their \nconsiderable talents to work. Getting to know those outstanding young \npeople is a highlight of every year for me, and that is thanks to \nTerry's hard work.\n  Terry is a one-of-a-kind leader, and he has nurtured and grown the \nfoundation from a mere idea into a respected and established \nindependent institution.\n  Terry's retirement means that a new leader will take the helm of the \nfoundation's board. We all know that change is never easy, but I am \nconfident the foundation will thrive for many years to come because \nTerry laid such solid ground on which to continue to build. And the \ntop-rate staff Terry helped assemble will ensure a continuity that will \nkeep the foundation on mission.\n  On a more personal level, I observe that Terry is the consummate \ncompetitor--whether on the golf course or in the legislative arena--and \nhe has never shied away from a fight if it was necessary to get the \nright things done.\n  I also note that during the time that he led the foundation's board \nof trustees, Terry also ran his own successful firm and played an \nactive role in his community. His commitment to public service meant \nthat he took time away from his own business--and more importantly, his \nfamily--to oversee the foundation's work. Those are the sacrifices of a \ntrue public servant.\n  My father had that same core--he passionately believed that public \nservice was an honorable calling. It is little wonder that Mo Udall \nhired Terry as his chief of staff many years ago in the U.S. House. \nHand in hand with Representative Mo Udall, Terry worked on historic \npieces of legislation that have protected our Nation's public lands and \nensured that our government lived up to its obligations to Native \nAmericans.\n  As my dad used to say, ``If the good guys don't get involved, the \nscoundrels will.'' I know my dad would say that Terry Bracy's support \nand loyalty were invaluable to his own career. And Mo would be the \nfirst in line to heartily congratulate Terry on his successful tenure \nheading the foundation's board and creating a lasting public service \nlegacy.\n  Terry wasn't just important to my dad, he was important to my Uncle \nStewart. And I want to mention that it was Terry who suggested changing \nthe official name of the Udall Foundation to recognize my uncle, the \nlate Stewart L. Udall as well.\n  My dad and my uncle were extremely close, and Terry believed that \nnaming the foundation for both Udalls, on one level, brought them \ntogether again. The christening of the foundation's building in Tucson, \nAZ, 2 years ago was the last significant public appearance that Stewart \nmade before he died, and it was a proud and moving day for all of us. I \ntreasure the photos that were taken that day of the Udall family, and I \nwill always cherish the memories. I credit Terry with making that day \npossible.\n  The Udall Foundation will recognize Terry Bracy's contributions at a \ndinner in Tucson on October 27. I am sorry that I won't be able to \nattend the function, as I will be on international travel. But while I \ncan't be there in person, I will be there in spirit, applauding Terry \nfor everything that he has done for the foundation and its important \nmission.\n  In the meantime, I urge everyone in this body to join me in \nrecognizing Terry Bracy for his many significant contributions. Terry, \nthank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6868-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6868-S6869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO KATHY CLONINGER, CEO OF GIRL SCOUTS U.S.A.\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

She \nhas devoted her life to girls and to one of America's most treasured \ninstitutions. We honor her today for a career that has been dedicated \nto building girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the \nworld a better place.\n  Kathy's journey with Girl Scouts began in 1983 and spanned more than \ntwo decades of service as the head of Girl Scout councils in Tennessee, \nTexas, and Colorado. During her tenure as CEO of the Girl Scouts of \nCumberland, TN, Girl Scout membership in our region rose to more than \n25,000 girls--an increase of nearly 40 percent. She was also \nresponsible for creating an outreach program that tripled the number of \nAfrican-American Girl Scouts, increased the participation of Hispanic \ngirls, and brought more than 1,000 girls in public housing into the \nprogram.\n  Since assuming her role as CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA in 2004, \nKathy has transformed the Girl Scout movement. Under her guidance, the \nGirl Scouts accomplished the remarkable task of successfully merging \n315 councils down to 112 high-performance councils nationwide. Kathy \nhas unified the Girl Scout movement around a common mission and \nbusiness strategy, laying a sound foundation for success as the \norganization looks towards its 100th anniversary and beyond.\n  Kathy's service goes well beyond Girl Scouts. She has received \nnumerous awards for her work on behalf of youth empowerment and the \nnonprofit community, including Nonprofit CEO of the Year 2000 from the \nCenter for Nonprofit Management. In 2010, Kathy was named one of the \n``21 Leaders for the 21st Century'' by Women's eNews.\n  Mr. President, we ask our colleagues to join us in thanking Kathy \nCloninger for nearly 30 years of service to the\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\nGirl Scouts and our country.

Mr. President, I wish to submit for the \nRecord an article written by Scott Zimmerman, cooperatives specialist \nwith the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and published October 15, 2011, \nin the Wyoming Livestock Journal. The article's title is ``Cooperatives \nContinue to Shape the Landscape in Rural Wyoming.''\n  Across the country, October is celebrated as National Cooperative \nMonth. With the fall harvest season upon us, our Nation's farmers are \nseeing the fruits of their labors. Gov. Matt Mead has declared October \nCooperative Month in my home State of Wyoming. In his article, Scott \nZimmerman traces the history of cooperatives and explains how their \nfounding principles continue to guide cooperatives today.\n  As Mr. Zimmerman points out, cooperatives form the basis of life in \nmany rural communities. Cooperatives have shaped the landscape of \nAmerican agriculture and rural way of life. For example, their \npioneering organization led to memberowned and operated Rural Electric \nAssociations. These co-ops first brought electricity to many small \nWyoming communities. Additionally, cooperatives help many small Wyoming \nfarmers and ranchers keep their costs low by purchasing needed inputs \nsuch as fertilizer, seed, and fuel at a discount. They accomplish this \nby pooling their purchasing power and buying farm inputs with volume \npricing, thus taking advantage of their collective economy of scale.\n  The author also notes how cooperatives market their goods together as \nwell. This allows buyers to source larger volumes of a product from a \nsingle seller, rather than attempting to procure a similar volume from \nmany different sellers. This increased procurement efficiency allows \nbuyers to offer higher prices to the co-op members than they would \notherwise receive.\n  American consumers also have reason to celebrate National Cooperative \nMonth. By contributing to increased efficiency, both in the way farm \ninputs are purchased and outputs are sold, consumers as well as co-op \nmembers benefit. Cooperatives provide lower prices to the final \nconsumer by keeping the cost to produce and market their goods and \nservices down.\n  Two of the founding principles of cooperatives are cooperation among \ncooperatives and commitment to their communities. I would like to \nacknowledge and recognize Scott Zimmerman and all co-op members who \nassist in bringing safe, wholesome, and affordable food to our tables \nin a spirit of cooperation and community involvement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Cooperatives Continue to Shape the Landscape in Rural Wyoming\n\n (By Scott Zimmerman, Cooperatives Specialist, Rocky Mountain Farmers \n                                 Union)\n\n       October is being celebrated across the U.S. as National \n     Cooperative Month, and Governor Matt Mead has signed a \n     proclamation declaring Cooperative Month in Wyoming as part \n     of this celebration. Here at Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and \n     our Cooperative Development Center we applaud the Governor's \n     action, and we join with him in saluting cooperatives \n     nationwide.\n       To understand what cooperatives mean today, it helps to \n     understand the history of cooperatives. The cooperative \n     movement began in Europe in the 19th Century, not long after \n     the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The increasing \n     mechanization of the European economy transformed society. It \n     threatened the livelihoods of skilled workers and destroyed \n     businesses too small to compete with industrial giants. Labor \n     and social movements attempted to address the need for \n     change.\n       The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was formed in \n     Rochdale, England in 1844. Mechanization was replacing \n     skilled workers with unskilled labor. Weavers were being \n     replaced with machines that produced quantity without much \n     regard for quality. These tradesmen, driven into poverty by \n     industrialization, banded together to open their own store. \n     They designed the Rochdale Principles to govern their \n     business and they pooled their meager capital to stock their \n     store with simple necessities at affordable prices. They were \n     so successful that, in the next 10 years, more than 1,000 co-\n     ops sprang up in Great Britain.\n       Cooperatives worldwide still subscribe to the Rochdale \n     principles that guided these first cooperators to success. \n     There are seven original principles:\n       1. Open, voluntary membership\n       2. Democratic governance (one member, one vote)\n       3. Members control capital and equity\n       4. Autonomous, independent governance\n       5. Education and training in cooperative principles\n       6. Cooperation among cooperatives\n       7. Commitment to their communities\n       Agricultural cooperatives have played a huge role in \n     developing and sustaining local agriculture here in Wyoming \n     and across the West. Wyoming agriculture has created and \n     benefited from three general types of cooperative: service, \n     supply and marketing. Each type fills a different role in our \n     state.\n       The service cooperative, as its name suggests, provides its \n     member owners with a service typically not available \n     otherwise. A good example of this type of cooperative is \n     member-owned Rural Electric Associations. Had it not been for \n     the vision and hard work of the founding members of these co-\n     ops, rural Wyoming would have remained without electricity \n     many years longer. Co-ops emphasize benefits to members \n     rather than measuring their results in raw profits, so small \n     ``local'' electric utilities were able to address the need.\n       The supply cooperative offers its members the opportunity \n     to buy inputs and raw materials at prices competitive with \n     the volume discounts offered to the industrial corporations \n     they must compete with. Typically the co-op can offer the \n     supply item at volume pricing based on the buying power of \n     the entire membership, and typically the coop will deliver to \n     small, independent operations. Many rural Wyoming \n     agricultural communities have been home to ``fuel and \n     supply'' cooperatives. These operations offered fuel, seed, \n     fertilizer and farm and ranch supplies to their members. \n     Cenex is a well-known example of this type of cooperative \n     that is still part of the Wyoming landscape.\n       The marketing cooperative typically pools its members' \n     goods and offers them for direct sale to obtain the best \n     price. Grain or commodity marketing cooperatives fall into \n     this category, as well as the co-op food markets that benefit \n     both consumers and producers.\n       Starting in the late 1970s, many states changed the legal \n     definition of ``cooperative,'' and a new kind of co-op \n     emerged. New-generation cooperatives in rural America adapt \n     traditional cooperative structures to the increasing need for \n     capitalization. Some states now allow capital investors to \n     participate as voting members. This kind of co-op often is an \n     agricultural processor adding value to a primary product. \n     Capitalized by investors and run democratically by members, \n     they might be producing ethanol from corn, pasta from durum \n     wheat or gourmet cheese from goat's milk. The highly \n     successful Mountain States Lamb Cooperative, headquartered in \n     Douglas, is an example of such a cooperative.\n       Rocky Mountain Farmers Union takes cooperation as one of \n     its founding principles, and we have promoted cooperative \n     solutions\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n     to rural and agricultural challenges for more than 100 years. \n     Since 1991, our foundation has been a leader forming and \n     assisting cooperatives of all types. Our Cooperative \n     Development Center, created in 1996, has used funding from \n     Rural Cooperative Development Grants (RCDG) awarded each year \n     by USDA-Rural Development to support our cooperative \n     development work in Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming. In the \n     Center's 15 years we have helped design, develop, incorporate \n     and manage more than a hundred cooperatives, many of them, \n     like Mountain States, still thriving. We continue to seek out \n     and assist individuals and groups with ideas that may become \n     the next successful cooperative venture.\n       As you can see, cooperatives have had a significant role in \n     shaping the Wyoming agricultural landscape. We celebrate that \n     role each year in October. RMFU and our Co-op Center will \n     ensure that the role of co-ops will be important for years to \n     come, and we will strive to enhance that role wherever \n     possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6870-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6870-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/20/senate-section/article/S6870-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6870-S6871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3639.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Community Wind\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nAct with my friend and colleague Senator Tester from Montana.\n  Rural renewable energy development has been one of my top priorities \nsince coming to the Senate. America's rural communities have some of \nour country's most abundant renewable energy resources, and I strongly \nbelieve that community-owned renewable energy projects are among the \nmost promising drivers of economic development in our rural \ncommunities.\n  Minnesota has a lot of wind. In the past decade, communities across \nsouthwestern Minnesota have been transformed by wind power, with \nturbines producing renewable energy to power homes and businesses \nacross the midwest. These projects are helping Minnesota meet its \nambitious goal of obtaining 25 percent of its electricity from \nrenewable sources by 2025. As we look to develop more renewables in \nMinnesota and across the country, I want to make sure that rural \ncommunities are reaping the maximum benefit from these projects.\n  That is why community wind is so powerful. When a wind project has \nsome level of local ownership, studies have shown that the project will \nhave higher local economic impact than conventional projects. That is \nbecause profits from the project flow to members in the community. \nThose profits are then reinvested in the community, fueling economic \nactivity that wouldn't have otherwise happened.\n  Like many small and distributed energy projects, community wind \nprojects face unique challenges when compared to conventional wind, \nranging from difficulties accessing financing to the inability to take \nfull advantage of Federal tax benefits. Despite these barriers, \ncommunity wind projects have devised innovative financing structures to \nmove forward with projects across the country. However, like the larger \nwind industry, community wind still faces great uncertainty with the \nlooming expiration of the federal production tax credit for wind at the \nend of 2012.\n  Our bill provides long-term certainty to community wind over the next \n5 years by expanding the existing small wind Investment Tax Credit to \nprojects with capacity up to 20 MW. There is no restriction on turbine \nsize, and the bill prevents the subdivision of large wind projects to \ngame the system and claim the credit.\n  This bill has support from a diverse group of stakeholders, including \nthe American Wind Energy Association to the National Farmers Union, the \nMinnesota Farmers Union, the Minnesota Corn Growers, the Minnesota \nSoybean Growers, a broad coalition of Minnesota and national small and \ncommunity wind developers, and rural businesses and nonprofits across \nthe country. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator \nTester today, and I look forward to working with my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle to garner support for its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nfraudulently representing a product to be maple syrup; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nCollins, Schumer, Sanders and Gillibrand as we introduce this \nlegislation to hold accountable those criminals who fraudulently sell \nwhat they call ``maple'' syrup.\n  Vermont iconic maple syrup--painstakingly produced, and prized across \nthe Nation and beyond--is one of our state's fine, high-quality, \nnatural products. I have been alarmed by the growing number of \nindividuals and businesses claiming to sell genuine Vermont maple syrup \nwhen they are in fact selling an inferior product that is not maple \nsyrup at all. This is fraud, plain and simple, and it undermines a key \npart of Vermont's economy and reputation for quality that has been \nhard-earned through Vermonters' hard work. I know that diligent syrup \nproducers in Maine, New York, and other States have been similarly hurt \nby this crime. Our bill, the Maple Agriculture Protection and Law \nEnforcement, or ``MAPLE''Act, will deter this criminal conduct.\n  The MAPLE Act creates a felony offense with a 5-year maximum penalty \nfor fraudulently selling a product purported to be maple syrup that is \nnot, in fact, maple syrup. Under current law, doing so is only a \nmisdemeanor offense with a one year penalty.\n  The sale of fraudulent maple syrup is a real problem facing consumers \nand producers. Recently, Vermont U.S. Attorney Tris Coffin sought an \nindictment after a Food and Drug Administration investigation revealed \nthat a Rhode Island man had been selling cane sugar-based syrup as \n``maple'' syrup and representing to consumers that the syrup was \nauthentic. The legislation we introduce today will more effectively \nprotect consumers and the maple industry by punishing and deterring \nthis deceptive conduct.\n  Vermonters, and consumers across the country, should be confident \nthat when they buy food, they know exactly what they are getting. The \nfines that may result from criminal violations under current law are \noften not enough to protect the public from harmful or fraudulent \nproducts. Too often, those who are willing to endanger our livelihoods \nin pursuit of their profits see fines as just a cost of doing business. \nWe need to make sure that those who intentionally deceive consumers get \na trip to jail, not a slap on the wrist. Schemers should not easily be \nable to sully the seal of quality that is associated with genuine \nVermont maple syrup.\n  I have a longstanding commitment to comprehensive food safety and \nfood integrity reforms, and our work is not done. Earlier this year, \nthe Senate unanimously passed my Food Safety Accountability Act, which \nwould hold those criminals who intentionally poison our food supply \naccountable for their crimes. I urge the House to pass that \nnoncontroversial bill, and I hope that all Senators will join us in \nsupporting the MAPLE Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \nto facilitate recovery and beneficial use, and provide for the proper \nmanagement and disposal, of materials generated by the combustion of \ncoal and other fossil fuels; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of job \ncreation as well, specifically in regard to legislation I will be \nintroducing that seeks to not only create jobs but also to truly reduce \nthe cost of electricity to Americans throughout this country.\n  In North Dakota, we have a powerplant north of our State capitol, the \ncity of Bismarck. It is about 1,100 megawatts. It consists of two \nseparate plants, each of them 550 megawatts, so the complex provides \n1,100 megawatts of electricity, power that fuels our State, as well as \nsending power to Minnesota and other places as well. This plant uses \nthe latest in emission control technology. It is state of the art.\n  We also have an ethanol plant attached to the powerplant, so the \nwaste steam that comes off the powerplant is used to power the ethanol \nplant to make low-cost transportation fuel as well.\n  In addition to those things, another innovation at this plant is that \nafter they produce the electricity, they take hundreds of thousands of \ntons of coal ash and, rather than landfilling it, they actually reuse \nit, and they use it to make concrete--they call it FlexCrete--for \nhighways, they use it in building materials, and they even use it in \nproducts such as the shingles we use on our roofs.\n  Formerly, this plant paid about $4 million a year to landfill that \ncoal ash. Now they sell it for all these products and generate around \n$12 million a year in revenue. If you take the $4 million they used to \nexpend to landfill the material, figure in the $12 million they now \nmake selling the product, that is a $16 million revenue benefit to the \nplant. That means a $16 million reduction in the cost of electricity to \ntheir customers throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.\n  At the same time, because they have partnered with a company out of \nUtah called Headwaters, right there at the complex they also have a \nfacility that manufactures these building products, FlexCrete, and \ncreates good-paying jobs as well.\n  Today I rise to introduce commonsense, bipartisan legislation--a jobs \nbill, if you will--the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act. In \nfact, this legislation has already passed the House of Representatives \nwith a large bipartisan majority.\n  In a true example of American ingenuity and innovation, entrepreneurs \naround the country are recycling coal ash. Millions of Americans now \nwork in buildings that are either partially constructed from coal ash-\nstrengthened building materials or they drive home from work on roads \nand over bridges that are made of coal ash concrete or, as I said, they \nlive under roofs that are shingled, and those shingles are made out of \nthis coal residuals material. In fact, in my home State of North \nDakota, we have both our Heritage Center, which is under construction \nnow, and also the National Energy Center of Excellence that were \nconstructed with these materials.\n  First, this National Energy Center of Excellence, this is the \nBismarck State College. They specialize in energy programs. This \nfacility overlooks the Missouri River and it is about a $20-plus \nmillion facility. It is absolutely beautiful, and it is made with the \ncoal residual building materials.\n  On this other slide, right now this facility is under construction. \nThis will be a more than $50 million facility, which is, in essence, a \nmuseum and a heritage center for the State of North Dakota. The \nbuilding materials in this state-of-art facility will have both static \nand interactive displays and is being built with what is called coal \nash--but coal residual materials. These are materials coming out of \npowerplants that were formerly simply landfill, and now we are using \nthem for all these purposes. The important point is, we need to be able \nto continue to do that. That is exactly why I am introducing this \nlegislation.\n  It turns out that using this natural byproduct of coal combustion not \nonly makes our buildings and infrastructure stronger, it makes homes, \nbusinesses, and highways more affordable to build. It also creates \nhundreds of thousands of jobs in the process, while using this cost-\neffective material.\n  Meanwhile, by using coal ash in such an innovative manner, it is \nestimated the overall energy consumption in this country can be reduced \nby 162 trillion Btu's, British thermal units, and that water usage is \nreduced annually by 32 billion gallons a year. That is the equivalent \nof the amount of energy used by 1.7 million homes a year and the amount \nof water--actually one-third of the amount of water used in the entire \nState of California each year. So we can see from a conservation \nstandpoint what an incredible impact using these materials has.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA is now considering whether to overturn 30 \nyears of precedent and regulate coal ash as a hazardous material, \ndespite findings from the Department of Energy, the Federal Highway \nAdministration, and State regulatory agencies throughout the country, \nas well as EPA itself. EPA's own studies show the toxicity level in \ncoal ash is well below the criteria that requires any type of hazardous \nwaste designation.\n  In fact, the EPA's May 2000 regulatory determination--in that \ndetermination they concluded that coal ash does not warrant regulation \nas hazardous waste and that doing so would be environmentally \ncounterproductive. However, new regulations first proposed in June of \n2010 would create a stigma for coal ash recycling and expose it to \nfrivolous lawsuits that could undermine the industry, cost thousands of \njobs, and take billions of dollars out of our economy at a time when \nworking families can least afford it. But the damage to American's \npocketbooks would not just stop with the undermining of this recycling \nindustry.\n  It is estimated that meeting the regulatory disposal requirements \nunder the EPA's subtitle C proposal would cost between $250 and $450 \nper ton, as opposed to about $100 per ton under the current system. \nThat could mean up to another $50 billion in costs, a burden on our \nelectricity generators that use coal and, most important, customers--\nAmerican families, businesses, and farmers--again, Americans throughout \nthis great country.\n  It is also estimated this regulation by EPA, this proposal, could \nmean the loss of more than 300,000 American jobs. That is why I have at \nthe desk the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, which I am \nintroducing today, along with Senator Kent Conrad, Senator Michael \nEnzi, Senator Mary Landrieu, Senator Rob Portman, Senator Ben Nelson, \nSenator Joe Manchin, and also Senator John Boozman; four Republicans \nand four Democrats. This is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  As I said, it is a companion to H. Res. 2273 that passed the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives last Friday with strong--and I emphasize \nstrong--bipartisan support. It takes a commonsense approach to ensuring \nwe can continue\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nthis vital industry and, in fact, build it, save millions of dollars \nfor American consumers and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  This bill not only preserves coal ash recycling by preventing the \nbyproducts from being treated as hazardous, it establishes Federal \nstandards for coal ash disposal. Under this legislation, States can set \nup their own permitting programs for the management and disposal of \ncoal ash. These programs would be required to be based on existing EPA \nregulations to protect human health and the environment. If a State \ndoes not implement an acceptable permit program, then the EPA regulates \nthe program for that State.\n  Importantly, States will know where they stand under this bill since \nthe benchmark for what constitutes a successful State program is set in \nstatute. EPA can say: Yes, the State does meet these standards or, no, \nit doesn't. But EPA cannot move the goalposts. This is a State's first \napproach that provides regulatory certainty. What is certain is, under \nthis bill, coal ash disposal sites will be required to meet established \nstandards. These include groundwater detection and monitoring, liners, \ncorrective action when environmental damage occurs, structural \nstability criteria and financial assurance and the recordkeeping needed \nto protect the public.\n  The Coal Residual Reuse and Management Act is legislation needed to \nprotect jobs and help reduce the cost of home and road construction and \nelectric bills.\n  I wish to thank both the Republicans and the Democrats who have taken \na leadership role and are joining me in cosponsoring this legislation. \nI particularly wish to thank my fellow Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nKent Conrad. I urge our colleagues to join us and support this \nimportant measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK (for himself, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Cardin, \n        and Mr. Kerry)\n  S. 1753. A bill to require operators of Internet websites that \nprovide access to international travel services and market overseas \nvacation destinations to provide on such websites information to \nconsumers regarding the potential health and safety risks associated \nwith traveling to such vacation destinations, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bi-partisan \nInternational Travelers Bill of Rights of 2011 with my colleagues \nSenators Scott Brown, Ben Cardin, and John Kerry. It is critical that \nconsumers are able to make fully informed decisions, especially with \nregard to health and safety, as more Americans use the Internet to book \noverseas travel.\n  This effort is on behalf of my constituent, Nancy Midlock of \nShorewood, Illinois, whose family suffered a great tragedy when her 8-\nyear old son, Brent, drowned in a hotel pool, while on vacation in \nMexico. If Ms. Midlock had been aware that this particular hotel did \nnot offer adequate emergency care, perhaps she would have chosen to \nstay at another location where such services were offered.\n  Because of this, I feel strongly that websites must do their best to \nmake sure travelers are aware of the available onsite health and safety \nservices before they book. If a hotel can provide details about their \nfitness center, golf courses, and high speed Internet, it can certainly \nindicate if there is a lifeguard on duty.\n  This bipartisan legislation requires website operators to display the \navailable health and safety information of their overseas destinations. \nThis includes Department of State travel warnings, the availability of \na nurse or physician on the premises, and the presence of a lifeguard \non duty. Additionally, the Department of State is required to update \nthe record of Deaths of US Citizens Aboard by Non-Natural Causes on a \nmonthly basis with increased granularity.\n  Finally, several provisions will ensure that the travel industry is \nnot burdened with impractical regulations. Website operators will have \none year to request and display the necessary information, if \navailable, and are protected from unfair lawsuits. Online travel \nwebsites provide an important service to many of us, and I look forward \nto working with them on behalf of all Americans. This bill is an \nimportant first step to ensure Americans are informed, prepared, and \nultimately more aware, global travelers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1753\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the hosting in the United States of the \n34th America's Cup by authorizing certain eligible vessels to \nparticipate in activities related to the competition, to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to introduce the \nAmerica's Cup Act of 2011. This legislation will enable foreign ships \nto compete for the 34th America's Cup, scheduled to begin in November.\n  I am happy to be joined by Senators Barbara Boxer, Jack Reed, and \nSheldon Whitehouse as original cosponsors.\n  The America's Cup is one of the oldest global sporting competitions. \nIts economic impact is surpassed only by the Olympics and the World Cup \nof soccer.\n  The event will begin in San Diego on November 12th. Next year the \nevents continue in Italy and Newport, Rhode Island, and they conclude \nin San Francisco in September 2013.\n  But the events in San Diego, Newport and San Francisco cannot take \nplace unless we waive certain laws that prohibit foreign vessels from \noperating in U.S. waters.\n  My legislation waives the Jones Act and the Passenger Vessel Services \nAct for all vessels participating in or supporting the America's Cup \nevents.\n  However, this waiver is limited and narrow. It was carefully crafted \nto protect our domestic industry and passenger service operators. The \nlegislation specifically states that the authority to operate in U.S. \nwaters is strictly limited to activities that occur during and related \nto America's Cup Events.\n  The vessels are prohibited from transporting more than 25 individuals \nor from receiving compensation for transportation.\n  The vessels are prohibited from transporting merchandise between \nports.\n  I understand that Jones Act waivers can be sensitive subjects for \nmany, but I want to assure my colleagues that this is a \nnoncontroversial bill.\n  The waiver is widely supported by local governments and business \ngroups in California and Rhode Island.\n  Equally important, it is not opposed by the American Maritime \nPartnership, AMP. Like many of us, the AMP's neutrality was critical to \nme before I decided to pursue this legislation.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the American Maritime Partnership, \nformerly called the American Cabotage Task Force, is the voice of the \nU.S. domestic maritime industry. The group represents more than 450 \nmember organizations ranging from vessel owners and shipboard unions to \nshipbuilders and equipment manufacturers.\n  These diverse interests recognize the importance of a strong domestic \nmaritime industry and share my belief that the continued success of \nthis industry is critical for America's economic security and \nindependence.\n  Needless to say, Jones Act waivers are not an issue the AMP takes \nlightly, so I thank them for their willingness to work with me to bring \nthis great event back to the United States.\n  The reason the American Maritime Partnership and so many other \norganizations support this legislation is that it will create jobs and \nstimulate the economy.\n  As I mentioned, the first event in the America's Cup World Series \nwill occur in San Diego. This event alone is expected to bring $20 \nmillion to local businesses.\n  When the larger America's Cup Finals take place in San Francisco, the \neconomic impacts are expected to be far greater. According to a recent \nstudy by Beacon Economics and the Bay Area Council the increase in \neconomic activity in San Francisco could be nearly $1.4 billion. This \nis three times the estimated impact of hosting a Super Bowl, $300-$500 \nmillion.\n  The event could create as many as 8,840 jobs in San Francisco.\n  Local Governments could generate an additional $85 million in \nrevenue.\n  Nationwide, the event is expected to increase domestic economic \nactivity by $1.9 billion and create 11,978 jobs.\n  The economic impacts of these events are significant.\n  The waiver is widely supported by labor, business and members of both \nparties.\n  This is straightforward, common sense legislation that will \nfacilitate international participation in a globally recognized \nsporting event.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

He has been an invaluable employee of mine and the State of \nNevada and the Senate. He is a person the entire Senate looks to for \nadvice and counseling on banking, housing issues, and other matters.\n  He has been a wonderful employee. I really hate to lose him, but his \ntalent is one people recognize, both Democrats and Republicans, and I \nam very proud of him.
