Madam President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 476, \nwhich is the Veterans Jobs Corps Act, sponsored by Senator Nelson of \nFlorida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 476, S. 3457, a bill to \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a \n     Veterans Jobs Corps, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the first hour will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Yesterday I filed cloture on the cyber security bill. As a result, \nthe filing deadline for first-degree amendments is 1 p.m. today. We \nwill let the Senate know about votes scheduled. We are trying to do one \non Burma and the African trade bill that we have wanted to do for a \nlong time, but Republicans have held it up to this point. But we will \nsee what we can do to move forward on that.\n  Madam President, last week GEN Keith Alexander, commander of the U.S. \nCyber Command, was asked to rate how prepared America was to face a \ncyber terrorist attack on the scale of 1 to 10. Here is what he said: \n``From my perspective I'd say around a 3.''\n  Keep in mind, 1 is totally unprepared, 10 is totally prepared. Three \nis what he said. One of the country's top national security experts \ngave us 3 out of 10, a failing grade by any standard.\n  He went to say that the type of cyber attacks that could black out \nthe United States for weeks or months are up seventeenfold in the last \n3 years. The Nation's top security experts have said a cyber 9/11 is \nimminent. They say frailties in our defenses against these attacks are \nmost urgent. They are a threat to our national security. Nothing is \nmore important.\n  So it was with disappointment last night that I filed cloture on \nlegislation to reinforce our defenses against these malicious \nattackers. Some are countries, some are organizations, some are \nindividuals. National security experts have been plain about the urgent \nneed to act. They say the question is not whether to act but whether we \nwill act in time.\n  One need only look at the headlines in papers all over America \ntoday--all over the world today. As we speak, 600 million people in \nIndia are without electricity. It is not believed there was any \nterrorism involved. It is believed it relates to the unusual weather, \nprobably based, many experts say, on global warming. They have never \nhad such heat in India, which has put a tremendous burden on their \nfragile power system.\n  This legislation we are trying to finish has been worked on for \nyears--years--not this Congress but going into last Congress. I was \npleased to hear last week that many of my colleagues were working on \nthoughtful amendments to improve and strengthen this measure in spite \nof the untoward pressure by the Chamber of Commerce to kill this \nlegislation. Senators on both sides have worked hard to address every \nconcern raised by the private sector about this legislation. Senators \nLieberman and Collins have been exemplary. The bill that is before this\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nbody now is not nearly as strong as I would like, but that is what \ncompromise is all about. I accept what they believed they had to do.\n\n  I expected a healthy debate on this important issue. I also expected \nto process many relevant amendments. Unfortunately, that was not good \nenough for a few of my Republican colleagues. Instead of substantive \namendments that deal with our Nation's cyber security, they are \ninsisting on political show votes. Instead of substantive amendments \nthat deal with our Nation's cyber security, they are looking at all \nkinds of other things. I had thought they were going to be serious \nabout this, but they are not. The threat is clear, and protecting the \ncomputer networks that control our electric grids, water supplies, and \nfinancial systems should be above political wrangling. So I was doubly \ndisappointed to watch a bipartisan process derailed by ideological \nattacks--for example, on a woman's right to choose her health care \ngenerally.\n  As 47 million Americans were set to gain access to preventive \nservices with no out-of-pocket costs, Republicans insisted once again \non a vote to repeal these benefits. They want to roll back the clock to \nthe days when insurance companies could discriminate against women. \nWhy? Because they were women. They had a preexisting disability--their \ngender.\n  To make matters worse they are willing to kill a bill that will \nprotect our Nation from cyber terrorism in the process. But this is not \na new tactic. You may remember, as we all do--and I was reminded of \nthat yesterday by a question that was asked of me by the distinguished \nassistant leader, Senator Durbin, that reminded the entire Senate that \non a surface transportation bill that put 3 million jobs at risk, their \nfirst amendment was by Senator Blunt on women's access to \ncontraception.\n  Still, I admit I was surprised that Senator McConnell would so \nbrazenly drag partisan politics into a debate over a measure crucial to \nnational security. It is today when the health care bill that we passed \ndesignates women will no longer be second-class citizens in relation to \nhealth care. So I cannot imagine a more untimely attack on women than \nyesterday.\n  Yesterday Senator McConnell and I received a letter from General \nAlexander, who runs the National Security Agency--he is one of the top \nleaders there--urging us to move more quickly. Here is what he wrote, \npartially:\n\n       The cyber threat facing the nation is real and demands \n     immediate action. The time to act is now; we simply cannot \n     afford further delay. We need to move forward on \n     comprehensive legislation now. I urge you to work together to \n     get it passed.\n\n  What more do we need? What more does the Chamber of Commerce need so \nthat they can release my Republican colleagues? I share General \nAlexander's concern.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader if he is aware of \nthe statement we had on the floor of the Senate by Senator Whitehouse, \nwho has been one of the leaders in putting together the cyber security \nbill relative to an incident at the Chamber of Commerce? I would like \nto read it, if I may, very briefly. And I quote Senator Whitehouse from \npage S5720 of the July 31 Congressional Record:\n\n       Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been the completely \n     unwitting victim of a long-term and extensive cyber \n     intrusion. Just last year the Wall Street Journal reported \n     that a group of hackers in China breached the computer \n     defenses of the U.S. Chamber, gained access to everything \n     stored in its systems, including information about 3 million \n     members, and they remained on the U.S. Chamber's network for \n     at least 6 months and possibly more than a year. The Chamber \n     only learned of the break-in when the FBI told the group that \n     servers in China were stealing their information.\n       Even after the Chamber was notified and increased its cyber \n     security, the article stated that the Chamber continued to \n     experience suspicious activity, including a ``thermostat at a \n     townhouse the Chamber owns on Capitol Hill . . . [that \n     communicated] with an Internet address in China . . . and . . \n     . a printer used by the Chamber executives spontaneously . . \n     . printing pages with Chinese characters.\n\n  As Senator Whitehouse has said:\n\n       These are the people we are supposed to listen to about \n     cyber security.\n\n  Can I ask the Senator from Nevada if he was aware that the chamber \nopposition to the cyber security bill certainly belies the fact that \nthey have been hacked by the Chinese themselves, and they didn't even \nknow it until the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported it?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in answer to my friend, we are living in a \nmodern world. A thermostat--isn't that what the Senator just said?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Is the connectivity to what China wants to get from the \nChamber of Commerce. Remember, that is only one way they get this \ninformation. But the numerous instruments we carry around--BlackBerrys, \niPhones, all these kinds of things, instruments we have at home--every \none of those is a vehicle to find out what is going on in my life, your \nlife, the life of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot imagine how my \nRepublican friends can follow this lead. I don't know who. We have had \nRepublican leaders in the past, on security--they have all said do \nsomething about this.\n  I would love to have a bipartisan bill to work through this with some \namendments. I do not expect anyone to think the bill Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Collins did is perfect. But it is a lot better than \nnothing. I hope people, when we vote on this tomorrow, will invoke \ncloture and pass their bill.\n  I had no choice but to file cloture. I am going to continue to work \nwith all Senators to find out if we can reach a compromise.\n  I wish I had better news. Ignorance is bliss. I wish I did not know \nas much. I wish the briefings I had down in the classified area of the \nCapitol--a lot of that information is kind of scary. It is scary that \nwe are not doing something about this bill.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader's time is \nreserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, while the majority whip is on the \nfloor, I want to pay him a compliment about some remarks I am going to \nmake this morning. A group of 6 people in the Senate, three Republicans \nand three Democrats, about a year and half ago began getting together \nto deal with our fiscal problems in this country, both entitlements as \nwell as our tax system as well as spending. I commend him for his work \non that because I am going to talk exactly about what this Senate and \nthis Congress has to do in the months ahead to deal with the fiscal \ncliff we are about to go over, but I want to acknowledge the fact that \nmany of us, most importantly the distinguished majority whip, have been \nworking on solutions that we are going to have to take if we are going \nto save the Republic and the economy.\n  I wanted to pass that on to the distinguished majority whip.\n  In my State of Georgia, the most recent report on unemployment posted \nour unemployment rate at 9 percent. In our State we advertise \nforeclosures every Friday and leading up to the first Tuesday. We set a \nrecord in the month of July on the number of foreclosures being \nadvertised.\n  Yesterday in my office I had a meeting with the President of \nLockheed. They are headquartered in Fort Worth, but they have one of \ntheir largest manufacturing facilities in Marietta, GA. They are going \nto have to send out their notice of potential layoffs that will take \nplace because of sequestration. We just got the second quarter GDP \nreport that said we are still slowing down and going down to 1.5 \npercent from a previous quarter of 2 percent. All indicators are that \nwe are heading to a second bump in our economy, and what has been a \nvery protracted and weak recovery is beginning to fail, and we are \nlooking at a fiscal problem that is going to affect this country for \ndecades to come.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the clock is \nrunning and time is running out. We can no longer postpone doing those \nthings\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nwe must do as a Congress to save the Republic and save our economy and \nbegin producing jobs in this country. The most important thing our \npeople need is certainty. They need certainty in regulation, and they \nneed certainty in tax policy. The American people need to know we are \ngoing to do what we have to do to save this Republic and to save this \neconomy. For the few minutes I have this morning, I wish to talk about \nthat. All the solutions are on the table. The problem is that none of \nus seems willing to take them off the table and put them on the floor \nand deal with it.\n\n  Let's talk about spending. Our deficit has been announced for this \nparticular fiscal year to be $1.2 trillion, $100 billion less than the \ntotal spending of the U.S. Government. We have to cut discretionary \nspending. We can't totally balance our books by cutting discretionary \nspending. We have entitlements. Our entitlements are growing because of \nwhat? Our economy. Why are food stamps up from $35 billion to $87 \nbillion? Because a lot people are hungry and a lot of people are out of \nwork. Why are AFDC and many other programs rising rapidly? It is due to \nthe economy. If we can deal with the spending and if we can deal with \nentitlements, then we can begin to bring back certainty and our economy \nwill come back and our jobs will come back and there will be less \npressure on the entitlement programs.\n  We are going to have to also recognize that ``entitlements'' is not \nthe right word for programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Those \nare contracts with the American people. I pay 6.2 percent of my \nincome--the President does as well--to the payroll tax for my Social \nSecurity. I paid 1.35 percent for my entire life to Medicare. That is a \ncontract with my government. We have to fix those programs.\n  Social Security is easy. Social Security is fixable by moving the \neligibility date to the outyears. For my grandchildren, eight of whom \nare under 8 years old, that ought to be 69 or 70 years old before they \nbecome eligible. We don't need to cut their benefit or raise their tax, \nbut we need to actuarially put out their eligibility. That is what \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did in 1983 to save Social Security until \nthe current pressure it is under right now.\n  Medicare is the tough animal to deal with. We are going to have to \nrecognize that we have to get out of the fee-for-service business and \nthen do a premium support business. That way, we can quantify premium \nsupport and know how much we are spending, and the American people have \nthe choice of buying the insurance and the coverage for Medicare that \nthey want. It ought to be means tested. We ought to make sure that \nthose who can afford more insurance, like myself, have less support and \nthose who are in need have more support. But it should be quantified in \nterms of support for premiums, not a fee-for-service reimbursement \nsystem.\n  In terms of our revenues, everybody always wants to talk about taxes. \nLast week we had a debate that was meaningless and worthless over \npolitical positions of two political parties on tax systems. We need to \nlook at Bowles-Simpson. We need to clean up our Tax Code. We need to \nuse the tax expenditures that we get as income by reducing them and \nwaiving them. We need to use that income to reduce the rates on \ncorporate taxes and all the marginal rates of taxation so we can \nencourage people to spend their money, invest their money, and make our \nTax Code simple. We don't need to raise taxes, we need to raise their \nattitude. We need to improve the plight the American taxpayers have \ntoday by giving them certainty and a tax code that is clean, a tax code \nthat is fair, and a tax code that produces jobs, revenues, and growth.\n  My message this morning is this: If we go up to probably Friday when \nwe go home for the month of August and we come back in September for 60 \ndays and wait until the election, we are putting off dealing with \nissues that affect our economy, affect our people, and affect our \nfuture. I, for one, stand ready the minute the leaders are ready to put \nthese issues on the floor, and let's vote on them. Let's deal with the \nfuture of the American people, their taxes, their entitlements, and the \nguarantees we made to them on Social Security and Medicare. Let's deal \nwith our responsibility. Let's not sequester spending, let's cut where \nwe should cut and let's add money where we should add money. Let's run \nthis country like a business and not like a political action committee.\n  I yield to the Republican leader.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican is recognized.\n\n\n                           Defense Sequester\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday I came to the floor to draw \nattention to the administration's transparent attempts to conceal the \nimpact of defense cuts President Obama demanded as part of last year's \ndebt-ceiling deal. I was referring, of course, to the administration's \nMonday notification to businesses that work with the government that \nthey are under no obligation to warn employees who might lose their \njobs as a result of these cuts. Incredibly, the administration's \nargument was that they don't expect the cuts to happen even though the \nPresident had not done a thing to prevent them and even though Congress \nhad to pass a law requiring the administration to tell us what the cuts \nwould look like.\n  So let's be clear. The administration officials who sent out this \nnotification instructing businesses to keep quiet about these cuts know \njust as well as I do that the cuts are coming unless Senate Democrats \nact or the President of the United States finally decides to come up \nwith a credible plan to replace them.\n  The only reason the administration sent out this guidance to \nemployers earlier this week was to keep people in the dark about the \nimpact these defense cuts will have until, of course, after the \nelection. So the White House is clearly trying to hide the ball from \nall of us. The clearest proof of that is the fact that no one even \ndenied it after I noted it here just yesterday. But if we did need \nfurther proof, we actually got it yesterday when the Obama \nadministration's Office of Management and Budget issued guidance of its \nown to departments and agencies telling folks they should prepare for \nthe cuts.\n  So let's get this straight. Government workers should prepare for \ncuts, but private businesses and their employers should not. Not a week \nseems to pass that we don't see more evidence of the President's \nabsolute contempt for the private sector, and here is the latest. The \nFederal Government is told to prepare for cuts, and yet the private \nsector businesses are specifically told it would be ``inappropriate'' \nto tell people they could lose their jobs. The cuts to the Defense \nDepartment under sequester are the law of the land, and until Congress \nchanges that fact they are totally foreseeable.\n  Yesterday the Director of OMB exempted appropriations for military \npersonnel from the sequester, providing even more certainty that the \ncuts to defense will fall upon training, maintenance, and weapons \nprocurement and development. So the fact is that private businesses \nhave a higher degree of certainty that their workforces will be hit. \nYet here is the administration's message: If you are in the public \nsector, prepare for cuts. If you are in the private sector, don't even \nwarn your employees that their jobs actually may be on the line.\n  What a perfect summary of this administration's approach to the \neconomy and jobs over the past 3\\1/2\\ years. Private businesses didn't \nearn their success; somebody else made that happen. Now the President \nsays: If you work hard in the private sector, you don't even deserve to \nknow if your job is on the chopping block. The private sector is doing \njust fine; it is the government that needs help. That is the message of \nthis administration.\n  Just as disturbing is what this says about the administration's \napproach to our national defense. The President's own Defense Secretary \nhas said these cuts would hollow out our Armed Forces. Yet the \nPresident has not said a word about how he plans to responsibly replace \nthem or, if he accepts a weakened national defense, how he will carry \nthem out. Congress had to actually pass a law forcing him to make these \nplans clear to everybody. Now, he hasn't signed the bill yet. It went \nto him by voice vote out of the Senate last week. The defense cuts that \nwill be triggered under the sequester are in addition to the $487 \nbillion in cuts to the Department identified by Secretary Gates.\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\n  It is time for the President to provide the leadership to avoid these \nreductions that will render his own strategy unsustainable. A lot of \npeople are wondering how they will be affected by these cuts. The fact \nthat many of them will be voting in swing States in November is no \nreason to leave them wondering about their fate any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I have been listening to \nthe debate on spending and taxes and our debt and deficit. I come to \nthe floor this morning with a few visual aids and charts and graphs to \ntry to dispel some of the myths I have been hearing.\n  The first myth I constantly hear is about the Draconian cuts being \nproposed in the House budget. I think this chart pretty well dispels \nthat by showing that 10 years ago, in 2002, the Federal Government \nspent $2 trillion. This last year--this year--we will spend about $3.8 \ntrillion. We have doubled spending in just 10 years. The debate moving \nforward shows that under the House budget, we would spend $4.9 \ntrillion. President Obama's budget proposes spending $5.8 trillion. I \nthink it is clear to see from this chart that nobody is proposing net \ncuts in spending. We are just trying to limit the rate of growth in \nspending.\n  Another way of looking at spending is over 10 years. In the 1990s, \nthe Federal Government over a 10-year period spent $16 trillion. The \nlast decade, from 2002 through 2011, the Federal Government spent $28 \ntrillion. Again, the debate moving forward is, over the next 10 years \ndo we spend $40 trillion, as the House budget proposes, or do we spend \n$47 trillion? Again, no cuts, just trying to reduce the rate of growth.\n  Let's talk a little bit about what the Federal Government has spent \nunder the current administration. Over the 4 years of President Obama's \nadministration, the Federal Government in total will spend $14.4 \ntrillion. Think back to the last graph. That is almost as much as we \nspent in the decade of the 1990s. The entire deficit for that time \nperiod was $5.3 trillion. In other words, we had to borrow $5.3 \ntrillion of the $14.4 trillion we spent; that is, about 37 cents of \nevery dollar spent, we borrowed. We put that debt burden on the backs \nof our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren.\n  I often hear that the whole problem with the deficit is caused by the \nwar costs or the 2001 to 2003 tax cuts. We added those to the chart \nhere. We can see that the total amount over that 4-year period of the \noverseas war costs and the Bush tax cuts was $1.2 trillion. It is less \nthan 25 percent of the total deficit. Again, they are a factor but not \nthe cause of the deficit. The cause of the deficit primarily is \nspending.\n  This chart basically shows what has been happening over the last 50 \nyears. The structural deficit we have incurred is a basic result, on \naverage, of the Federal Government spending 20.2 percent of the gross \ndomestic product from 1959 to 2008, prior to this administration. On \nthe other hand, revenue generation averaged about 18.1 percent of GDP, \nwhich gives us a 2.1-percent structural deficit. That is why our debt \nhas continued to grow.\n  Under this administration, starting with the recession, that \nstructural deficit exploded, with tax revenue dropping to about 15 \npercent and spending skyrocketing to 25 percent and now to about 24 \npercent. It is on a trajectory to hit 35 percent by the year \n2035. Clearly, that is unsustainable.\n\n  Another way of taking a look at the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, in \nterms of their total effect on our deficit figure, is to actually put \nthem on a bar chart. The red bars represent the total deficit. The blue \nportions on the bottom of those red charts are the actual reductions in \nrevenue from those tax cuts. We can see it is not a very large figure. \nIn total, over that--I guess that is an 11-year time period, the total \nBush tax cuts were about $1.7 trillion, while the entire deficit was \nabout $7.5 trillion. The tax cuts represent about 22 percent of that \ntotal deficit--but, again, when we take a look at the last 4 years, a \nfar smaller portion of the deficit, because the primary deficit over \nthe last 4 years has been on the spending side of the equation.\n  What does the President offer us for solutions? Last year, he \nproposed the Buffett rule. In a speech on September 26, in proposing \nthe Buffett rule, he used the basic principle of fairness that he said \nthe Buffett rule represents, and if that was applied to our Tax Code, \nit could raise enough to not only pay for his jobs bill, it would also \nstabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade. Think about what \nPresident Obama said there. He said the Buffett rule would not only pay \nfor his jobs bill but would stabilize our debt and deficits for the \nnext decade. Here is the chart and here is the fact: The Buffett rule \nfor 4 years--4 years of the Buffett rule, it was projected, would raise \nabout $20 billion total. President Obama's 4 years of deficit is $5.3 \ntrillion. So let's state it a different way: $5,300 billion. It doesn't \ntake a math major to realize $20 billion doesn't even come close to \nstabilizing a deficit of $5,300 billion. President Obama misled the \nAmerican people. I think the President of the United States has a far \nhigher duty to the American people. He should be honest with them.\n  Last week, we debated the other tax proposals offered by our friends \non the other side of the aisle. In proposing this and actually, \nunfortunately, passing this piece of tax legislation, the majority \nleader said this piece of legislation is about debt. It is about the \ndebt, he said. We have to do something about the debt, and we have \ntried mightily to do that. We have tried mightily.\n  Again, let's take a look at the facts. The first years of that tax \nlegislation--the only years that count--would have raised $67 billion a \nyear on average compared to last year's deficit of $1,326 billion. Is \nthat trying mightily to fix the debt and deficit? I don't think so.\n  If we were serious about fixing our debt and deficit situation, if we \nwere trying mightily to do that, we might have tried passing a budget \nin the last few years. We might have actually brought appropriations \nbills to the floor so they could be debated and passed in the House and \nsigned into law so we would not be faced with what we are faced with \nright now, which is a continuing resolution to fund the government in \n2013.\n  Again, dispel the myth: The Democrats' tax proposal would do \nnothing--almost nothing--to stabilize our debt and deficit. It is \nsimply a political exercise. It is political demagoguery. It is class \nwarfare.\n  I ask the American people to consider a simple question: Are they for \nincreasing taxes on the productive sector of our economy, the small \nbusinesses, those 1 million small businesses that would be affected by \nthis? The money that would be taken out of those small businesses that \nthey would use to expand their business, to buy capital equipment, to \nincrease wages, to pay for health care, and invest in 401(k) plans, it \ndoes not stabilize the debt and deficit. It does nothing to do that.\n  I think Republicans basically agree with President Obama and \nPresident Clinton. Back on August 5, 2009, just as we were coming out \nof recession, President Obama said: ``You don't raise taxes in a \nrecession.'' I agree with that. Republicans agree with that.\n  Back in December--the last November and December of 2010--right after \nthe lameduck session when all the tax rates were extended for 2 years, \nPresident Obama said: ``If we allow these taxes to go up . . . the \neconomy would grow less.''\n  He was right. Back then, by the way, average growth in our economy \nwas about 3.1 percent. During the last four quarters now, the economy \nhas only grown about 2 percent. Our economy is in worse shape. It only \ngrew at 1.5 percent in the last quarter. We can see the downward \ntrajectory.\n  Of course, President Clinton also said probably the best thing we \ncould do is to extend all the tax rates to take that sense of \nuncertainty off the table. That is what Republicans are proposing.\n  Let's not increase taxes on any American at this point in time. Let's \nnot threaten any kind of government shutdown. As much as fiscal \nconservatives do not like the Budget Control Act or those spending \nlimits, we think it is reasonable policy to pass a 6-month continuing \nresolution so a responsible leader can come into this town and actually \nstart fixing our debt and deficit situation.\n  That is what Republicans are all about, taking the uncertainty of a \nshutdown off the table, taking the uncertainty of what people's tax \nrates\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\nwill be over the next year off the table, and being responsible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Small Businesses\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I don't believe any State has felt the \nbrunt of this recession more than the State of Nevada. We are a State \nthat leads the Nation in unemployment, leads in foreclosure, and leads \nthe country in bankruptcy.\n  There is not an evening that goes by or a day that goes by that I am \nnot thinking about what can we do to create jobs and get our economy \nmoving. In order to help small businesses thrive again, we must tear \ndown the barriers to growth and opportunity and launch this Nation into \nits next great chapter.\n  Small businesses are our Nation's economic backbone and they were \nbuilt on the very same values of hard work and determination our Nation \nwas founded upon. This issue is very personal to me. I spent most of my \nchildhood working at my father's automotive shop in Carson City--\nHeller's Engine and Transmission. At this small business my dad taught \nme how to fix engines and transmissions but, more importantly, I \nlearned about hard work, I learned about personal responsibility, and I \nlearned how to provide an important service to our community.\n  Although my father's shop has been closed for some time, I have asked \nhim what he would do as a small business owner in today's environment. \nFirst of all, he said, you couldn't open that same shop, not with the \nregulations, the taxes, the overhead that would be involved from what \nthis government has produced. But his simple answer is he would have to \nclose his shop because of the uncertainty and the costs due to all the \nFederal regulations and mandates.\n  Contrary to what some in Washington may believe, my father built his \nbusiness and he worked long hours to make it successful. It was through \nthis business that he provided for my mother and my five brothers and \nsisters. I can't thank my father enough for the values he instilled in \nme. It is humbling to think that all around our country sons and \ndaughters are still learning from their parents who are making a living \nat their small businesses. These businesses are often struggling to \nmake payroll, pay suppliers and, in some instances, can't even afford \nto pay themselves. These Americans are fighting every day to achieve \nthe American dream, but what they get from Washington is more attacks \non their livelihood in the form of new regulations, new mandates, and, \nof course, every day the talk of new taxes. Just last week, the \nmajority party offered a tax plan that would kill 6,000 jobs in Nevada \nand more than 700,000 jobs nationwide. In a stagnant economy suffering \nfrom chronic unemployment, we should be looking for ways to strengthen \njob growth, not pushing destructive tax increases that serve as nothing \nmore than political talking points.\n  Every week I hold telephone townhall meetings with Nevadans from \nacross the State. Lately, a lot of Nevadans have discussed how some in \nthe majority party are willing to take our economy off a fiscal cliff \nif Republicans will not vote for tax increases on small businesses.\n  For the past 2 weeks, I have asked all those participating in these \ntownhall meetings if they believe this type of partisan politics is \ngood for the economy. We shouldn't be surprised to know that a vast \nmajority believe partisanship at the expense of the economy needs to \nend, and with that I agree.\n  Last Friday, I visited Joe Dutra, who owns Kimmie Candy in Reno, at \nhis factory. He talked about how he is fighting to grow his business \nwith his kids, John and Kathryn. Unfortunately, instead of supporting \nsmall businesses throughout our country, Washington has been making a \ndifficult situation even worse. Joe has been getting a lot of heat \nlately from the press because he is standing up against politicians who \nbelittle his efforts and has had the courage to fight the destructive \npolicies coming out of Washington.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that Joe built his business and works \nhard to keep it going. That is what many small businesses across this \ncountry want to do. They want nothing more than to expand their \nbusinesses, hire more people, and pass on a legacy to their children \nand grandchildren that shows with hard work and dedication, anything is \npossible in America. Instead of encouraging this, Washington has \nincreased their burden with miles of regulatory redtape. They passed a \nhealth care law that is costing jobs and continues with a top-down, \nWashington-knows-best mentality that has led to an anemic economy.\n  Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and will be a key \ncomponent to our recovery. It is far past time Washington recognized \nthis by encouraging their growth and getting our Nation on the right \ntrack.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johanns pertaining to the introduction of S. 3467 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, as I begin to talk this \nmorning about the wind production tax credit, I think we all know that \ntax credits have encouraged our wind industry to invest in that great, \nnew, cutting-edge form of power, and that has resulted in the creation \nof thousands of American jobs and wind projects all over our country. \nForty-eight States have a stake in our wind energy industry. But the \nproduction tax credit that has driven this investment in American \nmanufacturing and job creation is about to expire at the end of this \nyear.\n  I have been coming to the floor on an ongoing basis to make the case \nthat we ought to extend the wind production tax credit as soon as \npossible.\n  I know the Acting President pro tempore has been here on a couple of \noccasions when I have spoken about this issue before. In fact, this is \nthe 14th time I have come to the floor to speak to this important \nopportunity but also the peril that awaits us if we do not extend the \nwind production tax credit. The key here is that we have created \nuncertainty. The wind energy industry is beginning to back off \ninvestments for next year. They need certainty. They need \npredictability.\n  I have come to the floor today to talk, as I have been on each \noccasion, about a particular State and that State's contribution to the \nwind industry. Today I want to talk about North Dakota. It is a State \nwith enough wind energy potential that it could meet more than 240 \ntimes its own electricity needs--240 times its own electricity needs. \nIn fact, we know North Dakota sits in an ocean of wind, and it could \npower much of the Midwest if we could get that electricity to the city \ncenters that need it, and if we keep the wind production tax credit in \nplace.\n  What I want to talk about in particular in North Dakota are a couple \nof manufacturing facilities there. In the late 1990s, LM Glasfiber \nopened a facility in Grand Forks, which is in eastern North Dakota, \nclose to the border of Minnesota, as shown on this map. They produce \nwind turbine blades there. And just a few years ago, DMI Industries--a \ncompany that manufactures the towers--opened a factory in West Fargo. \nThat is also in eastern North Dakota. It is south of Grand Forks, over \nhere, as shown on this map, on the Minnesota border as well.\n  These wind turbines--and the Acting President pro tempore knows \nthis--are magnificent machines. They sit on\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\ntowers that in some cases are 100 meters tall. The wind blades \nthemselves are like aircraft wings. The cell that sits on the top of \nthe towers, where the gear box and all the technology is--these are \nvery technical, very complicated, very sophisticated machines, and \nmanufacturing them brings out American greatness. The point I am making \nis these are two important facilities in North Dakota.\n  I also want to talk about the leadership that exists in North Dakota \nwhen it comes to wind energy. I want to start with our colleague, \nSenator Conrad. He has been a proponent of the production tax credit \nfor over a decade. His reasoning is that this is a great opportunity \nfor North Dakota, as well as for the country, and the wind production \ntax credit creates certainty.\n  His colleague Senator Hoeven has also taken up the cause during his \nfirst term in the Senate.\n  One of the key points I want to make here is those two Senators are \nfrom two political parties. Yet they each support the wind production \ntax credit. Last month, North Dakota hosted a renewable action energy \nsummit in Bismarck, and both Senator Conrad and Senator Hoeven \nattended. During this summit national leaders talked about how North \nDakota's robust and diverse energy sector has provided the model for \ncreating jobs and helping reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I have to say this strikes me as the most intelligent kind of policy. \nIt is a mix of traditional energy sources with sustainable energy such \nas wind. What you get from that is advanced technology. You have \ncertainty for developers. You spur investment. You create jobs. I \napplaud North Dakota's leadership in putting in place a smart energy \npolicy, an all-of-the-above energy policy, as well as our colleagues' \nwork on this subject.\n  The point I am making is that North Dakota recognizes investment in \nwind energy is an investment in jobs. Some of those numbers make that \npoint. Some 2,000 jobs in North Dakota are supported by the wind energy \nindustry. Those jobs are there no doubt because of the existence of a \ntax credit. I would add that the tax credit is a production tax credit. \nSo you produce the power and then you get the tax credit. This is not \nspeculative. This is not hoping that something will happen. This is \nbased on production of electrons. That is why it is such a powerful \ntool. It has been used in the past, by the way, in other energy \nsectors. You produce power, you produce energy, you are rewarded with \nan energy tax credit.\n  Besides jobs, the wind industry provides $4 million annually in \nproperty tax and land lease payments that go to supporting local \ncommunities and vital services tied to those communities. Where does \nNorth Dakota rank nationally? Well, they rank 10th in terms of \ninstalled wind capacity, and third in the Nation in percentage of \nelectricity derived from wind, with almost 15 percent of their entire \npower supply coming from wind energy projects. That is the equivalent \nin North Dakota of 430,000 homes being powered by wind.\n  That number--I know this is important to the Presiding Officer--\nequals about 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide that are not \nreleased into our atmosphere every year. It is simple: The wind \nindustry is important to America's future and it should be incented in \ncommunities that can support it, such as in North Dakota.\n  The wind production tax credit is that incentive. Without a doubt, if \nthe PTC is allowed to expire, this important American industry will \nshrink, move overseas, and take thousands of American jobs with it. So \nas I have done when I come to the floor, I am imploring our colleagues \nto work with me, to work with us to stop this possibility from becoming \na reality. Wind energy is not a partisan issue.\n  As I have noted, many of our colleagues agree with me, whether they \nare on this side of the aisle or the other side of the aisle. They \nunderstand if we do not extend the PTC we risk losing thousands of jobs \nand crippling a very important, successful, existing industry. So it \nwould be a decision that we would all regret for a long time if we let \nthe PTC expire.\n  As I close, I again implore and urge my colleagues to work on this \ntogether. If we believe in energy independence and job creation, as we \nsay, then we need to work together. Let's show Americans that we \nunderstand the economy is job one. One of the ways we can create new \njobs is to extend the wind production tax credit. One of the ways we \nlose jobs is if we let the wind production tax credit expire. So we \nought to be passing the PTC as soon as possible.\n  The production tax credit equals jobs. It is crucial to our future. \nLet's not let the wind production tax credit be a casualty of election \nyear partisanship. We cannot--America cannot--afford it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \nhis remarks about the production tax credit. This is incredibly \nimportant to the wind industry. It is a big factor in the economy of \nColorado and certainly a substantial factor in the economy of Oregon. \nSo I join him in making the case, if you will, that we need to make \nsure we continue to drive forward this clean energy manufacturing \neconomy that produces zero carbon dioxide.\n  I can tell you, I recently had the chance to drive from the northern \nborder of Oregon to the southern border in an electric Leaf. We have \nenough charging stations now along the interstate to make this \npossible. It was miraculous to not produce a single molecule of \npollution out of that car trip.\n  If that energy for that car is coming from wind, then not any--zero--\ncarbon dioxide is produced, a zero impact on global warming. So \ncertainly what is very good for the American worker, for the American \neconomy, is also good for our air and the environment here in our \nNation and around the world. We must get this production tax credit \npassed. I will continue to work with him to make this happen.\n  I rise today to address a critical issue for Oregon's ranchers and \nfarmers who are dealing with wildfire devastation--huge devastation. I \nam going to put up some pictures. We have had in the last month the \nlargest fires in Oregon in over a century. An enormous amount of land \nhas been burned in the process.\n  The Long Draw fire in Malheur County burned 557,000 acres or, to \ntranslate that, that is about 900 square miles. This is the largest \nwildfire in Oregon since the 1800s. This chart shows the incredibly \npowerful flames these ranchers and farmers have been dealing with. As \nthese flames sweep across the grasslands, the cattle and other \nlivestock are often killed in the process. The land does not quickly \nrecover because of the intensity of the fire and how it affects the \nsoil.\n  Let me give you another view of this same fire. This is actually a \npicture taken from Nevada looking toward Oregon. You see this massive \nwall, this massive wall of smoke coming across. It is an incredible \nsight to behold when a fire is in full rage as this was.\n  The Long Draw fire was one of the major fires, but the Miller \nHomestead fire was another. It burned about 250 square miles. Here \nagain, you can see the dramatic flame front southeast Oregon was \nfighting. This is moving through the sagebrush, continuously \nprogressing, moving very quickly when the wind is driving it, creating \nan enormous wall of smoke.\n  Let's take one more view. Here we see the aftermath of the fire when \nit was stopped by a road as an interlude. It completely destroyed land \non one side of the highway, and what it looked like, this green \ngrassland, this was not all dry and parched, this green grassland, \nbefore the fire moved through.\n  In addition to these two huge fires, we have had a number of others--\nthe Lexfalls fire in Jefferson County; the Baker Canyon fire in \nJefferson and Wasco Counties; the West Crater fire in Malheur County, \neach of these having a substantial impact in addition to the Miller \nHomestead and the Long Draw fires.\n  Together, these fires have consumed over 1,100 square miles. That is \nroughly an area the size of Rhode Island. So an entire State would fit \ninto the area burned in Oregon. These fires are now under control, and \nsoutheastern Oregon is surveying the damage and picking up the pieces.\n  One of the things they would immediately turn to, our farmers and our \nranchers, would be the disaster assistance that has always existed \nwithin the farm bill. But guess what. These disaster assistance \nprograms are not\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\navailable because the House has failed to act on the farm bill. This \nSenate passed the farm bill, a bipartisan bill, Republicans and \nDemocrats coming together.\n  In it are the reauthorizations of four key programs. One of them is \nthe Livestock Indemnity Program that addresses when there is a natural \ndisaster like this, addresses the death and the loss of cattle and \nother livestock.\n  A second is the Emergency Assistance for Livestock Program called the \nELAP. But it basically addresses the lost value of forage on private \nland, and then the LFP program, or Livestock Forage Disaster Program, \nthat addresses the loss of forage on public land. Those of you who are \nnot from the West may not be aware that a lot of our livestock is \noperating on land that is leased to our ranchers. So when a fire like \nthis affects those public lands, it also is affecting the value of the \nlease to those farmers and the ability of their livestock--those that \nhave survived the fire--to be able to find forage and continue to live.\n  It is deeply disturbing that the House has not voted on the farm bill \nand sent it to conference. I urge them to act on this quickly. Without \nthese key disaster relief programs, ranchers and farmers who have lost \nlivestock and grazing land are left with few options. That is wrong. A \nrancher in southeastern Oregon who has been devastated by these \nwildfires should not pay the price because the House of Representatives \nwill not bring a farm bill that it can pass and send to conference.\n  Let's be clear. The best solution to this problem, as well as many \nother issues, would be for the House to pass the bipartisan Senate farm \nbill. This would bring timely relief to all of those who have suffered \nin the disaster, and certainly to the farmers and ranchers across \nOregon who have been struck by the largest fire in this century, a fire \nlarger than the State of Rhode Island.\n  But if we can get consensus to bring immediate relief in the face of \nthe inaction by the House, then we should do so. That is why I have \nintroduced the Wildfire and Drought Relief for Farmers and Ranchers Act \nto extend the most urgently needed programs immediately. This would \nextend the programs for livestock indemnity. This would extend the \nprogram for forage loss on public lands and forage loss on private \nlands.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the same bipartisan spirit they brought \nto the farm bill to recognize that this Chamber has already voted to \nextend disaster programs and, if necessary, move quickly to extend \nthese disaster programs, if necessary by themselves, in order to help \nour ranchers, to help our farmers who have been affected by these \nnatural disasters, including this once-in-a-century fire in the State \nof Oregon.\n  Again, I encourage the House of Representatives to immediately get \nthe farm bill to conference. This should be done in the context of many \nprograms that need to be renewed that have been worked out. But in \nabsence of that, let's find a way to move quickly to assist our farmers \nand ranchers in the face of devastating natural disasters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for the duration of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Anniversary of I-35w Bridge Disaster\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the 5-year \nanniversary of the horrific collapse of the I-35W bridge in \nMinneapolis, and to pay tribute to those who lost their lives on that \ntragic summer day.\n  As I said the day after the bridge collapse, ``A bridge just should \nnot fall down in the middle of America.'' Not a bridge that is a few \nblocks from my house. Not an eight-lane highway. Not a bridge that I \ndrive over every day with my husband and my daughter. But that is what \nhappened that sunny summer day in Minneapolis, MN.\n  I can't even begin to count how many times I have thought about that \nbridge, and everyone in our State actually remembers where they were \nthe day it collapsed. It was one of the most heavily traveled bridges \nin our State, and in all that day 13 people lost their lives and scores \nwere injured. So many more could have been killed if not for the first \nresponders, if not for the volunteers, who instead of running away from \nthe disaster, when they had no idea what actually happened, ran toward \nit and rescued their fellow citizens.\n  Everyone was shocked and horrified, but on that evening and in the \ndays that followed, the whole world watched as our State came together, \nas they did in the minutes and hours after the collapse. I was proud to \nbe a Minnesotan.\n  The emergency response to the bridge collapse demonstrated an \nimpressive level of preparedness and coordination that should be a \nmodel for the Nation. We saw true heroes in the face of unimaginable \ncircumstances. We saw an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter named Shannon \nHanson, who grabbed her lifejacket and was among the first at the \nscene. Tethered to a yellow life rope in the midst of broken concrete \nand tangled rebar, she swam from car to car searching for survivors up \nand down in that river.\n  We saw that schoolbus perched precariously on the falling bridge \ndeck. I called it the miracle bus. Inside there were dozens of kids \nfrom a very poor neighborhood, who had been on a swimming field trip. \nTheir bus was crossing the bridge when it dropped. Thanks to the quick \naction of responsible adults and the children themselves, they all \nsurvived, they all got off that bus.\n  Although you can never feel good about a tragedy like this one, I \ncertainly felt good about our police officers, firefighters, \nparamedics, and all the medical personnel who literally saved dozens \nand dozens of lives.\n  On this, the 5-year anniversary of the bridge collapse, we should \nagain honor those heroes and the countless lives they saved.\n  For a minute, I want to tell you a few examples. A woman named Pamela \nLouwagie, who writes for the Star Tribune, gathered some of their \nstories this weekend. Some of these people I know. Lindsey Patterson \nWalls was in a Volkswagen that went over the bridge; she kicked out the \ndoors and windows and was able to get out and survive. She is putting \nthe collapse to work in her career. She is a youth worker who counsels \nchildren and teens and she discovered that her trauma, as hard as it \nwas, wasn't so different than that of her clients. She felt insecure in \nthe world, wondering whether another bridge would collapse under her, \nand she realized that the homeless teens she counsels felt insecure, \nwondering where they would sleep at night. It is a lesson she takes \nwith her every day in her job.\n  Betsy Sathers is someone I have come to know. Her husband was 29 \nyears old when he died in that bridge collapse. They had just gotten \nmarried and they planned on having a family. She decided to adopt \nchildren from Haiti. In the aftermath of that earthquake, she already \nknew the names of these children she was going to adopt. She would not \nlet those kids just be left in that rubble. She contacted our office. \nWe worked with her and brought Alyse and Ross back from Haiti, and she \nis their mother. I saw them this weekend with their big smiles and \ntheir mom. That is an inspirational story.\n  The Coulter family was in their minivan--the kids, the mom, the dad. \nIt was clear at the beginning that they were severely injured and the \nmom, Paula, they didn't think would survive. Also, after they learned \nthat maybe she was going to make it--she had devastating injuries to \nher brain and her back--one time during one of the surgeries, they had \nto jolt her heart back to life. They had suggested that her family \nstart looking for nursing home care. But she didn't give up--Paula and \nher family didn't give up. After 2 years, with the help of some great \ntherapists, she could walk and move again and go back to her counseling \njob part time, and two summers ago she and her trainer ran a 5K race. \nThat is inspirational.\n  Then there is the bridge itself. After it collapsed, it was so clear \nto us that we had to rebuild it and we had to rebuild it right away. In \njust 3 days, Senator Coleman and I worked together in the Senate to \nsecure $250 million in emergency bridge reconstruction funding. \nRepresentative Jim Oberstar led the way in the House. Approval of the \nfunding came with remarkable speed in this Chamber. It was bipartisan \nand we\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nwere able to get the funding. From the moment that bridge started \nconstruction to the end, it took less than a year to rebuild a bridge \nthat is now a 10-lane highway.\n  Today, the new I-35W bridge is a symbol of pride and the resilience \nof a community. This weekend, when I was at the Twin Cities heroes \nparade with our veterans, the organizer looked at me proudly and said: \nTonight they are lighting up the 35W bridge red, white, and blue. So it \nliterally has become a symbol of hope in our State.\n  The new bridge is a hundred-year bridge with more lanes than before. \nIt is also safer. The bridge includes state-of-the-art anti-icing \ntechnology, as well as shoulders, which the old bridge didn't have.\n  Of course, bridge safety was on the minds of all Americans, \nespecially those of us in Minnesota, following the bridge collapse. \nImmediately afterward, the Minnesota Department of Transportation \ninspected all 25 bridges in Minnesota with a similar design as the I-\n35W bridge. This inspection led to the closing of the Highway 23 bridge \nin St. Cloud, where bulging of gusset plates was found. I remember \nseeing it. It accelerated its planned replacement of that bridge, which \nopened in 2009.\n  But the reforms were not all structural. Since then, the department \nof transportation in our State has improved the way the inspections and \nmaintenance functions of the department handle critical information and \nnecessary repairs.\n  Just as in Minnesota, bridge safety became a priority nationally as \nwell. After the National Transportation Safety Board identified gusset \nplates as being heavily responsible for the collapse, a critical review \nof gusset plates was conducted on bridges across America, and there was \nnew attention focused on deterioration of steel and weight added to \nbridges over the years through maintenance and resurfacing projects.\n  The national organization that develops highway and bridge standards, \nthe American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, \nupdated bridge manuals that are used by State and county bridge \nengineers across the Nation.\n  I will say that 5 years later we have still not made as much progress \nas I would have liked. The Federal Highway Administration estimates \nthat over 25 percent of the Nation's 600,000 bridges are still either \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers gave bridges in America a C \ngrade in its 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure and a D for \ninfrastructure overall.\n  We did take a positive step forward with the recent bipartisan \ntransportation bill that will help State departments of transportation \nfix bridges and improve infrastructure.\n  For Minnesota, that bill means more than $700 million for Minnesota's \nroads, bridges, transit, congestion mitigation projects, and mobility \nimprovements.\n  The bill gives greater flexibility to State departments of \ntransportation to direct Federal resources to address unique needs in \neach State. It also establishes benchmarks and national policy goals, \nincluding strengthening our Nation's bridges, and links those to \nFederal funds. It reduces project delivery time and accelerates \nprocesses that will reduce in half the amount of time to get projects \nunder way.\n  However, we all know more needs to be done. While other countries are \nmoving full steam ahead with infrastructure investments, we seem to be \nsimply treading water, and in an increasingly competitive global \neconomy standing still is falling behind.\n  China and India are spending, respectively, 9 and 5 percent of their \nGDP on infrastructure. We need to keep up. We need to build our \ninfrastructure. That is why I authored the Rebuild America Jobs Act \nlast fall, which would have invested in our Nation's infrastructure. It \nwould have also created a national infrastructure bank--something the \noccupant of the chair is familiar with--to help facilitate public-\nprivate partnerships, so that projects could be built that would \notherwise be too expensive for a city, a county, or even a State to \naccomplish on its own. We included a provision to set aside a certain \namount of funding for road projects. Unfortunately, while we got a \nmajority of the Senate voting to advance this bill, we were unable to \nbreak the filibuster.\n  So 5 years to the day after the I-35W bridge fell into the \nMississippi River, we know we have much to do to ensure our 21st \ncentury economy has the 21st century infrastructure we need. I know I \nam committed to move forward and work in a bipartisan way to address \nour Nation's critical bridge and infrastructure needs and prevent \nanother tragedy like the collapse of the I-35W bridge.\n  They didn't distinguish on that bridge on that day 5 years ago who \nwas a Democrat or Republican. Certainly those first responders--the \ncops and firefighters--didn't ask what political party somebody \nbelonged to. They simply did their job. That is what we need to do in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                       Cybersecurity Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012, which is numbered S. 3414.\n  Last night, the majority leader, Senator Reid, filed a cloture motion \nwhich would ripen for a vote on tomorrow. Senator Reid said he was \nsaddened to have to file that motion. He also used a word we don't hear \nmuch when he said he was ``flummoxed'' by the need to file a cloture \nmotion on bipartisan legislation that responds to what all of the \nexperts in security in our country from the last administration and \nthis one say is a critical threat to our security, which is the lack of \ndefenses in the cyber infrastructure that is owned by the private \nsector.\n  Senator Reid was saddened, as I was, that he had to file for cloture \nbecause, of course, there can be disagreements about how to respond to \nthis threat to our security and our prosperity. Hundreds of billions of \ndollars of American ingenuity and money have already been stolen by \ncyber thieves operating not only from within our country but, more \noften, from outside. So you can have differences of opinion about how \nto deal with the problem. But the fact that people started to introduce \ntotally irrelevant amendments, such as the one to repeal ObamaCare--\nwell, that is a debatable issue. We have debated it many times, as the \nHouse has, but not on this bill, which we urgently need to pass and \nsend to the House and then go into conference and then, hopefully, pass \nsomething and send it to the President.\n  I was at a briefing with more than a dozen Members of the Senate, \nrepresenting a wide bipartisan group and ideological group, with \nleaders of our security agencies--cyber security agencies, including \nthe Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, NSA, \nand they could not have been clearer about the fact that this cyber \nthreat is not a speculative threat. The fact is we are under attack \nover cyber space right now. In terms of economics, we have already lost \nan enormous amount of money. GEN Keith Alexander, Chief of U.S. Cyber \nCommand, described the loss of industrial information and intellectual \nproperty, and just plain money, through cyber theft as ``the greatest \ntransfer of wealth in history.'' That is going on.\n  We are also under cyber attack by enemies who are probing the control \nsystems, the cyber control systems that control not the mom-and-pop \nbusinesses at home, not the Internet systems over which so many of us \nshop these days, but the cyber systems that control the electric \nsupply, that control all of our financial transactions, large and \nsmall, that control our transportation system, our telecommunication \nsystem--all the things we depend on to sustain our society and our \nindividual lives. That is who we are talking about here.\n  It is the greatest transfer of wealth in history. But our enemies are \nalready probing those private companies' cyber systems that control \nthat kind of critical infrastructure I have described. There is some \nreason to believe that because of the vulnerability of those systems \nand lack of adequate defenses, they have already placed in them \nmalware, bugs--whatever we want to call it. In the old days, we used to \ncall it a sleeper cell of spies and, more recently, in terms of \nterrorism, a sleeper cell of terrorists.\n  Let me put it personally, without stating it definitively on the \nfloor. I worry that enemies of the United States have already placed \nwhat I call\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\ncyber sleeper cells in critical cyber control systems that control \ncritical infrastructure in our country. Everybody will say that some \ncompanies that own critical infrastructure are doing a pretty good job \nof defending it and us, but some are not. That is one of the reasons \nthis bill has occurred--to try to create a collaborative process where \nthe private sector and the public sector can act together in the \nnational interest.\n\n  The businesses themselves that control cyber infrastructure--God \nforbid there is a major cyber attack on the United States--are going to \nbe enormous losers. They are going to be subject, under the current \nstate of the law, to the kind of liability in court that may bring some \nof them down. It may end their corporate existence.\n  Mr. CARPER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be glad to yield to my friend from Delaware \nfor a question. He is the cosponsor of our main bill, S. 3414.\n  Mr. CARPER. The message the Senator is conveying today is so \nimportant. I hope folks who are unsure about supporting our legislation \nare listening.\n  I was briefed earlier today by a large multinational company. One of \nits divisions is manufacturing, among other things, helicopters. \nApparently, within the last 12 months, maybe even 6 months, the plans \nfor developing and manufacturing one such helicopter were hacked and \nobtained by another nation--presumably the Chinese. So they will \ndevelop and will build their version of our helicopters. They won't be \nbuilt by Americans. They will not provide American jobs. It will not \nprovide revenues to that company or tax revenues to our Treasury; they \nwill really be apprehended, if you will, by another nation. That is the \nreality of this theft.\n  So I was reminded just this morning of what the Senator is talking \nabout, what General Alexander says is the largest economic threat in \nthe history of our country, and it is taking place. I was reminded of \nthat this morning, and I just wanted to share that with the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Delaware very much. I think \nhe crystallized the moment we are in.\n  I mentioned that Senator Reid filed a cloture motion that will ripen \ntomorrow. Again, he did it in sadness, and I was sad he had to do it. \nThis is an issue on which I had hoped we would overcome gridlock--\nspecial interest driven, ideologically driven, politically driven--but \nwe couldn't do it, so the majority leader did exactly what he had to \ndo, in my opinion, in the national security interest.\n  This does two things. One, as my colleagues know and I repeat just to \nremind them, we have a 1 p.m. deadline when any Member of the Senate \ncan file a first-degree amendment to this bill. That is important to \ndo. And I want to say that the managers of the bill--Senator Collins' \nstaff, the Republican cloakroom, my staff, the Democratic cloakroom--\nare going to be working on these amendments to see if we can begin to \nmove toward a finite list so we can give some sense of certainty.\n  Senator Reid has been very clear. He has not wanted to, to use an \nidiom of the Senate, fill the tree, which is to say limit amendments. \nHe has wanted to have an open amendment process, which really ought to \nhappen on a bill of this kind, but open for germane and relevant \namendments, not amendments on repealing ObamaCare or, I say \nrespectfully, on enacting more gun control. Those are both significant \nand substantial issues, but they are going to block this bill from \npassing if people insist on bringing them up here.\n  So the first and positive consequence of Senator Reid's cloture \nmotion--one we all signed--is to require that amendments people have \nbeen talking about filing have to come forward by 1 p.m., and \nbipartisan staffs will be working to winnow that down to a finite list.\n  Second, if we don't have an agreement on a finite list and we cannot \nvitiate the cloture vote for tomorrow, then Members of the Senate--\nevery one, in their own heart and head--will have to make the decision \nas to whether to vote against taking up this bill while all the \nnonpolitical experts on our security--GEN Keith Alexander, Director of \nCyber Command within the Pentagon, head of the National Security \nAgency, and one of the jewels and treasures of our government \nprotecting our security, appealed to Senators Reid and McConnell in a \nletter yesterday stating that this legislation is critically necessary \nnow.\n  This legislation will give our government and the private sector \noperators of critical cyber infrastructure powers they do not have now, \nauthorities they do not have now to collaborate, to take action, to \nshare information, to adopt what General Alexander in a wonderful \nphrase said is the best computer hygiene, the best cyber hygiene to \nprotect our country.\n  So that is the question facing Members of the Senate in the face of \nthat kind of statement of the urgency of some form of cyber security \nlegislation in this session from the Director of Cyber Command, an \nhonored, distinguished veteran of our uniformed military--U.S. Army in \nthis case.\n  Are we going to find it hard to get 60 Members of the Senate to vote \nto take up this bill and debate it? I hope not. For me, it would be \nhard to explain--I will put it that way--why I would vote against it no \nmatter what the controversy is.\n  I would say to my friend from Delaware, who has been involved, that I \nwill yield to him if he wants to make a statement, but we have been \nworking really hard with three groups: the group who sponsored S. 3414, \nthe Cybersecurity Act of 2012; the group who sponsored SECURE IT, \nSenators Hutchison, Chambliss, McCain, et al.; and the third group, the \nbipartisan group that sprung up because of the urgency of this clear-\nand-present danger to America, led by Senator Kyl and Senator \nWhitehouse, who is also on the floor and really has played an important \nrole in bringing the two sides--if I can put it that way--closer \ntogether. Frankly, there was a chasm that separated us at the outset. \nWe have changed our bill. We have made it much more voluntary--carrots \ninstead of sticks, as the Senator and I have said. But still there are \ndifferences, and I would just say shame on us if we can't bridge those \ndifferences on national security, of all topics.\n  So this is an important day to see if we can come together. Senator \nCollins and I are ready and willing to meet with the sponsors of the \nother bills--Senator Kyl, Senator Whitehouse--to see if we can come to \nsome kind of agreement on critical parts of this legislation and to \ncome up with a finite list we can support.\n  Just a final word. I wish to thank the majority leader, Senator Reid. \nSenator Reid has a tough job, and it is obviously battered by the \npolitical moment we are in, whenever we are in it. And of course this \nis a particularly political moment--partisan--because of the \nelection season and the campaign we are in. But I have known Harry Reid \nfor quite a while, and I have the greatest confidence and trust in him \nand an awful lot of affection. He is a personal friend. He got briefed \nabout the cyber security threat more than a year ago, and he called me \nin and we talked about it. He said he was really worried, that we had \nto do something in this session of Congress to protect our security, \nand he has been steadfast in that belief and has refused to give up.\n\n  Senator Reid filed the cloture motion to bring this to a head and \nhopefully to get to that finite list of amendments. And I think he is \ngoing to stretch, within the process and time, the great authority and \npower the majority leader has--some people say it may be the only power \nthese days, but I think he has more because of his skills--in \ncontrolling the schedule. I think if there is a hope that we can bring \na bill together and pass a cyber security bill, Senator Reid is going \nto give us every opportunity to do that. So I wanted to put on the \nrecord my thanks to him for his own commitment to improving the cyber \nsecurity of our country because he has listened to the experts and they \nhave convinced him. This is rising to be a greater threat to America \nthan any other threat we face today, and that is saying a lot, but I \nbelieve it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor for my friend from Delaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I am joined on the floor by Senator \nWhitehouse, so we might take a moment\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nhere with the chairman to have a little bit of a colloquy and then head \noff to another hearing.\n  While he is here, I wanted to say a special thank-you to Senator \nWhitehouse for the work he and Jon Kyl, our colleague from Arizona, and \nChris Coons, our colleague from Delaware, and others have done in \nreally helping to put the meat on the bones, if you will, of our \noriginal legislation. And they have done great work. I really admire \nthem, and I thank all of them.\n  Over at the other end of the Capital, they have spent a whole lot of \ntime in recent weeks and months on the issue of Fast and Furious, and I \nwanted to mention that one of the reasons I think the American people \nare furious with us is we are not moving fast enough to deal with the \neconomy and to create jobs. Yet government doesn't create jobs. \nPresidents don't create jobs. Governors don't create jobs. As a former \nGovernor, I know this. Members of the Senate don't create jobs. We help \ncreate a nurturing environment for jobs and job creation. That includes \na lot of things, such as a world-class workforce, access to capital, \ninfrastructure, access to reasonably priced energy and reasonably \npriced health care. But it also includes, as we go forward in time, the \nassurance that if a company spends a lot of money--a lot of R and \ninvestments--and it comes up with a really good idea that has \ncommercial application, that before it can even build that idea, create \nthat idea, or sell that idea in this country and manufacture and sell \nit around the world, the idea is not going to be stolen--stolen--by \nsomeone from another country who will use that idea to make money on \ntheir own.\n  That introduces an uncertainty in this country we have never had to \nworry about before. We just have not had to worry about that before. \nBut, as General Alexander has said and has been quoted here already \ntoday, the greatest economic thievery in our history is underway right \nnow through cyber security. This is as much a jobs issue as it is a \nsecurity issue. It is an economic security issue, and we have to be \nmindful of that.\n  I have spoken to some of our friends over at the chamber of commerce \nwith whom we work on a variety of issues and said to them that we need \ntheir involvement and support. We need them to help us get through \nthis. If they have good ideas, if they have read the legislation as it \nis redrawn and want to share those ideas with us today, Democrats and \nRepublicans, that would be a huge help.\n  I hope everybody over at the chamber is watching today, and I hope \nthey hear this request for them to be more involved in a constructive \nway. It is not so much that we need them in the Senate, we need them as \na country, and the folks who are their members across the country need \nthem to be involved as well.\n  This legislation started out as more of a command-and-control deal \nwhere our Department of Homeland Security was going to say: These are \nour standards, and we expect companies and industries in critical areas \nto comply with these, and that is it.\n  That is an oversimplification of the original legislation, but we \nhave moved so far away from that, it is amazing. We have moved from a \ncommand-and-control system to one where we say to critical industries, \nsensitive industries: Listen, you figure out amongst yourselves what \nthe best practices and standards ought to be for protecting you and \nyour businesses and your ideas. You figure it out, you share those \nideas, develop those ideas, really, in a collaborative way with a \ncouncil that includes the Department of Commerce, the Department of \nJustice, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security. And then, in an \ninterim process, we refine those ideas, refine those best practices, \nand refine those standards, which would then be implemented. If \ncompanies don't want to comply with them, they do not have to. It is on \na voluntary basis. If they do, there are rewards. If they do not, they \ndo not participate in those rewards, including protection from \nliability.\n  Sometimes we get stuck on legislation, and we just say: This is it, \nand we are not going to change it. This is it, and we are not going to \nlet you do that. But here we have changed this legislation dramatically \nand I think for the better. Some people say we changed it too much in \norder to get to ``yes.''\n  The last thing I would say before I yield to Senator Whitehouse is \nthat the legislation before us is not a Democratic idea, nor is it a \nRepublican idea. This is not a conservative idea. This is not a liberal \nidea. This is a good idea, and this is an idea that has gotten better \nover time. This is an idea whose time has come. And we need to be \nmindful of the fury across our country. We need to move faster to take \ngood ideas like this and make them better and to implement them.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Whitehouse, and again a big thank-you \nfor the great work he and Senators Coons and Kyl have done, as usual.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, at this point I will speak, if I \nmay, in the nature of a colloquy with the chairman and with the Senator \nfrom Delaware, but first let me thank the Senator from Delaware for his \nvery kind remarks. Senator Carper, as everybody knows in the Senate, is \nreally a bellwether of bipartisanship, and he constantly seeks \ncooperation. So I appreciate very much his efforts to bring us \ntogether.\n  The chairman has been working very hard on these bills for many \nyears, and the bill on the floor now is the product of considerable \nwork in his committee--Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--considerable work in the Intelligence Committee, and \nconsiderable work in the Commerce Committee primarily, although we in \nthe Judiciary Committee have had some input as well. So while there has \nbeen no specific hearing on the assembled bill, because it covers so \nmany committees, it has to be brought together at some point, and its \ncomponents have had extensive committee work. So we have all put a lot \nof effort into this, and we have actually all come a very long way, I \nbelieve.\n  Our window is very short, and I hope and expect we can use the hours \nahead of us literally to work to close this gap. But I believe the \ndistance we have come, and particularly that last bit of distance, when \nthe chairman changed S. 3414 to go from a traditional mandatory \nregulatory system to the new voluntary standards, really has moved us \nin enormous ways. We are almost on the 1 yard line now, and I believe \nit would be such a shame, with things being that close, if we couldn't \nclose the deal.\n  I would like to ask the chairman to react to that assessment of our \nsituation, and I would also like to ask him to react to one other \npoint, which is that the House took action on cyber security but it \nonly did so in the form of legislation on information sharing. All of \nour information--the letter yesterday from General Alexander and \neverything we have heard from our national security officials--is that \nis not enough.\n  We have two really important jobs. One is information sharing, and \nthe other is defending America's privately owned critical \ninfrastructure--our electric grids, our communications networks, our \ndata-processing systems. Those are our great liability. Those are the \nthings Secretary of Defense Panetta was referring to when he said that \nthe next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyber attack.\n  So are we as close as I think and is it important that the Senate do \nits job because the House simply failed to address the critical \ninfrastructure part of our responsibilities?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, I thank our friend from Rhode Island for the \nextraordinarily constructive role he has played--unusual here, \nunfortunately--in bringing the group of eight Members, four Democrats \nand four Republicans, together. Senator Whitehouse, along with Senator \nKyl of Arizona, created a bridge that really invited Senators Collins, \nFeinstein, Rockefeller, Carper, and me to come halfway across to change \nour bill from mandatory to voluntary.\n  So my answers to the Senator's two questions are yes and yes. We are \na lot closer than we were really just a month ago--a matter of weeks \nago. There is a remaining difference, and it is real. But considering \nwhere we have come from, if we show a willingness to compromise--and \nagain, as I have said over and over, not a compromise of principle--\nthat acknowledges that if everybody in the Senate insists on getting \n100 percent of what they want on\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\na bill, nobody is going to get anything because nothing is going to \npass. So we have come back from our 100 percent quite a lot, and we are \nstill open to ideas that will enable us to achieve what we need to \nachieve here in improving our cyber security, which means changing \nwhere we are now.\n  That is why, as my friend from Rhode Island knows, we are going to \nkeep meeting today with the other leading sponsors of the bill and with \nthe peacemakers in between to see if we can find common ground and \navoid what I think could be a very disappointing cloture vote--a very \ndivisive, very destructive cloture vote--tomorrow.\n  The second point is a very important one; that is, the House has \nacted, but it has only acted with regard to information sharing. This \nis important, but it is only half the job. The information sharing, in \nbrief, says that private companies that operate critical infrastructure \ncan share with other private companies if they are attacked or as they \nbegin to defend themselves so they mutually can strengthen each other. \nThey can also share with the government, and the government, \nparticularly through the Department of Homeland Security and the \nNational Security Agency, can help the private sector strengthen \nitself. Those kinds of communications, which are critical and would \nseem natural, don't happen now in too many cases because the private \nsector is anxious about liability that it might incur. Even the public \nsector is limited in how much it can reach out or help. So it is \nimportant that the House has addressed that part of it.\n  I will say--and not just parenthetically--that there has been very \nsignificant concern of a lot of Americans and a quite remarkable \ncoalition of groups--remarkable in the sense that it is right to left, \nalong the ideological spectrum--about the personal privacy rights of \nthe American people, that they not be compromised as a result of this \ninformation sharing.\n  Those privacy advocacy groups are not happy with the House \ninformation-sharing bill. I am pleased they have praised what we have \ntried to do as a result of negotiations with colleagues in this Chamber \nwho are concerned about privacy. The point Senator Whitehouse makes is \nso true, but that is only half the job. Everybody who cares about cyber \nsecurity has said it.\n  There was, I must say, an encouraging, inspiring, for us, editorial \nin the New York Times today, supporting essentially S. 3414, the \nunderlying bill, and crying out to us to take action and not get \ndragged down into gridlock by special interest thinking. But here is a \nstatistic that jumped out at me. I saw it once before, but we have not \nheard it in this debate. In a Times editorial today entitled \n``Cybersecurity at Risk,'' this sentence: ``Last year, a survey of more \nthan 9,000 executives in more than 130 countries by the \nPricewaterhouseCoopers consulting firm found that only 13 percent of \nthose polled had taken adequate defensive action against \ncyberthreats.''\n  That is worldwide. But I can tell you from what I know, the number in \nour country is not much better. That is why we need this set of \nstandards, best practices, computer hygiene--no longer mandatory but we \ncreate an incentive. It is as if a company chooses to go into what my \nfriend from Rhode Island has quite vividly described as Fort Cyber \nSecurity. We are going to build Fort Cyber Security of the best \npractices to defend cyber security, and we are going to leave it to the \ncompanies that operate critical infrastructure totally on their own \nwhether they want to go into Fort Cyber Security. If they do, they will \nhave some significant immunity from liability in the case of a major \nattack.\n  My answer to the Senator's questions are yes and yes. I just want to \ncome back to something the Senator said at the outset of his remarks. I \nnever know how much this argument weighs on Senators' minds, but once \nagain it is being made here, which is this bill has received no \nhearings; it is not ready for action.\n  Good God. I went back and looked at the Record. I attended my first \nhearing on cyber security held in what was then the Governmental \nAffairs Committee--it is now the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee--chaired then by Senator Fred Thompson in 1998, 14 \nyears ago. I can tell my colleague that in recent years, Senator \nCollins and I have held 10 hearings on the subject of cyber security. \nThat is only in our committee. That is not counting judiciary, \nintelligence, commerce--I think foreign relations may have held some \nhearings on it too. In fact, we held a hearing just earlier this year, \nI believe it was March, on cyber security and the legislation that we \nknew we were going to bring forward. This has been heard.\n  I wish to say this too. I mentioned Senator Reid's commitment to \ndoing something about cyber security. Last year--I am trying to think, \nbut I cannot remember a time on another bill where I saw this happen--\nSenator Reid asked the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, to join \nhim in calling in the Democratic chairs and the ranking Republican \nmembers of all the relevant committees, relevant to cyber security that \nwe just talked about, and made an appeal that we work together to bring \none bill which he would then, as he has done before when a subject \ncovers more than one committee, blend into a single bill and bring to \nthe floor under majority leader's authority pursuant to rule XIV of the \nSenate rules, which he has done today.\n  So there has not been a specific hearing on this bill, but Lord knows \nthere have been a lot of hearings and this bill has been vetted and \nnegotiated not only with many Members of the Senate but by our \ncommittee and all the other committees--by stakeholders, private \nstakeholders, by some of the very businesses and business organizations \nthat now seem to be the main block to moving forward on the bill.\n  I probably responded to my friend at greater length than I might have \nor perhaps more than he expected, but his questions were right on \ntarget, and I thank him for giving me the opportunity.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I mentioned, to use the Senator's words, it was \nimportant to help the private sector strengthen itself. Some of the \ndebate that has surrounded this bill has suggested that if we just get \nthe heavy hand of government out of the way and let the nimble private \nsector do its thing to protect critical infrastructure, all will be \nwell, and that a purely private sector way of proceeding is the best \nway to proceed.\n  In that context, the Senator mentioned the study that showed that \nonly 13 percent of the private businesses that were reviewed were \nadequately cyber security prepared. The NCIJTF, which is the FBI-led \njoint task force that protects our national cyber infrastructure, has \nsaid that when they detect a cyber attack and they go out to work with \nthe corporation that has been attacked, 9 out of 10 times the \ncorporation had no idea. It is not just a government agency, the \nNCIJTF, saying that, there is a company called Mandiant which is sort \nof ``Who are you going to call? Ghost Busters.'' When someone is hit, \nthey come in and help the companies clean up. They say the same thing: \nOut of 10 times, these companies had to find out that they had been \npenetrated from a government agency telling them, ``By the way, you \nhave been hacked. They are in there.''\n  In fact, he said 48 out of the last 50 companies they dealt with had \nno idea. The Aurora virus hit 300 American companies, and only three of \nthem knew it. The chamber of commerce, which is very active in this \ndebate, had Chinese hackers with complete impunity throughout its cyber \nsystems without knowing about it for at least 6 months. It was only \nwhen the government said, ``By the way, guys, your info was on a server \nin China,'' that they realized, ``Oh, my gosh; we have been hacked \ntoo.''\n  Then the Senator has used the statistic I have used before--that \nGeneral Alexander, who is head of Cyber Command, has adopted--which is \nthat America is now on the losing end of the biggest transfer of wealth \nin history through illicit means as a result of cyber industrial \nespionage--stealing from us our chemical formulas, our manufacturing \nprocesses, and various things that create value in the country.\n  So I am not just pinpointing individual examples. If we look at it \nfrom\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\na macro point of view, we are getting our clocks cleaned in this area. \nThe private sector, it seems to me all of the evidence suggests, is an \narea in which it is not adequately protecting itself without a \ngovernment role to spur cooperation and to set an agreed standard that \nNSA and the people who are watching this with real anxiety every day \nknow is an adequate standard to meet the needs.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut would respond, I would be grateful.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Basically, I would say I agree. There is not much I \ncould add to that. This is not legislation that is a solution in search \nof a problem. This is a real problem. Again, we are hearing it from all \nthe cyber security experts.\n  If the private sector owners of critical cyber infrastructure--\nelectric power grids, telecommunications, finance, water dams, et \ncetera--if they were taking enough defensive action, we wouldn't want \nto act, but they are not. And we understand why. We have talked about \nthis. A lot of the CIOs--chief information officers--in companies get \nfrustrated that their CEOs don't want to devote enough time and \nresources to beefing up their cyber defenses.\n  The Senator said something very important, which is cyber theft and \ncyber attack is so insidious that a lot of people and companies who are \nvictims of cyber attack don't even know it. My great fear is that there \nis a lot of malware or bugs--I called it cyber cells earlier--planted \nin some of our critical cyber control systems in our country waiting \nfor the moment when an enemy wants to attack us.\n  Senator Reid yesterday pointed to the terrible tragedy in India where \nthe power system has gone out. There is no evidence there was a cyber \nattack, but I saw today that 600 million people are without \nelectricity. It has had a terrible effect on quality of life, on the \neconomy, et cetera. Unfortunately, this is what an enemy who is capable \ntoday could do to us, and they are out there.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The only reasonable conclusion one could draw is that \nit would be prudent to view, with some caution and some skepticism, the \nclaims of folks who are hacked and penetrated at will--and who often \nusually don't even know it--that: Don't worry. Trust us. We can take \ncare of this. Everything is fine.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. And, of course, I agree. That is \nwhy we are legislating--but we are trying to legislate as minimally as \nwe possibly can--to begin to solve this problem.\n  I yield the floor. The Senator from Maryland is here. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is here.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator. I certainly want to accommodate the \nschedule.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In the order of fairness, we yield to my friend from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak as if in morning \nbusiness on the subject of energy.\n  I commend my colleagues for their excellent work on cyber. I look \nforward to working with them, and I thank them for the incredible \namount of work and diligence they are putting into this extremely \nimportant effort. I rise this morning to speak on the incredible \nimportance of energy security for our country.\n  Last week I introduced the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act along with 30 \nsponsors on the legislation. It is a comprehensive plan for energy \nsecurity for our country. When I say energy security, what I mean is \nproducing more energy than we consume; getting our Nation to energy \nsecurity by not only producing enough energy for our needs, but even \nbeyond that. It is absolutely doable. There is no question we can do \nit.\n  It is about pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, and I mean truly \npursuing an all-of-the-above strategy; not saying it and then picking \ncertain types of energy we want and don't want but, instead, creating a \nclimate and a national comprehensive energy policy that truly empowers \nprivate investment to develop all of our energy resources and all types \nof energy.\n  The Domestic Energy and Jobs Act is actually a package of energy \nbills. Many of these have already passed the House, and we have \nintroduced them now in the Senate as well--13 separate pieces of \nlegislation pulled together into this energy package, with energy \nleaders from both the House and the Senate. It clearly demonstrates \nthat we have a strategy, we have a comprehensive energy plan to move \nour country, and it is ready to go.\n  If we look at the situation right now, there are hundreds of billions \nof dollars of private investment, of capital that would be invested in \nenergy projects in this country, but they are being held up. These \nprojects are being held on the sidelines because of the inability to be \npermitted or because of burdensome regulation. We need to create the \nkind of approach, the kind of business climate, the kind of energy \npolicy that will unleash that private investment. That is exactly what \nthis legislation does.\n  First, it reduces the regulatory burden so these stalled energy \nprojects--again, hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment, \nnot government spending but in private investment--that would move \nforward with energy projects that would not only develop more energy \nmore cost effectively and more dependably, but also with better \nenvironmental stewardship, deploying the latest, greatest technology \nthat would produce the energy, and do it with better environmental \nstewardship--not only for this country but actually leading the world \nto more energy production with better environmental stewardship.\n  But these projects are held up either because they can't get \npermitted or because they can't get through the regulatory redtape to \nget started and get going. This legislation cuts through that.\n  It also helps us develop the vital infrastructure we need for energy \ndevelopment. A great example is the Keystone XL Pipeline, a $7 billion \n1,700-mile pipeline that would move oil from Canada to our refineries \nin the United States, but that would also move oil from my home State--\n100,000 barrels a day for starters--to refineries. We need that vital \ninfrastructure. That is just one example.\n\n  This legislation also develops our resources on public lands as well \nas private lands. So we are talking about expedited permitting both \nonshore and offshore, on private lands and on public lands, including \nfor renewables. It sets realistic goals. It sets a market-based \napproach that would truly foster all of our energy resources rather \nthan picking winners and losers. It would also put a freeze and require \na study of rules that are driving up gasoline prices that are hitting \nfamilies and businesses across this country. And it includes \nlegislation that Senator Murkowski of Alaska has added to our package \nthat would require an inventory of critical minerals in the United \nStates and set policies to develop them as a key part of developing a \ncomprehensive energy approach and a comprehensive energy plan for our \ncountry.\n  So what is the impact? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in March of last \nyear put forward a report. In that report they showed there are more \nthan 350 energy projects nationwide that are being held up either due \nto inability to get permitted or regulatory burden, as I have \ndescribed--more than 350 projects--that if we could just greenlight \nthese projects, they would generate $1.1 trillion in gross domestic \nproduct and create 1.9 million jobs a year just in the construction \nphase.\n  So this legislation truly is about energy--more energy, better \ntechnology, and better environmental stewardship. But it is also very \nmuch about creating jobs--creating jobs at a time when we have more \nthan 8.2 percent unemployment, more than 13 million people out of work \nand looking for work. This will create an incredible number of jobs. It \nis about creating economic growth.\n  Look at our debt and our deficit. Our debt is now approaching $16 \ntrillion. We need to get this economy going and growing to reduce that \ndeficit and reduce that debt along with controlling our spending. But \nwe need economic growth to get on top of that debt and deficit. As I \ndescribed, just the 350 projects alone and $1.1 trillion in GDP to help \ncreate that economic growth, to put people to work, and help reduce our \ndeficit and our debt.\n  Let's talk about national security. The reality is with the kind of \napproach I am putting forward in the\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\nUnited States and working together with our closest friend and ally \nCanada, we can get to energy security without a doubt in 5 to 7 years. \nThat means producing more energy than we consume within 5 to 7 years. \nThink how important that is.\n  Look what is going on in the Middle East. Look what is going on in \nSyria. What is going to happen there? Look at what is going on in Iran \nand their efforts to pursue a nuclear weapon and what is going to \nhappen with the Strait of Hormuz. An incredible amount of oil goes \nthrough that area. Look at what is happening in Egypt with the Muslim \nBrotherhood. Do we really want to be dependent on the Middle East for \nour oil?\n  I think the American people have said very clearly no, and we don't \nhave to be. We just need the right approach to make it happen right \nhere and to work with our closest friend and ally, Canada.\n  The reality is developing our energy resources is an incredible \nopportunity, and we need to seize it right now, with both hands. We can \ndo it. That is exactly the plan we are putting forward.\n  Earlier this year we passed legislation through the House and through \nthe Senate in conjunction with the payroll tax credit legislation. \nAttached to it we required the President to make a decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. He chose to turn it down. Shortly after that, the \nPrime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, went to China. He met with \nChairman Wu and China's energy leaders, and he signed a memorandum of \nagreement. That memorandum of agreement between China and Canada called \nfor more economic cooperation and more energy development, with China \nworking in conjunction with Canada.\n  Just last week, CNOOC--one of China's largest government-controlled \ncompanies--made a $15 billion tender offer for the Nexen Oil Company, a \nlarge oil company in Canada, to purchase their interests in the \nCanadian oil sands. It also includes mineral interests offshore, lease \ninterests offshore of the United States in the gulf region, as well as \nin the North Sea area. But primarily it is an acquisition by the \nChinese of huge amounts of tracts in the oil sands in Canada.\n  So just what we said: If we don't work with Canada on projects such \nas the Keystone XL Pipeline, the oil that is produced in Canada, \ninstead of going to the United States will go to China or Americans \nwill be put in the position of buying Canadian oil from the Chinese \nbecause of a failure to act on key projects such as the Keystone XL \nPipeline because we are not acting on the kind of energy policy we are \nputting forward right here.\n  Ask the American people what they want. What they want is that we \nmove forward with the energy package we put forward, and we need to do \nit. If we check gas prices, they are now back up to $3.50 a gallon \nnational average. When the current administration took office, it was \n$1.85 national average per gallon. That is a 90-percent increase. What \nramifications does that have for our economy? What ramifications does \nthat have for small businesses? What ramifications does that have for \nhard-working American families? I think we all know the answer to that.\n  The time to move forward is now. It couldn't be more clear. We \ncontrol our own destiny. We need to take action. We need to move \nforward on the kind of energy plans that truly benefit our people and \nour country. I call on my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout cyber security, the pending Lieberman-Collins bill, and the need \nto act--and the need to act before we adjourn for the August break.\n  I come today to the floor as I did when I spoke yesterday. I don't \ncome as a Democrat, I come as an American. If ever there was an issue \nwhere we have to forget if we are red States or blue States, it is this \nissue.\n  I am going to stop my remarks. I note the Senator from Arizona is on \nthe Senate floor, and I know he was scheduled to speak at 12:45. I was \nscheduled to speak at 11:30. I have about 10 minutes. I just want to \nacknowledge where we are.\n  So resuming my comments, Madam President, what I wanted to say is \nthis: This is when we have to forget we are red States or blue States, \nwe have to forget what we have on our bumper stickers, and we have to \ncome together and not be the red State party or the blue State party \nbut to be the red, white, and blue party for the United States of \nAmerica. We must put aside partisan differences and ideological \nviewpoints. We need to act, and we need to act in the defense of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The Senate has a great opportunity today and tomorrow to pass \nlegislation to protect, defend, and deter a cyber attack on the \ncritical infrastructure of the United States of America.\n  What do I mean by critical infrastructure? It is our electrical power \ngrid, our financial services, our water supplies. It is those things \nthat are the bread and butter of keeping America, its businesses, and \nits families going. Through voluntary participation, we can work with \nthe private sector that owns and operates the critical infrastructure \nto keep our critical infrastructure hardened and resilient against \nattack.\n  I worry about the possibility of an attack. We know there are already \nattacks going on, particularly in our financial services. We know our \npersonal identities are being hacked, and we know small business is \nbeing attacked. I will give examples later on. Not only do I worry \nabout an attack, I equally worry about our inertia, where we do \nnothing.\n  I bring to the attention of the Senate and all those watching that \nLeon Panetta, the Secretary of Defense, called our cyber vulnerability \nour potential digital Pearl Harbor. The Presiding Officer is from New \nYork. We don't want a cyber 9/11. We can act now. We can act when it is \nin our power to protect, defend, and deter these attacks. That is what \nI want. I want us to have a sense of urgency. I want us to go to the \nedge of our chair. I want us to put our best thinking on to be able to \ndo the kind of job we need to do to find a sensible center on how we \ncan do that.\n  Right now our adversaries are watching us. We are debating on how we \nwill protect America from cyber attacks, and it looks like we are doing \nnothing. When all is said and done, more gets said than gets done. Our \nadversaries don't have to spy on us. They can look at the Senate floor \nand say: What the heck are they doing? What are they going to do? They \nare going to look at us and say: There they go again.\n  We know our own inability to pass legislation, our own partisan \ngridlock and deadlock works for our predatory enemies in a positive \nway. They are saying, well, our first line of attack is for them to do \nnothing. They are thinking how they can make sure the critical \ninfrastructure is vulnerable. How can they weaken the critical \ninfrastructure? One way is by not passing legislation and putting in \nthose hardened, resilient ways to protect, defend, and deter. Our \nadversaries are laughing right this minute. They just have to watch us. \nWell, this is no laughing matter.\n  What is the intent of a cyber attack? What is the intent? Is it the \nsame intent as a nuclear attack? Is it the same attempt as flying into \nthe World Trade Center? It is all the same. It is to create chaos, it \nis to create civil instability, and it is to create economic \ncatastrophe that makes 9/11 look minuscule.\n  Just think about a cyber attack in which our grid goes down. Think of \na blackout in New York. Think of a blackout in Baltimore. Remember when \nwe did the cyber exercise here where it showed what would happen? The \nstop lights go down, the lights go out in the hospitals, the \nrespirators go off, business shuts down, commerce shuts down, 9-1-1 \nshuts down, America is shut down, and we will be powerless and impotent \nto put it back on in any quick and expeditious manner.\n  Right now we are in the situation where we have an early missile \ndetection. We know the cyber attack will come. We need to do something. \nWith this cyber attack, think of the chaos of no electricity. Just \nthink of it. We have all lived through blackouts, and we had a terrible \nfreak storm here a few weeks ago. No matter how late Pepco, BG, and \nDominion was in responding, they can get the electricity back on. What \nhappens if they can't get the electricity back on? What happens if they \ncan't get it back on for\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nweeks or longer? There we are powerless, impotent, and the President of \nthe United States is wondering what to do.\n  Remember, the attack is to humiliate, intimidate, and cripple: \nhumiliate by making us look powerless, intimidate by showing there is \nthis power over us, and to cripple our functioning as a society. I find \nit chilling.\n  We saw an attack on a little country called Estonia. That is how I \ngot into this. I was sitting on the Intelligence Committee--I can say \nit now because it has been more than 5 years ago--and it was brought to \nmy attention that Estonia--a brave little country that resisted \ncommunism, challenged the Soviet Union, and is now a part of NATO--was \nbeing attacked. The electricity was going off around Estonia. We \nthought, from the Intelligence Committee, it would be the first cyber \nattack on a NATO nation, and we were going to trigger the NATO Charter \narticle V that an attack on one is an attack on all.\n  Thanks to the United States of America and our British allies, we had \nthe technical know-how to go in and help them. Who is going to have the \ntechnical know-how to help us? We have the technical know-how right now \nto make our critical infrastructure hardened and resilient. We \nshouldn't harden our positions so we can't get to a resilient critical \ninfrastructure.\n  I could go on with examples. I know my colleague from Arizona wants \nto come to the floor, but I just want to say one more thing. I have \nbeen involved in this from not only my work on the Intelligence \nCommittee, but we fund the Justice Department through the \nAppropriations Committee, and they are very involved and hands on with \nthe policy issues around the FBI.\n  Now, if Director Mueller were here, he would say the FBI currently \nhas 7,600 pending bank robbery cases. Guess what. He has 9,000 pending \ncyber banking attacks. There are more cyber heists than there are \nregular heists. That doesn't make it right.\n  Now, is a cyber attack coming? Is it something out of Buck Rogers or \nBetty Rogers or the cyber Betty Crocker cookbook or whatever? The \nNASDAQ, as the gentlelady from New York knows, the NASDAQ and New York \nStock Exchange has already been attacked. Hackers repeatedly penetrated \nthe computer networks at the NASDAQ stock market. The New York Stock \nExchange has been the target of cyber attacks. That sounds so vague \nbut, remember, successful attempts to shut down or steal our \ninformation are going on every day.\n\n  Madam Chair, do you remember in 2010 the Dow Jones plunged 1,000 \npoints because of a flash crash? That was a result of turbulent \ntrading. That can be manipulated by cyber, and it could happen several \ntimes a week. What are we going to do?\n  Our banking industry clears $7 trillion worth of financial goods, \nproducts, and actual real money every day. Imagine what would happen if \nthat was thrown into turmoil or shut down. I don't want to go through \ngrim example after grim example, but let me say this: Good people in \nthis body have been working on both sides of the aisle.\n  We are close, and I urge my colleagues now: Let's either vote for \ncloture or come to a regular agreement to be able to offer amendments. \nFor those who worry about the costs, for those who worry about \nregulation, for those who worry about homeland security, I understand \nthat. That is why I would be willing to sunset the bill so we can \nalways look ahead and reevaluate this. I want everyone to know if a \ncyber attack comes and happens to the United States and we have failed \nto act, we will overreact, we will overregulate, and we will overspend.\n  Why do I have a sense of urgency right now? Let me say this: When we \nadjourn tomorrow for the August break, we don't come back until \nSeptember 10. We will go out somewhere around October 1. That means if \nwe don't act by tomorrow or Friday, we will essentially only have about \n14 working days in September to do this. Well, we can't let this go.\n  I conclude my remarks by saying this: To my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, let's be the red, white, and blue party. Let's come to \nthe middle ground. Let's do what we need to do to protect and defend \nthe United States of America. There are good people who have been \nworking on this. Some have extraordinary national security credentials. \nLet's put our best heads together and come up with the best amendments. \nLet's come up with the best protections of the United States of \nAmerica, and let's do it by tomorrow night.\n  God bless America. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, the Senator from South Carolina, \nMr. Lindsey Graham, and if he wants to, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nCoats.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, before I go to the issue we want to \ndiscuss, I want to point out in this debate that has become so \nimpassioned that the issue of cyber security is one of transcendent \nimportance, and I want to again reiterate my respect, appreciation, and \naffection for both Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that the people who are directly \naffected by this--and that is the business community of the United \nStates of America--are unalterably opposed to the legislation in its \npresent form. They are the ones who will be affected most dramatically \nby cyber security legislation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which \nrepresents 3 million businesses and organizations of every size, \nsector, and region, has a strong letter which supports the legislation \nwe have proposed.\n  I finally would just like to say that I have had hours and hours of \nmeetings with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle trying to work \nthis out. I believe we can work this out. We understand that cyber \nsecurity is important and of transcendent importance. But to somehow \nallege that the business community, the 3 million businesses in \nAmerica, should be left out of this discussion, of course, is not \nappropriate nor do I believe it will result in effective cyber security \nlegislation.\n\n\n                        National Security Leaks\n\n  I really came to the floor today to talk about the issue of the \nleaks, the leaks which have directly jeopardized America's national \nsecurity. At the Aspen Security Forum, just in the last few days, the \nhead of Special Operations Command, Admiral McRaven, observed that the \nrecent national security leaks have put lives at risk and may \nultimately cost America its lives unless there is an effective \ncrackdown. Admiral McRaven, the head of our Special Operations Command \nsaid:\n\n       We need to do the best we can to clamp down because sooner \n     or later it is going to cost people their lives or it is \n     going to cost us our national security.\n\n  This is another national security issue, my friends, and I appreciate \nvery much the fact that Governor Romney rightly referred to these leaks \nas contemptible and a betrayal of our national interests.\n  I wish to point out to my colleagues that, yes, there are supposedly \ninvestigations going on and, according to media, hundreds of people are \nbeing interviewed. Well, I am no lawyer. I am no prosecutor. Senator \nGraham may have some experience in that. But what about the 2009 G20 \neconomic summit when, according to the New York Times journalist David \nSanger, ``a senior official in the National Security Council'' tapped \nhim on the shoulder and brought him to the Presidential suite in the \nPittsburgh hotel where President Obama was staying and where ``most of \nthe rest of the national security staff was present.'' There the \njournalist was allowed to review satellite images and other evidence \nthat confirmed the existence of a secret nuclear site in Iran.\n  I wonder how many people have the key to the Presidential suite in \nthat Pittsburgh, PA hotel? We might want to start there. Instead, we \nhave two prosecutors, one of whom was a strong and great supporter of \nthe President of the United States. And the same people--I am talking \nabout the Vice President of the United States and others--who strongly \nsupported a special counsel in the case of Valerie Plame and, of \ncourse, the Abramoff case. We need a special counsel to find out who \nwas responsible for these leaks.\n  I ask my colleague Senator Graham if he has additional comments on \nthis issue. It has receded somewhat in the\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\nmedia, but the damage that has been done to our national security is \nsignificant. It has put lives at risk, and it has betrayed our allies. \nThis is an issue we cannot let go away until those who are responsible \nare held accountable for these actions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, my comment, in response to the question \nSenator McCain has, is what we do today becomes precedent for tomorrow. \nSo are we going to sit on the sidelines here and allow the Attorney \nGeneral--who is under siege by our colleagues in the House about the \nway he has handled Fast and Furious and other matters--to appoint two \nU.S. attorneys who have to answer to him to investigate allegations \nagainst the very White House that appointed him? The reason so many \nDemocrats wrote to President Bush and said, You cannot possibly \ninvestigate the Scooter Libby-Valerie Plame leak because it involves \npeople very close to you--well, let's read some of the letters. Biden, \nDaschle, Schumer, and Levin letter to President Bush, October 9, 2003:\n\n       We are at risk of seeing this investigation so compromised \n     that those responsible for this national security breach will \n     never be identified and prosecuted. Public confidence in the \n     integrity of this investigation would be substantially \n     bolstered by the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n  Senator Biden:\n\n       I think they should appoint a special prosecutor, but if \n     they're not going to do that, which I suspect they're not, is \n     get the information out as quick as they possibly can. This \n     is not a minor thing . . . There's been a federal crime \n     committed. The question is who did it? And the President \n     should do everything in his power to demonstrate that there's \n     an urgency to find that out.\n\n  Then he goes on later and says:\n\n       There's been a federal crime committed. You can't possibly \n     investigate yourself because people close to you are \n     involved.\n\n  In the Abramoff scandal, which involved Jack Abramoff, a person very \nclose to House leadership and some people in the Bush administration, \nand our Democratic colleagues, 34 of them, said the following:\n\n       FBI officials have said that the Abramoff investigation \n     ``involves systematic corruption within the highest levels of \n     government.'' Such an assertion indicates extraordinary \n     circumstances and it is in the public interest that you act \n     under your existing statutory authority to appoint a special \n     counsel.\n\n  So our Democratic colleagues back during the Bush administration \nsaid, We don't trust you enough to investigate compromising national \nsecurity by having an agent outed allegedly by members of your \nadministration. We don't trust the Republican Party apparatus enough to \ninvestigate Jack Abramoff, because you are so close to him, and you \nshould have a special counsel appointed.\n  Well, guess what. They did.\n  Here is what I am saying. I don't trust this White House to \ninvestigate themselves. I think this reeks of a coverup. I think the \nhighest levels of this government surrounding the President, \nintentionally, over a 45-day period, leaked various stories regarding \nour national security programs, to make the administration look strong \non national security. I don't think it is an accident that we are \nreading in the paper about efforts by the administration and our allies \nto use cyber attacks against the Iranian nuclear program as a way to \ntry to head Israel off from using military force. I don't know if it \nhappened, but the details surrounding the cooperation between us and \nIsrael and how we engaged in cyber attacks against the Iranian nuclear \nprogram are chilling and something we should not read about in the \npaper.\n  The second thing we read about in the paper was how we disrupted the \nunderwear bomber plot where there was a double agent who had \ninfiltrated an al-Qaida cell, I believe it was in Yemen, and how we \nwere able to break that up; and the man was given a suicide vest that \nwas new technology and couldn't be detected by the current screening \ndevices at the airports, and how we were able to basically infiltrate \nthat cell, and God knows the damage done to our allies and that \noperation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend, isn't it also true that this \nindividual had some 23 family members whose lives were also placed in \ndanger because of the revelation of his identity?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is what we have been told in the paper.\n  We also have a story about the kill list--a blow-by-blow description \nof how President Obama personally oversees who gets killed by drones in \nPakistan, and at the end of the day, I am not so sure that is something \nwe should all be reading about.\n  But if that is not enough, what about releasing the Pakistani \ndoctor--the person who allegedly helped us find bin Laden, and his role \nin this effort to find bin Laden is also in the paper, and now he is in \njail in Pakistan.\n  The sum total is that the leaks have been devastating. They have put \npeople's lives at risk. They have compromised our national security, \nunlike anything I have seen, and people expect us to sit on the \nsidelines and let the White House investigate itself? No way.\n\n  Those who wrote letters in the past suggesting that Bush could not \nimpartially investigate himself, where are they today? Is this the \nrule: We can't trust Republicans, but we can trust Democratic \nadministrations to get to the bottom of things they are involved in up \nto their eyebrows?\n  Do we think it is an accident that all of these books quote senior \nWhite House officials? There is a review of one of the books the \nSenator from Arizona mentioned that talked about the unprecedented \naccess to the National Security Adviser. There is a vignette in one of \nthe books where the Secretary of Defense goes up to the National \nSecurity Adviser and suggests a new communications strategy when it \ncomes to the programs we are talking about: Shut the F up. Well, that \nmakes great reading, but at the end of the day, should we be reading \nabout all this? People's lives are at stake. Programs have been \ncompromised. Our allies are very reluctant now to do business with us.\n  This was, in my view, an intentional effort by people at the highest \nlevel in the White House to leak these stories for political purposes. \nAnd to accept that Eric Holder is going to appoint two people within \nhis sphere of influence and call it a day is acceptable. That is not \ngoing to happen. We are going to do everything we can to right this \nship, and we are asking no more of our Democratic colleagues than they \nasked of the Bush administration.\n  To our Democratic colleagues: How do you justify this? How do you \njustify that you couldn't investigate Abramoff without a special \ncounsel and you couldn't investigate what Scooter Libby may or may not \nhave done without a special counsel, but it is OK not to have one here? \nHow do you do that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator asked whether this side would like to explain \nour position. I would be happy to do it at this point, but I can wait \nuntil my colleagues finish their colloquy, so it is their choice.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Whatever the Senator from Illinois wishes to do. I am \ndying to hear how my Democratic colleagues think it is good government \nnot to have a special independent counsel investigate the most damaging \nnational security leak in decades. I am dying to hear the explanation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is no need to die. I hope the Senator from South \nCarolina will continue living a good life because he is such a great \nSenator. But I am asking if my colleague wants me to join in this \ndialogue or would he rather make his presentation?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I tell you what. Why don't we let my colleague \nspeak, and then the Senator from Illinois will have all the time he \nneeds. What does my colleague, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nthink?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Well, I am dying to hear his explanation too, let me \nsay that.\n  First of all, let me say that I join in with everything my two \ncolleagues have said with respect to, No. 1, the volume of the leaks \nthat have come out in recent weeks. We all know this town has a \ntendency to leak information from time to time, but never in the volume \nand never with the sensitivity of the leaks we have read about on the \nfront page of newspapers around the country as we have seen in the last \nfew weeks.\n  Irrespective of where they came from, to have folks who may be \nimplicated in the White House, and the\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nWhite House appointing the two individuals who have been charged with \nthe duty of prosecuting this investigation, reeks of ethical issues. I \ndon't know these two U.S. attorneys, but everything I know about them \nis they are dadgum good prosecutors and they are good lawyers. But why \nwould we even put them in the position of having to investigate in \neffect the individual who appointed them to the position they are in? \nThat is why we are arguing that a special counsel is, without question, \nthe best way to go. I am interested to hear the response from my friend \nfrom Illinois to that issue.\n  Let me talk about something else for a minute, and that is the impact \nthese leaks have had on the intelligence community. The No. 1 thing \nthat individuals who go on the intelligence committees in both the \nHouse and the Senate are told--and I know because I have served on both \nof them and continue to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee--is \nto be careful what you say. Be careful and make sure you don't \ninadvertently--and obviously advertently--reveal classified \ninformation. Be sure that in your comments you never reveal sources and \nmethods.\n  Well, guess what. The individuals who were involved in these leaks \nwere very overt in the release of sources and methods with respect to \nthe issues Senator Graham referred to as having been leaked. Not only \nthat, but lives were put in danger, particularly the life of the \nindividual who was an asset who worked very closely with respect to the \nunderwear bomber issue. We know that to be a fact.\n  But there is also a secondary issue, and that is this: We have \npartners around the world we deal with in the intelligence community \nevery single day, and we depend on those partners and they depend on us \nto provide them with information we have and likewise that they give to \nus. A classic example was detailed of one of these particular leaks on \nthe front page of the New York Times. Today why in the world would any \nof our partners in the intelligence community around the world--those \npartners who have men and women on the front lines who are putting \ntheir life in harm's way and in danger every single day to gather \nintelligence information and share that information with us--why would \nthey continue to do that if they are now concerned about that \ninformation being written about on the front page of newspapers inside \nthe United States and blasted all over television or wherever it may \nbe?\n  The answer is pretty simple. Very honestly, there are some strong \nconsiderations being given by some of our partners as to how much \ninformation they should share with us. That creates a very negative \natmosphere within the intelligence world.\n  Lastly, let me say that we dealt in the Intelligence Committee with \nour authorization bill recently in which we have tried to address this \nissue from a punishment standpoint.\n  There are certain things that individuals are required to do when \nthey leave the intelligence community and go write a book. One of those \nthings is they have to present their book to an independent panel of \nintelligence experts, and that panel is to review the information and \nthen decide whether any of it is classified and shall not be released. \nIn one of the instances we have, one of those individuals never \nsubmitted his book to that panel. In another instance, an individual \nsubmitted his book to the panel, and the panel said: You need to be \ncareful in these areas. And the advice from that panel was pretty well \ndisregarded.\n  One of the provisions in our bill says if someone does that, if \nsomeone fails to submit their book to that panel, or if they disregard \nwhat that panel tells them to do, then they are going to be subject to \npenalties. Part of those penalties include the possible removal of \ntheir right to a pension from the Federal Government--the portion the \ngovernment is obligated to pay them, not what they have contributed.\n  Our intelligence bill is being criticized by some individuals out \nthere. And guess who it is? It is the media and it is the White House. \nWhat does that tell you about their fear and their participation in the \nrelease of classified information?\n  So this issue is of critical importance. It simply has to stop for \nany number of national security reasons, but the ones that have been \naddressed by my colleagues obviously are to be highlighted. I look \nforward to whatever comments the Senator from Illinois may have with \nrespect to justifying--I know he is not going to justify the leaks \nbecause I know him too well, but whatever his justification is for \nproceeding in a prosecution manner the way the Department of Justice is \ngoing versus what the Bush administration did and appointing a special \ncounsel in a case that, by the way, pales in comparison to the leaks \nthat took place in this particular instance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before we turn to our friend from Illinois \nfor his, I am sure, convincing explanation as to why a special counsel \nis not required, even though it was, in the opinion of his side, in a \nprevious situation, I want to just, again--and the Senator from Georgia \nand the Senator from South Carolina will also corroborate the fact that \nwe have been working and working, having meeting after meeting after \nmeeting, on the issue of cyber security.\n  We believe we have narrowed it down to three or four differences that \ncould be worked out over time. Among them is liability. Another one is \ninformation sharing. But I think it is also important for us to \nrecognize in this debate the people who are most directly affected in \nmany respects are the business communities, and it is important that we \nhave the input and satisfy, at least to a significant degree, those \nconcerns.\n  There are those who allege that a piece of legislation is better than \nno legislation. I have been around this town for a long time. I have \nseen bad legislation which is far worse than no legislation. So we \nunderstand certainly--I and members of the Armed Services Committee and \nothers understand--the importance of this issue.\n  We also understand that those who are directly affected by it--those \nconcerns need to be satisfied as well. I commit to my colleagues to \ncontinue nonstop rounds of meetings and discussions to try to get this \nissue resolved. To this moment, there are still significant \ndifferences.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, I look forward to hearing his \nconvincing discussion.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois \nbe involved in the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I did not know if the Senator wanted to make his \nunanimous consent request that he came to the floor to make.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is not going to make it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. The Senator will object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Arizona. \nOccasionally, historically, on the floor of the Senate there is a \ndebate, and this may be one of those moments. I hope it is because it \nis a worthy topic.\n  Let's get down to the bottom line. I have served on the Intelligence \nCommittee, as some of my colleagues have. We know the important work \ndone by the intelligence community to keep America safe. They literally \nrisk their lives every day for us, and they are largely invisible. We \ndo not see them at the military parades and other places where we \nacknowledge those warriors who risk their lives, but these men and \nwomen do it in so many different ways.\n  When I spent 4 years on the Senate Intelligence Committee--and my \ncolleagues, I am sure, feel the same--I went out of my way to make sure \nI was careful with classified information so as to continue to protect \nthis country and never endanger those who were helping us keep it safe \nall around the world.\n  So the obvious question raised by the Republican side of the of the \naisle is whether this President, President Barack Obama, thinks \ndifferently; whether President Obama believes we should cut corners and \nnot be so careful when it comes to the leaking of classified \ninformation.\n  My answer to that is look at the record. Look at the record and ask \nthis basic question: When it comes to prosecuting those believed to \nhave been\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\nguilty of leaks of classified information, which President of the \nUnited States has prosecuted more suspected individuals than any other \nPresident, Democrat or Republican? Barack Obama.\n  On six different occasions--five in the Department of Justice and one \nin the Department of Defense--they pursued the active prosecution of \nthose they believed were guilty of leaking classified information that \nmight endanger the United States.\n  Let me add another personal observation. It was last year when my \nfriend Bill Daley, then-Chief of Staff to President Obama, came to \nChicago for a luncheon. It was a nice day. We had a nice luncheon. It \nwas very successful. He said he had to get back to Washington. He was \nin a big hurry. He never said why. He told me later--he told me much \nlater--after this occurred: I had to get back because we had a \nclassified meeting about hunting down Osama bin Laden. We were sworn to \nsecrecy at every level of government so that we never, ever disclosed \ninformation that we were even thinking about that possibility.\n  Bill Daley took it seriously. The President takes it seriously. \nAnyone in those positions of power will take it seriously. To suggest \notherwise on the floor of the Senate is just plain wrong, and it raises \na question about this President's commitment to the Nation, which I \nthink is improper and cannot be backed up with the evidence.\n\n  Now, let's look at the evidence when it comes to the appointment of a \nspecial prosecutor. Let me take you back to those moments when a \nspecial prosecutor named Patrick Fitzgerald from the Northern District \nof Illinois was chosen to investigate the leak of classified formation.\n  Let me put it in historical context. We had invaded Iraq. We did it \nbased on assertions by the Bush-Cheney administration about the danger \nto the United States. One of those assertions dealt with Africa and \ncertain yellow cake chemicals that might be used for nuclear weapons \nand whether they were going to fall into the hands of the Iraqi \nleadership.\n  It was one of the arguments--there were many: weapons of mass \ndestruction, and so forth, that turned out to be totally false--leading \nus into a war which has cost us dearly in terms of human lives and our \nown treasure.\n  So one person spoke out. Former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who identified \nhimself as a Republican, said: I do not believe there is any evidence \nto back up the assertion about the yellow cake coming out of Africa.\n  Well, he was punished. Do you remember how he was punished? He was \npunished when someone decided to out his wife Valerie Plame. Valerie \nPlame had served as an intelligence agent for the United States to \nprotect our Nation, and someone decided that in order to get even with \nJoe Wilson they would disclose the fact that his wife worked in the \nintelligence agencies.\n  Then what happened? If you will remember, when that story broke, the \nintelligence community of the United States of America said: We have \nbeen betrayed. If one of our own can be outed in a political debate in \nWashington, are any of us safe? A legitimate question.\n  So there was an obvious need to find out who did it, who disclosed \nher identity, endangering her life, the life of every person who had \nworked with her, and so many other intelligence agents.\n  Mr. President, do you recall what happened? I do. The Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, John Ashcroft, recused himself from this \ninvestigation. It was the right thing for him to do because the \nquestions about this disclosure of her identity went to the top of the \nadministration. He recused himself and appointed Patrick Fitzgerald, \nthe U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, a \nprofessional, a professional prosecutor with the U.S. Department of \nJustice.\n  Well, the investigation went on for a long time. At the end of the \ninvestigation, the Chief of Staff of the Vice President of the United \nStates was found to have violated a law. That came out, and eventually \nwe learned the identity of who actually disclosed the name of Valerie \nPlame. It was a serious issue, one that called for a special counsel, \nand, if I remember correctly, there were even Republicans at that point \njoining Democrats saying: Let's get to the bottom of this. If this goes \nall the way to the top, let's find out who is responsible for it. So it \nwas the appropriate thing to do.\n  Now, take a look at this situation. This President, who has activated \nthe prosecution of six individuals suspected of leaking classified \ninformation, takes very seriously the information that was disclosed \nrelated to the al-Qaida techniques and all the things they were using \nto threaten the United States.\n  What has he done as a result of it? Let's be specific because I \nreally have to call into question some of the statements that have been \nmade on the floor. To say that the administration is covering this up, \nas to this leak, is just plain wrong.\n  At this point, the Department of Justice has appointed two highly \nrespected and experienced prosecutors with proven records of \nindependence in the exercise of their duties. U.S. Attorney Machen has \nrecently overseen a number of public corruption prosecutions in the \nDistrict of Columbia. U.S. Attorney Rosenstein has overseen a number of \nnational security investigations, including one of the five leak \ninvestigations that have been prosecuted under this President. The \nJustice Department has complete confidence in their ability to conduct \nthorough and independent investigations into these matters in close \ncollaboration with career prosecutors and agents.\n  This is not being swept under the rug. This is not being ignored. \nThis is being taken seriously by this administration, as every leak of \nclassified information will be taken seriously.\n  I know it is an election year. We are fewer than 100 days away from \nthe election, and I know the floor of the Senate is used by both \nparties this close to the election. But I want to make it clear this \nPresident has a record of commitment to protecting the men and women \nwho gather intelligence for America. He has a record of prosecuting \nmore suspects for leaks of this information than any other President in \nhistory. He has, through his Attorney General, appointed two career \ncriminal prosecutors to look into this case and said they will have the \nresources and authority they need to get to the bottom of it. That is \nthe way to do it.\n  Will the day come when we say perhaps a special counsel is needed? I \nwill not ever rule that out. Perhaps that day will come. But it is \nwrong to come to the floor and question this President's commitment to \nour intelligence community. It is wrong to come to the floor and \nquestion the credentials of these two men who have performed so well in \nthe service of the Department of Justice in years gone by.\n  I thought Senator McCain was going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest. If he wishes to, let me yield to him at this point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to respond to my friend.\n  First of all, obviously, he is in disagreement with the chairperson \nof the Intelligence Committee because she said these leaks were the \nworst in the 11 years she has been a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. So, obviously, the Abramoff and the Valerie Plame \ninvestigations are not nearly as serious, and they certainly were not \nwhen we look at the incredible damage, according to Admiral McRaven, \naccording to anyone who is an observer of the incredible damage these \nleaks have caused.\n  Again, the chairperson of the Intelligence Committee said it is the \nworst she has ever seen. Admiral McRaven, as I said, said these have \nput lives at risk and may ultimately cost Americans their lives.\n  I wonder if my colleague from Illinois is concerned when, according \nto his book, Mr. Sanger said: ``A senior official in the National \nSecurity Council'' tapped him on the shoulder and brought him to the \nPresidential suite in the Pittsburgh hotel where President Obama was \nstaying, and--I am quoting from Mr. Sanger's book--where ``most of the \nrest of the national security staff was present.'' There, the \njournalist was apparently allowed to review satellite images and other \n``evidence'' that confirmed the existence of a secret nuclear site in \nIran.\n  When leaks take place around this town, the first question you have \nto ask is, Who benefits? Who benefits from them? Obviously someone who \nwants to take a journalist up to the presidential suite would make it \npretty\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\neasy for us to narrow down whom we should interview first. Who had the \nkey to the presidential suite? Who uses the presidential suite in a \nhotel in Pittsburgh? These leaks are the most damaging that have taken \nplace in my time in the Senate and before that in the U.S. military. \nYes, six people have been prosecuted. Do you know at what level? A \nprivate. The lowest level people have been prosecuted by this \nadministration. And this administration says they have to interview \nhundreds of people in the bottom-up process.\n  I can guarantee you one thing, I will tell the Senator from Illinois \nnow, there will not be any definitive conclusion in the investigation \nbefore the election in November. That does not mean to me that they are \nnot doing their job, although it is clear that one of these prosecutors \nwas active in the Obama campaign, was a contributor to the Obama \ncampaign. I am not saying that individual is not of the highest \ncaliber. I am saying that would lead people to ask a reasonable \nquestion, and that is whether that individual is entirely objective.\n  Americans need an objective investigation by someone they can trust, \njust as then-Senator Biden and then-Senator Obama asked for in these \nprevious incidents, which, in my view, were far less serious and, in \nthe view of the chairperson of the Intelligence Committee, are far more \nsevere than those that were previously investigated. I would be glad to \nhave my colleague respond to that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, let me say that whatever the rank of the \nindividual--private, specialist, chief petty officer--if they are \nresponsible for leaking classified information, they need to be \ninvestigated and prosecuted, if guilty.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the fact that a private is being investigated should \nnot get him off the hook. I would----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not think it gets him off the hook. I think it has \nsome significance as compared to this kind of egregious breach of \nsecurity that has taken place at the highest level. We know that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to my friend from Arizona, if I am not \nmistaken, it was a noncommissioned officer at best and maybe not an \nofficer in the Army who is being prosecuted for the Wiki leaks. So \nlet's not say that the rank of anyone being prosecuted in any way makes \nthem guilty or innocent. We need to go to the source of the leak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. But my friend would obviously acknowledge that if it \nis a private or a corporal or something, it has not nearly the gravity \nit does when a person with whom the Nation has placed much higher \nresponsibilities commits this kind of breach.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course. It should be taken to where it leads, period. \nBut let me also ask--I do not know if quoting from a book on the floor \nmeans what was written in that book is necessarily true. Perhaps the \nSenator has his own independent information on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But no one has challenged Mr. Sanger's depiction. No one \nin the administration has challenged his assertion that he was taken by \n``a senior official in the National Security Council to the \npresidential suite.'' No one has challenged that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator, I do not know if that has to \ndo with the information that was ultimately leaked about al-Qaida. It \nseems as though it is a separate matter. But it should be taken \nseriously, period. What more does this President need to do to convince \nyou other than to have more prosecutions than any President in history \nof those who have been believed to have leaked classified information?\n  If you will come to the floor, as you said earlier--and I quote, the \ninvestigation is ``supposedly going on.'' I trust the administration \nthat the investigation is going on. What evidence does the Senator have \nthat it is not going on?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, it is not a matter of trust, it is a \nmatter of credibility because if an administration has the same \nargument that then-Senator Biden used and Senator Obama used in \nopposition to the administration investigating the Abramoff case and \nthe Valerie Plame case--they argued that it is not a matter of trust, \nit is a matter of credibility with the American people whether an \nadministration can actually investigate itself or should there be a \ncredible outside counsel who would conduct this investigation, which \nwould then have the necessary credibility, I think, with the American \npeople. I think that there is a certain logic to that, I hope my \ncolleague would admit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator that in that case, the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, John Ashcroft, recused himself--recused \nhimself. He said there was such an appearance of a conflict, if not a \nconflict, he was stepping aside. It is very clear under those \ncircumstances that a special counsel is needed. In this case, there is \nno suggestion that the President, the Vice President, or the Attorney \nGeneral was complicit in any leak. So to suggest otherwise, I have to \nsay to Senator McCain, show me what you are bringing as proof.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am bringing you proof that this Attorney General has a \nsignificant credibility problem, and that problem is bred by a program \ncalled Fast and Furious where weapons were--under a program sponsored \nby the Justice Department----\n  Mr. DURBIN. When did the program begin?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just finish my comment. A young American Border \nPatrol agent was murdered with weapons that were part of the Fast and \nFurious investigation. What has the Attorney General of the United \nStates done? He has said that he will not come forward with any \ninformation that is requested by my colleagues in the House.\n  So I would have to say that, at least in the House of Representatives \nand with many Americans and certainly with the family of Brian Terry, \nwho was murdered, there is a credibility problem with this Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague and friend Senator McCain, I deeply \nregret the loss of any American life, particularly those in service of \nour country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am convinced of that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I feel exactly that about this individual and the \nloss to his family. But let's make sure the record is complete. The \nFast and Furious program was not initiated by President Obama, it was \nstarted by President George W. Bush.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Which, in my view, does not in any way impact the need \nfor a full and complete investigation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Secondly, this Attorney General, Mr. Holder, has been \nbrought before congressional committees time after time. I have been in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee when he has been questioned at length \nabout Fast and Furious, and I am sure he has been called even more \nfrequently before the House committees.\n  Third, he has produced around 9,000 pages of documents, and Chairman \nIssa keeps saying: Not enough. We need more. Well, at some point it \nbecomes clear he will never produce enough documents for them. And the \nHouse decided to find him in contempt for that. That is their decision. \nI do not think that was necessarily proper.\n  But having said that, does that mean every decision from the \nDepartment of Justice from this point forward cannot be trusted?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. But what I am saying is that there is a significant \ncredibility problem that the Attorney General of the United States has, \nat least with a majority of the House of Representatives----\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Republican majority.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On this issue, which then lends more weight to the \nargument, as there was in the case of Valerie Plame and Jack Abramoff, \nfor the need for a special counsel.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not see the connection. If the Attorney General and \nthe President said: We are not going to investigate this matter, \nSenator McCain, I would be standing right next to the Senator on the \nfloor calling for a special counsel. But they have said just the \nopposite. They have initiated an investigation and brought in two \ncareer criminal prosecutors whom we have trusted to take public \ncorruption cases in the District of Columbia and leaks of classified \ninformation in other cases. And he said: Now you have the authority. \nConduct the investigation.\n  They are not ignoring this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Those two counsels report to whom? The Attorney General \nof the United States.\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. And ultimately report to the people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I would think, just for purposes of credibility with \nthe American people, that a special counsel would be called for by \nalmost everyone.\n  Look, I understand the position of the Senator from Illinois. We have \nour colleagues waiting. I appreciate the fact that he is willing to \ndiscuss this issue. I think we have pretty well exhausted it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I turn to one other issue the Senator raised, if he \nhas a moment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The pending bill, cyber security--this is a bill which I \nhope we both agree addresses an issue of great seriousness and gravity \nin terms of America's defense. I know the Senator from Arizona and some \nof his colleagues have produced an alternative. I support the \nbipartisan bill that Senators Lieberman and Collins have brought to the \nfloor.\n  The major group who opposes the passage of the cyber security bill is \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an organization that represents the \nlargest businesses in America, and what I have heard the Senator from \nArizona say over and over is that they have to be an important part of \nthis conversation and this discussion. I think Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Collins would say: We have engaged them. We have listened to \nthem. We have made changes consistent with what they were looking for. \nBut clearly they have not reached the point where they are satisfied.\n  I learned yesterday, when Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island came to \nthe floor, that, in fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce really turns out \nto be pretty expert on this issue of cyber security. And I call the \nattention of the Senator from Arizona, if he is not aware of it, to a \nWall Street Journal article of December 21, 2011. This Wall Street \nJournal article is entitled ``China Hackers Hit U.S. Chamber,'' and it \nstarts by saying:\n\n       A group of hackers in China breached the computer defenses \n     of America's top business lobbying group and gained access to \n     everything stored on its systems, including information about \n     its three million members, according to several people \n     familiar with the matter. The complex operation involved at \n     least 300 Internet addresses. . . . Four chamber employees \n     who worked on Asian policy had six weeks of their emails \n     stolen.\n\n  The article goes on to say that the Chamber of Commerce did not \nnotice this breach that went on for 6 months. The Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation brought it to their attention. And then they learned that \nthe Chinese had not only hacked into the computer mainframe, they had \nsomehow hacked into the computer-driven thermostats in their office, \nand at times in the office of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, their copy \nmachines and fax machines were spitting out pages with Chinese \ncharacters on them. They were completely compromised by this cyber \nattack. Now they come us to as experts on how to avoid a cyber attack.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 21, 2011]\n\n  China Hackers Hit U.S. Chamber--Attacks Breached Computer System of \n                 Business-Lobbying Group; Emails Stolen\n\n                          (By Siobhan Gorman)\n\n       A group of hackers in China breached the computer defenses \n     of America's top business-lobbying group and gained access to \n     everything stored on its systems, including information about \n     its three million members, according to several people \n     familiar with the matter.\n       The break-in at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is one of the \n     boldest known infiltrations in what has become a regular \n     confrontation between U.S. companies and Chinese hackers. The \n     complex operation, which involved at least 300 Internet \n     addresses, was discovered and quietly shut down in May 2010.\n       It isn't clear how much of the compromised data was viewed \n     by the hackers. Chamber officials say internal investigators \n     found evidence that hackers had focused on four Chamber \n     employees who worked on Asia policy, and that six weeks of \n     their email had been stolen.\n       It is possible the hackers had access to the network for \n     more than a year before the breach was uncovered, according \n     to two people familiar with the Chamber's internal \n     investigation.\n       One of these people said the group behind the break-in is \n     one that U.S. officials suspect of having ties to the Chinese \n     government. The Chamber learned of the break-in when the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation told the group that servers \n     in China were stealing its information, this person said. The \n     FBI declined to comment on the matter.\n       A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Geng \n     Shuang, said cyberattacks are prohibited by Chinese law and \n     China itself is a victim of attacks. He said the allegation \n     that the attack against the Chamber originated in China \n     ``lacks proof and evidence and is irresponsible,'' adding \n     that the hacking issue shouldn't be ``politicized.''\n       In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a \n     daily briefing that he hadn't heard about the matter, though \n     he repeated that Chinese law forbids hacker attacks. He added \n     that China wants to cooperate more with the international \n     community to prevent hacker attacks.\n       The Chamber moved to shut down the hacking operation by \n     unplugging and destroying some computers and overhauling its \n     security system. The security revamp was timed for a 36-hour \n     period over one weekend when the hackers, who kept regular \n     working hours, were expected to be off duty.\n       Damage from data theft is often difficult to assess.\n       People familiar with the Chamber investigation said it has \n     been hard to determine what was taken before the incursion \n     was discovered, or whether cyberspies used information \n     gleaned from the Chamber to send booby-trapped emails to its \n     members to gain a foothold in their computers, too.\n       Chamber officials said they scoured email known to be \n     purloined and determined that communications with fewer than \n     50 of its members were compromised. They notified those \n     members. People familiar with the investigation said the \n     emails revealed the names of companies and key people in \n     contact with the Chamber, as well as trade-policy documents, \n     meeting notes, trip reports and schedules.\n       ``What was unusual about it was that this was clearly \n     somebody very sophisticated, who knew exactly who we are and \n     who targeted specific people and used sophisticated tools to \n     try to gather intelligence,'' said the Chamber's Chief \n     Operating Officer David Chavern.\n       Nevertheless, Chamber officials said they haven't seen \n     evidence of harm to the organization or its members.\n       The Chamber, which has 450 employees and represents the \n     interests of U.S. companies in Washington, might look like a \n     juicy target to hackers. Its members include most of the \n     nation's largest corporations, and the group has more than \n     100 affiliates around the globe.\n       While members are unlikely to share any intellectual \n     property or trade secrets with the group, they sometimes \n     communicate with it about trade and policy.\n       U.S. intelligence officials and lawmakers have become \n     alarmed by the growing number of cyber break-ins with roots \n     in China. Last month, the U.S. counterintelligence chief \n     issued a blunt critique of China's theft of American \n     corporate intellectual property and economic data, calling \n     China ``the world's most active and persistent perpetrators \n     of economic espionage'' and warning that large-scale \n     industrial espionage threatens U.S. competitiveness and \n     national security.\n       Two people familiar with the Chamber investigation said \n     certain technical aspects of the attack suggested it was \n     carried out by a known group operating out of China. It isn't \n     clear exactly how the hackers broke in to the Chamber's \n     systems. Evidence suggests they were in the network at least \n     from November 2009 to May 2010.\n       Stan Harrell, chief information officer at the Chamber, \n     said federal law enforcement told the group: ``This is a \n     different level of intrusion'' than most hacking. ``This is \n     much more sophisticated.''\n       Chamber President and Chief Executive Thomas J. Donahue \n     first learned of the breach in May 2010 after he returned \n     from a business trip to China. Chamber officials tapped their \n     contacts in government for recommendations for private \n     computer investigators, then hired a team to diagnose the \n     breach and overhaul the Chamber's defenses.\n       They first watched the hackers in action to assess the \n     operation. The intruders, in what appeared to be an effort to \n     ensure continued access to the Chamber's systems, had built \n     at least a half-dozen so-called back doors that allowed them \n     to come and go as they pleased, one person familiar with the \n     investigation said. They also built in mechanisms that would \n     quietly communicate with computers in China every week or \n     two, this person said.\n       The intruders used tools that allowed them to search for \n     key words across a range of documents on the Chamber's \n     network, including searches for financial and budget \n     information, according to the person familiar with the \n     investigation. The investigation didn't determine whether the \n     hackers had taken the documents turned up in the searches.\n       When sophisticated cyberspies have access to a network for \n     many months, they often take measures to cover their tracks \n     and to conceal what they have stolen.\n       To beef up security, the Chamber installed more \n     sophisticated detection equipment and barred employees from \n     taking the portable devices they use every day to certain \n     countries, including China, where the risk of infiltration is \n     considered high. Instead, Chamber employees are issued \n     different equipment\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n     before their trips--equipment that is checked thoroughly upon \n     their return.\n       Chamber officials say they haven't been able to keep \n     intruders completely out of their system, but now can detect \n     and isolate attacks quickly.\n       The Chamber continues to see suspicious activity, they say. \n     A thermostat at a town house the Chamber owns on Capitol Hill \n     at one point was communicating with an Internet address in \n     China, they say, and, in March, a printer used by Chamber \n     executives spontaneously started printing pages with Chinese \n     characters.\n       ``It's nearly impossible to keep people out. The best thing \n     you can do is have something that tells you when they get \n     in,'' said Mr. Chavern, the chief operating officer. ``It's \n     the new normal. I expect this to continue for the foreseeable \n     future. I expect to be surprised again.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, could I say that is just unfair. They are \nnot claiming to be experts on cyber attacks. They are claiming that \nthere are issues of liability, issues of information sharing, and other \nissues that they believe will inhibit their ability to engage in \nbusiness practices and grow and prosper. So to say that somehow they \nclaim they are experts on cyber security, they are not, but they are \nexperts on how their businesses can best cooperate, share information, \nresist these attacks, and come together with other people and other \ninterests to bring about some legislation on which we can all agree.\n  There are 3 million businesses and organizations that are represented \nhere, I say to my colleague, so it seems to me that we should continue \nthis conversation with them, particularly on issues of information \nsharing and liability. But to somehow say ``well, we talked to them, \nbut we did not agree with anything they wanted to do'' is not fair to \nthose 3 million businesses. We are making some progress. But please \ndon't say they portray themselves as experts.\n  By the way, they hacked into my Presidential campaign, which shows \nthey really were pretty bored and did not have a hell of a lot to do. \nBut, anyway, go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure that wasn't the case. I am sure it was a \nfascinating treasure trove of great insights and information.\n  But let me just say to my friend from Arizona, I am asking only for a \nlittle humility on both sides, both in the public sector and the \nprivate sector, by first acknowledging, as our security advisers tell \nus, that this is one of the most serious threats to our country and its \nfuture, and we should be joining with some humility, particularly if \nyou have been victimized, whether in your campaign or in your offices, \nto understand how far this has gone. The FBI, according to Senator \nWhitehouse when he came to the floor, found 50 different American \nbusinesses that had been compromised and hacked into by the same type \nof operation. Forty-eight were totally unaware of it. They did not even \nknow it occurred. What we are trying to do is to get these businesses \nto cooperate with us so that we share information and keep one another \nsafe.\n  At the end of the day, it is not just about the safety of the \nbusinesses--and I think it is important that they be safe--but the \nsafety of the American people. This is really a serious issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I say to my colleague, first of all, to somehow infer \nthat businesses in America are less interested in national security \nthan they are in their own businesses is not, I think, a fair \ninference. But let me also say that what they want to do is be more \nefficient in the way they can do business.\n  For example, information sharing--as you know, there is a serious \nproblem with liability if they are not given some kind of protections \nin the information sharing they would do with each other and with the \nFederal Government. So we want to make sure they have that security so \nthat they will more cooperatively engage in the kind of information we \nneed. That is a vital issue. That is still something on which we have a \ndisagreement.\n  I have no doubt that the comments of the Senator from Illinois about \nhow important this issue is are true. Nobody argues about that. But we \nhave to get it right rather than get it wrong. The Senator from \nIllinois and I have been here a long time, and sometimes we have found \nout that we have passed legislation that has had adverse consequences \nrather than the positive ones we contemplated. By the way, I would \nthrow Dodd-Frank in there. No company is too big to fail now. I would \nthrow in some of the other legislation we have passed recently, which \nhas not achieved the goals we sought.\n  That is why we need, in my view, more compromise and agreement. I \nbelieve we can reach it. I give great credit to both of our cosponsors \nof the bill, but please don't allege that this is ``bipartisan'' in any \nsignificant way. Most of the Republican Senators oppose the legislation \nin its present form. All Republican Senators understand the gravity of \nthis situation and the necessity of acting.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Arizona, I hope we get this done \nthis week. I know it is a big lift, and it is a lot to do. But I \nbelieve the threat is imminent, and I believe it is continuous. If we \ndon't find a way through our political differences to make this country \nsafer, shame on us.\n  I believe Senator Collins is from the Senator's side of the aisle and \nis proud of that fact. So it is a bipartisan effort. She worked with--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. It depends upon your definition of ``bipartisan.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, it is clearly bipartisan with Senators Lieberman \nand Collins. I also say that to raise the question of Dodd-Frank and \nappropriate government oversight and regulation--I suggest that we \nreflect on three things: LIBOR, Peregrine Investments, and the Chase \nloss of $6 billion.\n  To say that we should not have government oversight of our financial \ninstitutions that dragged us into this recession we are still trying to \nrecover from--I see it differently. We vote differently when it comes \nto that. I think there is a continuing need for government oversight of \nthese financial institutions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. These institutions are not averse to government \noversight. They are averse to legislation that harms their ability to \nshare that information because if they face the threat of being taken \ninto court for that, then obviously there is some reluctance. They also \nknow how much has been lost because of the lack of cyber security to \nChina and other countries. They are the ones who have been most \ndirectly affected. They are intelligent people, smart people, and they \nwant this legislation to pass in a way that is the most effective way \nto enact legislation on this very serious issue.\n  I look forward to continuing the conversation with my friend from \nIllinois. I think both of us learn a bit from our conversations, and I \nthank him for his continued willingness to discuss the issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend, the Senator from Arizona. I hope other \ncolleagues will engage in this kind of exchange. I don't know if we \nconvinced one another, but we certainly leave with the same level of \nrespect with which we started. I hope those who have followed the \ndebate have heard a little more about both sides of the issue in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5824-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5824-S5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1627\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored and grateful to follow \nthat very enlightening and energetic exchange between two of the most \nable and respected Members of this body on a range of issues.\n  One of them I want to address now, and I want to particularly thank \nthe Presiding Officer for his contribution, my distinguished friend \nfrom Minnesota, who has really addressed so instructively some of the \nprivacy concerns in various proposals in an amendment I have joined. I \nthink his work on that issue is really reflective of the approach that \nhas been brought to this issue of cyber security--an issue that this \nentire body, in my view, has a historic opportunity and also a historic \nobligation to address this week, deal with it now authoritatively and \neffectively and in a way that the Nation expects us to do it.\n  I thank not only the Presiding Officer but a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues, beginning with Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, \nFeinstein, and Carper, who deserve our appreciation for drafting this \nbill and bringing it to the floor, and a number of other colleagues, \nincluding, along with the Presiding Officer, Senators Whitehouse, \nMikulski, Coons, Coats, Blunt, Akaka, and Kyl. I mention this number \nbecause I think it is an important fact about the process that has \nbrought us to this point. It really reflects the kind of collegial \napproach that is so important to this legislation.\n  This legislation has undergone very significant and substantial \nrevisions to reflect suggestions made by myself and our colleagues, and \nthis bill will give the government and private sector an opportunity to \ncollaborate and share information so that they can confront the \nongoing, present, urgent cyber threat directly and immediately.\n  This bill is not a top-down approach; it is voluntary in its \ndirection to the private sector. What it says to critical industries--\nindustries that are critical to our infrastructure--is that you \ndetermine what the best practices are, you tell us what the standards \nshould be, and then those standards will be shared throughout the \nindustry and overseen by a council that the Departments of Commerce and \nJustice and Defense and Homeland Security will be involved in \nimplementing. And if companies comply with those standards--voluntary \nstandards--they receive benefits that will enlist them in the program, \nbenefits that will form incentives in the form of limited immunity in \nthe event of an attack. If companies decline to comply, if they are not \nprovided with sufficient incentives, in their judgment, there is no \ncompulsion, no legal mandate that they need to do so. To use an often \noverused imagery, what we are talking about here is a carrot, not a \nstick, in solving one of the most pressing and threatening challenges \nour country faces today. It is the challenge of this moment, the \nchallenge of our time.\n  I have been in briefings, as has been the Presiding Officer and other \nMembers of this body, with members of the intelligence community and \nothers who have, in stark and staggering terms, presented to us the \npotential consequences of failing to act.\n  Just last week, GEN Keith Alexander, the chief of the U.S. Cyber \nCommand and the Director of the National Security Agency, said that \nintrusions on our essential infrastructure have increased 17-fold \nbetween 2009 and 2011 and that it is only a matter of time before \nphysical damage will result. He has said that the loss of industrial \ninformation and intellectual property--putting aside the physical \nthreat and taking only the economic damage--is ``the greatest transfer \nof wealth in history.''\n  We are permitting with impunity the greatest transfer of wealth in \nhistory from the United States of America to adversaries abroad, \ncompanies based overseas, at a time when every Member of this body says \nour priority should be jobs and protecting the economy of this country. \nIt is an economic issue, not just a national security issue. In fact, \ncyber security is national security.\n  The United States is literally under attack every day. General \nAlexander described 200 attacks on critical infrastructure within the \npast year. He alluded to them without describing them in detail. And on \na scale of 1 to 10, he said our preparedness for a large-scale cyber \nattack--shutting down the stock exchange or a blackout on the scale \ncomparable to the one in India within the past few days--is around a 3 \non a scale of 1 to 10. That situation is unacceptable.\n  We are, in a certain way, in a period of time now that is comparable \nto 1993, after the first World Trade Center bombing. Remember, in 1993 \nthe World Trade Center--1,336 pounds of explosives were placed in a \ncritical area of the World Trade Center, killing 6 people, injuring \n1,000, fortunately, at that point, failing to bring down the building, \nwhich was the objective. That first bombing was a warning as well as a \ntragedy. America, even more tragically, disregarded that warning in \nfailing to act. We are in that period now, comparable to 1993 and \nbefore 9/11, when the country could have acted and neglected to do so. \nWe cannot repeat that failure now. We cannot disregard the day-to-day \nattacks, the serious intrusions that are stealing our wealth and \nendangering our security, our critical grid, transportation, water \ntreatment, electricity, and financial system. The scale of damage that \ncould be done is horrific, comparable to what 9/11 did. We have an \nobligation to act before that kind of damage is faced in reality by the \ncountry.\n  We have been adequately and eloquently warned on the floor of this \nbody, in private briefings available to Members of this body, and in \nthe public press, to some extent. One of the frustrations I think many \nof us feel is that we cannot share some of the classified briefings we \nhave received which would depict in even more graphic and dramatic \nterms what this Nation faces. Some of these attacks are launched by \nforeign countries that seek to do us harm. Some are launched by \ndomestic criminals who simply want to steal money. Some are \nsophisticated and some are very crude.\n  Former Deputy Secretary William Lynch has detailed just one attack in \nwhich a foreign computer hacker--or group of them--stole 24,000 U.S. \nmilitary files in March of 2011. As others have noted on the floor as \nrecently as a few minutes ago, in late 2011 the computers of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce were completely compromised for more than a year by \nhackers. Yet today the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has essentially opposed \nthe voluntary standards-based plan to help secure our Nation against \nattack. In fact, how extraordinary it is that certain parts of this \nbill have actually combined a consensus among the business community, \nthe privacy advocates, as well as public officials, the National \nSecurity Agency. That consensus on privacy, again, reflects a profound \nand extraordinary feature of this bill, which is that we are coming \ntogether as a nation to face a common problem in a way that is demanded \nby the times and threats we face.\n  Shawn Henry, the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI, has said \nthat ``the cyber threat is an existential one, meaning that a major \ncyber attack could potentially wipe out whole companies.'' That is the \nreason the business community has been involved and should support \nthese proposals.\n  These attacks are not only ongoing, they have been occurring for \nyears. These criminals are infiltrating our communications, accessing \nour secrets, and sapping our economic health through thefts of \nintellectual property.\n  Finally, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, as has been frequently \nquoted, said:\n\n       The next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a \n     cyber attack that cripples our power system, our grid, our \n     security systems, our financial systems, our government \n     systems.\n\n  The panoply of harm is staggering, and we cannot wait for that harm \nto be a reality to this country. The consequences comparable to 9/11 \nare tragic to contemplate. FBI Director Mueller has said the cyber \nthreat, which\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\ncuts across all programs, will be the No. 1 threat to our country.\n  FBI Director Mueller speaks the truth. We must make sure our \ngovernment has the tools and authority they have asked for. The NSA, \nthe Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, our \nbusiness community and privacy advocates are all united in feeling this \nthreat must be confronted. We have the opportunity but we also have a \nhistoric obligation to make sure we move this bill and that it moves \nforward so we do not squander this opportunity.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                       Thanking Katharine Beamer\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, if I might, let me first thank Katharine \nBeamer for her service to the Senate and to the American people. She \nhas been an incredibly valuable part of my staff, detailed from the \nDepartment of State to my Senate office. She has helped me deal with \npreparations for my responsibility, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nwhile serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as we deal with \nthe confirmation of ambassadors. It is important to be adequately \nprepared to deal with the many foreign visitors who come to our office \nand to deal with foreign policy issues.\n  I particularly want to thank her for her help in the so-called \nMagnitsky bill, a bill that passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and has been also supported in the Senate Finance Committee. \nShe has been a critical part of our team in developing the necessary \nsupport so that bill could move forward.\n  I want to thank her for her help on the Cardin-Lugar provisions that \nprovide transparency among mineral companies so we can trace the \nresources of developing countries, allowing those resources to benefit \nthe strength of a country's economy rather than become a curse.\n  And I want to thank Katharine Beamer for her help on a lot of human \nrights issues she has been involved with, including the issue of Alan \nGross.\n  Senator Durbin has spoken on the floor and has brought to our \nattention the human rights violations of a Marylander who is today in a \nprison in Cuba. Alan Gross was providing help to a small Jewish \ncommunity in Cuba. He wasn't doing it in any secret manner. He was \ntrying to provide them a better opportunity to communicate with the \nInternet. He was very open about what he was doing in Cuba and was \ndoing it in order to advance the ability of a community to keep in \ntouch around the world.\n  As a result of that activity, Alan Gross, a Marylander, was arrested \nand imprisoned, tried and convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in \nprison. His appeal to the Cuban Supreme Court was denied in August of \n2011. For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, since December 3, 2009, Alan Gross has \nbeen imprisoned in Cuba--over 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Throughout my legislative career, I have worked hard to improve the \nrelationship between Cuba and the United States, particularly among the \npeople of Cuba and the people of the United States. I have worked on \nways to ease certain restrictions so we can improve the climate between \nour two countries. But what the Cuban Government is doing today in \ncontinuing to imprison Alan Gross is absolutely outrageous. It violates \ninternational human rights standards and it is against any sense of \nhumanity.\n  I am going to continue to speak out about it and urge the Cuban \nauthorities to do what is right. This has gained international \nattention and there have been efforts made by other dignitaries from \nother countries to try to get Alan Gross's case heard in a proper \nmanner. I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Durbin's \nextraordinary leadership on this issue. Senator Durbin took the time, \nwhen he was in Cuba, to meet with Alan Gross. I have been with Senator \nDurbin when we have met with Alan Gross's family. I have been with \nSenator Durbin when we have tried to engage other international \ndiplomats to implore the Cuban authorities on a humanitarian basis to \nrelease Alan Gross.\n  There was no reason for his arrest. There was no reason for his \nconviction. There is no reason for his being in prison today. But one \ndoesn't have to get too much involved in that issue to suggest that the \nCuban authorities should release Alan Gross on a humanitarian basis. I \nsay that because his health is in question. Alan's health has steadily \ndeteriorated during his imprisonment. He has lost over 100 pounds, \nsuffers from a multitude of medical conditions, including gout, ulcers, \nand arthritis, that have worsened without adequate treatment.\n  Of equal concern as his own health are the conditions of his beloved \nmother and daughter, both of whom are suffering from cancer. The Gross \nfamily should not have to suffer through another day of this desperate \nsituation without Alan at home for support.\n  So for all those reasons, we speak out today to once again urge the \nCuban authorities to do the right thing as far as human rights and \ntheir legal system and release Alan Gross. They should do the right \nthing from a humanitarian point of view and let Alan Gross come home to \nhis beloved family so he can be supportive of them during this \ndifficult time in their lives. We urge them to do the right thing so we \ncan have a better relationship between the people of Cuba and the \npeople of the United States. They should release Alan Gross because it \nis the right thing to do.\n  We are going to continue to speak out about this. I know many of us \nhave looked for different ways in which to help the Gross family and we \nwill continue to do that. But the simple, right thing for the Cuban \nauthorities is to release Alan Gross today, and we urge them to do \nthat.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Financial Strength\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce a rare \nopportunity for the people of my State, who care so much about the \nfuture of our country.\n  When I travel all around my beautiful State of West Virginia, one of \nthe biggest concerns I hear from the people is simply that our Nation's \nfinances are in such bad shape we could be the first generation that \nleaves this country and leaves our next generation in worse shape than \nwe received it.\n  I am determined to make sure that doesn't happen, and I am sure the \nPresiding Officer is as well. I am determined to bring people together \nto fix our finances and put this country back on the right path. I am \nalso determined that all our children and grandchildren will be able to \nlive a more fulfilling and prosperous life than we do.\n  But we are running out of easy options to put our country's financial \nhouse in order. And every day we delay a big fix, the price will be \nhigher, the changes will be more painful, and the choices will be more \nstark. With our country's finances so far out of control, all of the \npriorities we all care about--whether it is creating jobs, maintaining \nthe best military in the world, keeping the core of vital programs such \nas Social Security, or educating the next generation--are in jeopardy.\n  If we care about rebuilding America--investing in our highways and \nour roads, our airports, our water and sewer systems--we cannot do it \nif we don't pay for it. If we care about creating jobs and giving our \nbusinesses certainty, we can't do that either if we can't pay for it. \nAnd if we care about educating the next generation and preparing this \ngeneration with the skill sets they need for the jobs of today and \ntomorrow, we can't do it if we can't pay for it.\n  If we care about having an energy policy that uses all of our \ndomestic resources in the cleanest possible manner; if we care about \ndeveloping technology for clean coal; if we care about finally ending \nour dependence on foreign oil from hostile countries, we can't do it if \nwe can't pay for it.\n  If we care about having the best military in the world, one that can \ndefend the liberty of this great Nation at home and, where needed, \nabroad, we simply can't do it if we can't pay for it.\n  If we care about helping the vulnerable, the sick, the weak, and \nkeeping our vital core promises--such as Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Head Start--we simply can't do it if we can't pay for it.\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\n  Any nation that wants to be a strong nation, that wants to invest in \nits priorities and wants to leave the country in better shape for the \nnext generation cannot be shackled by crippling debt. If the Federal \nGovernment can't get its financial houses in order, the hard truth is \nall these priorities I spoke about will be slashed--sooner than any of \nus would like to admit.\n  Whether we consider ourselves a Democrat, a Republican, an \nIndependent, or we have no affiliation at all; whether we consider \nourselves a liberal, a conservative, or a centrist--wherever we fall in \nthe spectrum--none of the priorities we care about on all those sides \ncan happen unless we can pay for it. The old saying is as true today as \nit ever has been: You can't help others if you're not strong enough to \nhelp yourself.\n  It is time to make America strong again.\n  Let me give some troubling figures that illustrate how bad it has \ngotten: The debt hole we have dug for ourselves now equals the entire \namount of goods this country produces; in other words, our gross \ndomestic product. That hasn't happened since 1947.\n  Think of the next group of lawmakers who will be sitting where we sit \nin 2033, which is just around the corner. They are going to have to \nlook Americans in the eye and tell them the Social Security check they \nare receiving will only be 75 percent of what is owed to them. They \nwill have to say it is because the group who came before us didn't do \ntheir job.\n  Think of 10 years from now, truly around the corner, when every man, \nwoman, and child in this country will owe more than $79,000 to pay off \nour national debt. Today it is about $50,700, which is way too high, \nbut it is only going to get worse if we don't do our job and fix it.\n  There are 3 million jobs going unfulfilled in this country because \nthey say the workforce doesn't have the right skills in order to \nperform those jobs, and our unemployment rate has been the highest for \nthe longest period of time. That is not acceptable.\n  Who exactly is supposed to pay for all this debt? If we do the math, \nthe picture isn't pretty. We are not balancing our budget, we are not \ntraining people for the jobs of the future, and we are leaving our \nchildren and grandchildren a massive debt that, as of today, equals the \nentire economic production of this great Nation.\n  To me, however we do the math--even if we use funny Washington \naccounting tricks--this situation adds up to a train wreck at best. I \nam determined to prevent this oncoming train wreck, and I will do all I \ncan, working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I have said \npeople back home didn't send me to Washington to put the next \ngeneration into more debt. They sent me to, hopefully, help get them \nout of debt.\n  Putting this country back on the right path will hurt, but we have to \nbe willing to come together across party lines. We have to determine \nour highest priorities and make tough choices. That is what the people \nof West Virginia sent me to do, not to cater to any one special \ninterest group.\n  There are plenty of politicians who will talk about fixing the \nproblem, who will pay lip service to coming up with a plan, who will \ntalk a good game--what we call talk the talk--but can't walk the walk. \nBut in the end, the problem will continue to fester if we don't do \nsomething.\n  I am not one of those politicians who can turn a blind eye to our \ndebt and walk away from it. The people of West Virginia expect more. \nThey expect me to make hard choices and work with both Democrats and \nRepublicans to do the right thing for our State. No matter how hard it \nwill be to fix our problems--and it is clear everyone will need to have \na little skin in the game and share these sacrifices--I am determined \nto do it.\n  But no Senator--no matter how committed they may be--can do it alone. \nThat is why I am so pleased to announce that two of the Nation's \ngreatest financial leaders will be coming to West Virginia to hold an \nopen forum with the people of our State about the future of our \nfinances, and we call that ``Our Finances and Our Future.'' Former \nSenator Alan Simpson, a Republican from Wyoming, and Mr. Erskine \nBowles, a Democrat who is the former White House Chief of Staff under \nPresident Bill Clinton, are two of the toughest and smartest people in \nthis country when it comes to our finances.\n  Since I have been here, the most bipartisan effort to fix our \nfinances has been led by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. They were \nasked to head the President's National Commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility and Reform. It was bipartisan when it began, it has \nstayed bipartisan all this time, and it has grown with the number of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle who understand we need a big fix \nthat comes from both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan way.\n  Bowles and Simpson paint a grim picture about the problems we are \nfacing. In December of 2010, they laid out a serious blueprint for a \nsolution--one that isn't perfect but that has earned more support from \nmembers of both parties than anything else that has been proposed in \nWashington.\n  Since then, too many of our leaders have put their heads in the sand \nabout this proposal and the choices we face. But West Virginia is \ndifferent from most of the States. We welcome the hard truth because we \nknow we have to face the truth. Believe me, we can handle the truth in \nWest Virginia.\n  On September 10, West Virginians will have an opportunity to hear \nsome truth telling. I am so proud that Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles \nwill hold a forum, ``Our Finances and Our Future: A Bipartisan \nConversation about the Facts,'' at our magnificent cultural center. \nThey will present the facts--and there is no doubt the facts are dire--\nand lay out the magnitude of the problem we face, and then we will talk \nabout solutions. It is a rare opportunity to have a frank bipartisan \nconversation about the grave conditions of our Nation's finances.\n  I am inviting all West Virginians--be it business, labor, senior \ngroups, the young people who are expected to pay off our debt, and \nanyone else with an interest in our future--to come and participate in \nthis session. We will talk about what this framework will do, which is \nto find the balance between revenue and spending, fundamentally \nchanging our Tax Code and cutting spending. In short, it will make our \nsystem more fair.\n  Let's look first at the Tax Code. There are some Americans who, \nbecause of their connections and ability to hire lobbyists, have \nmanipulated our Tax Code so they get special tax breaks. That is not \nright. Too many corporations that depend on the strength of this great \nNation--as has been noted, such as G.E.--are paying nothing or \nvirtually nothing in taxes. That is wrong. It is not right.\n  We need to make our tax system more fair and straightforward. The \nbipartisan Bowles-Simpson plan would end many of those loopholes and \nlower tax rates for everyone. When it comes to our spending, right now \nin this country we spend so much more than we can afford. I know so \nmany Americans who tell me they would be more than happy to pay more--\nif we were using it in the right direction--to pay down our debt and to \ninvest in infrastructure.\n  But we are not spending well. I have always said public servants can \ndo one or two things with public tax money: We can either spend it or \ninvest it. Frankly, we have been doing too much spending and not enough \ninvesting.\n\n  Our annual deficit--the amount we spend versus the amount we take \nin--is about $1.2 trillion this year alone. Looking into the future, if \nnothing changes, we will have deficits every year for the next decade. \nNo one can tell me we can sustain that pace and still afford Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, defending this Nation, and educating our \nchildren. The math doesn't add up. The bipartisan Bowles-Simpson \nframework addresses this by cutting more than $2 trillion for our \nspending over the next decade.\n  After we address our spending and our Tax Code, guess what happens. \nOur interest payments--the amount we are spending every year just for \nthe privilege of borrowing money from countries such as China to \nfinance our day-to-day operations--will go down nearly $700 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  That is the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson framework. Yes, it will have \nsome painful cuts, and, yes, everyone will have to share in the \nsacrifice. But because the pain is spread out, no one takes too deep a \nhit. That is why I believe this proposed blueprint is the\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nonly plan that has garnered any real show of bipartisan interest from \nthe beginning of its inception to today.\n  When I became Governor of the great State of West Virginia, our State \nfinances were in a tough place. We had to make very hard choices about \nour priorities, and not everyone was happy with those decisions. Seven \nor eight years ago, people believed West Virginia was hopeless; that we \nwould always be challenged; that our finances would always be on the \nbrink; that we wouldn't be able to invest in our priorities; that our \neconomy would always be stagnant; that our credit ratings would always \nbe miserably low; that we wouldn't be able to turn any of that around.\n  But I will tell you what. At the end of my term, we had lowered tax \nrates, reduced our food tax, ended our fiscal years with a budget \nsurplus each and every year, and increased our credit rating three \ntimes in 3 years during the greatest recession because we put our \npriorities based on our values of what was important to West Virginia. \nTogether, we weathered the recession better than 45 States. We are \nfinally getting the last piece of our puzzle in place with a fix to the \nretirement system.\n  I can tell you this: I am not talking about fixing our Nation's \nfinances from some ivory tower, from some rigid ideological position. I \nam talking about this country's finances because I know how much it \ncosts all of us to live in debt. I know the burden of high interest \npayments and the way it robs us of the opportunity to pay for more \nimportant priorities. I know how much stronger this country will be \nwhen we manage our debt. I know because we came together in West \nVirginia and improved the quality of life in our State, and I know we \ncan do it together in this country.\n  The truth is, Democrats don't have a lock on good ideas and neither \ndo Republicans. But with less than 100 days to go before the election, \nwe are not going to hear many Democrats giving Republicans any credit \nand we won't hear many Republicans acknowledging that Democrats have \nanything to bring to the table.\n  That is a true shame. We will not fix our problems with a go-it-alone \nattitude because the only way America has ever solved our problems is \nto put partisanship aside and come together for the good of this great \nNation.\n  Put America first. The West Virginia fiscal summit is just one honest \nway we can take an important step toward, coming together to solve our \nproblems and one more way for the people of West Virginia to show this \ngreat Nation that we can--and will--do the heavy lifting it will take \nto put this country back on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                        Renewable Fuels Standard\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the president and CEO of Smithfield \nFoods, Larry Pope, took to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal \nagain to blame all that ails him on the renewable fuels standard for \nethanol.\n  Some may recall he did the same thing back in April 2010 when \ncommodity prices were rising. At that time, he perpetuated a smear \ncampaign and blamed ethanol in an attempt to deflect blame for rising \nfood prices while boosting Smithfield's profits. With this newspaper \narticle, he is back at it again.\n  I start by referring to Mr. Pope as Henny Penny from the children's \nfolktale ``Chicken Little.'' Every time Smithfield has to pay a little \nmore to America's corn farmers to feed his hogs, Mr. Pope starts with \nthe same argument that the sky is falling, and it is all ethanol's \nfault.\n  Mr. Pope's opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal might lead some \nto believe he is very knowledgeable about the ethanol industry. But \nthere are many areas of ethanol he doesn't know much about.\n  He continues to perpetuate the myth that ethanol production consumes \n40 percent of the U.S. corn crop. Mr. Pope states: ``Ethanol now \nconsumes more corn than animal agriculture does.''\n  Everyone with a basic understanding of a livestock farm--even a \nkernel of corn--or of an ethanol plant knows that is not a true \nstatement. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 37 percent \nof the corn crop is used in producing ethanol. But--and a very \nimportant but--the value of corn does not simply vanish when ethanol is \nproduced.\n  One-third of the corn--that is, 18 pounds out of every 56-pound \nbushel--reenters the market as a high-value animal feed called dried \ndistillers grain. I would imagine millions of hogs raised by our farms \nevery year are fed a diet containing this ethanol coproduct. For sure \nit is a very big feed product for cattle. Of course, Mr. Pope appears \nto be unaware of its existence.\n  When the distillers grains are factored in; that is, 18 pounds out of \nthe 56 pounds that is left over after you make ethanol, 43 percent of \nthe corn supply is available for animal feed. Only 28 percent is used \nfor ethanol--unlike the 40 percent Mr. Pope says. This is the \ninconvenient truth of ethanol detractors. They prefer to live in a \nbubble where they believe ethanol is diverting corn from livestock use. \nThat is just not the case.\n  Mr. Pope also proclaims that ``ironically, if the ethanol mandate did \nnot exist, even this year's drought-depleted corn crop would have been \nmore than enough to meet the requirements for livestock feed and food \nproduction at decent prices.''\n  I would like to ask Mr. Pope why he thinks that is the case. Why did \nfarmers plant 96 million acres of corn this year when normally they \nwould plant between 86 and 88 million acres of corn? Why have seed \nproducers spent millions to develop better yielding and drought-\nresistant traits so we can produce more corn on less acres? The answer \nis simple: Because this gigantic industry of ethanol is there to \nconsume more corn and more production on each acre.\n  If not for ethanol, it is very clear farmers wouldn't have planted 96 \nmillion acres of corn this year because those are more acres of corn \nthan farmers have planted in this country since 1938. Without ethanol, \nI doubt we would have seen investment in higher yielding and more \ndrought-tolerant corn plants by our seed corn companies.\n  I happen to think Mr. Pope is an intelligent man, but he is woefully \nuninformed on the issue of what the ethanol industry and the demand for \ncorn has done for the size and genetic improvement of the corn crop. It \nis easy to understand Smithfield's motives. They benefit from an \nabundant supply of corn, just not the competing demand for it.\n  What is Smithfield's primary problem? Again, the answer is simple: \ncost and profit. They still want to pay $2 for a bushel for corn. This \nis an important point that I hope people understand. For nearly 30 \nyears, until about 2005, companies such as Smithfield had the luxury of \nbuying corn below the cost of production. Corn prices remained for \nabout 30 years between $1.50 a bushel and $3 a bushel. Farmers \nroutinely lost money. The Federal Government then provided economic \nsupport for the farmers. Producers such as Smithfield had the best of \nboth worlds. They were able to buy corn below the cost of production, \nand they were able to let the Federal Government subsidize their \nbusiness by guaranteeing a cheap supply of corn.\n\n  In the view of corporate livestock producers, subsidies are fine--if \nthey allow them to buy corn below the cost of production. Anybody could \nlook like a genius with that sort of a business model.\n  Mr. Pope also continues to overstate the impact of corn prices on the \nconsumer. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack recently stated that farmers \nreceive about 14 cents of every dollar spent on food at the grocery \nstore. Farmers get 14 percent and everybody else gets 86 percent, yet \nthe farmers of America are the problem? It happens that that 14 cents \nworks out to be about 3 cents of that 14 cents is because of corn.\n  A research economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently \nstated that a 50-percent increase in the price of corn will raise the \ntotal grocery shopping bill by about 1 percent. To put it in \nperspective, the value of corn in a $4 box of corn flakes is about 10 \ncents.\n  Mr. Pope also exaggerated the impact of ethanol on food prices in \n2010, and he is doing it again. He is using the devastating drought \nthat we now have--over 62 percent of the country and worse in the \nMidwest, of Iowa where I live--to once again undermine our Nation's \nfood, feed, and fuel producers,\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\nand he is doing it--why? To make more money.\n  Repealing the renewable fuel standard will not bolster Smithfield's \nprofits. Because of the flexibility built into the renewable fuels \nmandate, a waiver will not significantly reduce corn prices. A recent \nstudy by Professor Bruce Babcock, Iowa State University, found that a \ncomplete waiver of the renewable fuel standard--that is what the \nmandate is called--might reduce the corn prices by only 4.6 percent. \nThat report goes on to state:\n\n       The desire by livestock groups to see the additional \n     flexibility in ethanol mandates may not result in as large a \n     drop in feed costs as hoped.\n\n  They continue:\n\n     . . . the flexibility built into the Renewable Fuels Standard \n     allowing obligated parties to carry over blending credits \n     from previous years, significantly lowers the economic impact \n     of a short crop, because it introduces flexibility into that \n     mandate.\n\n  The drought is enormous in both scale and severity. But we will not \nknow the true impact until September when harvest begins. The latest \nestimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicate an average \nyield of 146 bushels per acre. That would result in a harvest of 13 \nbillion bushels. This would still be one of the largest corn harvests.\n  I suggest those claiming that the sky is falling withhold their call \nfor waiving or repealing the renewable fuel standard. It is a premature \naction that will not produce desired results and it would increase our \ndependence upon foreign oil and it would drive up prices at the pump \nfor consumers.\n  On another point with regard to taxes and the proposals around the \nHill to increase taxes, I want to say that over the past few years my \ncolleagues on the other side have come to the floor repeatedly to \npresent a revisionist story regarding the fiscal history of the last \ntwo decades. On several occasions I have come to the floor to refute \nthis history. Yet, again and again, the other side continues to present \nthe same distorted facts, including lots of speeches last week.\n  The general misguided argument is that all of the economic and fiscal \nsuccess of the 1990s is thanks to big tax increases by the Clinton \nadministration and the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief is \nresponsible for all of our economic ills and fiscal problems.\n  Neither of these claims is supported by facts or a basic \nunderstanding of economics. I will begin with the Clinton tax increase \nto which people are giving so much credit. Many on the other side of \nthe aisle argue that the Clinton tax increases are proof that tax \nincreases will not harm our economy today--when they have even heard \ntheir own President say otherwise several times, until recently, that \nyou should not increase taxes when you have a depression. These people \nfrequently ask, ``If our economy grew in the 1990s with higher marginal \ntax rates, how can it be bad to raise marginal taxes to these former \nlevels?'' Engrained in this argument is the assertion that tax hikes \ncan actually be good for our economy.\n  This assertion fails to take into account numerous economic factors \nthat occurred alongside the Clinton tax increases. The fact is that the \neconomy grew not because of the 1993 tax increases but despite them.\n  The economy of the mid-1990s is a result of economic conditions that \nwe may never see again. It was a time of great economic expansion due \nin large part to the advent of the Internet economy. The Internet \nspawned new technologies and created efficiencies in our economy that \nhave never been matched. In turn, these new technologies and \nefficiencies spurred startup businesses and new industries. Many seem \nto forget the huge Y2K fear that gripped the Nation, causing billions \nand billions in spending that helped prop up what became the infamous \nInternet bubble that blew up on all of us. Nevertheless, before the \nbubble burst these factors led to historically low unemployment and \nhigh workforce participation. Claiming that this was due to Clinton tax \nincreases is equal to Vice President Gore claiming that he invented the \nInternet.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be hard-pressed to \nfind many economic studies indicating tax increases are stimulative. \nThe focus of economic research in this area is not about whether tax \nincreases are harmful or beneficial to the economy. Rather, the focus \nseems to be on the degree to which tax increases are very harmful to \nthe economy. Admittedly, there are wide variations in views of \neconomists on the responsiveness of individuals and businesses to \ntaxes. However, even studies by economists who can hardly be labeled as \nconservative have concluded that tax increases have a significant \nnegative effect on the economy.\n  For instance, a 2007 study by Christina Romer, President Obama's \nformer chief economist, found ``tax increases are highly \ncontractionary,'' and ``have very large effects on output.''\n  In fact, this study found that a tax increase of 1 percent of gross \ndomestic product could lower real GDP by at least 3 percent.\n  Another likely contributor to the growth of the 1990s was a peace \ndividend we reaped from the end of the Cold War. We have Ronald \nReagan's staredown of the Soviet Union to thank for that phenomenon. \nThe end of the Cold War allowed for a reduction of government spending \nas a percent of GDP. Coupled with priorities pushed by the Republican-\nled Congress to reach a balanced budget and to reform welfare, spending \nas a percentage of GDP dropped to its lowest point in 30 years. With \nthe Government spending less of the people's money, more was left in \nthe hands of the private sector. This allowed the private sector to \ninnovate, to invest, and eventually create jobs. The peace dividend is \nalso the largest contributor to reining in deficits in the 1990s.\n\n  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from the \nreduction of defense spending. The next biggest source of deficit \nreduction, 32 percent, came from other revenue because of a growing \neconomy. Another 15 percent came from interest savings.\n  Let's get to the Clinton tax increase in reducing deficits. The \nClinton tax increase, on the other hand, only accounted for 13 percent \nof the deficit reduction--only 13 percent.\n  There are further factors that contributed to the economic growth of \nthe 1990s, including the expansion of free trade in the 1997 reduction \nin the capital gains tax rate. However, in the interest of time I am \ngoing to go on to other issues. One thing is clear, though, from this \nperiod of the 1990s. The economic growth of that time was not thanks to \nthe Clinton tax increase nor was it a major player in bringing our \ndeficit into balance.\n  Today we cannot rely on the unique economic conditions we experienced \nduring that decade of the 1990s, some of which were artificial, to \nbuttress the negative effects of the tax increase. In fact, we are in \nthe middle of one of the worst economic eras since the Great \nDepression. Unemployment has remained above 8 percent now for over 41 \nstraight months, almost 3\\1/2\\ years, in other words. Economic growth \nhas been anemic.\n  Each passing day economic indicators are pointing more and more to \nthe chance of a double-dip worldwide recession. Last Wednesday it was \nreported that Great Britain's economy contracted at the rate of .7 \npercent. Then on Friday it was reported that our own economy is \nstalling. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of just 1.5 percent, \ncontinuing its downward trend for three straight quarters. In a recent \nblog post, Nobel Laureate economist Gary Becker addressed the question \nof whether raising taxes on high-income earners is a very good idea. In \nhis post, Professor Becker entertained arguments--these were arguments \nby the supporters of the tax increases--by hypothesizing that there is \na 50-50 chance that higher taxes on the so-called rich would damage the \neconomy.\n  Of course I believe, as does Professor Becker, that in reality this \nchance is much higher than 50-50. However, even granting the other side \nthis generous assumption he concluded the benefit of raising taxes was \noutweighed by the potential damage they would cause. According to \nProfessor Becker, even if richer individuals only slightly reduce their \nwork hours and reduce their effort at work, the gain in tax revenue \nfrom these individuals would not be great. In contrast, ``the costs to \nthe economy in the chance that higher taxes greatly discourage their \nefforts is likely to be substantial in terms of fewer hours worked and \nless work effort by high-income individuals, reduced incentives to \nstart businesses,\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nless investment in their human capital, investing abroad rather than in \n[this country] . . . and even migration abroad.''\n  Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are pushing billions \nof dollars in tax increases. Last week they voted to increase taxes on \nnearly 1 million flowthrough businesses. Their vote to increase taxes \non job creators came on the heels of an Ernst and Young study detailing \nits ramifications. This study concluded that these proposed tax hikes--\non top of the 3.8-percent tax increase on dividends, interest, and \ncapital gains that was added to pay for the health care reform bill--\nwould reduce our economic output by 1.3 percent. The Ernst and Young \nstudy also found that real aftertax wages would fall by 1.8 percent as \na result of President Obama's policies.\n  Even in the face of this information, my colleagues on the other side \nseem all too willing to gamble with the chance that our stalling \neconomy can withstand such a hit. By doing this, they are playing \nRussian roulette with our economy.\n  To my colleagues I ask: How certain are you that tax increases on job \ncreators will not be damaging the economy? If you have any doubt, I \nsuggest don't pull the trigger.\n  I wish to shift gears a little bit to address the record of the 2001 \nand 2003 tax relief. Just as a perfect storm of good economic \nconditions blew at the back of the Clinton administration, a perfect \nstorm of bad economic conditions and unpredictable events blew in the \nface of the Bush administration.\n  It is undisputed that at the end of the Clinton administration, the \nCongressional Budget Office was projecting a 10-year budget surplus of \n$5.6 billion. Keep in mind, though, that CBO's projection was based on \nassumptions that did not pan out.\n  The CBO failed to predict the bursting of the tech bubble that was so \nbeneficial in the previous years. CBO also did not predict the \nSeptember 11, 2001 tragedy that wreaked havoc on our economy.\n  In reaction to the economic recession from these events, Congress \nenacted the bipartisan 2001 tax relief that cut tax rates across the \nboard, providing tax relief to virtually all taxpayers. Then in 2003, \nCongress expedited this relief so the benefit of lower rates would take \neffect more quickly. This resulted in one of the shortest and \nshallowest economic recessions yet on record. The economy grew for 25 \nstraight quarters, making it the fourth longest period of economic \nexpansion since 1930. Additionally, we had 47 straight months of \nprivate sector job gain.\n  Moreover, the expanding economy led to higher than expected revenues. \nThat is a fact. Revenue actually rose in the years following the tax \nrelief bill, peaking at 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, well above the \nhistorical average of around 18 percent.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects that if we extended \nall the 2001 and 2003 tax relief today, revenues would once again \nexceed the historical average. Under this scenario, the CBO projects \nthat by 2022 revenues will reach 18.5 percent of GDP.\n  From 2004 to 2007, the deficit also shrank from a high of $412 \nbillion to a low of $160 billion. That means the budget deficit was cut \nby more than half in 3 years. Given the trillion dollar deficits we are \nexperiencing under President Obama, a deficit below $200 billion would \nbe very welcome news. Yet CBO projects that even if all the tax \nincreases in President Obama's budget were enacted, deficits would \nnever drop below $500 billion in the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022.\n  I will give President Obama credit when he says he took office in \nvery tough economic times. The bursting of the housing bubble and the \nresulting financial crisis gave him a very high hill to climb, but any \nassertion the 2001 and 2003 tax relief is related to these events is \nwithout merit. There is plenty of blame to go around for the housing \nbubble. It was the culmination of housing policies spanning \nadministrations of both parties. It was further fueled by the Federal \nReserve providing historically low interest rates and cheap credit.\n  However, the President's policies have failed at getting us out of \nthis mess. The President's party passed the President's nearly $1 \ntrillion stimulus bill. He claimed this would keep the unemployment \nrate below 8 percent. However, the unemployment climbed to a high of \n10.1 percent and has never dropped below 8 percent during his almost 4 \nyears in office.\n  The President's party also passed the health care bill, which the \nPresident sold as a job creator, and the financial reform bill that was \nsupposed to fix our financial system. However, both of these bills, \nwhich the President signed, have actually turned out to be costly to \nour economy and a hindrance to job creation.\n  Now President Obama appears ready to gamble with the economy. He \nappears to go all in on raising taxes on our Nation's job creators. In \ndoing so, he is betting that raising taxes on the so-called wealthy \nwill result in a political payoff exceeding the chance his actions will \nthrow us back into recession. It is not so long ago that I remember the \nPresident saying what I have already referred to in this speech: ``You \ndon't raise taxes in a recession.'' The President's statement is as \ntrue now it was then.\n  Let's end the political theater of holding votes for the purpose of \ncampaign ads. Let's instead actually do what the people sent us here to \ndo. Let us not drive the American economy head long off the fiscal \ncliff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes on two subjects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I rise today to address the \nimportant legislation pending before this body, S. 3414, the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012. I followed this debate, and I want to \nparticularly compliment Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Feinstein, and folks such as Senator Kyl and \nSenator Whitehouse who have been trying to find some common ground in \nthis area. I hope at some point in the next day or so we will be able \nto proceed to this bill and have it fully debated.\n  Many Senators bring different levels of expertise to this issue. As \nsomeone who spent 20 years in the technology field and in telecom in \nparticular before entering government service, and has had the honor to \nserve for the last 3\\1/2\\ years on the Intelligence Committee, the \nCommerce Committee, and the Banking Committee, three of the committees \nthat all immediately intersect with the challenges around cyber, I can \nadd a bit of my perspective to this debate.\n  Let me start with concerns that have been raised by some of the \nopponents to this legislation. In the area around cyber, we need to \nmake sure we have appropriate information sharing. How do we set some \nstandards? Who should enforce those standards? I think most all of us, \nand anyone who has looked into this area, would recognize it is not a \nquestion of when we are going to have a major cyber attack or if we are \ngoing to have a cyber attack, it is only a question of when. We have \nalready--as has been reported in the press in a number of fashions--\nbeen attacked on a daily basis by foreign agents, criminal elements, \nhackers who are constantly probing our country's cyber defenses on the \npublic and private side. One of the reasons I think it is so important \nto move on this legislation soon is I have great fears that when we \nhave a major cyber element or cyber attack, Congress may, as they have \ndone so many times in the past, overreact because we didn't take action \non something we knew was imminent.\n\n  I do think this piece of legislation--and, candidly, I could have \nsupported an even stronger piece of legislation--is a great first step \nin this area. I am going to come back in a moment to some amendments I \nhope to offer to this legislation to deal with some of the concerns \nother Members and folks have raised on this issue.\n  Let's talk about why we need cyber legislation and why we need it \nnow. Inaction is not a solution. Every national security expert--not \njust from the current administration but previous administrations, and \nmost Members of Congress--agrees that the status quo is not \nsustainable. Over a 5-month period between October of 2011 and February \nof 2012, there were 50,000 cyber attacks\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\non private and government networks. We are told between 2009 and 2011 \nattacks on U.S. infrastructure increased by a factor of 17.\n  As more and more nations and rogue actors get more sophisticated with \ncomputer and technological knowledge, these numbers are going to grow \nexponentially. As the FBI has said, cyber espionage, computer crime, \nattacks on critical infrastructure will surpass terrorism as the No. 1 \nthreat facing the United States. Think how many things we have done \nappropriately in the previous administration and this administration in \nterms of homeland security to protect our Nation against the threat of \nterrorists. We now have the Director of the FBI saying the cyber threat \nwill soon surpass terrorism in terms of a threat to our Nation.\n  I know as a former businessman that we are already seeing \nmanifestations of this threat in other areas. Intellectual property \ntheft is one of the most insidious threats we face right now. A former \nFBI agent who specialized in counterintelligence and computer intrusion \nhas said that in most cases companies don't realize they have been \nburned until years later when a foreign competitor puts out the very \nsame product, only making it 30 percent cheaper. We have lost our \nmanufacturing base in many ways. By not putting appropriate cyber \nprotections in place, are we really prepared to lose our R base as \nwell?\n  Some say cyber is different. Cyber is different in certain ways, but \nin many ways it is similar. Just as we would never have a nuclear \nfacility without guards and a wall and a fence or--I see my good \nfriend, the Senator from Louisiana--we would never have power \nfacilities or levees without appropriate protections, how is it we \nwould not have some level of standards and information sharing of \nthreats that are coming in amongst not only our public sector entities \nbut our private sector entities as well?\n  As a matter of fact, as a former businessman, I have been surprised \nat some of the resistance from some business organizations that are \nsaying this requirement of both information sharing and some minimum \nstandards would actually be a burden on us. In many ways I actually \nthink somewhat the opposite because there are a number of businesses \nright now that have taken the responsible step and put in place \nsignificant cyber protections while competitors in their industry, \nbecause they are not putting those same protections in place, are \nactually free riders on the system. Yet, not if but when we have a \nmajor cyber event, if one of those companies that has not put \nappropriate protections in place ends up causing dramatic harm to our \neconomy or to that industry sector, all the industries and all the \nbusinesses in that sector will in one way or another end up paying the \nprice. Again, this is one of the reasons why we need both this \ninformation sharing and some level of standards.\n  I know to try to move forward in terms of actual or mandatory \nstandards, we are not going to have them at this point. We have set up \na measure--and again, I commend Senator Kyl and Senator Whitehouse for \nworking through what I think is a pretty darn good compromise where \nthere would be an industry group that would develop, in effect, best \npractices. It is hard with the government and bureaucracy moving so \nslowly to keep up with something like technology that would allow an \nindustry group to come up with, in effect, best practices. Those \ncompanies that adhere to those best practices would actually receive \nlegal and other protections so we could encourage folks to make sure we \nhave in place the kind of protections that all industries and our \ncountry need.\n  To make clear that we don't have mandatory standards, we have put in \nplace--I have been working with Senator Snowe on a couple of \namendments. I believe there are other Members who will join us on at \nleast one of these amendments. The first amendment is very important \nand hopefully will go some distance in terms of clarifying one of the \nissues that seems to be a major subject of debate in this legislation, \nand that is to modify--again working with the chairs of the committee, \nwe may even move beyond this modification to elimination--a key section \nof the bill, section 103. It will make clear that the standards set by \nthis bill, the protection of infrastructure, are indeed voluntary. This \namendment makes it clear that this bill does not in any way alter the \nauthority of any Federal agency to regulate the security of critical \ninfrastructure. Again, there were some concerns that there might have \nbeen a mistake in the earlier draft. This amendment makes clear that \nthe standards that are developed by industry working groups will be \nvoluntary and that nothing in this legislation will allow any Federal \nagency to regulate the security of critical infrastructure.\n\n  I believe this amendment should alleviate the concerns of some that \nthe bill might put in place mandatory standards for infrastructure \nprotection--again, despite the very clear language that already exists \nin the bill that standards are voluntary. It is my understanding this \namendment will be considered as part of a broader set of solutions \nnegotiated by Senator Lieberman, and whether our amendment comes \nforward or whether it is broadened into a managers' package, I hope it \nwill clarify this portion of the debate about mandatory versus \nvoluntary.\n  Voluntary is a good first step. The fact that this will be developed \nby industry working groups, the fact that this will not be subject to \nthe lagging time of government bureaucracy or rulemaking, hopefully, \nwill move us in the right direction.\n  A second amendment, again, one I have been working on with Senator \nSnowe, is a bit more technical, and particularly as to my colleagues on \nthe Commerce Committee, I hope we will be able to gain some support \nfrom them. This amendment seeks to ensure that the authority provided \nto DHS to sole-source highly specialized products will result in the \nprocurement of interoperable, standards-based products and services \nwhenever possible.\n  What does that mean in English? It means when government goes out, \nand particularly during sole-sourcing of a solution set, too often--and \nI have seen this in my old industry of telecom years in and years out--\npeople will develop a particular product or solution that works for \nthat company's only set of standards, and when the government \nsubsequently or other private sector entities go on and buy or replace \nor expand whatever particular system it is, if it is not interoperable \nwith the rest of the telecommunications system or the rest of the \nnetwork, then we are really not getting value for our dollar.\n  Again, this is a small issue in the context of cyber security, but \nboth Senator Snowe and I believe it is important for the purpose of \ncompetition, and it should lower the overall cost of key technologies \nand services for the taxpayer.\n  So as I close on my first comments, I hope we will be able to move \nforward before the break on the question of cyber security. I think \ngreat progress has been made in the negotiations. I know there are a \nlot of issues that remain to be resolved, but I would reinforce what so \nmany other colleagues have already said. It is not a question of if we \nare hit by a cyber attack, it is only a question of when in terms of a \nmajor incident. Let's get ahead of the game.\n\n\n                      Tribute To Federal Employees\n\n                            Diane Braunstein\n\n  Let me take two more moments and rise on one other issue. As many of \nmy colleagues and the floor staff know, I come down on a fairly regular \nbasis to honor great Federal employees. With all of the challenges we \nface with the fiscal cliff--I see my good friend and partner here, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and both he and I are always trying to look for \nways we can get better value for the taxpayer. One of the things we \nneed to do is find ways to reward and recognize the good work of so \nmany Federal employees who share that goal of getting better value for \nthe taxpayer. I know the Senator from Oklahoma has particularly worked \nwith the GAO on a number of occasions to find and root out duplication \nand other issues of where we can save dollars.\n  I come down on a regular basis to recognize Federal employees--\nbecause so many times they are under assault--when they do good things. \nToday I do that one more time, with recognition of another great \nFederal employee, in this case Diane Braunstein, who is the Associate \nCommissioner for the Office of International Programs for the Social \nSecurity Administration. She has\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\noverseen the creation of the Compassionate Allowance Program, which has \nallowed thousands of seriously ill Americans to gain quick approval for \nmuch needed Social Security benefits in a matter of days or weeks \nrather than months or years; although in this area of Social Security \ndisability we need to make sure only the appropriate beneficiaries are \nreceiving those funds.\n  For years, the Social Security Disability Insurance Program has faced \nbacklogs and delays in processing claims. In 2011 there were on average \n700,000 pending cases. We need to do a better job of evaluating and \nweeding out some of those cases. Couple this with what used to be a \nlack of caseworker knowledge on rare illnesses, and the result was a \nnumber of applications with rare illnesses being incorrectly denied \nFederal benefits. They then had to face an appeals process which took \nyears to complete.\n  Beginning in 2008, Ms. Braunstein partnered with patient advocacy \ngroups and NIH to come up with a list of 25 cancers and 25 rare \ndiseases that would automatically qualify an applicant to receive \nbenefits. To further improve the speed and efficiency and cost \neffectiveness of this process, an easy-to-use reference guide and \ntraining program was put together to aid caseworkers.\n  According to Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue, when Ms. \nBraunstein began work on the compassionate allowances, some Americans \nwere waiting 2 to 4 years for a decision. Now those with the most \ndevastating disabilities get approved for benefits in a matter of days. \nIn 2010, the program was able to assist an estimated 45,000 people, and \n65,000 people in 2011.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Ms. Braunstein for her \ninnovation and excellent work she has done as well as her commitment to \npublic service.\n  Again, we have some hard choices to make beyond the question of cyber \nsecurity, but as we approach this fiscal cliff there will be more asked \nof all Americans and there will be more asked of our Federal employees. \nWe will have to continue to find ways to ratchet out those programs \nthat are duplicative, those areas where we are not getting value for \nour dollar.\n  Again, I know this is an issue of concern to the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from Oklahoma. But when we find initiatives \nthat work, and we find Federal employees who are helping us provide \nvalue, particularly for those in need at a good price, they deserve \nthis recognition.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, first, before I begin the topic I wish \nto speak about, I thank Mr. Warner, the Senator from Virginia, for his \nleadership. He has many Federal employees, many defense contractors in \nVirginia. He, as a Senator from Virginia, recognizes the great threat \nto our Nation today in cyber security. The Senator knows very well that \nthere are literally thousands of attacks taking place as we speak. That \nis why as we get ready to go back to our States for the August recess \nand visit with constituents, we are pressing very hard for a positive \nvote to move forward on the debate to fashion a cyber security bill for \nour Nation. So I thank the Senator for his leadership and, of course, \nthe tremendous Federal employees who do get beat up all the time but, \nin fact, do remarkable work for our Nation and for the world.\n  So I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Senator Landrieu pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3472 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank Senator Coburn for letting me speak in advance \nof his time on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                             Army Weaponry\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is pretty unusual for me to come to the \nfloor to say I want to spend money. But I have had a longstanding \nproblem as I sign the letters of condolences to hundreds of families in \nOklahoma who have lost their loved one by serving this country.\n  I come to the floor to offer a critique on one of the most important \nthings to the people who truly put their lives on the line for this \ncountry. It is a national security issue, but it is truly about our men \nand women in uniform and the most important deployed weapon system over \nthe last 10 years of war; that is, the Army service rifle and their \nother small arms.\n  There is nothing more important to a soldier than his rifle or her \nrifle. There is simply no excuse for not providing our soldiers with \nthe best weapon, not just a weapon that is ``good enough.''\n  As I go through this, I am going to give a history of what the \nmilitary has done--or, rather, basically what they have not done--in \nterms of having available for our soldiers a weapon that is capable of \ngiving them the best possible chance when they serve our country.\n  Over the last few years, we have spent $8,000 per soldier on new \nradios, but we still are using a weapon that is 25 years old when it \ncomes to their M4.\n  I first got involved in this when I got e-mails. I gave many in the \nOklahoma National Guard--who served multiple tours, with lots of life \nlost in Iraq and Afghanistan--I gave those soldiers my personal e-mail, \nand I said: If you are having a problem over there, e-mail me.\n  I started hearing about the malfunction, the lack of effectiveness of \nthe M4 for the Oklahomans who were over there. It is the same weapon \nthe career Army has. It is the same weapon everybody who is issued a \nstandard rifle is given, except for our special forces and others in \nthe world who have a better rifle than the U.S. soldier on the ground \nfighting on our behalf.\n  I have noted before in the Congressional Record that I have lifted my \nobjection to the nomination of Ms. Heidi Shyu to be the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Acquisitions. It is an important position. \nShe is in charge of $28 billion worth of expenditures. My objection was \ndue to the Army's continued lack of urgency in modernizing and fielding \nnew rifles, carbines, pistols, light machine guns, and ammunition for \nour troops in combat. Ms. Shyu has been very responsive to me and has \nprovided some information regarding the Army's future plans for small \narms and ammunition.\n  So when I started getting the questions from our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, I started looking into what was happening. Most of our \nsoldiers know exactly what to do and how to care for their rifle. They \nknow how to take care of it. So we looked into the issue. What we found \nwas that there were several studies that raised questions about the \nreliability of the M4 rifle and whether there was a better weapon out \nthere for our troops.\n  For example, a special operations forces report in February 2001 said \nthe M4's short barrel and gas tube increased the risk that a round \nmight not eject from the rifle properly after it is fired. In other \nwords, they fire it and the round does not come out. That is called a \njam--when you are having bullets coming at you and your rifle is \njamming.\n  What we did was we set up a test, and the Army would not do it. So I \nput a hold on the Secretary of the Army Pete Geren's nomination. We \ntalked, and he assured me we would have a new competition for a new \nrifle for our troops. That was in 2007.\n  Here we are, 5 years later, and the Army is now telling us we are \ngoing to complete a new competition in 2014. But in the meantime, we \nhad a test done against our soldiers' rifle and others available in the \nworld, in terms of a dust test, and we came in last.\n  So we are sending our troops to defend us and fight for a cause that \nwe have put blood, sweat, tears, and $1 trillion into, and we are \nsending them with one that does not work the best.\n  My question to the Army is, Why? I can tell you why. Because the guys \nwho are responsible for making the decision on purchasing the rifles \nare not the guys who are out there on the line. Because if they were, \nwe would have already had this competition and our service men and \nwomen would be getting new rifles.\n  It is not that we cannot do it because what we learned--as we went \nback in\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nand reupped in Afghanistan--we determined that the MRAP was not \nsuitable for the rocky terrain as compared to what we used it for in \nIraq.\n  In less than 16 months and after rapid testing and fielding, new MRAP \nAll-Terrain Vehicles--that was designed specifically for Afghanistan; a \ncomplicated piece of vital equipment, costing $\\1/2\\ million each--\nstarted arriving in Afghanistan.\n  So it is not that we cannot supply our soldiers with a new rifle. It \nis not that it cannot be done. It is that we refuse to do it.\n  For $1,500, we can give every person on the line something equivalent \nto what our special forces have today.\n  Let me show some history.\n  The average age of our troops rifle is 26 years. The average age of \nthe German military rifle, small arms, is 12 years. For the U.S. \nspecial operations forces, theirs is 8 years. Guess what. They have new \ntechnology. Our regular frontline guys, they do not get it. They cannot \nhave it. It costs the same, but they cannot have it because it is not a \npriority for the leadership in the Army to give the most deployed piece \nof equipment our troops need--that defends them, protects them, and \ngives them the ability to come home alive--we will not give it to them. \nIt is shameful. It is shameful.\n\n  Let me give a history of what happened just once in Afghanistan.\n  It was called the battle of Wanat. On July 13, 2008, in the battle of \nWanat, in Afghanistan, 200 Taliban troops attacked U.S. troops at a \nremote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban were able to break \nthrough our lines and entered the main base before eventually being \nrepelled by artillery and aircraft.\n  What is notable about the battle was the perceived performance of the \nsoldiers' small arms weapons in the initial part of the battle.\n  Here are some quotes:\n\n       My M4 quit firing and would no longer charge when I tried \n     to correct the malfunction.\n       I couldn't charge my weapon and put another round in \n     because it was too hot, so I got mad I threw my weapon down.\n\n  It would be bad enough if this was the first time it happened. But it \nis not the first time it has happened. It has happened multiple times \nto our troops in our present conflicts.\n  All we have to do is go back to what happened with the M16 when they \nwere first used in Vietnam. There were instant reports of jamming and \nmalfunctions. One tragic but indicative marine action report read:\n\n       We left with 72 men in our platoon and came back with 19. \n     Believe it or not, you know what killed most of us? Our own \n     rifle. Practically every one of our dead was found with his \n     M16 torn down next to him where he had been trying to fix it.\n\n  That is occurring now, except it is not getting any press. Again, I \nwould ask my colleagues in the Senate: Why would we not give our \nsoldiers the capability that almost every other soldier has except \nours?\n  There is another aspect of this that I think needs to be shared; that \nis, the fact that it is all about acquisitions and culture rather than \nabout doing the right thing. I do not like giving this talk critical of \nthe leadership of the Army. But when it is going to take 7 years to \nfield a new rifle and in 18 months we can build and design a completely \nnew $500,000 piece of equipment, an MRAP, for Afghanistan or when we \ncan spend $8,000 per troop to give them a new radio--which are all \ngoing to be replaced in the next 2 years with another $8,000--and we \ncannot give them a $1,500 H or something equivalent, there is \nsomething wrong with our system. Our priorities are out of whack.\n  If the Department of Defense had spent just 15 percent less on \nradios, they could give every soldier in the military a new, capable, \nmodern weapon, and it does not just apply to their rifle.\n  One of the biggest complaints, after the M4, is the fact that the \nregular Army gets a 9-millimeter pistol that weighs over 2 pounds, but \nour special operations forces get a .45-caliber pistol that weighs less \nthan 1\\1/2\\ pounds. That is a big difference when you are out there all \nday. But the most important thing is, a .45-caliber round is twice the \nsize of a 9-millimeter round, so when you are shooting it and you hit \nsomebody, it is going to take them down. A 9-millimeter does not. So we \nare giving them an inferior pistol throughout the military.\n  Then, finally, here is what an M4 carbine looks like compared to an \nHK416, as shown on this chart. One other point I would make. This piece \nof equipment fires on automatic. This other piece of equipment--because \nthe military wants to save some bullets--will not fire on automatic. So \nour soldiers are facing people who have automatic fire and they can \nfire in bursts of three and at half the rate of what they are facing.\n  Why would we do that? The real question is, we are asking people to \ndefend this country. For essentially the same amount of money, we can \nbuy an old-style, 26-year-old M4 or we can buy a brandnew one that \ngives them everything they need and gives them the best weapon. Do they \nnot deserve that?\n  A lot of people do a lot of things for our country. But nobody does \nfor our country what the soldier on the frontline does--nobody. This is \na moral question, Mr. Secretary of the Army. This is a moral question. \nGet the rifle competition going.\n  Members of Congress, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ndo not allow this to continue to happen. Do not allow this to continue \nto happen. There is no excuse for it. We should be embarrassed. We \nshould be ashamed. Because what we are doing is sending our troops into \nharm's way with less than the best that we can provide for them.\n  As I have noted, I have lifted my objection to the nomination of Ms. \nHeidi Shyu to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisitions. \nThis is an extremely important position for an organization as large as \nthe U.S. Army which spends $28 billion per year on acquisition of goods \nand services. My objection was due to the Army's continued lack of \nurgency in modernizing and fielding new rifles, carbines, pistols, \nlight machine guns, and ammunition to our troops in combat. Ms. Shyu \nhas been responsive to me and provided some information regarding the \nArmy's future plans for small arms and ammunition.\n  I first got involved in the Army small arms issue 6 years ago when \nOklahoma National Guard soldiers told me that their issued weapon, the \nM4 carbine, was jamming in Iraq. These soldiers were told by their \nsuperiors that jamming resulted from poor weapons maintenance on their \npart and not from any fault of the rifle. While cleaning and proper \nmaintenance of a weapon are extremely important, sand and dust in Iraq \nare a daily occurrence and any small arms weapon our troops use there \nshould be able to fire reliably in spite of some sand and dust.\n  Also, the National Guard soldiers from my State--as is the case for \nGuard soldiers from many if not all of our States--are somewhat more \nlikely to hunt or serve as police officers or security guards in their \ncivilian lives. In other words, National Guard soldiers in the infantry \ngenerally know better than most how to care for rifles. So my staff \nlooked into this issue and found that there were studies that raise \nquestions on the reliability of the M4 and whether there was a better \nweapon out there for our troops. For example, a special operations \nforces report in February 2001 said that the M4's short barrel and gas \ntube increased risk that round might not eject from the rifle properly \nafter firing.\n  I also learned that in the early 1990s Colt received funding from the \nArmy to produce the M4 carbine, which would be a shorter variant on the \nM16 rifle. This was not done through a competition and was considered \nmerely an extension of Colt's original M16 contract.\n  This lack of competition would later greatly benefit Colt. In 1999 \nColt charged the military less than $600 per M4 carbine. This would \nrise to more than $900 in 2002 and more than $1,200 for a fully \nequipped carbine in 2010 when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted \nin more M4s being bought.\n  So in 2007 I raised these questions and even put a hold on the \nnomination of Secretary of the Army Pete Geren. To his credit, he \nordered a full and open competition for a new carbine rifle no later \nthan the end of 2009.\n  It is now 2012 and the Army still has not completed a competition for \na new carbine rifle, now scheduled for 2014. The window for the regular \nArmy soldiers to battlefield test an improved rifle in a war we have \nbeen in for 12 years is rapidly closing. This extended and lengthy \nprocess is for a weapon\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nsystem that--while vital--costs less than $2,000 each.\n  This 7-year effort differs greatly from their effort to field new \narmored combat vehicles in Afghanistan. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, in 2008 Army leaders determined that the Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, vehicle was not suitable for the \nrocky terrain of Afghanistan. In less than 16 months and after rapid \ntesting and fielding, new MRAP all-terrain vehicles, M-ATV, a \ncomplicated piece of vital equipment costing $500,000 each--started \narriving in Afghanistan.\n  In contrast, according to the Government Accountability Office, the \nDepartment of Defense spent more than $11 billion buying newer models \nof existing legacy radios from 2003 to 2011 and is currently planning \non spending billions more on even newer radios to replace the ones just \npurchased for Iraq and Afghanistan. There are only 1.4 million troops \non active duty so the Department of Defense has spent nearly $8,000 per \ntroop on new radios. A brand new rifle--that soldiers don't have--costs \naround $1,000 to $1,500.\n  If the Department of Defense had just spent 15 percent less on the \nbillions and billions they spent on newer models of legacy radios in \nthe last 10 years, every soldier in the Army could have had a brandnew \ncarbine rifle going to war.\n  In addition to the rifle, there remains a great need for improvement \nof the Army's service pistol. This pistol, usually given to officers \nbut also as an additional weapon to some infantry soldiers, is the M9 \nBeretta. This pistol entered the Army in 1985, 27 years ago, and fires \na 9mm round. The M9 pistol had the lowest satisfaction rate of any \nweapon surveyed by the military in 2006 on troops returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan with half feeling that the 9mm ammunition is \ninsufficient.\n  Is the Army's failure to modernize its rifles, pistols and machine \nguns a recent occurrence? Sadly no, the Army's reluctance to field new \nweapons runs throughout its history. In far too many instances U.S. \nArmy troops have entered battle with an inferior weapon to their \nadversaries and either during or after the war ended the Army was \nreluctant to change and adapt to the superior weapons.\n  In 1776 colonial forces faced the British at the Battle of Brandywine \nwhere the British used a new breech loading weapon that loaded at the \nrear of the weapon rather than the muzzle or front of the weapon. As a \nresult trained British soldiers could fire more than twice as fast as \ntrained colonial American soldiers. The breech loading weapon was not \nused much in the Revolutionary War but where it was used, such as at \nthe Battle of Brandywine, it was described as acting magnificently: 93 \nBritish killed and 400 wounded compared to over 300 Americans that \ndied, 600 wounded, and 400 prisoners captured.\n  However when Americans again fought the British in the War of 1812--\n36 years later--the Americans were still using the same muzzle loading \nweapon they fought with during the Battle of Brandywine.\n  U.S. Army troops at war against Mexico in 1845 did not have breech \nloading rifles, but rather continued to carry muzzle-loading rifles \nwhen fighting against Mexico--nearly 80 years after the breech-loading \nrifle was invented.\n  During the Civil War one Union officer in particular was unsatisfied \nwith the Army's standard muzzle-loaded rifle and decided to do \nsomething about it. Colonel Wilder, commander of the Union's \n``Lightning Brigade'' decided to go around the Army bureaucracy. His \nmen spent $35 out of their paychecks to buy Spencer Repeating Rifles \ndirect from the factory for his mounted cavalry. In one of the first \nbattles using this new rifle Wilder's ``Lightning Brigade'' of 1,000 \nsoldiers defended the Union flank against over 8,000 Confederate troops \nthat could not pass. At one point one company of Colonel Wilder's men \nheld off ten times as many Confederate troops using their repeating \nrifles for 5 hours.\n  However, the Army did not widely adopt the repeating rifle after the \nCivil War. More than 30 years later in the Spanish-American War, 5,000 \nAmerican soldiers armed with single shot rifles attacked fewer than \n1,000 Spanish soldiers armed with a German `Mauser' repeating rifle. \nWhile Americans won the battle by attrition (there were 10,000 U.S. \ntroops in reserve), the U.S. Army suffered over 1,400 casualties, with \n205 killed, while the Spanish lost fewer than 250, with 58 killed, \nbefore surrendering.\n  A telling American newspaper column title from 1898 aptly summarizes \nthe problems: ``The [U.S. Army] Gun: It is Inferior in Many Respects to \nthe Mauser [rifle] used by the Spaniards.'' The article states \nunequivocally that the ``enemy's [Spain's] weapon is easier to load \n[and] can be fired more rapidly''.\n  The 20th Century would see a great deal of further modernization, \nimprovement, and innovation in the area of small arms to include \nlighter fully automatic assault rifles capable of firing at a rate of \nmore than 10 rounds per second rather than per minute.\n  The United States entered World War I with a Springfield 1903 rifle, \nnamed for the Armory and the year it was produced, which was possibly \nthe third best rifle in the world at that time. The British Enfield-Lee \nrifle held ten rounds instead of 5 and could fire upwards of 20 rounds \nper minute. The American rifle held only 5 rounds and fired 10 rounds \nper minute which was similar, but still inferior to the German rifle \nthat was capable of firing more rounds per minute.\n  The U.S. Army did enter World War II with one of the last great \nbattle rifles, the M1 Garand, but its success during that conflict may \nhave blinded the Army to a revolutionary development in small arms: the \ninvention of the modern lightweight fully-automatic assault rifle. From \n1942 to 1944 Germany invented the world's first assault rifles--rifles \nthat could fire 550 to 600 rounds per minute and held detachable 30 \nround magazines. However, it would be over two decades later before \nU.S. Army soldiers were permitted to have lightweight assault rifles.\n  Shortly after World War II ended the Soviet Union invented the AK-47 \nfully automatic assault rifle. This rifle's success is easily stated: \nover 90 million AK-47s or derivatives have been built. It is very \nlikely a weapon that has inflicted more casualties than any other \nweapon on earth. Soviet troops had this rifle nearly 20 years before \nthe United States Army would issue assault rifles to its soldiers.\n  In 1958, an American inventor named Eugene Stoner developed the AR-15 \nrifle in less than 9 months, which would eventually become the M16. \nThis revolutionary rifle weighed six pounds and fired at a rate between \n700 and 900 shots per minute with little recoil and the lightweight but \nstill deadly 5.56mm ammunition meant soldiers could carry more \nfirepower than before.\n  However, it took the then-Chief of Staff of the Air Force General \nCurtis LeMay to purchase 85,000 of them for use by Air Force base \ndefense airmen before they got into the military at all. The U.S. Army \nwas strongly opposed to the M16. Some of these weapons were used by \nSpecial Forces troops serving as advisers in Vietnam, increasing the \npressure for the Army to adopt it. The Army initially refused the AR-\n15s stating the ``lack of any military requirement.''\n  At this point, it should be clarified that the Army has used the \nphrase ``lack of a requirement'' for more than 50 years to justify \nslowing down and not innovating in the area of small arms. I first \nencountered the phrase ``lack of a requirement'' in 2006 when asking \nwhy the Army couldn't field a better carbine rifle that didn't jam in \nthe desert. I am hearing the same phrase today when I ask why soldiers \ncan't have a better light machine gun or pistol. Soldiers have \ncomplained about these weapons but they can't have a new one because \nthere is no ``military requirement.'' Congress is often frustrated by \nthe term ``military requirement'' because it can be used to deflect \nresponsibility from the person using it. It says the Army is fearful of \noffering its judgment on whether or not someone made a weapon that is \nbetter than what the Army has, so it instead says that the weapon is \nnot needed.\n  It took intervention by President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense \nMcNamara to order the Army to adopt the M16 rifle--the military version \nof the AR-15. Then what happened in Vietnam was a tragic occurrence \nthat took the direct involvement and investigation of Congress and \ndeaths of thousands of soldiers to remedy.\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n  When the M16s were first used in Vietnam there were nearly instant \nreports of jamming and malfunctions. One tragic but indicative Marine \nafter-action report read:\n\n       We left with 72 men in our platoon and came back with 19. \n     Believe it or not, you know what killed most of us? Our own \n     rifle. Practically every one of our dead was found with his \n     M16 torn down next to him where he had been trying to fix it.\n\n  Before the necessary fixes could be made to the weapon which included \nswitching back to the original type of ammunition propellant and \nissuing cleaning supplies in early 1967, nearly ten thousand American \nsoldiers had been killed. Before the Army made the changes these \nsoldiers were told--much as soldiers are told today--that problems with \ntheir weapons are their fault: a lack of care and cleaning or operator \nerror. There is no formal process where soldiers are required to \nprovide feedback to Army leadership on a jammed weapon in order to \naccurately note issues with reliability.\n  There were six warnings from various arsenals and offices within the \nDepartment of Defense as to the problems with the M16. However, the \nArmy Materiel Command and Army senior leaders would not listen. It took \npublic pressure and a massive congressional investigation by the House \nArmed Services Committee to get to the bottom of the problems with the \nArmy's small arms in Vietnam. It was discovered that the Army was using \na different ammunition propellant--procured from a sole-source \ncontract--that caused the M16 to jam. After Congressional intervention, \nthe original propellant was used and the problems with the M16 nearly \ndisappeared. After Vietnam, the Army formally adopted the M16 as its \nservice rifle and by 1968 nearly all troops surveyed said they \npreferred the M16 to any other rifle.\n  The post-Vietnam era saw changes for the M16 weapon, few of them \npositive. In 1980 the Army adopted a different, heavier 5.56mm round \nthat required different rifling for the caliber which marginally \nimproved penetration of armor and helmets but at the cost of greatly \nreducing.\n  U.S. troops would find out in Iraq and Afghanistan that the enemy did \nnot wear helmets or armor. As a result the rounds would penetrate \nthrough the enemy and exit the other side without causing enough damage \nto incapacitate him and he kept fighting. Soldiers have regularly \nreported having to fire multiple rounds into enemy combatants in Iraq \nand Afghanistan as a result.\n  In 1982 the Army also altered the M16 to prohibit soldiers from \nfiring on full automatic. The current M16A2 rifle has a choice between \nsemiautomatic and three-round burst. The M16A2 is now the only major \nassault rifle in the world fielded for military use that does have a \nfull automatic capability.\n  As I said the problems we see with small arms procurement may not be \nsinister, but they are serious and they are current.\n  On July 13, 2008 in the Battle of Wanat in Afghanistan around 200 \nTaliban attacked U.S. troops at a remote outpost in eastern \nAfghanistan. The Taliban were able to break through U.S. lines and \nenter the main base before eventually being repelled by artillery and \naircraft. What is notable about the battle was the perceived poor \nperformance of the soldiers' small arms weapons in the initial part of \nthe battle. Some selected quotes from the report:\n\n       My M4 quit firing and would no longer charge when I tried \n     to correct the malfunction,\n       I couldn't charge my weapon and put another round in \n     because it was too hot, so I got mad and threw my weapon \n     down.\n\n  Nine soldiers died and twenty-seven were wounded at the Battle of \nWanat in Afghanistan.\n  For too much of its history from the Revolutionary War to today the \nArmy has shown a slowness and reluctance to adopt improved small arms \nweapons and ammunition developed by others. It has also been slow to \nrecognize and fix problems with its small arms. The Army has repeatedly \nengaged in poor negotiating and contracting on behalf of the American \npeople. Senior Army leaders continue to go work for incumbent small \narms manufacturers after they retire.\n  However, a major problem is also Congress. There have been far too \nfew hearings and oversight on the topic of small arms. The House Armed \nServices Committee report in 1967 stands out as an exception that \nproves this point. Senior military leaders in uniform and civilians are \nregularly challenged and questioned--and in some cases chewed out--on \nall manner of programs and weapon systems here by Members of Congress \nincluding medical benefits, stealth fighter jets, missile defense, the \nsize of the Army and Navy, and armored vehicles.\n  However, for some reason Congress, for the most part, has seen fit to \ngive the Army a pass on small arms. For some reason the oversight \ncommittees responsible do not aggressively and regularly question \nwhether the Army's rifle--the most deployed weapon system for the last \nten years--is the best that American industry can offer our troops. \nThere are many small arms experts that are independent of the industry \nthat can inform Congress on this issue. I call on my colleagues to hold \nlong overdue hearings on this topic with independent witnesses as soon \nas possible and will continue my efforts on this issue to raise \nawareness and push the Army to procure the best weapons and ammunition \nfor our troops.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Drought\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Back home in Kansas, we are spending our time down on our \nknees and then looking up to the sky. We are praying and hoping for \nrain. Our State, along with much of the country, is in a very serious \ndrought. Crops are dying. Cattle are hungry and are being sold off and \nwater is in scarce supply.\n  Every county in Kansas, all 105, have now been declared disaster \ncommunities. Half of the continental United States is in the worst \ndrought since 1956, and the situation is expected only to get worse. In \nthis photograph, my friend Ken Grecian from Palco, KS--it is a little \ntown in northwest Kansas--is pictured here with dry grass and hungry \ncattle. Over the past few weeks, Ken has had to reduce his herd at \nlower prices than before because there is not enough feed to feed the \ncattle. Ken is similar to many producers who have been diligently \nbuilding their herds of cattle over many years and are now seeing those \ncattle sold due to the drought, undermining their efforts, year after \nyear, to develop a herd.\n  Paul and Tommie Westfahl from Haven, KS, just a little bit north and \nwest of Wichita, and their two daughters Jenna and Raegan are pictured \nstanding next to their failed crops. South central Kansas has been hard \nhit this year by the drought. The corn on the right never got above \nchest high and dried up months before it was time to harvest.\n  Paul swathed and will soon bale his failed beans on the left of the \nphoto and try to save some of that for feed for cattle this winter. \nHard times are there and they are not over.\n  The United States has a long history of drought and recovery. From \nthe Dust Bowl to today, we have faced periods of drought. The thirties \nwere often called the worst of hard times. Don Hartwell, a farmer on \nthe Kansas and Nebraska border, captured how hard it was when he wrote \nthis in his diary on May 21, 1936:\n\n       15 years ago, the Republican River bottom was a vast \n     expanse of alfa and corn fields. Now, it is practically a \n     desert of wasted, shifting sand, washed-out ditches, cockle \n     burs, and devastation. I doubt very much if it ever can be \n     reclaimed.\n\n  A few weeks later he wrote in his diary, ``I wonder where we will be \na\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nyear from now?'' In the 1930s, folks were faced with severe drought \nwhich resulted in the Dust Bowl. People were forced to abandon their \nfarms and ranches and give up the only way of life they knew. Crops, \nlivestock, and livelihoods vanished with the dust. They were \nunimaginable times. Thankfully, those unimaginable times passed and the \nrains came and the Republican River bottom was reclaimed.\n  This happened with the help of the good Lord and by individual \nefforts by those who refused to give in to those bad times, to give in \nto nature. If we look at the drought now and compare it to that of the \n1930s, we will notice a huge difference. There is no Dust Bowl. The \nprograms and conservation management tools that were used have worked. \nThe forward-thinking American farmers and ranchers, the landowners who \nadopted new land and livestock management practices have made \nconservation the most effective drought mitigation effort available \ntoday.\n  But conservation programs are in danger. While many conservation \npractices can be planned and executed by individual farmers and \nranchers, certain programs administered by the Department of \nAgriculture deserve our attention so these important initiatives do not \nexpire on September 30. In just about 60 days, farm programs will \nexpire, and that means more uncertainty, compounding an already \ndisastrous drought situation.\n  Right now, farmers and ranchers are wondering the same thing Don \nHartwell wondered in 1936: Where am I going to be 1 year from now? As \nCongress debates the future of domestic agricultural policy, it is \ncritical risk mitigation tools are included for farmers and ranchers. \nMost important among these tools is crop insurance. With the absence of \ndirect payments in both the House and Senate versions of a new farm \nbill, crop insurance is and will remain the last protective tool \navailable to those producers.\n  Viable crop insurance ensures that a farm operation can survive \ndifficult times, when there is drought or hail or flood, in hopes that \nthey can experience a successful yield the following year. Farmers \nalways have hope: Tough times now? Come back next year. But crop \ninsurance, as valuable as it is, does not cover all the problems \nagriculture producers face, and particularly livestock producers are \nnot usually generally eligible for crop insurance coverage.\n  These producers require risk mitigation and a safety net just like \nproducers covered by crop insurance. Disaster programs for livestock, \nalong with crop insurance for cultivation agriculture, give producers \nthe security they need to plan and invest for the future.\n  Currently, ranchers and cattlemen are left with few disaster \nprograms. The 2008 farm bill disaster farm programs expired this year, \nleaving producers across our drought-stricken country with less \nprotection from Mother Nature. These programs are an important safety \nnet for farmers and ranchers. Farmers and ranchers such as Ken and Paul \ndeserve to know what the future of these programs will be.\n  We should not expect producers to plant crops or to buy and sell \nlivestock if they do not know what the rules are. Putting these \nprograms back in place and ensuring a sound safety net is vital for \ndrought recovery, continued conservation work, and for the affordable \nfood supply for the people of our country. Kansas farmers and ranchers \nshould not have to keep guessing. It is too important to their \nfamilies, their industry, and their Nation for more delay.\n  We must give agricultural producers the long-term certainty and \nsupport they deserve. While we wait for Washington, we will continue to \nhope and pray.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a number of us have spoken with increasing \nconcern--I think probably most Senators have come to the floor in the \ncourse of the last months to express their alarm about the politics \nthat surround big issues in our country that demand action and not \npartisanship, not acrimony, but which we continue to simply find a way \nto avoid. We have been artists in the politics of avoidance here in \nWashington over the course of too long a period now.\n\n  The debt and the fiscal cliff are obviously perfect examples of \nwhere, despite all of the warnings and all of the expert advice we get, \nCongress is fundamentally stuck in political cement of our own mixing. \nNo one will credibly deny here the existence of the fiscal cliff, the \ncrisis of our budget, the tax system, and so forth. So that, at least \nas an issue that is avoided, gets a credible amount of words being \nthrown at it.\n  But there is another issue that, in many ways, is just as serious \nbecause of its implications for all that we do on this planet, but \nwhich doesn't any longer elicit that kind of concern or expressions of \nalarm on both sides of the aisle, or from that many Senators. The two \nwords that have described this particular issue over a long period of \ntime now have actually become somewhat words of almost skepticism in \nmany quarters in America, or a kind of shrug, where people say: I don't \nknow what I can do about it. It is not something I ought to worry \nabout. Somebody else will take care of it, or maybe it is not real. \nThose words are ``climate change.''\n  Climate change, over the last few years, has regrettably lost \ncredibility in the eyes and ears of the American people because of a \nconcerted campaign of disinformation, a concerted campaign to brand the \nconcept as somehow slightly outside of the mainstream of American \npolitical thinking. I have to say it has been a remarkably effective \ncampaign. You can't sit here and say it hasn't worked. Every \nopportunity to cast a pall on facts with some kind of cockamamie theory \nhas been taken advantage of, and a lot of money has been spent in this \nprocess of disinformation and discrediting.\n  People used to joke years and years ago about those who argued that \nthe Earth was flat. For a long period of time, people argued that the \nEarth was flat, even though the evidence of astronomers and explorers \nevidenced that it was in fact quite the opposite. So we have, in \neffect, with respect to climate change in America today what is \nfundamentally a ``flat Earth caucus''--a bunch of people, some in the \nU.S. Congress itself, who still argue against all of the science, all \nof the evidence, that somehow we don't know enough about climate change \nor that the evidence isn't sufficient or that it is a hoax. We have \nMembers of the Senate who argue it is a hoax. But that is all they do. \nThey make the argument it is a hoax, but they don't present--and they \ncan't--any real, hard, scientific, peer-reviewed evidence to the effect \nthat it is in fact a hoax. The reason they can't is there are 6,000-\nplus peer-reviewed studies, which is the way science has always been \ndone in America. If you are a scientist and you are a researcher, you \ndo your science and research, and then your analysis is put to the test \nby your peers in those particular disciplines. They pass on the \nmethodology, the pedagogy by which you arrived at your conclusions.\n  We have more than 6,000 of those kinds of properly peer-reviewed \nanalyses of the science of climate change, and the other side of the \nledger has not one--not one, zero--peer-reviewed analysis that says \nhuman beings aren't doing this to the atmosphere and that humans are \nnot contributing or the main cause of what is happening in terms of the \nwarming of the surface of the Earth.\n  What has happened is that in America we all know it. We are seeing it \nin campaigns because of Citizens United. You have these unfathomable \namounts of money being thrown into the political system--millionaires \nand billionaires who plunk down millions of dollars--a $10 million or \n$20 million check at a whack--and then what is happening is people buy \ntheir facts. They create their facts out of whole cloth.\n  As we all have been reminded so many times in the last year, \ncertainly, because of this new debate we are having in America--as our \ncolleague, with whom I was privileged to serve here, Pat Moynihan, \nreminded us again and again, everyone is entitled to their own opinion \nin America, but you are not entitled to your own facts. But in fact, in\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\nAmerican politics today, that is not true. Apparently, you are, because \nyou can go out and buy them. You can buy some scientist to whom you \ngive some appropriate amount of funds, and he does a study with a \nparticular conclusion that has to be found, and they produce a whole \nbunch of hurly-burly to surround it and suggest that those are, in \nfact, facts.\n  The result of this is that over the last year and a half or 2 years, \nwe have had this concerted assault on reason, an assault on science. \nThis isn't the first time in the history of humankind we have been \nthrough these things. Galileo was put on trial for his findings and, as \nwe all know, there have been countless periods of time--that is why we \nwent through an Age of Enlightenment, Age of Reason, as people \nchallenged these old precepts that weren't based on fact but were sort \nof raw belief and/or political interests in some cases, or religious \ninterests in some cases. A handful of Senators here, including Senator \nBoxer, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Sanders, Senator Lautenberg, the \noccupant of the chair, and Senator Franken have recently spoken out \nabout this very process by which an incredibly important, legitimate \nissue of concern to all Americans--to everybody in the world--is being \ncompletely sidelined because of the status quo interests of powerful \ncorporations and other interests in America that don't want to change, \nor some of whom find political advantage in somehow buying into the \ntheory discrediting it.\n  This has not been an issue on which there is a profile of courage by \nsome in the U.S. Congress who are prepared to stand up and say what \nthey know is true, but what has become far more convenient to avoid. I \nbelieve the situation we face is as dangerous as any of the sort of \nreal crises that we talk about.\n  Today we had a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee on the \nsubject of Syria. We all know what is happening with respect to Iran \nand nuclear weapons, and even the possibility of a war. This issue \nactually is of as significant a level of importance because it affects \nlife itself on the planet, because it affects ecosystems on which the \noceans and land depend for the relationship of the warmth of our Earth \nand the amount of moisture there is and all of the interactions that \noccur as a consequence of our climate. It involves our health because \nof policies that we do or don't choose to pursue with respect to \npollution in the air.\n  Pollution didn't used to be a question mark in American politics. We \nfought that fight in the 1960s and 1970s. Rachel Carson started this \nenormous movement for reasonableness when she warned Americans they \nwere living next to toxic wells and water that had been polluted by \ncompanies that put mercury or other poisons into the Earth, which went \ndown into the water supply, and people got cancer and died. America \ndecided in the early 1970s--with the first Earth Day in 1970 itself, \nand the actions that Congress took after that in response to the \nAmerican people--everybody decided we didn't want that pollution in the \nair. We actually passed legislation in 1972, 1973, and 1974 that \ncreated the EPA.\n\n  America didn't even have an Environmental Protection Agency until \nAmericans said we want to be protected, and the people in Congress \nresponded to that. We passed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe \nDrinking Water Act, Marine Mammal Protection, Coastal Zone Management, \nand all of these came about because of an awareness among the American \npeople because they wanted to make a different set of choices or have \ntheir politicians do so on their behalf. Now, suddenly, there is an \nassault on the EPA, the Clean Air Act and, all of a sudden, pollution \ndoesn't matter. That is what we are talking about.\n  Greenhouse gases are, in fact, a pollutant. The particulates that \ncome with that have the same effect on human beings in terms of their \nbreathing, their lungs, the input in some of their food and water, \nwhich ultimately impacts cancer, emphysema, and other diseases that \ncome as a consequence of the quality of air we breathe. Yet we have \nthis whole notion now that somehow we have gone too far, that we have \ndone enough, or that the job has been done and we can go home, when, in \nfact, it is exactly the opposite. With respect to pollution, there are \nchoices, and with respect to health, the single greatest cause of young \nAmericans going to the hospital in the summertime and costing billions \nof dollars to the American people is environmentally induced asthma. \nThat environmentally induced asthma comes about as a consequence of the \ningredients that go into the air. All of this is related.\n  In addition, there is not one person in the Senate who doesn't know \nthat we are still more dependent than we want to be on foreign oil. We \nare better than we were, and we have made improvements, but we are \nstill more dependent than we want to be on foreign oil. We could be \ndoing better with respect to that if we pursued an intelligent energy \npolicy. We still don't have an energy policy after the years we have \nbeen talking about doing it in the Senate and elsewhere.\n  Why is that important to climate change? Because energy policy is the \nsolution to the problem of climate change. If you have an effective \nenergy policy, then you are dealing not only with your independence \nissues, but with the sources of carbon and other greenhouse gases that \nare causing the problem today. Twenty years ago this year, I was \nprivileged to go with the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator John Chafee, Senator Al Gore, Senator Wirth, and others, down \nto Rio, where we took part in the first Earth Summit, which President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush took seriously. To the great credit of \nGeorge H. W. Bush, he not only sent a delegation, he personally went \ndown there and spoke about the issue. He helped to embrace a forward-\nleaning idea. I think 160-some nations signed onto an agreement to try \nto restrain greenhouse gases. That was back in 1992. It was incredible.\n  Here we are, 20 years later, and we could not even get the time for \nthe Senate to send a delegation down there, let alone enough people who \nthought it was important and of interest. The Earth summit, 20 years \nlater, came and went without any major step forward or progress, and \nthe procrastination continues.\n\n  Mr. President, today I remember the debate when we came back from \nKyoto, in 1998 or so, and we had a debate in the Senate about whether \nthe United States should take part in the Kyoto Treaty. We all know \nnow, as a matter of long history, that we didn't because it was viewed \nas being too unilateral. In fact, everybody had the question of, what \nabout China? We can't possibly sign up for this because China will not \ndo it, and they will go racing ahead of us and continue to grow their \neconomy at the expense of the United States.\n  Well, Mr. President, guess what. Today China is the leading clean \nenergy producer in the world. China. The United States of America \ninvented the technologies 50 years ago--of solar and wind, renewable \nenergy technologies such as turbines, the transmission, and so forth, \nand photovoltaics. About 4 years ago, China had about 9 percent of the \nmarket. That was 4 years ago. Two years ago, China had 40 percent of \nthe market. Today China has over 70 percent of the global solar market, \nand the United States, which invented the technology, doesn't have one \ncompany in the top 10 solar panel producers, solar energy producers in \nthe world.\n  You know what is happening. Ninety-five percent of what China \nproduces it exports to other countries, including the United States. So \nhere we are, we give up our lead, and we don't get the jobs. Everybody \nis screaming about jobs. The energy market is a $6 trillion market with \nabout 6 billion users. Just to put that in perspective, the market that \ncreated the great wealth of the 1990s in the United States was in fact \na $1 trillion market with about 1 billion users. That was the \ntechnology market. We saw it with personal computers and with the rest \nof the telephone communications technology of the 1990s. We didn't even \nhave an Internet in the United States until about 1995 or 1996 when \nthat began to be commercialized. Yet in that short span of time we \ncreated more wealth in America than we had ever created at any time in \nAmerica's history. We created 23 million new jobs because we led in \nthat new industry.\n  Here we are today staring at the potential of this extraordinary \nindustry--the energy market--and we are just\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nsitting on our hands while other countries take it and run with it and \ngrow their economies. We are sitting around saying: Where are the jobs?\n  It is an insult. It is an insult to our intelligence. It is an insult \nto every American's aspirations about where they would like to see our \ncountry go. And the fact is it is not just China, but India, Mexico, \nBrazil, South Korea, and countless other countries have taken greater \nadvantage of this than the United States.\n  One of the principal reasons we have trouble getting that market \nmoving is we refuse to put a real price on the price of carbon. Carbon \nhas a price. Everything we are doing to our country and to our \ncommunities today as a result of pollution is a price we are going to \npay. But that price is not subsumed into the price of products, the \nprice of doing business or anything else because we just avoid it \naltogether.\n  A lot of people here continue, unfortunately, to avoid the science \nand just not deal with the reality of what is happening. But 2 days \nago, Mr. President, in the New York Times, there was a very important \nop-ed that appeared, written by a well-known climate skeptic Dr. \nRichard Muller, a professor of physics at the University of California \nat Berkeley. He has written many times about how he did not believe the \nscience was adequate or had produced it. Let me read his words. This is \nDr. Muller:\n\n       Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified \n     problems in the previous climate studies that, in my mind, \n     threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last \n     year, following an intensive research effort involving a \n     dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real \n     and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were \n     correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost \n     entirely the cause.\n\n  That is what this former climate skeptic has said. Bottom line: We \nneed to be armed with the facts, not with empty rhetoric. That is \nexactly what Dr. Muller set out to do. Let me quote him again:\n\n       We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from \n     urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data \n     alone), from data collection selection (prior groups selected \n     fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; \n     we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we \n     separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from \n     human intervention and data adjustment (our work is \n     completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we \n     demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome \n     effects unduly biased our conclusions.\n\n  Now, obviously, we all know the future has a hard way of humbling \npeople who try to predict it too precisely, but I have to say, when the \nscience is screaming pretty consistently over a period of 20 years--and \nnot just screaming at us to say it is coming back correctly but that it \nis coming back with faster results in greater amounts than the \nscientists predicted--as a matter of human precaution that ought to be \nan alarm bell and people ought to take note.\n  Here again is what Dr. Muller says:\n\n       What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions \n     increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect \n     the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one \n     and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if \n     the oceans are included.\n\n  And then he says ominously:\n\n       But if China continues its rapid economic growth--\n\n  And I say, as a matter of parentheses, who doesn't believe China \nisn't going to do everything in its power to continue its growth path \nand do what it is doing? So he says:\n\n       But if China continues its rapid economic growth (it has \n     averaged 10 percent per year over the last 20 years) and its \n     vast use of coal (it typically adds 1 new gigawatt per \n     month), then that same warming could take place in less than \n     20 years.\n\n  Less than 20 years, folks. In North Carolina recently State Senators \nactually voted not to do any planning for the potential of sea level \nrise, even though scientists today tell us the sea level is rising. Ask \ninsurance companies about what they are thinking in terms of their \npotential exposure and liability as we look down the road with \nrespect to the disasters that could come as a consequence of these \nchanges.\n\n  So the plain fact is we have all of the evidence--and I am not going \nto go through all of it right now, but it is there for colleagues to \nanalyze--countless studies of what is happening in terms of the \nmovement of forests--literally, movement--as it migrates, and species \nthat have left Yellowstone National Park and migrated north. Talk to \nthe park rangers. Talk to the folks in Canada and in Colorado and \nMontana and other places about the millions of acres of pine trees that \nhave been destroyed by the pine bark beetle that now doesn't die off \nbecause it doesn't get as cold as it used to. Talk to people in Canada \nand in the Northern United States who used to skate on ponds that used \nto freeze over but that don't freeze over anymore.\n  There are hundreds of examples. Talk to the Audubon Society. Ask them \nabout the reports from their members about certain plants and shrubs \nand trees that don't grow in the same places they used to. There is a \n100-mile swath in the United States now where there has been a \nmigration of things that grow and don't grow. This is going to have a \nprofound impact on agriculture in our country as we go forward if it \ncontinues. And I would just share with my colleagues why that is true \nbeyond any scientific doubt.\n  The first scientist who actually wrote something about global climate \nchange was a Swedish scientist by the name of Arrhenius, and he wrote \naround the turn of the 19th century--1890 or something, I don't \nremember the year. But he is the guy who first said there was this \nrelationship to the gases trapped in the atmosphere and this thing \ncalled the greenhouse effect. In fact, science has now determined to a \ncertainty the reason we can breathe on Earth today, the reason it is \nwarm enough for us to live, the reason life itself exists on Earth is \nbecause there is a greenhouse effect. And it is called a greenhouse \neffect because it behaves just like a greenhouse.\n  The light comes down from the Sun at a very direct angle on many \nthings on Earth and is reflected back from things such as the ice and \nsnow and off roofs and parking lots and other things. But in the ocean \nand in certain other dark spots it is subsumed into that mass, and it \ngoes back much more opaque than it comes down in its directness. The \nreason, therefore, for the greenhouse gas is that it doesn't escape. It \ndoesn't break out of the thin veneer of the atmosphere that contains \nthe gases that create the greenhouse effect, which actually creates an \naverage temperature globally of about 57 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  That is why life can exist; we have a greenhouse effect. And it \nstands to absolute high school, if not elementary-middle school logic, \nif a certain amount of gases are contained, and there has always been \nbalance to some degree, and you add to that massively and thicken the \namount that is there, less heat is going to escape and we wind up \naugmenting that effect of the greenhouse.\n  Scientists tell us now--and I am not a scientist, but I learned how \nto listen to them and at least read the science and try to think about \nit--that in order to keep the temperature of the Earth somewhere near \nwhere it is today or within the permissible range of change, we have to \nkeep our greenhouse gases at--originally, they said--450 parts per \nmillion. As they then noticed the damage and did more calculation, they \ncame and said: No, 350 parts per million.\n  Why is this important? Because today, as we are here assembled in the \nSenate, we are now at 397 parts per million. We are above where they \nsay you have to hold it. And worse, without doing anything--and we are \nnot doing anything--we are only adding amounts; we are moving at a rate \nthat will take it up to 500 or 600 parts per million. If that happens, \nwe will be at a tipping point with respect to the amount of temperature \nchange--5 to 7 degrees--and nobody can predict with certainty what \nhappens, except that we know the ice already melting in Greenland and \nin the Arctic will melt faster and disappear. As more water is exposed, \nthat dark water subsumes more of the heat, and the heat creates \ngreater, more rapid melting. And that is exactly what scientists are \nseeing in the Arctic and Antarctic today, where whole blocks of ice the \nsize of the State of Rhode Island have broken off and dropped into the \nsea and floated south to melt.\n  There are dozens of other examples of what is happening. I said I \nwouldn't go into all of them today. I would just say\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nto my colleagues, please read and challenge the science and talk to the \npeople who are the peer reviewers of these analyses because we have a \nresponsibility here, to future generations and to all of us, to try to \nget this right. And in the balance of right and wrong, I don't \nunderstand the judgment some people are making.\n  We know this is a $6 trillion market. We know that if we were to \nprice carbon, the marketplace would move rapidly toward the kinds of \ntechnologies and new job creation that would respond to that pricing \nand the United States could become a seller of these technologies and a \nbuilder of these new energy capacities in various parts of the world.\n  Astonishingly, the United States of America doesn't even have an \nenergy grid. The east coast has an energy grid, the west coast has an \nenergy grid, Texas has its own energy grid, and from Chicago out to the \nDakotas, there is sort of an energy grid. But the entire center of the \nUnited States is just a great big gaping hole where we don't have any \nconnected energy transmission capacity, and the result is that we can't \nproduce renewable energy down in the four corners of the Southwest--in \nColorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and so forth--and sell it to Minnesota \nin the wintertime or to New England, where we pay a very high price for \nenergy. We can't send energy from one part to the other in the United \nStates of America. It is an insult.\n  We need to build a national energy grid, and in the building of that \ngrid, there are countless jobs to be created for Americans and \ncountless technologies to be developed. For every $1 billion we spend \non infrastructure, we put 27,000 to 35,000 people to work. If we passed \nour infrastructure bank effort here in the Senate, for $10 billion of \nAmerican taxpayer leverage, we could have $650 billion to $700 billion \nof infrastructure investment paid for by Chinese investment, by Arab \nEmirates investment. It wouldn't cost the American taxpayers a dime to \nbe building America and putting people to work. We are not doing it, \nand we are not even building the energy grid of our Nation.\n  I must say to my colleagues, the avoidance here of responsibility for \na whole host of choices we ought to be making--and obviously, yes, it \nbegins with the deficit and the debt, and we can deal with those \nissues. There isn't a person in the Senate who doesn't understand what \nthe magic formula is going to be to do that. But everybody wants to \nwait until the end of the election. I got it. But this issue has been \nwaiting and waiting for 20 years now while other countries are stealing \nour opportunities to be able to be in the marketplace and winning.\n  Nothing screams at us more than the need to have an energy policy for \nour country that begins to address the realities of climate change, and \nnothing screams at us more than to tell the truth to the American \npeople about climate change, to stop having it be an unusable word in \nAmerican politics and not to allow it to become a source of attack and \nridicule with nonfacts and a bunch of cockamamie theories that have no \nfoundation in science or in the kind of analysis that does this \ninstitution justice.\n  I hope over the course of the next months we can have this fight \nbecause nothing less than our economic future--which is, in the end, \nour greatest strength for our military, for our security, for all of \nour objectives--that is what is at stake in this effort. I hope we will \nfinally wind up doing what is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts leaves the floor, I wish to commend him for his constant \nleadership on matters of a better environment, more effective ways to \nget our energy without spoiling the environment and putting what \namounts to toxins in the air. I congratulate him for his constant \nleadership in this area.\n\n\n                           Safe Chemicals Act\n\n  Mr. President, one thing Democrats and Republicans share is a desire \nto keep our children and grandchildren safe and healthy. Many of us \nremember the days when we simply counted to make sure our newborns had \nall of their fingers and toes and breathed a sigh of relief, but \nparents today face many more threats. As industrial chemicals have more \ncommon in consumer products, we have seen an increase in certain birth \ndefects, childhood cancers, and behavioral disorders. That is why I \nhave written legislation to reform our chemical management system and \ngive parents peace of mind about chemicals in household products. My \nSafe Chemicals Act passed out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee last week, and I hope we are going to see it on the floor of \nthe Senate this fall.\n  We think of the home as a place where our families are safe. We don't \nexpect the carpet in our bedrooms, the shampoo in our showers, or the \ndetergent in our laundry to pose a threat to our family's health. Many \neveryday products contain chemicals. Most Americans just assume those \nchemicals have been tested and proven safe. But for the vast majority \nof chemicals in products in our homes, safety testing is not required, \nand we look at the articles that suggest what kinds of things we are \ntalking about.\n  Every morning, millions of American kids wake up in beds that have \nbeen treated with chemicals, their breakfasts are cooked on pans coated \nwith chemicals, and their plates are cleaned with chemicals. Today, EPA \nlists more than 80,000 chemicals in its inventory, many of which are in \nregular household products--products that our children are exposed to \nevery day.\n  We see here a child getting a bottle. It is made of plastic, and we \ndon't really know what is in it. I think we can all agree that a \nchemical that comes into contact with a child should be tested to see \nif it is safe.\n  Many, if not most, chemicals in products are safe, but we know some \nare not. There have been too many cases of toxic chemicals showing up \nin our everyday lives that have horrible health effects, and we have \nfound that out only after our families have been exposed.\n  Recently, the Chicago Tribune exposed the latest example of untested \nchemicals wreaking havoc in our bodies. The Tribune reported that flame \nretardants are widespread in furniture, electronics, and other items \nthroughout our homes. In fact, the average couch contains 2 pounds of \nchemical flame retardants.\n  As we see here, a sofa like this looks as if it is all good and no \nharm could come, but there could be chemical materials in there that \nare releasing toxic fumes. Chemicals in products don't always stay in \nproducts. Many of them find their way into our bodies. It is not clear \nthat we are safe with any of these products because we don't know just \nexactly what is in there.\n  In fact, the Tribune tragically found that a typical American baby is \nborn with the highest concentrations of flame retardants in the world. \nAnd many flame retardants are highly toxic. Children born with high \nconcentrations of flame retardants can suffer devastating consequences \nfor the rest of their lives. Flame-retardant chemicals have been linked \nto cancer, developmental problems, and other health risks. High levels \nof these chemicals put newborns at greater risk of low birthrates and \nbirth defects, and then in childhood they face lower IQs and problems \nwith fine motor skills. Even in adulthood, women who were born with \nflame retardants in their blood can have trouble becoming pregnant. \nImagine, we are setting our children back from day one, before they \nhave taken their first breath.\n  Flame retardants are just one example of the problems with our \nchemical safety system. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, Americans typically have 212 industrial chemicals--\nincluding 6 that cause cancer--coursing through their bodies. We know \nthese chemicals can have serious health effects. We can see what kinds \nof health effects. Chemical exposure accounts for as much as 5 percent \nof childhood cancers, 10 percent of diabetes, 10 percent of Parkinson's \ndisease, and 30 percent of childhood asthma. That is not a very \ncomforting idea.\n  These chemicals are still around and untested because the 35-year-old \nlaw that is supposed to assess and protect against chemical health \nrisks is broken. That law, called TSCA, is so severely flawed that the \nnonpartisan Government Accountability Office testified that it is ``a \nhigh-risk area of the\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\nlaw.'' I want to repeat that. The law called TSCA is so severely flawed \nthat the Government Accountability Office testified that it is ``a \nhigh-risk area of the law.'' That is a credible government department \nsaying this is a high-risk area of the law.\n  Of the more than 80,000 chemicals on EPA's inventory, TSCA has \nallowed testing of only around 200 chemicals and restrictions on only \n5. That is more than 80,000 chemicals that are being used routinely, in \nEPA's inventory, that might affect children or adults in a household.\n  Until this law is fixed, toxic chemicals will continue to poison our \nbodies and threaten our health. This status quo is dangerous, and it is \nunacceptable. We have heard from parents across the country that we \nshould not wait any longer for reform. We had a demonstration here in \nWashington just a few weeks ago with people asking for safer chemicals \nnow. They are worried about it. They are parents. They don't want their \nchildren exposed to chemicals that might injure their health.\n  It is easy to do. These chemicals should be tested before they are \nmade into products, and then we don't have to worry about whether we \nare doing something that puts our kids at risk. We have already waited \ntoo long. Entire generations have grown up in homes filled with \nuntested chemicals. Every year, more chemicals are introduced, more \nchildren get sick, and more lives are put at risk.\n  I was proud when the Environment and Public Works Committee took an \nimportant step last week by passing the Safe Chemicals Act. We began \nworking on TSCA reform in 2005. In the 7 years since, we have explored \nthe topic from many angles. We talked to scientists, workers, business \nleaders, State officials, firefighters, researchers, legal experts, and \nparents who are concerned about their children's health. We also heard \nfrom Senators on both sides of the aisle. Throughout this process, we \nhave listened and we have learned.\n  The result is a commonsense bill that lays out a vision for strong \nbut pragmatic regulation of chemicals. The bill requires the chemical \nmanufacturers to demonstrate the safety of their products before they \nend up in our bodies. We already require this for pharmaceuticals and \npesticides, so there is not any reason we should not require the same \nof industrial chemicals that are found in products in our bodies. The \nEuropean Union, Canada, other countries require safety testing, but \nAmericans remain unprotected. That is not acceptable.\n\n  I have received letters in support of the Safe Chemicals Act signed \nby more than 300 public health organizations--businesses, environmental \norganizations, health care providers, labor unions and, again, \nconcerned parents. Twenty-four Senators have cosponsored my Safe \nChemicals Act and I believe the full Senate should now be given a \nchance to vote for or against the testing of these industrial \nchemicals. We want to debate it on the floor of the Senate. We want \nfamilies to know what we are thinking about as we go through this \nprocess. They deserve to know that Congress cares more about their \nkids' health than the concerns of the chemical industry lobbyists.\n  I come to this conclusion: There is risk out there that we take \nunnecessarily. It is time to take action to clear this up. It would be \na positive act for the chemical manufacturers so they would not have to \nworry about responding to challenges from laws in 50 States but rather \nbe under one guideline that takes care of them all.\n  It is time to take action. The health of our children is at stake. I \nhope my colleagues across the Chamber will stand and say yes, you are \nright, it is time we challenge what we know is an exposure that should \nnot exist. Simply done, it would move the process very quickly, letting \nus know that everything we have that has a chemical component to it is \nsafe for our use.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          Progrowth Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the need for progrowth \ntax reform. It is a subject I have been here on the Senate floor \nspeaking about repeatedly over the course of the year and certainly \nover the course of the recent weeks.\n  Last week the Senate voted on several tax measures. One of the \nmeasures was a measure we offered which would continue the current tax \nrates for a year, giving us an opportunity to engage in progrowth tax \nreform. That bill was defeated in the Senate.\n  The other bill, a bill which I voted against, was a bill that would \nraise taxes on approximately 1 million small businesses in this \ncountry. In fact, that bill was passed. But the fact is that under the \nConstitution any tax measure has to start in the House of \nRepresentatives. In fact, that is what is going on today. They are \nvoting on a measure that would extend the current tax rates for a year, \ngiving us the opportunity to engage in progrowth tax reform which I \nbelieve would truly help galvanize our economy and raise revenue for \nour country, not through higher taxes but in fact through growth and \nthrough more revenue from economic growth.\n  I believe that is exactly what we have to support in the Senate as \nwell. The measure the administration favored, and that was earlier \npassed, as I say, will be blue-slipped so it will not take effect, but \nthe problem with that measure is it would raise taxes on individuals \nand small businesses. Almost a million small businesses across this \ncountry would pay higher taxes and they are the generators of jobs for \nour economy. It also raises taxes on capital gains and it raises estate \ntax as well.\n  Let me talk about the estate tax or the death tax provision for a \nminute. Right now the estate tax provides an exemption on the first $5 \nmillion and then amounts in an estate over that $5 million threshold \nare taxed at 35 percent. However, reverting to the pre-2001-2003 tax \nrates, which happens at the end of the year unless action is taken--\nunless action is taken by both the House and the Senate to extend the \ncurrent rates--then we revert to the tax rates before the 2001-2003 tax \nreductions. That means instead of a $5 million exemption and a 35-\npercent tax rate on estate tax or the death tax, we go to a $1 million \nexemption with a 55-percent tax rate after that.\n  Think about what that means to our farms and our small businesses \nacross the country: 24 times more farms will then be in an estate tax \nsituation and something like 14 times more businesses will be in an \nestate tax situation. What does that mean? What it means is when a \nfamily member dies and it is time to pass on that farm or pass on that \nbusiness, they are going to have to borrow money to try to pay the \nestate tax. That farm or that business is going to have to generate \nenough revenue to pay that estate tax. If you cannot pay that estate \ntax at 55 percent of the value of what you are passing--if that \nbusiness or that farm cannot service that level of debt, then you have \nto sell that farm or sell that small business, which may have been in \nthe family for many generations. Remember that those farms, those \nranches, those small businesses are the backbone of the American \neconomy and here we are, at a time when we have 8.2 percent \nunemployment and we are trying to get this economy going and we are \nputting our small businesses across this country in that situation.\n  That is why it is so important that we act. That is exactly what we \nhave proposed. We have said rather than putting our economy in that \nsituation right now, let's set up a 1-year extension of current tax \nrates, let's engage in progrowth tax reform where we actually lower \nrates but close loopholes, which will generate economic growth, and we \nwill get revenue from economic growth rather than from higher taxes. \nThat is vitally important.\n  In fact, on a bipartisan basis 2 years ago that is what we did, we \nextended the current tax rates. I think we had 44 Democratic votes to \ndo that here in the Senate. Republicans voted for it. I think across \nthe board we had 44 votes on the Democratic side. Also, it was a \nbipartisan measure. I argue that is exactly what we have to do again. \nEven\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\nthe President--who came out that he supported doing exactly what I laid \nout because, he said, we can't raise taxes in a recession. He said \nraising taxes would hurt the economy and would hurt job creation.\n  If you look at the statistics today, we are actually in a more \ndifficult economic situation now than we were then. Unemployment is at \n8.2 percent and has been over 8 percent for more than 41 straight \nmonths. There are 13 million people who are out of work, 10 million \npeople are underemployed, which makes 23 million people either looking \nfor work or looking for a better job. Middle-class income has declined \nfrom approximately $55,000 to about $50,000 since this administration \ntook office. Food stamp usage has increased from 32 million recipients \nto 46 million recipients, and as we have seen, economic growth is about \n1.5 percent.\n\n  As far as job creation, there were 80,000 jobs gained during the \nmonth, but we need 150,000 jobs gained during the month just to keep up \nwith population growth and not have our unemployment rate increase. So \nthese are the facts, and the facts speak for themselves. We need to \nextend the current tax rates, we need progrowth tax reform on a \nbipartisan basis, and we need to get control of our spending.\n  If we look at the latest numbers from CBO, CBO says without taking \nthose steps we are looking at economic growth next year of maybe one-\nhalf percent for the entire year. If we take the steps to address the \nfiscal cliff, as I have described, and take those steps to undertake \nprogrowth tax reform, CBO talks in terms of a 4.4-percent growth rate \nnext year. Think what that means to 13 million unemployed people. It \nmeans the difference between getting a job and not getting a job.\n  The uncertainty that our economy faces right now because of the \nexpiration of the current tax rates at the end of the year, and \nbusinesses not knowing what is going to happen, is freezing investment \ncapital on the sidelines and freezing business expansion. There is more \nprivate capital and investment capital sidelined now more than in the \nhistory of our country. We unleash it, and we get it going not by \nraising taxes but by providing the legal tax and regulatory certainty--\nthe kind of progrowth tax reform with closing loopholes, as I have \ndescribed--to get this economy going.\n  The administration says: Well, everyone needs to pay their fair \nshare. I think that is certainly true. We are saying exactly that. That \nis exactly what we do by engaging in progrowth tax reform and closing \nloopholes. Everyone is treated fairly, and everyone pays their fair \nshare.\n  In fact, just to give a sense of that whole concept, let's look at \nwho pays the income taxes right now according to the National Taxpayers \nUnion. Today the top 5 percent of taxpayers pay almost 60 percent of \nthe income tax in this country. The top 10 percent pay almost 70 \npercent of the income tax in this country. The top 25 percent pay \nalmost 90 percent of the income tax in this country. The top 50 percent \nof taxpayers pay 98 percent of the income tax that is paid in the \ncountry.\n  So the point is, let's engage in progrowth tax reform that will get \nour economy growing rather than stagnant as it is today. It is that \neconomic growth that puts our people back to work and truly generates \nthe revenue, not higher tax rates which will hurt our growth. We can \nlower rates, close loopholes, come up with a fairer system that is \nsimpler and will generate revenue through economic growth. That is the \nonly way that economic growth, along with controlling and managing our \nspending, will get us on top of our debt and deficit and get Americans \nback to work. We need to do it in a bipartisan way. We can do it. We \nhave done it before, and we absolutely need to get started, and get \nstarted now, for the good of the American people and the good of our \ncountry.\n  If I may, I want to close on one short message; that is, as the House \nworks on a tax measure--as I described today--to extend the current tax \nrates and put us in a situation where we can truly engage in progrowth \ntax reform, I also urge my colleagues in the House to make sure that at \nthe same time they are acting on farm bill legislation and not just the \ndrought legislation.\n  We passed a farm bill in this Senate several weeks ago on a \nbipartisan basis. I hope they are able to do the same thing and pass a \nfarm bill in the House on a bipartisan basis as well that we can go to \nconference with. I believe the bill we produced in the Senate and the \nbill they have produced in the Agriculture Committee can be brought \ntogether in a conference committee. We can pass a farm bill that will \nbe cost effective, will save money, and help reduce the deficit.\n  The bill we passed would generate $23 billion in savings to help \naddress the deficit. It would provide the right kind of safety net for \nour farmers and ranchers and ultimately this: Good farm policy benefits \nevery single American because our farmers and ranchers produce the \nhighest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world. That benefits \nevery single one of us, not to mention creating a lot of great jobs \nthroughout the country.\n  So I call on the House to act on that farm bill as well as engage in \nthe kind of progrowth tax reform that I know will truly benefit our \ncountry.\n  With that, Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3473 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have a little bit of a problem in that \nI do not want to take time from the Senator who is in line to speak \nafter me. But I would like to serve notice that there have been several \nthings that were said on the floor today concerning this whole idea of \nglobal warming. We had a hearing this morning. It was kind of revealing \nbecause they have done everything they can to pass cap and trade, and \nit has not happened.\n  I wish to correct some statements that were made by Members. When the \ntime comes that I have about 20 minutes to do this, I will do that. It \nwill probably have to be later today because of the clock that is \nrunning now.\n  I yield the floor for my friend to take his turn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise this afternoon in \nsupport of the bipartisan Cybersecurity Act of 2012, and I wish to \nshare my concerns about the very real cyber threat facing our country. \nMost importantly, I rise to urge all my colleagues to move forward to \nthe passage of this pending cyber security bill for the good of our \nnational security. Top experts and respected members of both political \nparties have told us that time is wasting; we must debate and pass this \ncritically important piece of legislation.\n  Cyber security policy is an issue with which I am deeply involved, \ngiven my seats on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. Moreover, Colorado's military and defense \ncommunities play a prominent role in defending our country, the United \nStates, against cyber attacks.\n  The Air Force Space Command, located at Peterson Air Force Base in \nColorado Springs, is responsible for protecting American space-based \nassets from network intrusions. The U.S. Northern Command, also located \nat Peterson Air Force Base, recently established a Joint Cyber Center \nto help provide on-demand cyber consequence response to civil \nauthorities.\n  Multiple defense and technology industry companies based in Colorado \nalso contribute hardware, software, and expertise to the effort to keep \nour networks and infrastructure secure.\n  Our Federal labs also conduct critical research into cyber security, \nmost notably the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \notherwise known as NIST, which is located in Boulder. They play a key \nrole in helping establish cyber security standards.\n  The threats posed by cyber attacks have long been recognized, but we \nin the Congress have yet to act upon\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nthese threats in a comprehensive way. It is as if we see the danger in \nfront of us, but yet we cannot find the courage to face it. But \nCongress cannot afford to wait for a 9/11-sized attack in order to act. \nWaiting for a catastrophic act--something military and intelligence \nleaders and a bipartisan collection of national security experts are \nwarning us against--is the exact opposite of leadership and the exact \nopposite of what our constituents expect us to do.\n  This debate, to me, has seemingly, unfortunately, unraveled into an \nantiquated argument about the public sector versus the private sector. \nWe cannot let old ways of thinking bog us down. This is a threat that \ncan only be addressed by both the public and private sectors working \ntogether.\n  The private sector owns 85 percent of our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, which is itself heavily dependent on computer networks. \nA successful attack on our critical infrastructure could result in \ndisabled power grids, refineries, and nuclear plants, disrupted rail \nsystems and air traffic control and telecommunications networks. A \nsuccessful attack could bring commerce to a halt, our financial markets \nto their knees. It could also escalate into a war in cyber space or \neven a shooting war.\n  To defend against these serious threats, particularly those that \ninvolve national security, there needs to be an exchange of information \nbetween the public and the private sectors. Of course, allowing the \ngovernment and industry to share information must be done with \nsufficient safeguards, so any legislation authorizing such sharing \nneeds to strike a balance between privacy and civil liberties \nprotections. I believe the bill's authors have achieved such a balance.\n  I recognize it is often difficult to find consensus on how to defend \nour Nation from security threats. Sometimes that is because we cannot \nagree on the nature of our vulnerabilities and in what priority to \naddress them. Unfortunately, sometimes Congress is too polarized to act \nuntil after a crisis occurs.\n  But in the case of cyber security, we already know our Nation's \ncomputer networks are increasingly vulnerable. There is widespread \nagreement about the severity of the threat. Just last month, Defense \nSecretary Panetta testified before Congress that cyber attacks could \n``virtually paralyze this country.'' The threat is not impending, it is \nhere. We already know many of the steps we need to take to mitigate or \nprevent these attacks. The only issue getting in the way is politics. \nFrankly, Coloradans are tired of this. They want us to reason together \nand solve our most vexing national challenges.\n  The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 is not overly intrusive. It has been \nscaled back to a voluntary system of industry-driven security standards \nfor critical infrastructure. The bill's authors have offered a further \namendment to address some of the remaining concerns of the bill's \nopponents. As much as the bill's authors have compromised and worked \nwith groups and businesses from across the policy spectrum, one would \nthink they would get more in return from the Republicans than a demand \nto vote on the repeal of health care reform. But that is where the \ndebate stands, and it is not a proud moment for our Chamber.\n  The cyber security bill before us may not be perfect. In fact, I have \noffered three amendments that I believe make this an even stronger \nbill.\n  The first would require the administration to provide a detailed plan \non how it would develop a highly trained, robust Federal cyber security \nworkforce. A stronger Federal workforce will not only better protect \ngovernment assets, but these individuals will go on to fill critical \nroles protecting cyber assets in the private sector.\n  My second amendment would establish permanent faculty positions to \ntrain the next generation of military cyber leaders at the U.S. Air \nForce Academy.\n  My third amendment would require the assessment of the costs and \nbenefits of building a strategic stockpile of extra high voltage \ntransformers. We do not produce these highly specialized pieces of \nequipment domestically, and it would take months to replace \ntransformers damaged by a physical or cyber attack.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in passing these commonsense \namendments aimed at improving our national security.\n  This cyber security bill is over 3 years in the making. I find it \nironic some argue the process has been rushed and we need more time. \nBut I believe this bill is long overdue and we simply cannot afford not \nto act.\n  As the head of U.S. Cyber Command and the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency, General Alexander, wrote in a letter to Congress this \nweek, ``The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \nimmediate action.''\n  This is coming from the national security official who knows more \nthan anyone about the cyber threats facing our country. As a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, I take his cautions and advice very \nseriously. The rest of us should as well.\n  As I close, I urge all of us, let's put aside partisan ploys and \npartisan differences. Let's work together to amend and pass this \nvitally important cyber security bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I understand the floor time is pretty \nmuch used up between now and 6:30. I have made inquiries. I understand \nI will have time at 6:30 for 25 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized at 6:30 for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand the next speakers are in the cloakroom at \nthis time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, more than eight months ago, Senator Crapo \nand I, two Senators from very different parts of the country with very \ndifferent political perspectives, joined together to introduce the \nLeahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011. We put \naside our political differences, listened to the law enforcement and \nvictim services professionals, and drafted a bill that put victims \nfirst.\n  It has been more than 3 months since an overwhelming majority of the \nSenate joined us in our bipartisan effort to pass the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2011 with 68 votes, more than two-thirds \nof this body, including every woman Senator, Republican and Democratic. \nIn doing so, the Senate sent a very clear message. We said stopping \ndomestic and sexual violence is a national priority, and we are going \nto stand together, Republicans and Democrats alike, to protect all \nvictims from these devastating crimes--all victims. It was very clear. \nIf you are a victim of domestic and sexual violence, we are passing \nlaws to help protect you, no matter who you are or where you live in \nthis country.\n  Having sent such a strong bipartisan message from this body, I was--I \ndon't know whether to say bewildered or shocked to see the House \nRepublican leadership abandon the bipartisan approach that was so \nsuccessful in the Senate. Instead of allowing a vote on the Senate-\npassed bipartisan bill that has the support of more than 1,000 \nnational, state, and local victim service organizations, they insisted \non crafting a new, partisan measure that intentionally stripped out \nprotections for some of the most vulnerable victims and weakened \nexisting protections for others. They refused to allow votes on \namendments as we had done here in the Senate, choosing to stifle a full \nand honest debate about how to best meet the needs of victims.\n  This overtly political approach was too much even for some in their \nown party. Nearly two dozen House Republicans, including the chair of \nthe crime victims' caucus, stood up and voted against the inadequate \nand harmful House bill. That opposition was not surprising since a \nsimilar provision offered during the Senate debate was rejected by 61 \nSenators, including nine Republicans.\n  The House Speaker's recent announcement naming as conferees only\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\nRepublicans who supported that misguided and deeply partisan effort is \nhardly a step forward. Instead, I wish the Republican House leadership \nwould do what it should have done four months ago--take up, debate, and \nvote on the bipartisan Senate-passed bill. I have no doubt we could \nreauthorize this life-saving bill in short order if they would just \nallow their members a straightforward vote on the merits.\n  Instead, Speaker Boehner continues to hide behind a procedural \ntechnicality, called a ``blue slip,'' as an excuse to avoid debating \nthe bipartisan Senate bill. He acts as if he has no choice, but this is \nnonsense. The Speaker can waive the technicality and allow the House to \nvote on the Senate bill at any time. He is choosing to hold up this \nbill, and those efforts must stop.\n  Since the Senate bill passed, I have been consistently calling for \nHouse action on the legislation. Earlier this summer, Senator Murkowski \nand I wrote a bipartisan letter to Speaker Boehner, urging him to allow \nan up-or-down vote. Two weeks ago, five House Republicans followed \nsuit, calling on Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor to take up \nthe Senate-passed bill to resolve the ``blue slip'' problem. And \nyesterday Republican Representatives Biggert and Dold again urged the \nHouse to work with the Senate to get this vital legislation signed into \nlaw.\n  But if the Speaker and the Republican leadership in the House insist \non ignoring victims and the voices of the professionals in the field, \nand those in their own party, and continue to delay this crucial \nlegislation on a technicality, a technicality which has been waived \nover and over and over again since I have been in the Senate, I think \nthe Senate should once again lead by example.\n  We can solve this problem tonight--tonight, within the next few \nhours. If the Senate Republican leadership wants to get VAWA, the \nViolence Against Women Act, done, it can be done. We could take up a \nHouse revenue bill, substitute the bipartisan Senate VAWA bill, and \nsend it to the House immediately.\n  To those who are watching and listening, this may sound like, what \nare these legislative moves? What they are is a simple thing I have \nseen done hundreds of times since I have been here. It would be our way \nof saying we want to stop violence against women. We have passed a bill \nthat had Republicans and Democrats come together across the political \nspectrum. Now we are sending it to the other body, saying follow our \nexample.\n  Majority Leader Reid proposed this path forward nearly 2 months ago, \nbut he was blocked by the Republican side. There is no good reason for \ntheir objection. Just this year, Republican Senators unanimously agreed \nto a similar procedure in order to overcome blue slip issues with both \nthe transportation bill and the FAA reauthorization bill. Let's be \nclear about this--with just a little cooperation from Senate \nRepublicans, we can move VAWA now. What I am saying is that just as 68 \nof us, Republicans and Democrats, came together before to pass this \nbill, I would urge the Republican leadership to join us and stop \nblocking it from moving forward.\n  We have only a precious few days left in this Congress to get this \nbill passed. The procedural excuses must stop. Partisan politicking \nmust end, just as Senator Crapo and I, two Senators of different \npolitical philosophies, came together when we started this process so \nmany months ago, we came together to focus on the victims but also to \nmake good on our promise to stop domestic and sexual violence in all \nits forms against all victims.\n\n  I have said so many times on this floor, this matter is deeply \npersonal. I went to a lot of these crime scenes as a young prosecutor, \na young prosecutor with a young family. I would see a victim of \nviolence, sometimes a bloodied and barely conscious victim being taken \nin an ambulance to the hospital--but sometimes seeing a bloody corpse \non the floor and then we would find out, as we unraveled the case, that \nwe could have intervened and stopped this death if we had only had the \ntools. Well, now those early detection and intervention tools exist and \nwe can stop this violence. Those tools, critical resources to reduce \ndomestic violence homicide, are in the Senate-passed VAWA bill but they \nwill not become law unless we act to pass this legislation now.\n  What I also learned is that the police officers who came to help \ninvestigate and help get the perpetrator, they never asked: Was this \nvictim a Republican or Democrat, rich or poor, white or black, gay or \nstraight, Native American or immigrant. They just said, as I have said \nso many times on the floor and the distinguished Presiding Officer, who \nherself was a prosecutor, has said: A victim is a victim is a victim.\n  I do not want to just be able to arrest people after the victim is \ndead. I want programs to stop the person from being abused in the first \nplace. I want to protect victims before they become victims. If there \nis anything in this country that should unite all of us, it should be \nthis, just as it united us before. Let's send it on to the other body. \nLet's get it passed. Let's get it on the President's desk, and let's \nhope we save the lives of people.\n  Helping these victims--no matter who they are--must be our goal. \nTheir lives depend on it, and they are waiting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am honored to follow the Senator \nfrom Vermont, who has been such an extraordinary leader in this area, \nand look forward to yielding shortly to the Senator from Washington, \nwho has championed this bill and helped us all see the urgency of \napproving it.\n  In the minutes that I will be talking, and they will be brief \nminutes, every minute, two to three women will become victims of \ndomestic abuse. Every minute that I am standing here, every minute that \nwe occupy with debate and delay on this measure, two to three people in \nthe United States, the greatest country in the history of the world, \nwill become victims of domestic violence.\n  We cannot afford to wait. That is why I urge that my colleagues \nadvance this critical piece of legislation and urge the House of \nRepresentatives to agree to the Senate version of this bill so we can \nmake this bill more inclusive to include Native Americans and \nimmigrants and others who would not be covered by the House version.\n  We find ourselves at a crossroads. We can either strengthen VAWA or \nwe can retreat and go back. I say let's go forward with the philosophy \nthat the Senator from Vermont has articulated so well as a prosecutor, \nnot to mention knowing how our police work. We do not ask whether \nsomeone is an immigrant, what their sexual preference is, whether they \nare Native American. We protect them if they are victims of domestic \nabuse and violence. That should be our philosophy in the greatest \ncountry in the history of the world.\n  There are two protections for battered immigrant women in VAWA that \nare particularly important. The first allows immigrant women married to \nan abusive U.S. citizen to apply for legal status independent of that \nspouse. The second, which is the U visa, provides temporary status to \nvictims who cooperate with law enforcement to prosecute their abuser.\n  The reauthorization of VAWA is currently stalled principally because \nof the U Visa provisions in the Senate bill, S. 1925.\n  Let me illustrate the importance of this provision with one story. A \nwoman who came to Connecticut from Guatemala fled her native country to \nescape her abuser and arrived in Connecticut in 2005. Her abuser \nfollowed her to Connecticut, where he continued to abuse her. He was \neventually deported to Guatemala on criminal charges, but she found \nherself in another abusive relationship. Eventually, she was able to \nfind shelter at a local domestic violence agency. She could not \nconvince family to sponsor her so she could apply for legal status. She \nwould have had nowhere to turn but for a transitional living program \nfor domestic violence victims that connected her to a Connecticut legal \naid attorney, who then enabled her to file for a new visa.\n  I am happy to report that this constituent survivor received her new \nvisa in May of 2012. Because of VAWA, she is now safe, and so is her \nson.\n  This story is repeated countless times across Connecticut and the \ncountry by women who suffer in silence.\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\nTheir undocumented status makes them particularly vulnerable and \npowerless to escape their abusive situations. My constituents tell me--\nand I want to listen to them--that we cannot afford to compromise those \nbasic protections that are fundamental to human rights and dignity, and \nthat is why I urge this body, and the Congress as a whole, to move \nforward, not backward.\n  Again, every minute, two to three women become the victims of \ndomestic violence. The consequences of this horrific problem are too \nhigh and the costs too dire to stay the course and simply repeat the \ninaction we have seen so far.\n  Thousands of victims of domestic violence are entrusting us with \ntheir safety today. We have an obligation to them to avoid the \ngamesmanship, end the gridlock, and move forward with S. 1925.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank Senator Leahy and Senator \nBlumenthal and so many others who have come to the floor to speak on \nthis critical issue.\n  Today the women of the Senate and the men who support the Violence \nAgainst Women Act are on the Senate floor to give Speaker Boehner and \nthe Republicans another chance to do what is right. It is another \nchance to stop the delay. It is another chance to provide peace of mind \nto 30 million women whose protections are at risk, and it is another \nchance to pass the inclusive, bipartisan Senate, Violence Against Women \nAct bill.\n  The bipartisan Senate bill passed almost 100 days ago by a vote of 68 \nto 31. Fifteen of our Republican colleagues on the floor--I will repeat \nthat--15 Republicans joined us that day, and they did so because they \nknow the history of this bill. They know every time the Violence \nAgainst Women Act has been reauthorized, it has consistently included \nbipartisan provisions to address the women who have not been protected. \nThey know domestic violence protections for all women should not be a \nDemocratic or Republican issue.\n  But here we are back on the Senate floor urging support today for a \nbill that should not be controversial. Just as we did last week, just \nas we are doing today, and just as we will do in the coming weeks, we \nwill be making sure this message resonates loudly and clearly both in \nWashington, DC, and back home in our States because we are not going to \nback down--not while there are thousands of women in the country who \nare excluded from the current law.\n  The numbers are staggering. One in three Native Americans will be \nraped in their lifetime. Two in five of them are victims of domestic \nviolence, and they are killed at 10 times the rate of the national \naverage.\n  Those shocking statistics are not just isolated to one group of \nwomen; 25 to 35 percent in the LGBT community experience domestic \nviolence in their relationships. Three in four abused immigrant women \nnever entered the process to obtain legal status, even though they are \neligible. Why? Because their abuser husbands never filed their \npaperwork.\n  This should make it perfectly clear to our colleagues in the other \nChamber that their current inaction has a real impact on the lives of \nwomen across America affected by violence. Where a person lives, their \nimmigration status, or who they love should not determine whether \nperpetrators of domestic violence are brought to justice.\n  Last week, the New York Times ran an editorial on this bill that gets \nto the heart of where we are. It began by saying:\n\n       House Republicans have to decide which is more important: \n     protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the \n     harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some of their \n     party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.\n\n  The editorial also made the point that it doesn't have to be this \nway. It pointed out:\n\n       In May, fifteen Senate Republicans joined with the \n     chamber's Democratic majority to approve a strong \n     reauthorization bill.\n\n  It ended with what we all know it will take to move this bill \nforward: leadership from Congressman Boehner. The effort that was \nstarted in the Senate last week--an effort that will continue for as \nlong as it takes--is a call for the very same--leadership.\n  It is time for Speaker Boehner to look beyond ideology and partisan \npolitics. It is time for him to look at the history of a bill that \nagain and again has been supported and expanded by Republicans and \nDemocrats and end the delay because, frankly, it is taking a toll.\n  Every moment the House continues to delay is another moment that 30 \nmillion vulnerable women are without the protections they deserve in \nthis country.\n  The women this bill protects have seen their lives destroyed by the \ncowardice of those who claimed to care for them. We have a chance now \nto stand for them where others have not. But the only way we can help \nprotect these women is to prove that we as a nation have the courage to \ndo so--the courage to show them that discrimination has no place in our \ndomestic violence laws. To do that, we need to pass the Senate's \ninclusive, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question, and I want to make sure everyone \nlistening to this debate gets what is about to happen.\n  Is it not true that the Senate passed the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo \nViolence Against Women Act with well more than 60 votes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it not correct that the House passed its version and \nleft out 30 million Americans?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. In fact, those \n30 million Americans would be covered under the Senate bill. We made \nsure that Native American women are covered, and we put in important \nprovisions to make sure campus violence is covered, and those \nprovisions have been left out of the House bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. And the immigrant women, as the Senator has \ndiscussed, which Senator Blumenthal pointed out, are the most \nvulnerable because they are so afraid of their status, they are very \nscared to report that someone is raping them, beating them, or harming \nthem every single day; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. We \ncannot even imagine what it is like to have somebody hold that kind of \npower over you and use it to beat you day in and day out. We cover \nthose women in this bill so that they have the protections they ought \nto have as human beings.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Isn't it fair to say that the 30 million people we \ncover--which the House leaves out--include college students, enhanced \nprotections for them on campus; the LGBT community; Native American \ncommunities; and undocumented immigrants; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As my friend pointed out, is it not true that when you \nlook at rates of violence against these particular people in our \ncommunities, they are higher than the population at large?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Isn't it fair to say that the House bill--their version \nof the Violence Against Women Act left out the most vulnerable people \nwho are the most susceptible to violence?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. That is why we \nhave work to do, in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate, to make sure in \nthis country, America, we do not discriminate against women when it \ncomes to violence.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have two more points, and then I will yield to my \nfriend so she can make the unanimous consent request.\n  Isn't it also true that the excuse Speaker Boehner is giving as to \nwhy he will not take up and pass the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill, isn't \nit true that the excuse is that there is a technical problem, which he \ncalls a blue slip, in the Senate bill? And isn't it true that my friend \ntoday is going to ask unanimous consent to correct that problem so that \nwe can send this inclusive bill over to Speaker Boehner?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. It seems to me \nsuch a simple procedure to do, which\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\nwe have done many times in the Senate, to just by unanimous consent \nsend the Speaker back the bill so he can't put a piece of blue paper in \nfront of us and say that stands between women and the protections we \nare trying to pass for them today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Finally, I hope, when my friend makes the unanimous \nconsent request, to take the very same text of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which passed this body with well over 60 votes, and put it \ninto a bill that would overcome the technical problem and enable us to \nsend it back to the House. It is my strong hope that the Republican \nleadership will not object. If they do, let the whole country \nunderstand what they are objecting to: a way to fix this technical \nproblem so that Speaker Boehner and the Republicans can pass the Senate \nbipartisan Violence Against Women Act and include the 30 million people \nwho have been left out.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from California and say that she is \nabsolutely correct. What I am about to do is to ask consent to do what \nwe have done on many pieces of legislation, including the jobs and \nTransportation bills the Senator from California was able to pass, and \nthe Senate overcame that technicality through a motion on the floor.\n  We have done it time and time again on bills like that. It seems to \nme that on a bill like this, which is affecting so many women and their \nright to protect themselves and the ability to get help in their \ncommunities, there should not be a technicality between them and our \npassing protections for them in this country.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 9\n\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 9 and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the language of S. 1925, the Violence Against Women Act \nreauthorization, as passed in the Senate on April 26 by a vote of 68 to \n31, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, rather than doing the usual thing and \nreserving the right to object, I will object, and then I would \nappreciate the courtesy, before I offer a parallel UC, to make my \nremarks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, has the Senator from Iowa objected to \nmy request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard. The Senator from \nIowa----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has objected. I \njust have to say that it is stunning to me that the Senator has \nobjected to a simple procedure that we have done many times on \nTransportation bills and FAA bills and, sadly, now there is an \ninability to provide protections for the women we have been talking \nabout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest dealing with the same subject.\n  Before I do that, I am astounded that it took 100 days for the \nmajority to decide that the bill they wanted to send to the House would \nbe blue-slipped because they kept saying it really wasn't subject to a \nblue slip. Obviously, the Constitution gives the House of \nRepresentatives the power to make that decision, and they made the \ndecision that the fee in this bill would keep it from being accepted by \nthe House of Representatives.\n\n  They have obviously overcome that problem. But they have not overcome \nsome other problems with the legislation. My reason for objecting for \npeople on my side who voted against this bill is because of some \nunconstitutional provisions that it contains, and issues that don't \nhave to be brought up to guarantee there is adequate legislation for \nfighting violence against women.\n  By the way, I believe this act, which has been on the books for more \nthan a decade and a half, is going to be carried on. So there is not \ngoing to be a situation where, whether or not we go through this \nprocess, there is not going to be legislation protecting women on the \nbooks. It is just a question whether it will be expanded in a way that \nwas intended to make the bill controversial so, presumably, it could be \nmade a political issue in an election year.\n  What bothers me about this whole process--besides the fact it has \ntaken 100 days to get to the point of offering it for conference--is it \nfits into a pattern of doing things at the last minute. We are 2 days \naway from a recess, and this is brought up at this particular time. I \nhave to ask why. Why not sometime during the last 100 days?\n  I also see a pattern of this maneuver fitting into the maneuvers that \nhave been going on ever since, I believe, the spring break we had in \nthe Senate. Ever since then--as reported in an article published in the \nnewspaper we know as Politico a couple of months ago about a strategy \nbetween the White House reelection effort and things that go on in the \nSenate--we seem to have a crisis every week.\n  We came back from the spring break, and we had the Buffett tax rule. \nThat was carried on for a week. Everybody knew that wasn't going to \npass, but we wasted a whole week on the Buffett tax rule.\n  Then this issue was brought up before and passed about that time as \npart of a strategy of having a war on women come up as an issue. That \nended in this legislation being passed through the Senate but in a way \nwhere everybody knew it wasn't going to get through the House of \nRepresentatives. But it was a very convenient political issue.\n  Later on, we had the equal wages for women legislation that came up \nfor about a week. Once again, everybody knew that wasn't going to go \nanyplace, but it was debated in this assembly, taking up time from a \nlot of important issues that ought to be dealt with--the economy and \ncreating jobs. We spent a week on that.\n  Then we spent a week on taxing the rich, and everybody knew that \nwasn't going to go anywhere.\n  I think we spent a month on interest rates on student loans. \nEverybody knew there was a bipartisan solution to that, but nobody \nwanted to go there until the President had a whole month of going to \nuniversity campuses to blame Republicans for not passing a bill that \nwould keep interest rates low on student loans.\n  Then we spent last week on the DISCLOSE Act. Everybody knew that \nwasn't going to go anyplace.\n  So we have had a whole spring and summer in this body of \naccomplishing nothing because there is a strategy between the White \nHouse and the leadership of the Senate to help this President get \nreelected. And to keep away from issues the people of this country are \nconcerned about, which are the economy and creating jobs and the fact \nthat this White House and this Senate aren't going to do anything to \nwork through those issues.\n  Here in the Senate it is an issue of politics and not an issue of \nprocess. I think the American people know the games being played, and \nthey are sick and tired of it.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 406, H.R. 4970, the House-passed Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act; provided further that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate-passed violence \nagainst women bill, S. 1925, with a modification that strikes sections \n805 and 810 related to the immigration provisions; that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio agreed to by \nboth leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the passion of \nthe Senator from Iowa on behalf of the Republican majority and Speaker \nBoehner, and, frankly, I have to say it is offensive to say that the \nissue of violence against women is about politics. This is about women \nwho are abused, women who are powerless to fight back, and\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nwomen being able to get the protection they need in this country that \nhas provided protection for a very long time, to make sure women who \nare immigrants, women who live in a tribe, women who are gay and \nlesbian, women who are on college campuses get the protection this \nlegislation supports. This is not about politics, this is about \nviolence and this country standing up and saying we are going to \nprotect them.\n  Make no mistake about it, what the Republicans are saying is that \nthey want to move this bill to conference so they can strip out those \nprovisions. Well, they have crossed a line--a line that in the history \nof this nonpolitical, bipartisan bill has been so deeply important to \nso many of us. They made this bill about politics just now. I find that \noffensive.\n  What they want is to take the Senate's bipartisan-passed bill, \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats here, send it to \nconference, and then pick it apart. They want to take it to conference \nso they can have a discussion about which women in this country deserve \nprotection and which do not. They want to pit one group of women \nagainst another. This is not a game. It is not politics. And it \ncertainly is not a game I am going to play. The new protections in this \nbill have been supported by Republicans and Democrats, groups across \nthis country, and millions of Americans. They are not bartering chips, \nand it is not about politics.\n  The objection of the Senator on behalf of the Republicans raises \nissues that really are nothing more than a smokescreen. They do not \nwant to be out in front saying they are willing to discriminate against \ncertain women. They would rather hide behind these procedural \nobjections. But I would remind all our colleagues that these procedural \nobjections they are out here talking about--the politics--have been \nroutinely overcome here in the Senate. Just as I said a few minutes \nago, the transportation and jobs bill we passed a month ago, the blue \nslip issue was overcome. The FAA reauthorization last year funding our \nNation's airports--overcome. The Food Safety Act--overcome. The Travel \nPromotion Act. All those had blue slip issues, and all of them were \novercome, and there was a reason why--leadership and the will to do the \nright thing.\n\n  So let me make it abundantly clear. This is not about politics. It is \nabout protecting women in this country. It is about making sure we do \nwhat is right for so many women who are looking to Congress to put in \nplace the protections they deserve.\n  So the ball is in the Speaker's court now. He is going to have to \ntalk to women across the country about why their protections are at \nrisk because of politics. But I want everyone to be clear: We are not \ngoing to compromise on the issues that are so important to so many \nwomen and throw them under the bus. That is not what we have fought for \nyear after year on bipartisan legislation when we passed the Violence \nAgainst Women Act before. It is inclusive, it is bipartisan, and it is \nabove ideology and partisan games. It is a bill that makes sure that no \nmatter who you are or where you live or whom you love, you are \nprotected in this great country in which we live.\n  Politics has no place in this. I would agree with the Senator from \nIowa. Who is playing politics? We will leave it up for those who are \nwatching. What I have asked is that the Senate do what we have done \nmany times on many bills--move this bill to the House in a bipartisan \nway and pass it, and then politics won't matter, women will be covered.\n  I hope our Senate colleagues who have objected and the Speaker will \nreconsider. They can easily pass this bill today or next month, put it \nin place, and women in this country can say the leaders of this country \nare fighting for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I just want to do one thing in terms of \nresponding to Senator Grassley, who is a friend. We enjoy a very good \nrelationship on the Judiciary Committee, and we are just friends. But \nthe idea that these new provisions in the VAWA bill are political just \ncouldn't be further from the truth.\n  Let me talk about just one provision. It is about women on Indian \nreservations who get abused by a partner or a boyfriend or husband who \nisn't Native. And this happens all the time. This provision gave \njurisdiction to the tribes to prosecute these individuals.\n  I am on the Indian Affairs Committee. I talk to tribal leaders all \nthe time. I go to reservations all the time. My colleagues have no idea \nhow grateful tribal leaders were and how important this was. One out of \nevery three Indian women in this country is raped at some time in her \nlife, and by far the largest majority of that is not by male Indians, \nit is by non-Indians. I can't think of anything that is less political. \nI just can't. And I ask my colleagues to think, to give a second of \nthought before they say stuff like that.\n  It really is, as Senator Murray said, offensive to her. I actually \nfound it more sad. I find it sad.\n\n\n              The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about diabetes. And the \nPresiding Officer has been such a champion in talking about the money \nthat can be saved in our health care system by the prevention of \nchronic disease.\n  The burden of chronic disease in our country is staggering. Chronic \ndisease affects half of all American adults, and 7 out of 10 deaths \neach year are due to chronic disease. If current trends continue, by \nthe year 2020, 52 percent of American adults will either have type 2 \ndiabetes or elevated glucose levels, known as prediabetes, and diabetes \ncan often lead to other chronic diseases, such as heart disease.\n  But as grim as these statistics are for our country, we also have \nsome of the best health care researchers in the world. A few years ago, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, conducted a \npilot program called the Diabetes Prevention Program in two cities: St. \nPaul, MN, and Indianapolis, IN. This program, which was administered by \nthe YMCA, is a program focusing on 16 weeks of nutritional training, \neating healthy, and physical activity. It costs about $300 per \nparticipant. The results of this pilot were extraordinary. Among adults \nwith prediabetes--who are at the highest risk for developing type 2 \ndiabetes--the program reduced chances that a participant would be \ndiagnosed with diabetes by 58 percent. For adults over the age of 60, \nit reduced the likelihood of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by 71 \npercent.\n  That is why Senator Lugar and I introduced legislation in 2009 to \nauthorize the National Diabetes Prevention Program as a grant program \nthrough the CDC. This bill was passed as part of the health care law \nand is helping community-based organizations such as the YMCA \nadminister the program across the country. No one can participate in \nthis program if it is not available, which is why we needed the CDC to \nhelp expand the program and scale it up. Thanks to their work and to \nour provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the YMCA is now offering the \nDiabetes Prevention Program at more than 300 sites in 30 States.\n  But we also need health insurers to pay for the program to make sure \neveryone who needs it can get it. We know that when eligible adults \nparticipate in the program, it saves everyone money. In fact, the CEO \nof United Healthcare told me that they will cover this. Why? Because \nthey save $4 for every $1 they invest in the program because their \nbeneficiaries are healthier. And the Urban Institute estimated that \nimplementing community programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program \ncould save $191 billion nationally, with 75 percent of the savings--\nmore than $142 billion--going to Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  That is why the Federal Government should also invest in this cost-\nsaving program for seniors. Nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries \nhad diabetes in 2010. The Diabetes Prevention Program costs about $300 \nper participant, as compared to more than $6,000 a year in added health \ncare costs for someone with type 2 diabetes. There is no question that \nby preventing diabetes, we can all save money while keeping our seniors \nhealthier.\n  That is why I introduced legislation yesterday with my friends, \nSenators Lugar, Rockefeller, Collins, and Shaheen, to allow Medicare to \ncover the National Diabetes Prevention Program. We are doing this to \nhelp our\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nseniors enjoy their golden years while staying as healthy as possible. \nWe are also doing it because it is the fiscally responsible thing to \ndo. That is why the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, and the American \nCouncil on Aging have all endorsed this legislation. The National \nAssociation of Chronic Disease Directors, the National Association of \nState Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs, and the YMCA of the USA have \nalso endorsed the bill, as have 79 State and local organizations.\n  We know a really good way to prevent type 2 diabetes, and we know how \nto do it while saving the Federal Government billions of dollars. In \nfact, we know doing it will save the Federal Government billions of \ndollars.\n  Let's all here work together to prevent chronic disease in our \ncountry. I urge the Presiding Officer and my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to join me in guaranteeing that every senior has access to \nthe Diabetes Prevention Program when they need it.\n\n\n                         I-35W Bridge Collapse\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize that today is the fifth anniversary of a tragedy in my home \nState--the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. The collapse \nkilled 13 people and injured 145 others. That collapse was a shock to \nMinnesotans and to the country. How could a bridge on our Interstate \nHighway System collapse? It underscores the importance, of course, of \ninvesting in our infrastructure. We did move quickly to replace the \nbridge--and it is a beautiful bridge--thanks to the leadership of \nSenator Klobuchar and others.\n  I wish to say a few words about the response by the people and the \nfirst responders in Minneapolis and the metropolitan area. It was \namazing. All the first responders had interoperable radio signals. \nPeople in Minneapolis ran to the bridge to help. People did heroic \nthings. I am very proud of Minnesota. I am proud of Mayor Rybak and the \nresponse of other first responders in the metropolitan area. I am so \nproud to represent Minnesota.\n  My heart goes out to the families of those who perished that day and \nalso to their loved ones and their friends and also to the survivors \nwho are still recovering in so many different ways.\n  I urge my colleagues not to forget that day. We need to invest in our \ninfrastructure to make sure this doesn't happen again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis great remarks. He really does care about Minnesota. It is a nice \nState.\n\n\n                             Iran Sanctions\n\n  Mr. President, in a few hours the Iran sanctions bill is likely to \npass both the House and the Senate. That is very good news because when \nit comes to Iran, time's a wastin'. We need to ratchet up the pressure. \nAnd this is a powerful package that will paralyze the Iranian economy. \nIt tightens the screws tighter, tighter, tighter, so that the Iranians \nwill have no choice but to see their economy basically in desperate \nshape if they continue to pursue obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  I thank my colleague, Chairman Johnson of the Banking Committee, who \nhas put so much time and effort into the Iran sanctions bill and done \nsuch a great job.\n  I thank Ranking Member Shelby. We go to the gym in the Senate at \nabout the same time early in the morning, and we have talked about this \nbill repeatedly. I know how much he cares about it.\n  I thank my colleague from New Jersey, whom I have worked with on this \nissue long and hard and who has taken a great leadership role. Senator \nMenendez has been relentless in pushing this bill, and the many of us \nwho wish not to see a nuclear Iran owe Senator Menendez a great deal of \nthanks.\n  I thank my friend Senator Kirk, who, even though he is not physically \npresent in the Chamber, has made this his highest priority. We have \nworked together on this issue a long time, and we continue to wish him \na speedy recovery.\n  I believe that when it comes to Iran, of course, we should never take \nthe military option off the table, but I believe--as almost everyone in \nthis Chamber believes, our President believes, Prime Minister Netanyahu \nbelieves, and most Israelis believe--that economic sanctions are the \npreferred way to choke Iran's nuclear ambitions. If we can achieve \nsanctions and Iran truly backs off, not with a feint but in reality, by \nmeeting the three standards that both President Obama and Prime \nMinister Netanyahu have set--turning over any 20-percent enriched \nuranium, stop producing any 20-percent enriched uranium, and destroying \nthe new facility at Qom--then we will have achieved great victory. So \nwe have to move forward.\n  Earlier this year a group of bipartisan Senators--I was proud to be \namongst them--led by Senator Lieberman called on the European Union to \nexert more pressure on Iran by imposing an oil embargo on this rogue \nregime. Our European partners have done just that, and their oil \nboycott is working. That, too, is furthering to ratchet the pressure on \nIran's nuclear program.\n  Last November the report on Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA was \nits most alarming yet. It proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Iran \nis developing a nuclear weapon. And according to published reports, \nthey could have at least one workable weapon in less than a year and \nanother in 6 months after that. So we don't have much time, and \nratcheting up the economic pressure is imperative. We cannot dawdle. We \ncannot sit around and say: Let's wait 6 months and see if the existing \nsanctions are working. We have to ratchet up that pressure so that Iran \nsees that it is not in its interests economically, politically, \nmilitarily even, to pursue the path they have thus far chosen. The IAEA \nreport details a highly organized program dedicated to acquiring the \nskills necessary to produce and test a nuclear bomb. And earlier this \nyear DNI Director Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that \nIran's leaders even seem prepared to attack U.S. interests overseas. So \nwe know Iran is on the path to continued evil.\n  Just last week a suspected suicide bomber killed 6 people and wounded \n30 aboard an Israeli tourist bus in a coastal town in Bulgaria. Israel \nbelieves--and I tend to agree with them--that Hezbollah and Iran are to \nblame. Many questions remain about the bomb, but many Western \ncounterterrorist officials share the suspicions that Israel and I, \nfrankly, both have.\n  By giving our government the capability to impose even more crippling \nsanctions on Iran should they continue with their nuclear weapons \nprogram, the House and the Senate are putting forth a tough, smart plan \nto ratchet it up and prevent, hopefully, God willing, the very real \nthreat Iran poses to the United States and our allies, particularly \nIsrael.\n  I am not going to go over what the bill does. That has been talked \nabout. But I want to mention one other part of the bill before I sit \ndown. I am really happy and grateful to Chairman Johnson that the \nmeasure before us will also include language adopted from the Syrian \nHuman Rights Accountability Act. That is legislation I cointroduced \nthis year with my friend and colleague from New York, Senator \nGillibrand. The legislation would require the administration to \nidentify violators of human rights in Syria, it would call for reform \nand protection of the prodemocracy demonstrators, and it would also \nblock any financial aid and property transactions in the United States \ninvolving Syrian leaders involved in the crackdown on protesters.\n  If the Syrian Government, which in many respects operates as a client \nstate for the rogue Iranian regime, will not willingly change its \nbrutal approach and continues to violate the human rights of those \nseeking to exercise their voices, then we have to do everything we can \nto send the strongest message possible to that nation's leadership that \nthis behavior is beyond the pale and not without consequences.\n  In conclusion, I believe my colleagues Chairman Johnson, ranking \nmember Shelby, Senator Menendez, and Senator Kirk, have done an \nexcellent job crafting a comprehensive plan to arm the administration \nwith the tools it needs to put a stop to Iran's nuclear program. I urge \nmy colleagues to unanimously support the Iran Threat Reduction and \nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Servicemembers' Protection Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise today because servicemembers \nwho risk their lives protecting our Nation should not have to ever \nworry about predatory banking practices. They should not have to worry \nabout whether they can vote absentee while serving abroad. While they \nare fighting our Nation's foes, they should not have to worry about \nfighting a foreclosure. When they are serving our country, they should \nnot have to worry if their civilian job, if they are Guard or Reserve, \nwill be available when they return.\n  Unfortunately, too many do worry about that. Last week I joined the \nAttorney General of the United States at Wright Patterson Air Force \nbase near Dayton, OH, and spoke with men and women who serve our \ncountry, air men and air women. Also around that time I spoke to some \nGuard and Reserve, members of the Guard and Reserve who serve our \ncountry, about some of these fraudulent practices. When they are \noverseas, some of them do not know when they return if they are going \nto still have their job. They don't know what happens to them when they \ngo back to school if they are enrolled in a university, private or \npublic, 2-year or 4-year. They don't know what happens sometimes with \ntheir families in foreclosure or facing financial fraud.\n  We know that employment is critical for servicemembers and military \nfamilies. So is housing. So is protecting their ability to cast a \nballot. That is why I am sponsoring legislation, the Servicemembers' \nProtection Act, which is so vital to those men and women in uniform. It \nwould make critical changes to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act that \ncould improve the quality of life for members of the Armed Forces.\n  My bill first would strengthen housing and lending rights for \nservicemembers. Right now, a bank cannot foreclose upon servicemembers \nwhile they are serving overseas until it gets a court order. Yet the \nbank has no real obligation to actually investigate whether a homeowner \nis on active duty overseas. My bill would require lenders who want to \nforeclose on a home to conduct a meaningful investigation into a \nborrower's military status. It would increase civil penalties for \nviolating a servicemember's rights as a homeowner.\n  The bill also would strengthen enforcement for the Uniformed and \nOverseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, to make sure servicemembers' \nvotes are counted. It would create a nationwide standard for getting \nabsentee ballots to overseas servicemembers in a timely fashion.\n  Finally, it would make sure servicemembers can return to their jobs \nafter they have completed their military service with the seniority and \npay rate they would have earned if they remained continuously employed \nby the civilian employer.\n  We know the Guard and Reserve who are called up leave their civilian \njobs and too often come home to the uncertainty of, What happens when I \narrive home? Members of the Guard should not have to worry about \nwhether they will return home to the same job and the correct pay rate.\n  As citizens of a grateful Nation, we have a responsibility to do \nsomething--more than something to protect servicemembers' rights as \nthey sacrifice to keep our country safe. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to stand up for our servicemembers. It is time we serve \nthose who served us.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Alaska Interns\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am delighted to have a fine group of \nyoung Alaskans with me--not only here on the floor, but in my office \nfor four weeks, and I thank them for their help in Washington and \nreally for all of Alaska. They have been back here for a month and have \ndone a great job. It is always a true delight to have good, high energy \nyoung people from back home to help me in the work we do here. I am so \npleased they are with me.\n\n\n                             Tsunami Debris\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that people back home \nare talking about a lot. We are discussing the Federal Government's \nneed to plan for the increasing level of marine debris that is hitting \nthe Pacific coastline, whether it is out in Hawaii or all the way up \nnorth in Alaska. This debris is coming from the earthquake and tsunami \nthat struck Japan last March. This is a subject of great discussion and \ndebate for folks who are out fishing or walking our beaches.\n  We all know that tragic event claimed nearly 16,000 lives and \ndestroyed community infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods. Our prayers \ncontinue for the ones we have lost and those who have lost their loved \nones.\n  As horrifying as these natural disasters were, the Earth only shook \nanywhere from 3 to 5 minutes, and the tsunami rushed to the shore and \nthen receded. But the devastation to property and coastlines continues \nas debris has moved from the shores of Japan over a year and a half \nlater and we begin to see the debris pile up on our shores over here.\n  The Japanese Government has estimated that about 5 million tons of \ndebris were carried into the ocean. We have assumed that the majority \nof that either sank or will sink. There is no concrete idea of how much \nis still floating or when the bulk of it will reach our beaches, but in \nAlaska we know it has been arriving.\n  We saw the first evidence of it last winter, and it arrived ahead of \nthe projected timelines. It is understandable that we were not able to \nanticipate exactly when the tsunami debris would start arriving, but \nnow that we are starting to see it along the shoreline there is no \ndoubt we need to respond.\n  Last January, in trying to get ahead of the curve, if you will, I \nheld a roundtable in Anchorage to find out what our State and Federal \nagencies were doing to prepare for the debris we knew would be coming \nto our shores, how the interagency work was being coordinated, and how \nindividuals could report sightings and navigational issues.\n  I think I have mentioned on this floor that I have two sons out on a \nfishing vessel in the Gulf of Alaska. As they cross the gulf, I wonder \nif they will encounter debris from the tsunami?\n  We saw at one point in time a Japanese vessel that was literally a \nghost ship, a relic from that tsunami. The Coast Guard took that vessel \nout of the navigation channels. Alaskans and people who live on the \ncoast are very aware when there is stuff out in the water unchartered \nand unknown, and we want to understand and know a little bit more.\n  This past June, I joined the U.S. Coast Guard to see for myself what \nwas washing up on some of Alaska's remote shorelines and our beaches. \nWe flew out of Cordova, AK. We went to Kayak Island. Kayak sticks out \nfrom the coastline at an angle that allows it to collect an incredible \namount of marine debris on just an average year. So the reason to go to \nKayak was to see what might be there other than the typical marine \ndebris, unusual things like nets, ropes, and buoys. We saw real \nevidence of what is coming our way from the tsunami. We saw colored \nbuoys. We saw large Styrofoam blocks. There was a large container that \nhad washed up very recently.\n  We have a picture from NOAA that shows some of what we saw washed up \nthere on Kayak Island. These are all the plastic buoys. The black ones, \nwe were told, are what we see more of coming out of Japan.\n  Now, you may wonder, have we been clearly able to identify whether \nthese items came from Japan or if this was the usual marine debris? \nNOAA is working to sort all of that out, but there are signs that give \nus somewhat of an idea of whether what we saw out there on Kayak Island \nwas typical marine debris or not.\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\n  Many saw pictures of this huge dock that recently arrived on the \ncoastline in Oregon. Just look at the size here and think: this \nconcrete dock had flotations on either end and traveled all the way \nacross the Pacific literally in one huge slab up onto the Oregon beach. \nI think when folks looked at that picture, their word was, Wow.\n  Again, for those who are navigators and fishermen, if they run across \nsomething like this in the water it is real evidence of why we need to \nbe concerned.\n  This next photo is from somewhere in the Pacific. This shows the \nobjects that are creating, again, a hazard to navigation. These same \nmaterials are going to end up somewhere on a shoreline, whether it is \non our beaches or in our ports. Think about the impact this may have on \nsensitive habitats, making them unusable, possibly deadly for certain \nmarine animals, such as shore birds and other species that may rely on \nthem.\n  I think what is important to recognize from these three pictures I \nhave just shown is that we are seeing now the debris that is floating \non top or at least partly on top of the water. We are seeing it coming \nto U.S. shorelines earlier than anticipated because in addition to \nbeing carried by the currents from the ocean, this debris is being \nmoved along by the wind.\n  What we are seeing in Alaska primarily are those buoys that sit up \nclear out of the water. You can also see fishing boats, building \nmaterials, and roofs in this photograph. Again, this is what we can see \nbecause it is above the water.\n  So one of the real questions we need to ask is, What is below the \nwater? What is just below the surface that we can't see?\n  A couple of weeks ago, I met with some representatives from the \nYakutat Tlingit Tribe from Yakutat, AK. Yakutat is in the northern part \nof the Alaska panhandle, on the eastern side of the Gulf of Alaska. It \nis a very remote community. It is only accessible by air or by boat. \nThe closest community is hundreds of miles away and, Yakutat is \nsurrounded by National Park Service and Forest Service lands.\n\n  So this community--the tribe, city, borough--is meeting weekly to \nassess the debris that is coming up on their beaches, and they are \ntrying to put together a response. They have done some cleanup along 15 \nmiles of area beaches.\n  One beautiful beach is called Cannon Beach. It has black sand. It is \nabsolutely gorgeous. I visited it in March, and now we are seeing the \nStyrofoam, housing foam, and buoys coming up on it and the other \nbeaches near Yakutat. The community estimates that they have about 600 \npounds of marine debris per mile. The borough has 1,074 miles of \ncoastline, so this small village community is looking at the \npossibility of 3,000 tons of debris.\n  This next picture is actually from Yakutat. This details another \nproblem that our coastal communities are facing. What do we do with \nthis marine debris? Our landfills, particularly in southeastern Alaska, \nare maxed out or close to being maxed out. This landfill space that is \nalready filling up could very quickly be overwhelmed by tsunami debris. \nAnd not only are my residents working to clean up beaches with limited \nlandfills, often they are in very rugged and very remote locations, \nmany with no road to access. Sometimes they can't land a vessel or a \nboat on the shoreline because it is just too dangerous. So how do we \naccess this debris? That is a challenge.\n  It is also costly, and we are faced with the question of what do we \ndo with the debris we have collected?\n  Yakutat is exploring some pretty creative solutions and alternative \ndisposal solutions. Yakutat is one of those communities that has \nextremely high energy costs. If my memory serves me, I believe they pay \nin excess of 50 cents a kilowatt hour for their energy. So when they \nare dealing with challenges and problems, they try to find solutions \nthat help with their high cost of energy.\n  What Yakutat is looking at now is whether there is the potential for \nany waste-to-energy technologies that could deal with two problems: \nclean up debris and support long-term efforts to deal with the high \ncost of energy. It is kind of a two-for-one. They are trying to figure \nout how they can turn this problem into an energy source, and in this \nway they can support long-term community marine debris cleanup efforts. \nThis would be a creative solution for this small remote community, \nlargely on their own and facing truckloads of debris.\n  Now the State of Alaska has engaged in tsunami debris coordination, \nand I am told the Alaskan region representatives of various Federal \nagencies are as well, but headquarters of agencies across the Federal \nGovernment really need to be part of the plan and engage creatively to \naddress this accumulating debris.\n  I don't have my typical Alaska map here that I usually use when I \nspeak, but my State has an incredible coastline--more coastline than \nthe rest of the country put together--and we depend on our marine \nsources for livelihood and recreation. We value a healthy coastline to \nsupport a resilient marine environment. Our fisheries, our tourism, and \nour coastal communities are so dependent on a strong and sustainable \nregion.\n  So, think about this from the tourism perspective. When somebody is \npaying thousands of dollars to come up to Alaska to visit remote, wild \nareas, they are certainly going to be disappointed if they are greeted \nby a beach full of Styrofoam or pass by the many debris fields that are \naccumulating.\n  Communities up and down the coastline need assurance that the \nheadquarters of various agencies are going to be part of the cleanup \nplan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA compiled a document \ndenoting the debris removal authorities of Federal agencies. That \ndocument outlined that the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, \nDefense, Homeland Security, and Transportation all had a role to play \nin debris removal.\n  So for this reason--and using this federal memorandum as an example--\nI have asked the White House to establish and lead an interagency task \nforce to plan for tsunami debris. We also need to engage the relevant \nStates, tribes, local governments, and international partners by \ninviting them to participate in this task force. We all need to work \ntogether. We cannot leave a little community like Yakutat and say: \nClean up your section of the coastline.\n  I know private and government Japanese representatives have expressed \ninterest in helping with the debris problem. The ability for Japan to \noffer experience and technology with waste-to-energy devices could \nprovide a great opportunity for the U.S., Japan and public partnerships \nto come together and address the debris.\n  There are many reasons we need to act now. It is a difficult time of \nyear for many of us here in Washington, DC, to think about winter \nstorms. We are enjoying some pretty warm weather here. But we need to \nrecognize and think about what winter weather in Alaska will mean for \naccumulating debris. We have a lot of areas being impacted by tsunami \ndebris that have already had huge tide swings. If we add that to a \nwinter storm in areas with beaches, some of the debris we see will be \nburied deep by the sand, and will only be uncovered when snow melts. \nHowever even during the spring, accessing the coastline can be \nchallenging due to breakup conditions. We have extreme tides and, of \ncourse, the weather will also move the debris up into the tree line, \nmaking access and removal even more difficult.\n\n  This last picture will give my colleagues some indication of what I \nam talking about when we think about the Alaska coastline. This is in a \npart of the State called Montague Island. With good high tides and the \nweather we get, downed trees are part of the ocean accumulation on the \nshore. You can see tucked among the trees, kind of sprinkled like \nconfetti, some of the Styrofoam that has washed up. Again, this is \nmarine debris we are seeing. Think about how difficult it will be to \naccess some of this after winter storms.\n  Where debris lands on rough and rocky shorelines, wave action is \nexpected to break it up. We know that happens, and I am concerned about \nour marine life, birds and animals consuming smaller plastic particles \nthat have been broken down by this wave action. A piece of Styrofoam \nthat is easy to pick up today because it is reasonably good-sized is \ngoing to be much\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\nmore difficult to clean up when it has been broken down by wave action. \nSo, again, all of this argues for prompt action.\n  Maybe the best we can do for now is pick up the debris and store it \nsomewhere. But as we saw looking at the Yakutat picture, storing it in \na landfill in most of these communities is probably not going to be \nfeasible. Bailing technology could be available to Alaska communities \nfor about $10,000, and these machines would at least support the \nvoluntary cleanup efforts and provide a means to store the debris \nrather than force strained landfills to absorb the incoming debris. I \nthrow this out because I think it is important that we get creative \nabout this. We need to be exploring all available technologies to \nsupport the most efficient means to handle this tsunami debris and \nother marine debris for the long run.\n  Every year I attend an annual alternative energy fair. It is held in \nthe interior part of the State at Chena Hot Springs. We always learn \nsomething good and new at this energy fair. Last year, when I was \nthere, I saw a device that is actually in production. It is on-the-\nshelf technology. It may help turn much of the debris that is hitting \nour coastline into fuel. The device--I called it a gizmo but I know \nthere is a much more technical term for it--processes plastics into \nfuel with the capacity to produce as much as 2,400 gallons per day. \nWith fuel at over $6 a gallon in Yakutat, people are looking at this \nand saying, We can actually take some of the waste, the garbage, the \ndebris, the plastic, and turn that into fuel so we don't have to pay 6 \nbucks a gallon to fill up a four-wheeler, truck, or boat.\n  Given the tight budgets across the country, again, I think we need to \nbe creative. We need to identify and deploy all available resources and \nshare information. We need to leverage local knowledge and our coastal \nresidents' proximity to the debris, as well as their vested interest in \nthe cleanup efforts.\n  Our Federal agencies have regional staff and they have facility \nresources. Many run programs that are consistent with the objectives of \ntsunami debris response and mitigation. For those who would suggest, \nWell, if it has come up on your shore, it is your responsibility; there \nis no Federal role here; it is up to the States to figure this out, I \nwould remind them that in my State, much of our land is owned by the \nFederal Government. This picture here is of Montague Island. Montague \nIsland is entirely within the Chugach National Forest. And, in fact, \nover 60 percent of my State is owned by the Federal Government, so \nclearly the Federal Government has a role to play in cleaning up the \ndebris.\n  We also can't forget about the private interests in cleanup. Many \nindustries and private citizens are dependent on our navigable \nwaterways and healthy ecosystems. We need good communication, \nleadership, and a plan to guide an interagency and public-private \napproach to solve this challenge during what we all acknowledge are \ndifficult fiscal times. I commend the NOAA marine debris program for \ntheir coordination and response to this work, but the fact is they are \na small and an overtasked program. They need the help of their Federal \npartners to address this as a national priority.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing that marine \ndebris is a national problem as well as a priority, and a comprehensive \nresponse to tsunami debris that we are seeing on our shoreline in \nAlaska and other Pacific States, in addition to Hawaii, is past due.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the last few days we have been \nlectured numerous times that we must protect cyber critical \ninfrastructure; otherwise, our country is in jeopardy. Everybody agrees \nwith that statement. Enhancing cyber security is important to our \nnational security. I support efforts to strengthen our Nation against \ncritical cyber attacks.\n  However, I take issue with those who have come to the floor and \nargued that those who don't support this bill are against strengthening \nour Nation's cyber security. Disagreements over how to address policy \nmatters shouldn't evolve into accusations about a Member's willingness \nto tackle tough issues. The debate over cyber security legislation has \nturned from a substantive analysis of the merits into a political blame \ngame as to which side supports defending our Nation more. If we want to \ntackle big issues such as cyber security, we need to rise above \ndisagreements and work in a constructive manner. Disagreements over \npolicy should be openly and freely debated.\n  Unfortunately, this isn't how the debate on cyber security proceeded. \nInstead, before a real debate began, the majority leader cut that \ndebate off. As the discussion of cyber security began on the floor this \nweek, Senators stated that a failure to grant broad new powers to the \nFederal Government will lead to a cyber 9/11. I agree that if we fail \nto take action on cyber security, there could be a national security \nconsequence. However, I don't believe giving the Federal Government \nmore regulatory authority over business and industry, as supporters of \nthis bill propose, is the answer to strengthening cyber security.\n  Chief among my concerns with the pending bill is the role played by \nthe Department of Homeland Security. These concerns stem from oversight \nthat I have conducted on the implementation of a law called the \nChemical Facility Antiterrorism Standards Program. That acronym would \nbe CFATS. CFATS was the Department's first major foray into regulation \nof the chemical sector.\n  The Department of Homeland Security spent nearly $\\1/2\\ billion on \nthat program. Now, 5 years later, they have just begun to approve site \nsecurity plans for the more than 4,000 facilities designated under the \nrule.\n  I have continued to conduct oversight on this matter. Despite \nassurances from the Department of Homeland Security that they fixed all \nthe problems with CFATS, I keep discovering more problems. So now I am \nbaffled why we would take an agency that has proven problems with \noverseeing a critical infrastructure and give them chief responsibility \nfor our country's cyber security.\n  Additionally, I am concerned with provisions that restrict the way \ninformation is shared. The restrictions imposed under title VII of the \nbill are a step backward from other information-sharing proposals. This \nincludes the bill I have cosponsored, the SECURE IT bill. The bill \nbefore us places the Department of Homeland Security in the role of \ngatekeeper of cyber threat information. The bill calls for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to share the information in ``as close \nto real time as possible'' with other agencies. However, this surely \nwill create a bottleneck for information coming into the government.\n  Further, title VII includes restrictions on what types of information \ncan be shared, limiting the use of it for criminal prosecution, except \nthose that cause imminent harm.\n  This is exactly the type of restriction on information sharing that \nthe 9/11 Commission warned us about. In fact, the 9/11 Commission said, \n``the [wall] resulted in far less information sharing and \ncoordination.'' The 9/11 Commission further added, ``the removal of the \nwall that existed before 9/11 between intelligence and law enforcement \nhas opened up new opportunities for cooperative action.''\n  Why would we even consider legislation that could rebuild these walls \nthat threaten our national security? How much of a real debate have we \nhad on those issues I have raised? The lack of a real process in the \nSenate on this very bill amplifies my substantive concerns.\n  In fact, this is eerily reminiscent of the debate surrounding the \nhealth care reform bill. During that time, then-Speaker of the House \nPelosi declared, ``We have to pass the bill so that you can find out \nwhat is in it.'' Well, we all know how well that worked out. Years of \nlitigation later, the public is still learning what surprises the \nmajority and President Obama had in store for the Nation's health care \nsystem.\n  Now here we are, once again, in the last week before our August \nsummer break, tackling a serious problem that hasn't been given full \nprocess.\n  I do not want cyber security legislation to become another health \ncare reform bill. If we are serious about our\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\nNation's security, then shouldn't we treat it as serious as it really \nis? We all agree how serious it is.\n  We are told that the Senate has been working on cyber security for 3 \nto 5 years. However, we have not been working on this bill before us \nfor that long. The bill before us was introduced 13 days ago, and it \nwas only pending on the floor for 4 days before the motion for cloture \nwas filed. It did not go through the normal committee process. It was \nnot debated or amended. Instead, it was brought straight to the floor, \nand we are being forced to consider it under a very rushed schedule.\n  Talking about the danger of cyber attacks for years is not the same \nas discussing the impact of the actual text of the bill which could \nbecome law. The words on the 212 pages of the bill are what must be \nanalyzed, and analyzed in detail.\n  In fact, no one, except a handful of Senators, actually knows what \nthe bill says or might say. And, of course, that is a process that \ndebate in the U.S. Senate accomplishes or at least tries to accomplish.\n  We need full process and, unfortunately, that has not happened, and \nit does not look as if it will happen. Why won't it happen? Because the \nmajority leader has limited debate. This week we were told that a group \nof Senators and their staff were working on a compromise.\n  Again, that is something all of us as a body do not know much about. \nWe need an open debate in order to process this, as opposed to huddled, \nbackroom meetings.\n  I do not think this is the way we are supposed to legislate. The \npeople who elected us expect more. They expect transparency because \nthey know when you get transparency, you have accountability.\n  How many Senators are prepared to vote on something this important \nwithout knowing its impact because we have not followed regular order? \nAre we to once again pass a bill so that the American public can then, \nat that time, find out what is in it a la Speaker Pelosi's statement on \nhealth care reform?\n  These are questions that all Senators should consider. And our \ncitizens should know in advance what we are actually considering.\n  Yesterday, we heard claims that the amendments offered by Republicans \nwere part of some obstructionist tactic. Why isn't the same statement \nmade about the 77 or so amendments filed by Democrats? Somehow, are \nthey acceptable and not obstructionist?\n  I had three amendments that addressed specific provisions in the \nbill, and I wanted to have a debate on them.\n  For example, I have an amendment to strike the provision in the bill \nthat creates a cause of action against the Federal Government. What \ndoes that cause of action do? That provision waives sovereign immunity, \nprovides for automatic damages, and provides for an award of attorney's \nfees.\n  This provision is, obviously, a gift to the trial lawyers lobby, \nwhich American taxpayers should not have to pay for. And I do not think \nclass action lawsuits against the government will help with cyber \nsecurity.\n  Another amendment of mine would have removed industry-specific carve-\nouts from the bill. This is another example of how backroom deal making \ntakes place so as to get support and build support for a bill. We saw \nthis happen with the health care reform bill. You know the famous \n``Cornhusker Kickback'' that was agreed to in order to pass ObamaCare, \nand this process reminds me of that.\n  Here, to get support from companies in the information technology \nindustry, the bill clearly states those companies cannot be identified \nas critical cyber infrastructure. So to build support for this bill--\nbut without people knowing what is in the bill--the authors carved out \nthese companies from having to comply with the bill.\n  For example, under this carve-out, say an information technology \ncompany builds a router that has a flaw that is exploited by hackers. \nThat router is purchased by every sector of the critical \ninfrastructure, including power, water, and probably a lot of others \nthat I ought to be able to name.\n  If that router flaw is exploited, and if that is attacked, the \ncompanies that bought the router are held responsible. However, the \ncompany that made the faulty router is not.\n  It is obvious how absurd this is. It is obvious how much of a major \ngiveaway to a key industry it is, just to give the appearance of \nprivate sector support. This is not how we should handle cyber \nsecurity, and I have an amendment to strike this provision. We should \nopenly debate this issue and discuss whether this is the right course \nof action to give a carve-out to a specific segment of industry.\n  Again, the carve-out was a deal cut with one purpose: to limit \nopposition to the bill. Well, that was not good policy in 2009 on the \n``Cornhusker Kickback'' in the health care reform debate, and we should \nlearn from that lesson that it is, obviously, not good policy in 2012.\n  I also know that Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had an amendment \nthat the Congressional Budget Office issued a score on the cost of the \nbill before it could take effect.\n  Why were the supporters of the bill opposed to doing that? Do they \nbelieve they have a right to spend millions or billions of taxpayers' \ndollars at will without making the amount public? Are the supporters of \nthe bill really prepared to vote for this bill without revealing how \nmuch it will cost?\n  But I will not get a chance to debate my amendments or Senator \nJohnson's amendment before the cloture vote because that is how the \nmajority leader runs the U.S. Senate.\n  There are serious questions about this bill. It needs to be amended. \nWe need to discuss changes. Unfortunately, it does not look as though \nthat is going to happen.\n  I know some will, again, say that this has been a long process. The \nonly thing true about that statement is that the issue and problem has \nbeen discussed for a long time--but not discussed for a long time on \nthis bill.\n  If we are serious about addressing this problem, then let's deal with \nit appropriately. Rushing something through that will impact the \ncountry in such a massive way is not the way the most deliberative body \nin the world, the U.S. Senate, should do its business. It is not good \nfor the country, and it is, obviously, not good for the reputation of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma has asked consent to speak at 6:30 p.m. I will take about \n10 or 15 minutes, which would put us about 5 minutes past that time. So \nI ask unanimous consent to speak for about 15 minutes, if that is \nacceptable to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is perfectly all right. And I ask unanimous consent \nthat at the conclusion of the remarks of my friend from New Jersey I be \nrecognized for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank my colleague \nfor his courtesy.\n\n\n                         Death of Oswaldo Paya\n\n  Mr. President, while we are focused on issues here at home--and \ncertainly we should be--there are incidents taking place around the \nworld, and those of us who care about freedom and democracy and human \nrights, those of us like myself who sit on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, also have our focus on what is happening in other places in \nthe world.\n  I come to the floor to talk about the violence and repression that \ncontinues in the country of Cuba--this time in a dramatic and brazen \nattempt to exercise power through fear and intimidation over those who \nwant nothing more than to see the day when the people of Cuba are \nfree--and against members of the international community.\n  Once again, I am forced to come to the floor to put a spotlight on \nwhat is happening inside of Cuba and all those who put their lives on \nthe line for freedom and human rights around the world.\n  The information we are receiving from both public reports and other \ninformation from Cuba concerning the circumstances surrounding the \ndeath of Oswaldo Paya--the island's most prominent and respected human \nrights advocate--is disturbing. It underscores the continued brutality \nand repression\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\nof the Castro regime, and it demands a response from the international \ncommunity, as well as from ourselves as part of that community.\n  The facts as we know them are that 50 prodemocracy activists were \narrested and detained at the funeral--at the funeral--of Oswaldo Paya. \nAt a funeral--they were not demonstrating, they were not marching or \ncarrying signs, they were not engaged in acts of civil disobedience of \nany kind. They were not violating any laws. They were attending a \nfuneral.\n  Hundreds gathered peacefully. Family, friends, and those who want \nnothing more than a free and democratic Cuba were at a funeral mourning \nthe death of their hero, Oswaldo Paya.\n  But the arrest and detention of 50 dissidents who were mourning the \nloss of a friend and loved one is not the whole story of how far this \nregime will go.\n  The circumstances surrounding Oswaldo Paya's death leave any \nreasonable person to wonder what may have really happened on that road \nin Cuba that ended in the tragic automobile accident that took the life \nof Oswaldo Paya.\n  Paya's daughter Rosa Maria Paya immediately challenged the regime's \nversion of events, stating that the family had received information \nfrom the survivors that their car was repeatedly rammed--rammed--by \nanother vehicle.\n  She said:\n\n       So we think it's not an accident. They wanted to do harm \n     and then ended up killing my father.\n\n  The family also said that Oswaldo Paya was targeted in a similar \nincident 2 weeks earlier in Havana. The same thing: an effort as they \nwere driving to ram them off the road. In retrospect, the family now \nsees that incident as a warning from the regime.\n  What we know is the car, driven by a politician from Spain, Angel \nCarromero, a citizen of Spain, and Aron Modig, an activist in Sweden, \nwas involved in the fatal automobile accident that killed Paya and his \nCuban colleague Harold Cepero.\n  Of course, we have no proof of that. But we do know Carromero and \nModig survived the accident, and they obviously know exactly what \nhappened that day. These are two individuals--one is a Spanish citizen, \nthe other one is a Swedish citizen--who were involved in helping Paya \npromote, from an international perspective, the views of his civil \nsociety movement toward peaceful change in democracy and human rights.\n  But instead of getting the two survivors' real story, in a \ndemonstration of the twisted nature of the Castro regime, the Cuban \nMinistry of Interior detained, without consular access, the two \nforeigners who survived the crash and then paraded Modig, the Swede, \nbefore a Ministry of Interior press conference, where he was clearly \nforced to apologize for working with Paya and ``illegally aiding the \nCuban opposition.''\n  The driver of the car, Carromero, the Spanish citizen, was less lucky \nthan his Swedish colleague. It appears he will not be allowed to speak \nfreely for years to come, courtesy of the Castro regime. They have \nformally charged him with vehicular manslaughter in the crash.\n  Carromero, like Modig, was forced to offer a mea culpa, which was \nmade available in a video presentation hosted by Castro's nefarious \nMinistry of the Interior.\n  The regime's logic has to boggle the mind of any reasonable person \nwho cares about the rule of law.\n  It is also my understanding, according to reports from Cuba, that--in \na move typical of the Castro regime--Spanish diplomats were prohibited \nfrom seeing or meeting with Carromero until yesterday.\n  Meanwhile, the grieving widow of Oswaldo Paya has expressed outrage \nand has rejected Castro's official report regarding the death of her \nhusband and the circumstances surrounding the accident which has now \nblamed the accident on the actions of Angel Carromero, who was driving \nthe car.\n  Paya's widow has said: ``Until I'm able to speak with Angel or with \nAron, the last two people who saw my husband alive, have access to the \nexpert reports, and have the advice of people independent of the Cuban \ngovernment, I can have no idea what really happened that day.''\n  I cannot be certain that the regime killed Oswaldo Paya, but the \ncircumstances of his death are highly suspicious. There is no question \nthat the regime had no motive to kill Oswaldo Paya. Oswaldo Paya was \nmost--one of the most prominent opponents of the Castro dictatorship, a \nCatholic activist who funded the Christian Liberation Movement in 1988.\n  He is best known for the Varela Project, a petition drive he launched \nin 2002 that called for free elections and other rights. That drive led \nthe Cuban Government to adopt a constitutional amendment making the \nCommunist system in Cuba irrevocable. It followed that with the 2003 \nBlack Spring, which arrested 75 of the most prominent Cuban activists \nin that year.\n  Paya had become the most known, most visible face of Cuba's peaceful \nopposition movement. The European Parliament awarded him the Sakharov \nPrize for Freedom of Thought in 2002. That year, he was also nominated \nfor a Nobel Peace Prize by hundreds of parliamentarians in a campaign \nled by his friend Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic President.\n  Paya was determined that Cuba and Cubans should enjoy the benefits of \nfreedom and democracy and he committed his life to that cause and he \nmay very well have lost his life to that cause. We cannot continue to \nturn our backs on those inside Cuba struggling in peaceful ways to \npromote democracy and human rights. We cannot allow the violence and \nthe repression, the brutal detentions to continue without consequence. \nWe cannot allow innocent members of the international community to be \nbrutalized and victimized by the Castro brothers so they can hide the \ntruth without the international community standing together and holding \nthem accountable for their repressive and illegal actions.\n  Will the Castro regime stop at nothing, nothing to repress the rights \nof its people? Can we turn our back on the rule of law on the Cuban \npeople, on the facts of this case, on Mr. Carromero or can we once \nagain have that wink and nod and say: Oh, well, you know, it has been \nover 50 years; things are changing for the better in Cuba, and we \nshould let bygones be bygones, as people languish in jail, as people \ndie at the hands of the regime, as we see the hunger strikers who give \nup their lives because of the brutality they are facing, to try to \nrivet the world's attention in this regard.\n  Some say we should permit Castro's hooligans to parade across our \nNation, which we seem to give visas to, spewing lies while American \nAlan Gross sits in a prison simply because he brought some \ncommunications equipment for the Jewish community in Havana to be able \nto collaborate and to inform each other. That was his crime. He has now \nbeen in prison, a U.S. citizen, for 2 years, languishing in Castro's \njails, not to mention thousands of Cuban political prisoners who suffer \nin Cuban prisons.\n  As I have said on this floor over and over, to me, the silence is so \ndeafening from so many of our colleagues. They may have a different \nview than I do about how we promote democracy, but I do not hear them \nspeak out about these human rights abuses, about the deaths in Castro's \nprisons, about those who can get knocked off the side of a road and \nkilled. The silence in that respect is deafening.\n  So there are some of us who are committed to making sure that silence \nis broken. Today, I am asking my colleagues to join me in sending a \nletter to Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, \ndemanding that the United Nations and the Human Rights Council \nimmediately undertake a full and thorough investigation of the \ncircumstances surrounding Oswaldo Paya's tragic death and the detention \nof Angel Carromero. We must demand the truth about these tragic events \nthat took the life of Cuba's most devoted human rights advocate.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in that respect. We have supported \ndemocracy movements around the world. They have often made a big \ndifference, from Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, Soviet Jewry, Alexander \nSolzhenitsyn, and so many others. When we side on behalf of those \nstruggling against repressive regimes for democracy and human rights, \nit makes a difference. It can make a difference in this regard as well.\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\n  I am hoping our colleagues will join us in helping break the silence, \non behalf of the memory of Oswaldo Paya and on behalf of all those who \nlose their lives every day or their liberty simply because they \npeacefully choose to try to change the nature of the country in which \nthey live. It is something America should be a beacon of light for, \nsomething I hope we can shine very brightly, and in doing so, create a \nprotective element to those who are peacefully trying to create change \ninside Cuba. We should do no less.\n\n\n                               ALAN GROSS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, 32 months almost 3 full years. That is \nhow long Maryland native Alan Gross has been held by Cuba as a \npolitical prisoner.\n  Alan Gross went to Cuba in 2009 on an USAID contract to help install \nwireless Internet. The Cuban government responded by putting him in \njail. They declared him a spy, ran a sham trial and sentenced him to 15 \nyears in prison.\n  Alan Gross is from Potomac, MD, and like me, studied social work at \nthe University of Maryland. I have met his wife on numerous occasions. \nHer focus and strength are truly inspiring. While her husband has been \nheld in a Cuban prison, she has held down the fort and held the \npressure on the Cuban government for its poor treatment of her husband.\n  And Alan Gross has held strong in the face of his unfair \nimprisonment. To maintain his physical and mental strength, he would \npace his room and do pull ups. Unfortunately, however his health has \ndeclined. He has lost more than 100 pounds, is having difficulty \nwalking, and--most worryingly--has had a mass develop behind his \nshoulder. Rather than act humanely, the Cuban government has been \nreluctant to share information on Mr. Gross's medical condition.\n  At home, Mr. Gross's mother is facing inoperable lung cancer and the \nfamily is concerned he will not have a chance to say goodbye. That is \nwhy the Gross family petitioned the Cuban government to allow him to \ncome home for 2 weeks to see his mother for her 90th birthday.\n  This request was made following a U.S. Federal judge's humane \ndecision to allow a Cuban intelligence agent on probation in the United \nStates to return home to see his ailing brother. Their plea was met \nwith silence.\n  Cuba has held Alan Gross as a political hostage, trying to leverage \ntheir possession of an American citizen for concessions from the United \nStates. While Cuba might oppose U.S. policy, it has a responsibility to \nbehave humanely to its people.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for his continued focus on the detention \nof Alan Gross. The Senator has been one trying to improve relations \nbetween the United States and Cuba, but has put those efforts on hold \nbecause of their unwillingness to release Mr. Gross. I appreciate his \ndecision and his unrelenting work to see Mr. Gross freed.\n  And most importantly, I want to send my thoughts and prayers to Mr. \nGross, his wife Judy and their family. I think about you every day and \nam hopeful your family will be reunited soon. The pain you face is \nunfair, but the strength you show is inspiring. I promise we will \ncontinue to work to bring Alan back to Maryland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when we came back to session this week, I \nwas pleased to see a very good friend of mine on the floor, of a \ncompletely different philosophy from mine and a different background \nand a different State, talking about--being somewhat critical of my \nposition on global warming, which everybody knows I have been involved \nin for some 12 years since the Koyoto treaty, which was never before \nus.\n  Nonetheless, I appreciated the fact that we had a chance to resurrect \nthat issue because, to my knowledge, nobody has uttered the term \n``global warming'' since 2009. It has been completely refuted in most \nareas. But I was pleased to hear my good friend from Vermont talking \nabout it because he and I have a very honest relationship with each \nother but a total disagreement. We are able to go over those things.\n  Then again today two things happened. First of all, we had the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts come down to the floor and was somewhat \nquite critical of me and anyone who is a skeptic. I think it is \nimportant to realize that to understand--so you understand, when we are \ntalking, what we are referring to.\n  Those people who believe the world is coming to an end because of \nglobal warming and that is all due to manmade anthropogenic gases, we \ncall those people alarmists. Those people such as myself who have \nlooked at it very carefully and have come to the conclusion that is not \nhappening and the fact or the assertion that global warming is \noccurring today and it is occurring because of the release of \nCO2 and anthropogenic gases, methane, and such as that, it \nis a hoax, which I said way back in 2003. This became quite a charge to \na lot of people, a hoax that--the fact that all of this is happening is \ndue to manmade gases. I believe it is the greatest hoax ever \nperpetrated on the American people.\n  As a result of that, a lot of people are trying to do things to this \ncountry that are detrimental. By the way, we also had this morning--it \nwas enjoyable. This is the first time since 2009 that the Environment \nand Public Works Committee has had a hearing on global warming, on the \nscience or lack of science behind global warming.\n  I was delighted to see all these things resurrected. I know it is not \nproper to talk about your own books on the floor, and I do not do it, \nexcept I have to do it because it was mentioned by some of my \nadversaries, my book which was called ``The Greatest Hoax.'' Things \nwere taken out of this book so I had to defend them. Let me just \nmention, if I can in this fairly short period of time that I have, I \nthink it is only 30 minutes, some of the things that were stated, first \nof all, on the floor by the senior Senator from Massachusetts and then \nmake some comments about the hearing this morning.\n  In fact, I am glad it is coming to the surface again. First of all, I \nwas referred to as a ``skeptic.'' I mentioned just now that skeptics \nare those who do not believe what I referred to as the hoax. He \nreferred to us as ``flat earthers.'' I learned a long time ago that if \nthey do not have logic on their side, they do not have the science on \ntheir side, they respond with name calling. I have been called a lot of \nnames. Let me just name a few. This comes right out of the book and \nsome of the things that were said this morning. The ``noisiest climate \nskeptic,'' ``the Senate's resident denier bunny,'' ``traitor,'' \n``dumb,'' ``crazy man,'' ``science abuser,'' ``Holocaust denier,'' \n``villain of the month,'' ``hate filled,'' ``war mongering,'' \n``Neanderthal,'' ``Genghis Khan''. It goes on and on. I will submit \nthis for the Record.\n  But quite often we hear these things, it is only because there is not \nlogic or science on their side. So they do name calling, which is fine. \nTo me, that gets attention, and it needs to have the attention. The \nsecond thing, one of the other things that came out this morning, the \nstatement was made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and I am \nquoting now, I believe: There are 6,000 peer-reviewed studies that say \nthat no one peer-reviewed study that proves it is not happening.\n  There is not one, not one peer-reviewed study. A peer-reviewed study \nis a study that is published and then the peers review it. I think that \nis a process that is necessary. Consequently, that statement was made. \nThat statement just flat is not right. In fact, let me go ahead and \ntalk about some of these studies. If we look at the Harvard-Smithsonian \nstudy, that was a study which examined the results of more than 240 \npeer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers over the \npast four decades.\n  The study covers a multitude of geophysical and biological climate \nindicators. They came to the conclusion--this is a Harvard-Smithsonian \npeer-reviewed study. They came to the conclusion that climate change is \nnot real, that the science is not accurate.\n  Dr. Fred Seitz. Dr. Fred Seitz is a former president of the National \nAcademy of Science. He said: ``There is no convincing scientific \nevidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other \ngreenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\ncause catastrophic heating of the earth's atmosphere and disruption of \nthe earth's climate.''\n  I would like to pause at this moment, because I see the majority \nleader on the floor of the Senate, and inquire if they care to have \nsome leadership time. I would be very glad to yield to them that time. \nApparently, that is not the case.\n  Thirdly, this is something that happened very recently. One of the \nuniversities, George Mason University, surveyed 430 weathercasters and \nfound that only 19 percent of the weathercasters felt catastrophic \nglobal warming is taking place and is a result of human activity.\n  That is quite a change from what it used to be. That means 81 percent \nof those weathercasters that we all see every night are saying that is \nnot true.\n  Dr. Robert Laughlin, a Nobel Prize-winning Stanford University \nphysicist, said:\n\n       Please remain calm. The earth will heal itself. Climate is \n     beyond our power to control. The earth doesn't care about \n     government and legislation. Climate change is a matter of \n     geologic time, something the earth does on its own without \n     asking anyone's permission or explaining itself.\n\n  I think the statement is certainly not an accurate statement that was \nmade this morning. By the way, in terms of the climate change, I would \nlike to suggest there is a Web site called Climate Depot by Marc \nMorano. In this, we can find multitudes of peer-reviewed studies. There \nis not time to go over them all, but we certainly can find them on that \nparticular Web site.\n  Another statement made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts this \nmorning was when they were talking about a former climate skeptic, \nRichard Muller, M-u-l-l-e-r. He changed his mind through extensive \nresearch, implying he at one time was a skeptic and he is now an \nalarmist. Let me tell you about Richard Muller. In 2008 Richard Muller \nsaid that the bottom line is that there is a consensus. The \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--we will talk about that \nlater. The President needs to know what the IPCC says. Second, they say \nthat most of the warming of the last 50 years is probably due to \nhumans. You need to know that this is from carbon dioxide and that you \nneed to know the understanding of the technology.\n\n  Mr. President, I was talking about and responding to the speech made \non the floor this morning by the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I think the main thing I got across at that time was the assertion \nthat was made that there are 6,000 peer-reviewed studies that say not \none peer-reviewed study proves that global warming is not happening and \nthat anthropogenic gases would be the cause of it. I know it wasn't the \nintention of the senior Senator from Massachusetts to say something \nthat was factually wrong, but I did read several peer-reviewed studies \nand referred to the Web site climatedepot.com, if anyone is interested \nin that.\n  Second is the fact that the Senator from Massachusetts--and then \nagain in the hearing this morning, Richard Muller was referred to \nseveral times as being a former skeptic who converted over to an \nalarmist. I suggested--and I read something to show that, in my \nopinion, he never was a skeptic. I would like to make some comments \nabout Richard Muller.\n  If you go to my Web site, you will find about 1,000 scientists who \nhave come around and said: No, this assertion that we are having \ncatastrophic global warming due to anthropogenic, manmade gases is not \ncorrect. Muller is not on that list. However, when they say that he is \nthe one and made such a big issue, I will quote a couple people about \ntheir expressing themselves on the credibility of Richard Muller.\n  Professor Judith Curry, a climatologist at the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology, stated ``way over-simplistic and not at all convincing, in \nmy opinion.'' She was talking about the comments by Muller. She also \nsaid, ``I don't see that their paper adds anything to our understanding \nof the causes of the recent warming.'' That is on the paper submitted \nby Richard Muller.\n  Roger Peilke, Jr., said that the ``bigger issue is how the New York \nTimes let itself be conned into running [Muller's] op-ed.''\n  Michael Mann is the guy who started this whole thing at the U.N., \nputting it together. He had the hockey stick thing that has been \ntotally discredited. He said:\n\n       It seems, in the end--quite sadly--that this is all really \n     about Richard Muller's self-aggrandizement.\n\n  So much for the statements that were made to give credibility to \ntheir side by Richard Muller.\n  I think another thing that was stated this morning was we have \nevidence of climate change all around--wildfires, drought and \nvegetation, and all that type. Then they talked about glaciers. Well, \nlet me just share the facts about that, which I think are very \nsignificant, as far as the droughts and all that are concerned. Again, \nthis is a statement made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts this \nmorning, talking about all these things that are happening as a result \nof global warming.\n  Well, hurricanes, according to NOAA, have been on the decline in the \nUnited States since the beginning of records in the 19th century. The \nworst decade for major--category 3, 4, and 5--hurricanes was in the \n1940s.\n  To quote the Geophysical Research Letters:\n\n       Since 2006, global tropical cyclone energy has decreased \n     dramatically . . . to the lowest levels since the late 1970s. \n     Global frequency of tropical cyclones has reached a historic \n     low.\n\n  So just the opposite.\n  On tornadoes, NOAA scientists reject a global warming link to \ntornadoes. To quote them:\n\n       No scientific consensus or connection between global \n     warming or tornado activity.\n\n  Droughts. The Senator talked about droughts this morning. Reading \nfrom this article, the headline is ``Scientist disagrees with Obama on \ncause of Texas drought:'' and to quote Dr. Robert Hoerling, a NOAA \nresearch meteorologist, ``This is not a climate change drought.''\n  They further said severe drought in 1934 covered 80 percent of the \ncountry compared to only 25 percent in 2011.\n  The statements that were made about the Arctic and about Greenland \nthis morning, if you look at a November 2007 peer-reviewed--and I \nstress peer-reviewed--study, conducted by a team of NASA and university \nexperts, it found cyclical changes in ocean currents impacting the \nArctic. The excerpt from this peer-reviewed study by NASA says:\n\n       Our study confirms that many changes seen in upper Arctic \n     Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, \n     rather than trends caused by global warming.\n\n  And 2011 sees 9,000 Manhattans of Arctic ice recovery since the low \npoint in 2007.\n  Let me explain what that means. When we talk about the Manhattan \nArctic recovery, they use Manhattan because that is something people \ncan identify with, and then they relate that to the recovery of ice. In \nthis case--this is, again, from NASA. In 2011, there were 9,000 \nManhattans of Arctic ice recovery since the low point in 2007. Now, \nthis study was 2011. So that means the low point was actually below \nthat, and it has been decreasing since that time.\n  Now, that was the Arctic. In the Antarctic there is a 2008 peer-\nreviewed paper in the American Geophysical Union, and it found a \ndoubling in snow accumulation in the western Antarctic Peninsula since \n1850. In a paper published in the October Journal of Climate Examples, \nthe trend of sea ice extends along the east Antarctic coast from 2000 \nto 2008 and finds a significant increase of 1.43 percent per year.\n  Let's talk about Greenland. And I will always remember when I had \noccasion--well, one of the things I have been interested in is \naviation. I have been an active pilot for, I guess, 60 years now. The \noccupier of the chair is fully aware of this because he and I together \nwere able to pass the pilots' bill of rights, so for the first time an \naccused pilot has access to the judicial system. But as the occupier of \nthe chair is fully aware, I had occasion to fly an airplane around the \nworld one time, emulating the flight of Wiley Post when he went around \nthe world. It is an exciting thing, but it is one of those things where \nyou feel you are glad you did it, but you never want to do it again. It \nwas kind of miserable at times.\n  Anyway, I remember coming across Greenland, following Wiley Post, and \nstarting in the United States, going up to Canada, then Greenland, to \nIceland,\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nback to western Europe, and then across Siberia. But in Greenland they \nare still talking up there about what it used to be like in Greenland. \nThey had gone through this melting period where everyone up there was \ngrowing things. They were ecstatic up there, talking about the great \nold times. Then, of course, the cold spell came along, and it got much \ncolder and it was much worse.\n  Now, the IPCC, in 2001, covered this. They said that to melt the \nGreenland ice sheet would require temperatures to rise by 5\\1/2\\ \ndegrees Celsius and remain for 1,000 years. The ice sheet is growing 2 \ninches a year. So that is Greenland, and they were just talking about \nGreenland this morning. In fact, they talked about it during this \nhearing too.\n  Let me mention this IPCC and remind everyone of something that people \ntend to forget. The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. It was put together by the United Nations a long time ago. It \nall started in 1992 down in Rio de Janeiro. They had their big \ngathering down there to try to encourage everyone to pass the Kyoto \nTreaty. The treaty was never even submitted by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, although Gore went to this big meeting in Rio de \nJaneiro. They had a wonderful time down there. At that time they were \nall saying the world is coming to an end so we have to pass the Kyoto \nTreaty to stop all that. Well, that is the IPCC that I have been very \ncritical of because that is the science on which all of these things \nare based that we are dealing with today.\n  So much for these things that were stated in terms of the disasters \nand the droughts and all of these problems. The next thing he talked \nabout--and I have already talked about Greenland--is he talked about it \nis going to be necessary to have carbon caps. I think we talked about \nthat this morning. Right now, there are those people who are advocating \ncap and trade--a very complex, difficult thing to explain--which is \nessentially requiring a cap on carbon emissions and then trading these \nemissions back and forth. That is something they do not talk about \nanymore because that has been completely discredited. Now they are \ntalking about a carbon tax, and I think that was mentioned this \nmorning.\n  Quoting the Senator from Massachusetts this morning once again:\n\n       The avoidance of responsibility has to stop. We have been \n     waiting for 20 years now while other countries, including \n     China, are stealing our opportunities.\n\n  Let's put up that chart. Let's talk a little about China. You know \nChina is the great beneficiary of anything we do here to put caps on \ncarbon because they are the ones that are doing it. So they say China \nis making great strides in reducing their carbon emissions. Well, look \nat this. The green line there is China. This is in emissions--billions \nof tons of emissions. It starts down at 2, a little over 2, which was \nin 1990, and it was fairly low until 2002.\n\n  Look at what has happened. It has doubled in tons of emissions. China \nhas actually doubled in that period of time, from 2002 to 2012--a 10-\nyear period.\n  At the same time, we have actually reduced our emissions--both the \nUnited States and the European Union. To suggest that China is sitting \nback there waiting for us to provide the leadership for them to destroy \ntheir economy is pretty outrageous.\n  By the way, the other statement that has been made in the past, not \njust by the Senator to whom I have referred but several others, is that \nwe are not going to be able to solve the problem and to do something \nabout our reliance upon the Middle East just by developing our own \nresources. That is wrong.\n  There is a guy named Harold Hamm, who is now the authority, and he \nhas actually had more successful production in tight formations. He \nhappens to be from my State of Oklahoma. I called him up before a \nspeech or a debate I was involved in probably 6 months ago, and I said \nto Harold Hamm: You know, if we were to open up the United States--now, \ngranted, there has been a surge in the production in this country, in \nthe recovery, but that is all in private lands; none in public lands \nbecause we have had a reduction in public lands.\n  The Obama administration has said over and over and over--and I guess \nif you say something wrong enough times people will believe it--that \neven if we open these public lands it would take 10 years before that \nwould arrive at the pumps.\n  So I asked Harold Hamm, and I said: You are going to have to give me \nsomething you can document, but if we were to set up in New Mexico, for \nexample, where you are precluded on public lands from drilling, and you \nput up your operation, how long would it take you to bring up the oil \nand actually go through the whole refinery process and get it to the \npump to get the supply there so we can bring down the price of oil, of \ngas, at the pumps? He said: Seventy days. He didn't hesitate.\n  I said: Seventy days? They said it would take 10 years.\n  He said: No. He said: It would take 30 days to go down and lift it \nup--60 days before you hit the surface, and in preparation of sending \nit to a refinery, then in 10 days you get it to the refinery and to the \npumps.\n  Well, I am just saying there is this whole idea we have to rely on \nsome kind of green energy that has not even been developed yet in terms \nof technology and ration what we have in this country. I mean, this \nObama administration has had a war on fossil fuels since before he was \nelected President of the United States. He wants to kill fossil fuels. \nWe all know that. And I am not going to quote all the people in his \nadministration who say we are going to have to raise the price at the \npumps to be comparable to Central Europe before people will be weaned \noff of fossil fuel because I think people know that now.\n  This morning was kind of interesting. We had a hearing this morning, \nand one of the witnesses was a Dr. Christopher Field. He was a witness \nfor the other side, and he made a lot of statements. It was kind of \ninteresting because there is an article that was sent out, written by \nRoger Pielke, Jr., who is from the University of Colorado at Boulder, \nand he was actually on the IPCC at one time. But he is one of the \nauthorities who disagrees with me, and he talked about how wrong Dr. \nField was.\n  Now, this is what Field said, first of all:\n\n       As the U.S. copes with the aftermath of last year's record-\n     breaking series of $14 billion climate-related disasters and \n     this year's massive wildfires and storms, it is critical to \n     understand that the link between climate change and the kinds \n     of extremes that lead to disasters is clear.\n\n  Well, what did Roger Pielke say this morning? He said:\n\n       Field's assertion that the link between climate change and \n     disaster ``is clear,'' which he supported with reference to \n     U.S. ``billion dollar'' economic losses, is in reality \n     scientifically unsupported by the IPCC. Period.\n\n  That was the response to the assertion made this morning.\n  Another assertion made this morning by Field was:\n\n       The report identified some areas where droughts have become \n     longer and more intense (including southern Europe and west \n     Africa), but others where droughts have become less frequent, \n     less intent or shorter.\n\n  This is what was said in response to that. Again, this is Dr. Roger \nPielke, Jr., just today. This is in today's paper he published.\n\n       Field conveniently neglected in his testimony to mention \n     that one place where droughts have gotten less frequent, less \n     intense or shorter is . . . the United States. Why did he \n     fail to mention this region, surely of interest to U.S. \n     Senators. . . .\n\n  Myself included--that were on the panel?\n  The third thing he mentioned on NOAA's billion-dollar disasters; \nField said:\n\n       The U.S. experienced 14 billion-dollar disasters in 2011, a \n     record that far surpasses the previous maximum of 9.\n\n  Field says nothing about the serious issues with NOAA's tabulation. \nThe billion-dollar disaster memo is a PR train wreck, not peer-\nreviewed, and is counter to the actual science summarized in the IPCC. \nAgain, this is Dr. Pielke, Jr., who disagrees with me on this, but he \nsaid he is tired of people saying things that are not true.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include his entire statement in the Record \nbecause he goes over point after point and discredits everything that \nwas said by this witness--whose name is Christopher Field--this \nmorning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n         Roger Pielke Jr IPCC Lead Author Misleads US Congress\n\n       The politicization of climate science is so complete that \n     the lead author of the IPCC's Working Group II on climate \n     impacts feels comfortable presenting testimony to the US \n     Congress that fundamentally misrepresents what the IPCC has \n     concluded. I am referring to testimony given today by \n     Christopher Field, a professor at Stanford, to the US Senate.\n       This is not a particularly nuanced or complex issue. What \n     Field says the IPCC says is blantantly wrong, often 180 \n     degrees wrong. It is one thing to disagree about scientific \n     questions, but it is altogether different to fundamentally \n     misrepresent an IPCC report to the US Congress. Below are \n     five instances in which Field's testimony today completely \n     and unambiguously misrepresented IPCC findings to the Senate.\n       1. On the economic costs of disasters:\n       Field: ``As the US copes with the aftermath of last year's \n     record-breaking series of 14 billion-dollar climate-related \n     disasters and this year's massive wildfires and storms, it is \n     critical to understand that the link between climate change \n     and the kinds of extremes that lead to disasters is clear.''\n       Field's assertion that the link between climate change and \n     disasters ``is clear,'' which he supported with reference to \n     US ``billion dollar'' economic losses, is in reality \n     scientifically unsupported by the IPCC. Period. There is good \n     reason for this--it is what the science says. Why fail to \n     report to Congress the IPCC's most fundamental finding and \n     indicate something quite the opposite?\n       2. On US droughts:\n       Field: ``The report identified some areas where droughts \n     have become longer and more intense (including southern \n     Europe and West Africa), but others where droughts have \n     become less frequent, less intense, or shorter.''\n       What the IPCC actually said: . . . in some regions droughts \n     have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for \n     example, central North America. . .''\n       Field conveniently neglected in his testimony to mention \n     that one place where droughts have gotten less frequent, less \n     intense or shorter is . . . the United States. Why did he \n     fail to mention this region, surely of interest to US \n     Senators, but did include Europe and West Africa?\n       3. On NOAA's billion dollar disasters:,\n       Field: ``The US experienced 14 billion-dollar disasters in \n     2011, a record that far surpasses the previous maximum of \n     9.''\n       What NOAA actually says about its series of ``billion \n     dollar'' disasters: ``Caution should be used in interpreting \n     any trends based on this [data] for a variety of reasons''\n       Field says nothing about the serious issues with NOAA's \n     tabulation. The billion dollar disaster meme is a PR train \n     wreck, not peer reviewed and is counter to the actual science \n     summarized in the IPCC. So why mention it?\n       4. On attributing billion dollar disasters to climate \n     change, case of hurricanes and tornadoes:\n       Field: ``For several of these categories of disasters, the \n     strength of any linkage to climate change, if there is one, \n     is not known. Specifically, the IPCC (IPCC 2012) did not \n     identify a trend or express confidence in projections \n     concerning tornadoes and other small-area events. The \n     evidence on hurricanes is mixed.''\n       What the IPCC actually said: ``The statement about the \n     absence of trends in impacts attributable to natural or \n     anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical and \n     extratropical storms and tornados''\n       Hurricanes are, of course, tropical cyclones. Far from \n     evidence being ``mixed'' the IPCC was unable to attribute any \n     trend in tropical cyclone disasters to climate change \n     (anywhere in the world and globally overall). In fact, there \n     has been no trend in US hurricane frequency or intensity over \n     a century or more, and the US is currently experiencing the \n     longest period with no intense hurricane landfalls ever seen. \n     Field fails to report any this and invents something \n     different. Why present testimony so easily refuted? (He did \n     get tornadoes right!)\n       5. On attributing billion dollar disasters to climate \n     change, case of floods and droughts:\n       Field: ``For other categories of climate and weather \n     extremes, the pattern is increasingly clear. Climate change \n     is shifting the risk of hitting an extreme. The IPCC (IPCC \n     2012) concludes that climate change increases the risk of \n     heat waves (90% or greater probability), heavy precipitation \n     (66% or greater probability), and droughts (medium \n     confidence) for most land areas.''\n       What the IPCC actually says: ``The absence of an \n     attributable climate change signal in losses also holds for \n     flood losses'' and (from above): ``in some regions droughts \n     have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for \n     example, central North America''\n       Field fails to explain that no linkage between flood \n     disasters and climate change has been established. Increasing \n     precipitation is not the same thing as increasing streamflow, \n     floods or disasters. In fact, floods may be decreasing \n     worldwide and are not increasing the US. The fact that \n     drought has declined in the US means that there is no trend \n     of rising impacts that can be attributed to climate change. \n     Yet he implies exactly the opposite. Again, why include such \n     obvious misrepresentations when they are so easily refuted?\n       Field is certainly entitled to his (wrong) opinion on the \n     science of climate change and disasters. However, it utterly \n     irresponsible to fundamentally misrepresent the conclusions \n     of the IPCC before the US Congress. He might have explained \n     why he thought the IPCC was wrong in its conclusions, but it \n     is foolish to pretend that the body said something other than \n     what it actually reported. Just like the inconvenient fact \n     that people are influencing the climate and carbon dioxide is \n     a main culprit, the science says what the science says.\n       Field can present such nonsense before Congress because the \n     politics of climate change are so poisonous that he will be \n     applauded for his misrepresentations by many, including some \n     scientists. Undoubtedly, I will be attacked for pointing out \n     his obvious misrepresentations. Neither response changes the \n     basic facts here. Such is the sorry state of climate science \n     today.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is important to talk about the IPCC because if we stop \nand think about it, everything that has been happening comes from the \nscience that was investigated and formulated by the IPCC--\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--that is, the United Nations. \nIn my book I talk a little bit about that, but I don't believe it would \nbe appropriate to mention it at this time. But at today's hearing, we \ntalked about the IPCC.\n  When they were unable, through about five or six different bills, to \nget cap and trade through--keep in mind, cap and trade through \nlegislation would cost the American people between $300 billion and \n$400 billion a year. But when that failed, we had something happen in \nDecember 2009.\n  The United Nations has this big party every year, and they invite \ncountries from around the world to testify that global warming is \nhappening and they are going to do something about it. One time in \nMilan, Italy, I saw one of my friends from West Africa. I said, What in \nthe world are you doing here? You know better than this--in terms of \nglobal warming. He said, This is the biggest party of the year. Besides \nthat, if we agree to go along with this, we in West Africa are going to \nget billions of dollars from the United Nations, from those countries \nin the developed nations.\n  Another big party was coming up in Copenhagen in 2009. I think \nSenator Kerry had gone over; Hillary Clinton had gone over. I don't \nbelieve Barack Obama was there. Nancy Pelosi was there and several \nothers were there. They were telling all these countries: Don't you \nworry about it because we in the United States of America are going to \npass cap-and-trade legislation this year. So I said I was going to go \nover as a one-man truth squad to let them know the truth, and I did. I \nwent over and told the 191 other countries there: We are not going to \npass cap and trade. It is dead. It is gone. They can't get one-third of \nthe Senate to support it.\n  Before I left, one of my favorite liberals, Lisa Jackson--I really \nlike her. She is Obama's appointee and is now the Director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Right before I went to Copenhagen, we \nhad a hearing and she was a witness.\n  I said: Madam Administrator, I have a feeling that once I leave and \ngo to Copenhagen, you are going to come out with an endangerment \nfinding that will give you justification to start doing what they \ncouldn't do by legislation through regulations. And I could see a smile \non her face.\n  I said: When you do this, it has to be based on science. What science \nare you going to base this on?\n  She said: Well, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change would \nbe the major thing. And, sure enough, that is exactly what happened.\n  I could not have planned it, but she made this declaration that we \nnow are going to be able to do through regulation what we couldn't do \nthrough legislation because the people of America had spoken through \ntheir elected representatives in the House and the Senate and had \ndenied the opportunity to do cap and trade, so they decided to do it on \nan endangerment finding.\n  What happened after that is what I call poetic justice. Climategate \noccurred. I had nothing to do with it when it happened, but all the \nspeeches I had made in the previous 10 years on the floor of this \nSenate were speeches saying exactly the same thing: that they were \ncooking the science and what they were saying was not real.\n  I read several of the editorials that came out after climategate. The \nNew York Times has always been on the other side of this issue. They \nsaid:\n\n       Given the stakes, the IPCC cannot allow more missteps and, \n     at the very least, must\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\n     tighten procedures and make its deliberation more \n     transparent. The panel's chairman . . . is under fire for \n     taking consulting fees from business interests. . . .\n\n  The Washington Post, which has also been on the other side of this \nissue, said:\n\n       Recent revelations about flaws in that seminal IPCC report, \n     ranging from typos in key dates to sloppy sourcing, are \n     undermining confidence not only in the panel's work but also \n     in projections about climate change.\n\n  Newsweek:\n\n       Some of the IPCC's most-quoted data and recommendations \n     were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures, \n     newspaper articles. . . .\n\n  Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph said of climategate, `` . . . \nthe worst scientific scandal of our generation.''\n  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said: ``The stink of intellectual \ncorruption is overpowering.''\n  A prominent physicist from the IPCC said: ``Climategate was a fraud \non the scale I have never seen.''\n  Another UN Scientist, bails:\n\n       UN IPCC Coordinating author Dr. Philip Lloyd calls out IPCC \n     `fraud'--the result is not scientific.\n\n  Newsweek:\n\n       Once celebrated climate researchers feeling like used car \n     salesmen. Some of IPCC's most-quoted data and recommendations \n     were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures.\n\n  Clive Cook of the Atlantic Magazine, speaking of the IPCC, responds:\n\n       I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various \n     Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a \n     first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific \n     consensus.\n\n  So everyone is in agreement that this is what climategate was all \nabout. And why I am spending so much time on this is because this is \nthe science of all of these things that started since Kyoto.\n  By the way, the Senator, this morning on the floor, commented about \nthe Kyoto Treaty. Let's keep in mind, the Kyoto Treaty was back during \nthe Clinton-Gore administration. They were strongly in support of it. \nVice President Gore went down to the summit they were having in Rio de \nJaneiro and signed the treaty, but they never submitted it to the \nSenate.\n  To become a part of a treaty, it has to be ratified by the United \nStates. It never was, and people need to understand that there is a \nreason it never was submitted.\n  I would suggest a couple of other things in the remainder of the time \nthat I have that I think are significant and worthy of bringing up. One \nwould be the one-weather event. The thing that we are hearing more \nabout than anything else is that it has been a very hot summer. On \nMonday, my wife called me up and said: In Tulsa it is 109 degrees \ntoday.\n  I was joking around with my good friend from Vermont--we disagree \nwith each other, but he is a good friend. Sure, it is hot. But it is so \nimportant that people understand, weather is not climate.\n  Roger Pielke, Jr., a professor of environmental studies at University \nof Colorado, said:\n\n       Over the long term, there is no evidence that disasters are \n     getting worse because of climate change.\n\n  Judith Curry, chair of the Georgia Institute of Technology's School \nof Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, has said:\n\n       I have been completely unconvinced by any of the arguments \n     . . . that attribute a single extreme weather event, a \n     cluster of extreme weather events, or statistics of extreme \n     weather events to anthropogenic forcing.\n\n  Myles Allen at the University of Oxford's Atmospheric, Oceanic, and \nPlanetary Physics Department:\n\n       When Al Gore said . . . that scientists now have clear \n     proof that climate change is directly responsible for the \n     extreme and devastating floods, storms and droughts . . . my \n     heart sank.\n\n  I consider Rachel Maddow of MSNBC to be one of the outstanding \nliberals, and she is one of my four favorite liberals. I have been on \nher program, and I have enjoyed it. Bill Nye, the Science Guy, agrees \nthat some of these weather events have nothing to do with global \nwarming.\n  The other thing I made a note of that came up this morning was that \nthey said there is no evidence on cooling. I think it is important to \ntalk about that a little bit because a prominent Russian scientist \nsaid:\n\n       We should fear a deep temperature drop--not catastrophic \n     global. . . . Warming had a natural origin . . . \n     CO2 is not guilty.\n\n  U.N. Fears (More) Global Cooling Cometh! An IPCC scientist warns the \nU.N.:\n\n       We may be about to enter one or even two decades during \n     which temps cool.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent all of these be placed in the Record showing \nthat a single weather event has nothing to do with climate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Global Cooling Predictions\n\n       3. Paleoclimate scientist Dr. Bob Carter, James Cook \n     University in Austraila, who has testified before the U.S. \n     Senate Committee on EPW, noted on June 18, 2007, ``The \n     accepted global average temperature statistics used by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show that no \n     ground-based warming has occurred since 1998. Oddly, this 8-\n     year-long temperature stability as occurred despite an \n     increase over the same period of 15 parts per million (or 4%) \n     in atmospheric CO2.\n\n\n                            (andrew revkin)\n\n       4. Just months before Copenhagen, on September 23, 2009, \n     the New York Times acknowledged, ``The world leaders who met \n     at the United Nations to discuss climate change . . . are \n     faced with an intricate challenge: building momentum for an \n     international climate treaty at a time when global \n     temperatures have been relatively stable for a decade and may \n     even drop in the next few years.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do think it is important to bring this up because this \nis happening right now, after 3 years, and not one mention of global \nwarming, and all of a sudden it is global warming.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my time by 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This morning I showed a picture of an igloo. I have 20 \nkids and grandkids. My daughter Molly and her husband have four \nchildren. One of those is adopted from Africa, a little girl. She was \nbrought over here when she was a little baby. She is now 12 years old, \nreading at a college level. She is an outstanding little girl. I \nsponsor the African dinner every February, and she, for the last 3 \nyears, has been kind of a keynote speaker, and everybody loves her.\n  They were up here 2 years ago, and they couldn't leave because all \nthe airports were closed because of the ice storm. What do you do with \na family of six when they are stuck someplace? They built an igloo. \nThat was fun--a real igloo that will sleep four people. This became \nquite an issue, and we had articles from France and Great Britain and \nall criticizing my family. In fact, my cute little family was declared \nby Keith Olbermann of MSNBC to be the worst family in America because \nof this.\n  The point they were trying to make is, no one ever asserted that \nbecause it was the coldest winter in several decades up here that \nsomehow that refuted global warming. I said: No, that isn't true. Now \nthose same people are saying that it is.\n  So you can fool the American people part of the time and you can talk \nabout all the hysteria and all the things that are taking place, but \nthe people of America have caught on.\n  In March 2010, in a Gallup poll, Americans ranked global warming dead \nlast, No. 8 out of eight environmental issues. They had a vote, and \nthis was dead last.\n  A March Rasmussen poll: 72 percent of American voters don't believe \nglobal warming is a serious problem.\n  An alarmist, Robert Socolow, laments:\n\n       We are losing the argument with the general public big time \n     . . . I think the climate change activists--myself included--\n     have lost the American middle.\n\n  So as much money as they have spent and the efforts they have made, \nand moveon.org and George Soros and Michael Moore and the United \nNations and the Gore people and the elitists out in California in \nHollywood, they have lost this battle. Now they are trying to resurrect \nit. They would love nothing more than to pass this $300 billion tax \nincrease. It is not going to happen.\n  But I am glad that we are talking about it again, and I applaud my \nfriend. Senator Sanders from Vermont is a real sincere activist on the \nother side. We agree on hardly anything--except infrastructure, I would \nhave to\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\nsay--and yet we respect each other. That is what this body is all \nabout. We should have people who are on both sides of all these \ncontroversial issues talking about it. There has been a silence for 3 \nyears. Now we are talking about it again.\n  So welcome back to the discussion of global warming. I look forward \nto future discussions about this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement S. 3326\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are about to do something really \nimportant in the Senate. It would increase U.S. textile exports to \nCentral American countries, it would promote development and economic \nstability by creating jobs in, of course, African countries, and it \nwould extend U.S. import sanctions with Burma, which the Republican \nleader will speak more about. This bill would help maintain about 2,000 \njobs in North Carolina and South Carolina alone. It is a very good \nbill. It is fully paid for. It is an important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 459, S. 3326; that the only amendment in order be a Coburn \namendment, the text of which is at the desk; that there be 30 minutes \nfor debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that if the amendment is not agreed to, the \nbill be read the third time and passed without further action or \ndebate; that when the Senate receives H.R. 5986 and if its text is \nidentical to S. 3326, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration \nof H.R. 5986, the bill be read the third time and passed without \nfurther debate, with no amendments in order prior to passage; further, \nthat if the Coburn amendment is agreed to, the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 9 and the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 3326, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof, the bill be read the third time and passed without further \ndebate; that when the Senate receives H.R. 5986, the Senate proceed to \nit forthwith and all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text \nof sections 2 and 3 of S. 3326, as reported, by inserted in lieu \nthereof, the bill be read the third time and passed, without further \ndebate, as amended, and S. 3326 be returned to the Calendar of \nBusiness; finally, that no motions be in order other than motions to \nwaive or motions to table and that motions to reconsider be made and \nlaid on the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not be objecting, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. \nThis is an important piece of legislation.\n  The part I have the most interest in renews Burma's sanctions--\nsomething we have done on an annual basis for 10 years. We are renewing \nthe sanctions in spite of the fact that much progress has been made in \nBurma in the last year and a half. Secretary Clinton will, of course, \nrecommend to the President that these sanctions be waived in \nrecognition of the significant progress that has been made in the last \nyear and a half in that country, which is trying to move from a rather \nthuggish military dictatorship to a genuine democracy. There is still a \nlong way to go.\n  This is an important step in the right direction. America speaks with \none voice regarding Burma. My views are the same as the views of the \nObama administration as expressed by Secretary Clinton.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee also for helping us \nwork through the process, and particularly Senator Coburn, who had some \nreservations about the non-Burma parts of this bill. I think we have \nworked those out and are moving forward. It is an important step in the \nright direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5858-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5858-S5863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House with respect to H.R. 1950.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, that the House agree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 1905) entitled ``An Act to \n     strengthen Iran sanctions laws for the purpose of compelling \n     Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and other \n     threatening activities, and for other purposes'', with an \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise in strong support \nof the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, our \nlegislation which embodies a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to \nreconcile the current Senate and House-passed versions of Iran \nsanctions legislation. Once implemented, this comprehensive new set of \nsanctions will help dramatically to increase the pressure on Iranian \ngovernment leaders to abandon their illicit nuclear activities and \nsupport for terrorism. This bill passed the House of Representatives by \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote of 421 to 6 earlier this evening. I \nhope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it so that it can \nbe adopted by the Senate and signed into law by the President as soon \nas possible.\n  So far, in the sputtering P5+1 negotiations, Iran has shown no clear \nsigns of a willingness to work with the international community to \nengage in a serious way on nuclear issues. It remains to be seen \nwhether Iran will ultimately be willing to work towards progress on the \ncentral issues at upcoming negotiating sessions, or whether the \nmeetings will simply be another in a series of stalling actions to buy \ntime to enrich additional uranium and further fortify their nuclear \nprogram. That is why I think it necessary to intensify the pressure, \nand move forward quickly now on this new package that leaves no doubts \nabout U.S. resolve on this issue. As we all recognize, economic \nsanctions are not an end: they are a means to an end. That end is to \napply enough pressure to secure agreement from Iran's leaders to fully, \ncompletely and verifiably abandon their illicit nuclear activities.\n  Isolated diplomatically, economically, and otherwise, Iran must \nunderstand that the patience of the international community is fast \nrunning out. With these new sanctions, including those targeted at the \nI-R-G-C, we are pressing Iran's military and political leaders to make \na clear choice. They can end the suppression of their people, come \nclean on their nuclear program, suspend enrichment, and stop supporting \nterrorist activities around the globe. Or they can continue to face \nsustained multilateral economic and diplomatic pressure, and deepen \ntheir international isolation.\n  This legislation is based on the Senate bill which passed with \nunanimous support in May. It incorporates new measures from Democrats \nand Republicans in the House and Senate. The sanctions contained in \nthis bill reach more deeply into Iran's energy sector than ever before, \nand build on the sweeping banking sanctions Congress enacted 2 years \nago to reach to insurance, shipping, trade, finance and other sectors, \ntargeting those who help to bolster Iranian government revenues which \nsupport their illicit nuclear activities.\n  As I have said before, the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran is the \nmost pressing foreign policy challenge we face, and we must continue to \ndo all we can--politically, economically, and diplomatically--to avoid \nthat result. In recent months, we have seen increased signs that the \nIranian regime is feeling the pressure of existing sanctions. Their \ncurrency has plummeted, their trade revenues have been sharply \ncurtailed, and they are under increasing pressure from the oil \nsanctions regime currently in place. With passage of this bill, we are \ntaking another significant step to block the remaining avenues for the \nIranians to fund their illicit behavior and evade sanctions. The bill \nalso requires sanctions on those who purchase new Iranian sovereign \ndebt, thereby further limiting the regime's ability to finance its \nillicit activities.\n  In addition, there are substantial new sanctions for anyone who \nengages\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nin joint ventures with the National Iranian Oil Company, NIOC; provides \ninsurance or re-insurance to the National Iranian Oil Company or the \nNational Iranian Tanker Company, NITC; helps Iran evade oil sanctions \nthrough reflagging or other means; or sells, leases, or otherwise \nprovides oil tankers to Iran, unless they are from a country that is \nsharply reducing its oil purchases from Iran.\n  The bill also expands sanctions against Iranian and Syrian officials \nfor human rights abuses, including against those who engage in \ncensorship, jamming and monitoring of communications, and tracking of \nInternet use by ordinary Iranian citizens.\n  Many of my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, have helped us \nget to this point. I want to particularly thank Chairman Ros-Lehtinen \nof the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Without her help, we would not \nbe here. I also want to thank my colleagues, including Senator \nMenendez, who crafted many of its original provisions, and Senators \nSchumer, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, Brown, Kyl, Lieberman, and others who \ncontributed their ideas. I also want to thank Majority Leader Reid for \nhis tireless efforts to enact a strong comprehensive sanctions bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank the staff who crafted the details of this \nbill, and worked long hours in intensive discussions over the last \nseveral weeks to get it done. They include Patrick Grant, Steve Kroll, \nGeorgina Cannon, Ingianni Acosta and Colin McGinnis of my Committee \nstaff; Dr. Yleem Poblete, Matt Zweig, and Ari Friedman of Chairman Ros-\nLehtinen's staff; John O'Hara and Andrew Olmem of Senator Shelby's \nstaff, and Shanna Winters, Dr. Richard Kessler, and Alan Makovsky of \nRanking Member Berman's staff.\n  All told, when enacted this bill and other efforts by the President \nwill significantly increase pressure on Iran to abandon its illicit \nnuclear activities. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a detailed summary of the bill. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012\n\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n       Sec. 1--Short Title, Table of Contents\n       Sec. 2--Definitions: Provides that the definitions of key \n     terms (``appropriate congressional committees,'' and \n     ``knowingly,'') will be those found in the Iran Sanctions Act \n     (ISA) of 1996, as amended, and that the definition of \n     ``United States person'' will be that found in the \n     Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment \n     Act of 2010 (CISADA).

Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, regarding HR 1905, the Iran Threat \nReduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. I want to thank the \nchairman for crafting a strong sanctions package that includes language \nI authored to close a loophole in current law that allows foreign \nsubsidiaries of U.S. companies to continue doing business with Iran \nwithout imposing any penalties on their U.S. parent companies. We must \nclose this loophole once and for all, and I am pleased the Chairman \nagrees with me.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I thank Senator Lautenberg for his \nlongstanding leadership on this issue. As I have previously noted, it \nis long past time for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to end \ntheir business in Iran. That is already happening due to US and \ninternational pressure on the business and financial sectors, and this \nnew provision will accelerate that process. Firms realize the huge \nrisks such activity poses, reputationally and otherwise, to their \ncompanies. I note that it is already a violation of U.S. law for U.S. \nsubsidiaries to engage in sanctionable activity in Iran's energy sector \nand certain other activities under U.S. sanctions laws. It is also a \nviolation of U.S. trade law for a U.S. firm to do business of any kind \nin Iran via a subsidiary that it directs. The balance that has been \nstruck in prior law is to focus only on the activity of U.S. companies. \nForeign subsidiaries are not, by definition, U.S. companies, and your \nprovision takes a major new step forward in this area of the law. I \nagree with you that the way we have addressed this issue authorizing \nfor the first time penalties on U.S. parents if their foreign \nsubsidiaries engages in an activity that would be sanctionable if \ncommitted by a U.S. person--is a sound and responsible one, and will \nhopefully shut down this activity once and for all.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the chairman agree that the language in the bill \ncurrently under consideration would apply the same penalties that can \nbe imposed on U.S. companies that directly violate the U.S. trade ban \nto those U.S. parent companies whose foreign subsidiaries are doing \nbusiness with Iran?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. The bill would authorize the imposition \nof similar civil penalties on such U.S. parent companies.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the chairman also agree that this language \nsubjects to penalties U.S. parent companies if their foreign \nsubsidiaries knew or should have known that the subsidiary was directly \nor indirectly doing business with an Iranian entity, even if it was the \ncase that the parent companies were not actually aware of the activity \nof the subsidiary?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I agree this legislation mandates \npenalties on a U.S. parent company if its foreign subsidiary has \nknowledge or should have had knowledge that the subsidiary was doing \nprohibited business with Iran, even if the U.S. parent company has no \nknowledge of these transactions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And does the chairman agree that this requirement \nthat the foreign subsidiary knew or should have known that they were \ndoing business with Iran relates only to the actual business \ntransaction and does not require that the subsidiary had or should have \nhad knowledge of current U.S. sanctions law in order to place penalties \non the U.S. parent company?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Yes. That is my intent.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank Chairman Johnson for all of his work on this \nimportant Iran sanctions package. Iran continues to defy numerous \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions. It funds Hamas, Hezbollah, \nand other terrorist organizations, and it commits severe human rights \nabuses against its own people. We must do everything we can to place as \nmuch pressure on the Iranian regime as possible to change its behavior, \nand I am pleased that we have finally closed this loophole in current \nlaw and put U.S. companies on notice that they will be held responsible \nfor the activities of their subsidiaries with respect to Iran.\n  Mr. REID. I move to concur in the House amendment, and I believe the \nSenate is ready to act on this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate and that any \nstatements related to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Humanitarian trade, including \nagricultural commodities, food, medicine and medical products has long \nbeen specifically exempted by Congress from successive rounds of Iran \nsanctions legislation, as long as such trade is licensed by the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\n  With the sharp drop in the value of Iran's currency, and the \nworsening economic situation in Iran, it is becoming more apparent that \nU.S. financial sanctions targeting Iran's banking sector are causing \nincreased concern among U.S. and other businesses, and banks of our \nallies engaged in such trade.\n  The fear is that engaging in humanitarian trade in the current \nsanctions environment might lead to sanctions for legitimately licensed \nhumanitarian trade. We must underscore with other countries and their \nbanks that humanitarian trade with Iran is not subject to sanctions if \nit is appropriately licensed by OFAC.\n  This has been a concern since the Senate first considered this bill \nand this concern still remains. It is not and has not been the intent \nof U.S. policy to harm the Iranian people by prohibiting humanitarian \ntrade that is licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department, and we should \ndo all we can to avoid this outcome. OFAC consistently issues many \nlicenses, both general and specific, for this type of trade.\n  The practical financing difficulties arising today between banks and \nthose engaging in licensed humanitarian trade can be best addressed by \nU.S. government officials, who should do more to make it clear that no \nU.S. sanctions will be imposed against third-country banks that \nfacilitate OFAC-licensed or exempted humanitarian trade. The \nAdministration must continue to make this clear in public statements, \nin private meetings with foreign financial institutions, and elsewhere \nas appropriate. Misinterpretation of U.S. law, among foreign financial \ninstitutions, should no longer deny\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nthe people of Iran the benefit of OFAC-approved humanitarian trade.\n  Mr. REID. I am pleased that the Senate has just passed the final \nversion of the Iran Sanctions legislation.\n  I want to thank Senators Johnson, Shelby and Menendez for their \nleadership and all of their hard work getting this bill completed.\n  At a time when Iran continues to defy the international community \nwith its nuclear weapons program, it is critical we continue to tighten \nour sanctions regime.\n  This legislation expands our existing sanctions on Iran's energy \nsector, and imposes new sanctions targeting shipping and insurance.\n  Iran continues to try to evade existing sanctions. But this \nlegislation, in combination with newly announced measures by the Obama \nadministration, closes loopholes and stops the use of front companies \nor financial institutions to get around international sanctions.\n  Our current sanctions, and a recent European Union ban on purchasing \nIranian oil, have already had an impact.\n  In spite of the rhetoric coming out of Iran, the regime is clearly \nfeeling the heat.\n  Oil exports are down by 50 percent, and the Iranian currency has lost \nnearly 40 percent of its value.\n  Iranian tankers full of oil are crowding the waters around Iran, \nacting as floating storage facilities for oil the rogue nation cannot \nsell.\n  Over the past year, I have come to the floor many times urging \npassage of this measure.\n  I am pleased we have finally completed this important work.\n  There is no time to waste, as the Iranian regime continues to \nthreaten our ally Israel and the national security of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5863-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in memory of former Hazard \nPolice Chief Rod Maggard. Chief Maggard was a prominent member of the \nPerry County, KY, community, and he dedicated his life to serving his \ncountry, State, and city.\n  A native of the southeastern Kentucky region, Chief Maggard was born \non April 9, 1944, to Ivory and Margaret Maggard. After graduating from \nCumberland High School, he attended Southeast Community College. \nShortly thereafter, Chief Maggard received his draft notice for the \nVietnam War. Initially, he was stationed in Biloxi, MI, where he worked \nas a Morse radio intercept operator, and he ultimately served a 14-\nmonth tour in DaNang, Vietnam.\n  Chief Maggard became a State trooper in 1967 when he returned home \nfrom the war. He was a decorated trooper and even received the Trooper \nof the Year Award for the Hazard KSP Post. In 1981, Maggard left public \nservice and became director of Blue Diamond Coal's security. However, \nin 1991, he returned to public duty when he accepted the position of \npolice chief for the City of Hazard.\n  His career was highly distinguished as he earned many different forms \nof recognition. Chief Maggard was invited to the White House to \nrepresent the Kentucky Chiefs of Police; he also served on the Kentucky \nLaw Enforcement Council from 1995 to 2001; in 1997 he was appointed to \nthe National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Advisory \nCouncil; and he was president of the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of \nPolice from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, Chief Maggard retired from the \npolice force and became the director of the Rural Law Enforcement \nTechnology Center in Hazard.\n  Though a decorated police officer and public servant, the legacy \nChief Rod Maggard hoped to leave was that of a good member of his \ncommunity. Current Hazard police chief Minor Allen said that Chief \nMaggard was not just a mentor but more like a second father to him. It \nwas his love of Hazard and Kentucky that set Maggard apart as a great \npolice chief, and that is the reason why Rod will be dearly missed by \nthose he knew and with whom he worked.\n  Today, I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate would join me in \nhonoring Chief Rod Maggard. I extend my most sincere condolences to his \nwife, Beverly; their daughters, Lesley Buckner, Brandi Townsley, and \nVali Dye; his sons-in-law; brother; grandchildren; and many more \nbeloved family members and friends. The Hazard Herald, a publication \nfrom Hazard, KY, published an obituary that highlighted Chief Maggard's \noutstanding service to Kentucky. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat said article appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Hazard Herald, June 20, 2012]\n\n                              Rod Maggard\n\n       Rodney Mitchell Maggard, 68, of Hazard, passed away on \n     Wednesday, June 13, at the hospice care center in Hazard. He \n     was the former director of the Rural Law Enforcement \n     Technology Center and former chief of police with the Hazard \n     Police Department.\n       He was the son of the late Ivory Mitchell Maggard and the \n     late Margaret McIntosh Maggard, and was also preceded in \n     death by his brother, James Charles Maggard.\n       He is survived by his wife, Beverly Maggard; daughters \n     Lesley Buckner and husband Jay, Brandi Townsley and husband \n     Jeff, and Vali Dye and husband Kevin; brother Tommy Wayne \n     Maggard; godson Anthony Bersaglia; grandchildren Ali \n     Townsley, Walker Townsley, Mitchell Buckner, Grayson Dye, and \n     Avery Dye; along with a host of family and friends.\n       Arrangements were handled by Maggard Mountain View Chapel \n     of Hazard. Funeral services were held on Saturday, June 16, \n     at the Forum, with Dr. Bill Scott and Rev. Chris Fugate \n     officiating. Interment was at Charlie Maggard Cemetery at \n     Blair, Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5863-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5863-S5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING AURORA'S LOSS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we gain perspective on the recent \nhorrific shooting in Aurora, CO, our thoughts and prayers are with the \nvictims, their families, and on all those who have been impacted by \nthis tragedy. I, like many Americans, have been uplifted by the many \nexamples of courage and heroism that have emerged from this dark \nmoment. A young woman refusing to leave her injured friend, pulling her \nout of harm's way. A man giving his life to shield a loved one. A 19-\nyear-old stepping back into danger to rescue a mother and her two young \ndaughters. These stories and the others that will almost certainly \nemerge as time goes on serve as powerful reminders of the simple \ndecency that makes our Nation strong.\n  But as we reflect on these stories, it is also important that we \nbegin to understand what caused or contributed to this heinous act. \nWhen the alleged shooter burst into the theater, he opened fire on the \naudience with an AR-15 assault rifle. The AR-15 is a type of military-\nstyle assault weapon, built for no purpose other than combat. According \nto the Congressional Research Service, they were designed in the \naftermath of the Second World War to give soldiers a weapon suited for \nthe modern battlefield. Such weapons often use high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines, which allow shooters to continuously fire rounds without \nreloading. It has been reported that the alleged shooter used an \noversized drum magazine, which reports have indicated could fire 100 \nrounds without reloading.\n  Between 1994 and 2004, a Federal ban prohibited the purchase of \nassault weapons. The idea was that if we took lethal weapons with no \nsporting purpose off the streets, it would make our society safer and \nprotect American lives. Our law enforcement community strongly \nsupported it. And it worked. After the ban was enacted, Brady Campaign \nstudies observed a 66 percent decrease in the number of assault weapons \nthat the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF, traced back to \na crime scene. When assault weapons were taken off the market, our \nNation became safer. But, unfortunately, Congress allowed the assault \nweapons ban to lapse in 2004, and repeated efforts to reinstate it have \nbeen unsuccessful.\n  So this past May, when the alleged gunman walked into a local gun \nshop, he was able to purchase an AR-15 assault rifle. The sale was \ncompletely\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nlegal. Two months later, he used that same weapon to open fire on a \nmovie theater, filled with innocent people. The oversized ammunition \nmagazine allowed him to fire continuously. Thankfully, the weapon \njammed during the attack, and he was forced to switch to one of the \nother three firearms he had purchased, legally, in the preceding weeks. \nHe killed 12 and injured 58. Some were fathers and sons, mothers and \ndaughters. They were all individuals with plans and dreams. Some were \nmembers of our armed services, who had volunteered to fight for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, as elected officials, our greatest responsibility is \nto protect the lives of the American people. A renewal of the Federal \nban on assault weapons would help keep these combat weapons off our \nstreets and out of our neighborhoods. It would prevent them from \ngetting into the hands of criminals who can legally buy them today or \nwho can easily secure a straw purchaser to do so. They aren't used to \nhunt; they are too often used to kill. I urge my colleagues to \nreinstate the Federal ban on assault weapons and to take up and pass \nlegislation like S. 32, the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device \nAct, which would prohibit the sale of military-style ammunition \ncartridges. We can honor the memory of those who lost their lives in \nAurora in many ways--one would be by passing such legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5864-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING KRISTIN ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins me \ntoday in congratulating fellow Idahoan Kristin Armstrong, who won her \nsecond consecutive gold medal in the Olympic cycling time trial. \nKristin's perseverance and drive is an inspiration.\n  In the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Kristin, who is a Boise resident and \ngraduate of the University of Idaho, took home the gold. She returned \nto racing in 2011 after a retirement to give birth to her son, Lucas.\n  Throughout her racing career, Kristin has demonstrated remarkable \ndedication and strength. Despite breaking her collarbone in the Exergy \nTour in Idaho 2 months ago and sustaining minor injuries from a crash \njust a few days before her London win, Kristin did not let these \ndifficulties hold her back. She surpassed many skillful competitors to \nonce again achieve the gold medal while also becoming the oldest \nchampion in a road cycling event. Kristin's time of 37 minutes and \n34.82 seconds for the 18-mile course was more than 15 seconds faster \nthan the silver medalist. These are considerable accomplishments.\n  We join the many Idahoans and Americans who applaud Kristin's \ncommitment and excellence.

Jack is retiring this year after 32 years of public service in \nthe Iowa State Legislature. A decorated war hero before his time in \noffice, Jack was awarded the Bronze Star for his service as a tank \ncommander during the Korean war. After serving 4 years each in the Iowa \nHouse of Representatives and the Iowa Senate, he left the Senate in \n1968 but returned in 1988 and has served ever since.

Known as the ``Father of Iowa's Community Colleges,'' he \nsponsored the 1965 bill that created Iowa's community college system. \nLater on, Jack served on the Iowa Lakes Community College Board for 17 \nyears and was president for 10 of those years. What is most remarkable \nabout all of this work is that Jack himself does not have a college \ndegree, but he spent his life making sure his fellow Iowans had the \nopportunity to attain one. Over the years, we have seen the Iowa \ncommunity college system grow and succeed. The statewide community \ncollege student body, which began with a modest enrollment of 9,000 \nstudents, has flourished into a system of 15 schools that now serve \nmore than 155,000 college students and more than 254,000 noncredit \nstudents in every corner of the State.

By \n2018, for instance, Iowa will add 101,000 jobs requiring postsecondary \neducation, according to the Georgetown University Center on Education \nand the Workforce. By this same year, nearly two out of every three \njobs in Iowa will require postsecondary training beyond high school.

Mr. President, today is the 37th anniversary of the \nHelsinki process. Starting with the signing of the Helsinki Final Act \non August 1, 1975, this process began as an ongoing conference which \nhelped end the Cold War and reunite Europe. It has continued as a \nVienna-based organization that today seeks to resolve regional \nconflicts and promote democratic development and the rule of law \nthroughout the region.\n  While serving in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, it has been a \nunique and rewarding privilege to engage in this diplomatic process and \nits parliamentary component as a member and chairman of the U.S. \nHelsinki Commission, with the goal of improving the lives of everyday \npeople. While they may be citizens of other countries, promoting their \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms helps us to protect our own. It \nis, therefore, in our national interest to engage in this process.\n  On this anniversary, however, I do want to focus on three U.S. \ncitizens who suffered the ultimate violation of their human rights when \nthey were taken into a field and shot, deliberately murdered, in July \n1999 by a special operations unit under the control the Interior \nMinistry in Serbia. They were brothers: Ylli, Agron and Mehmet Bytyqi.\n  The Bytyqi brothers were Albanian-Americans from New York. Earlier in \n1999, they went to Kosovo to fight as members of the Kosovo Liberation \nArmy in a conflict which eventually prompted a NATO military \nintervention designed to stop Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic and his \nforces. When the conflict ended, the Bytyqi brothers assisted ethnic \nRoma neighbors of their mother in Kosovo by escorting them to the \nSerbian border. Accidently straying into Serbian territory, they were \narrested and sentenced to 2 weeks in jail for illegal entry. When \nreleased from prison, they were\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nnot freed. Instead, the Bytyqi brothers were transported to an Interior \nMinistry training camp in eastern Serbia, where they were brutally \nexecuted and buried in a mass grave with 75 other ethnic Albanians from \nKosovo. Two years later, after the fall of the Milosevic regime, their \nbodies were recovered and repatriated to the United States for burial.\n  Ylli, Agron and Mehmet were never given a fair and public trial, an \nopportunity to defend themselves, or any semblance of due process. \nTheir post-conflict, extrajudicial killing was cold-blooded murder.\n  In the last decade Serbia has made a remarkable recovery from the \nMilosevic era. I saw this myself last year when I visited Belgrade. \nThis progress, however, has not sufficiently infiltrated the Interior \nMinistry, affording protection to those who participated in the Bytyqi \nmurders and other egregious Milosevic-era crimes. Nobody has been held \naccountable for the Bytyqi murders. Those in command of the camp and \nthe forces operating there have never been charged.\n  The same situation applies to the April 1999 murder of prominent \njournalist and editor Slavko Curuvija, who testified before the \nHelsinki Commission on the abuses of the Milosevic regime just months \nbefore. There needs to be justice in each of these cases, but together \nwith other unresolved cases they symbolize the lack of transparency and \nreform in Serbia's Interior Ministry to this day. Combined with \ncontinued denials of what transpired under Milosevic in the 1990s, \nincluding the 1995 genocide at Srebrenica in neighboring Bosnia, these \ncases show that Serbia has not completely put an ugly era in its past \nbehind it. For that reason, not only does the surviving Bytyqi family \nin New York, as well as the friends and family of Slavko Curuvija, \nstill need to have the satisfaction of justice. The people of Serbia \nneed to see justice triumph in their country as well.\n  I want to thank the U.S. Mission to the OSCE in Vienna, which under \nthe leadership of Ambassador Ian Kelly continues to move the Helsinki \nprocess forward, for recently raising the Bytyqi murders and calling \nfor justice. I also want to commend the nominee for U.S. Ambassador to \nSerbia, Michael David Kirby, for responding to my question on the \nBytyqi and Curuvija cases at his Foreign Relations Committee hearing by \nexpressing his commitment, if confirmed, to make justice in these cases \na priority matter. On this anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, I \njoin their call for justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5865-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOEL BOUSMAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Joel Bousman \nwho will be inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame later \nthis month at the 100th Wyoming State Fair. Since 1992, Wyoming has \nrecognized the individuals each year who have made substantial \ncontributions to agriculture in our State. This year I have the honor \nof presenting this award to Joel with my colleague Senator Barrasso.\n  Joel Bousman is a fourth generation rancher and operator of Eastfork \nLivestock in Boulder, WY. Actively involved in the Wyoming Stock \nGrowers Association, he is admired for his leadership in the State's \nlivestock industry. Having served as regional vice president of the \nWyoming Stock Growers and president of the Green River Valley \nCattleman's Association, Joel is a determined advocate and defender of \nagriculture.\n  Wyoming ranchers are known nationwide for their stewardship and Joel \nleads by example with his own operation and when grazing on public \nlands. In 2003, he was presented with the Wyoming Stock Growers \nEnvironmental Stewardship Award and was most recently presented with \nthe 2011 Guardian of the Range Award. Bousman's nomination letter \nreads, ``He was a pioneer in initiating grazing monitoring that is \nconducted jointly by the federal land agencies and the grazing \npermittees.'' To this day, he remains active in promoting joint efforts \nto improve grazing and wildlife habitat on Wyoming's working lands.\n  Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame Award recipients are also expected \nto serve their communities and Joel has been no exception as the \nchairman of the Sublette County Board of County Commissioners. Joel has \nnot only served his community as a commissioner but has regularly come \nto Washington to bring his message before congressional committees and \ndirectly to Members. Wyoming Governor Matt Mead writes that Joel is, \n``a proven leader who is well respected in all circles--from the halls \nof Congress to the Wyoming Capitol and from the Sublette County \nBuilding to a constituent's kitchen table.''\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize Joel's achievements \nwith Senator Barrasso as a 2012 inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture \nHall of Fame. Wyoming and its public lands are well served by his \nlasting and continuing contributions to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5865-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GENE HARDY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, during Wyoming's State Fair, Senator \nEnzi and I will have the honor of inducting Gene Hardy into the Wyoming \nAgriculture Hall of Fame.\n  Wyoming ranchers care for the land because it cares for them and \ntheir families. The Hardy Ranch tradition began in 1920 when Gene's \nfather homesteaded in Converse County, WY. By the 1930s, the Hardy \nfamily was producing both cattle and sheep. Gene Hardy is a third \ngeneration rancher continuing the family business of multi-species \nlivestock production. Additionally, he balances wildlife and energy \nproduction on the Hardy Ranch. Balancing the ranch's resources has led \nGene to also be an industry leader in terms of multiple use land \nmanagement.\n  Mr. President, innovative is a word that describes Gene. He has \norganized his livestock operation to improve production utilizing land \nmanagement through aerial monitoring. As a pilot, he has been flying \nplanes for 50 years over the Hardy Ranch with the result being \nprofitable livestock production and sustainable grazing. Furthermore, \nhe has focused on innovation through superior genetics to produce \nquality livestock.\n  Gene is committed to the livestock industry. He works tirelessly to \nhelp his fellow producers. Previously, Gene served as president of the \nWyoming Wool Growers Association and on boards for the Wyoming Stock \nGrowers Association. However, his involvement does not stop there. He \nis still actively involved in many local, State, and national \nagricultural organizations. Currently, Gene serves as the chairman of \nthe American Sheep Industry Association's Predator Management \nCommittee. Gene's dedication and leadership will help ensure the \nsuccess of the industry for future generations of agriculturalists.\n  As my friend Bryce Reece, executive-vice president of the Wyoming \nWool Growers Association, remarked, ``We need a lot more Gene Hardy's \nin this world.''\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Enzi in \ncongratulating Gene Hardy, 2012 inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture \nHall of Fame. Wyoming lands and livestock are better because of his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5865-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5865-S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING MARY LOUISE RASMUSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the passing of \none of Alaska's most endeared philanthropists, Mary Louise Rasmuson. \nMrs. Rasmuson died on July 30, 2012, at her home in Anchorage, AK. Mary \nLouise Rasmuson was a beloved Alaska pioneer who saw opportunity in \nevery challenge. She was generous in spirit and deed, and through her \nfamily foundation made Alaska a much stronger and vibrant state.\n  Intelligent. Diplomatic. Principled and ethical. Gentle but firm. \nMrs. Rasmuson spent her life breaking barriers, challenging \nconventions, and seeking to improve opportunities for those around her.\n  She was a trailblazer for women and left her mark across the country \nand the State of Alaska through her leadership, philanthropy, and the \nfamily foundation that she helped lead with her late husband Elmer.\n  Selected from the initial pool of 30,000 applicants for the new \nWomen's Army Corp-WAC she rose quickly\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\nthrough the ranks and in 1957 became the fifth commandant of the WAC, a \nposition she occupied for 6 years, first appointed by President \nEisenhower and reappointed by President Kennedy. Mary Louise led the \nway for women in the military. Mrs. Rasmuson's oral history of the WAC \nunit, World War II and the Korean War is among those recorded by The \nLibrary of Congress for The Veterans History Project.\n  In 1942, as the United States entered World War II, Mrs. Rasmuson \nleft her job as an assistant principal in a school district near \nPittsburgh and became a member of the first class of the new WAC.\n  As director of the WAC unit, military historians credit her with \nmajor achievements including increasing the WAC's strength, insisting \non effectiveness in command, working with Congress to amend laws that \ndeprived women of service credit and benefits, and expanding the range \nof military opportunities open to women.\n  Mrs. Rasmuson retired in 1962 after 20 years of military service, \nduring which she received a Legion of Merit award with two oak leaf \nclusters for her work integrating Black women into the WAC. She was \nalso awarded the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Service Medal, the \nAmerican Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Occupation Medal \nand National Defense Medal. At an event honoring her, former U.S. \nSecretary of Defense William Perry said, ``When you hear about women \nseizing new opportunities to serve, remember that they march behind \nColonel Rasmuson.''\n  Mary Louise's impact can be felt virtually everywhere in Alaska, \nwhether improving the position of families, founding a world-class \nmuseum, enhancing research in healthcare, and advancing understanding \nof Alaska Native cultures on a national stage. Her contributions have \nreached every corner of Alaska, from Ketchikan to Gambell.\n  Mrs. Rasmuson arrived in Alaska in 1962 after her marriage to Elmer \nE. Rasmuson, chairman of National Bank of Alaska. Together, they made a \nformidable team influential in the public and civic agenda in a rapidly \ndeveloping city and State. She quickly adapted to life in Alaska and \nbecame active in several community groups. One of her most visible \nimpacts on Alaska came from her service as head of the Municipality of \nAnchorage Historical and Fine Arts Commission and later as chair of the \nAnchorage Museum Foundation. Her vision, passion and personal effort \nled to the creation of the Anchorage Museum of Art and History in 1968. \nAs Mayor of Anchorage, I was proud to be with Mrs. Rasmuson to cut the \nribbon on the latest expansion of the museum, now named the Anchorage \nMuseum at Rasmuson Center, a culminating moment in her decades-long \nvision to build a great museum for all Alaskans.\n  In 1967, Mrs. Rasmuson began what would become 45 years of service on \nthe board of Rasmuson Foundation. She maintained an active voice in the \naffairs of the Foundation and regularly attended board meetings until \nher late 90s, when she transitioned to an emeritus position. Even in \nthe last years of her life, Mrs. Rasmuson received briefings from \nFoundation staff on projects seeking Foundation support.\n  Facilities that bear her name include the Elmer and Mary Louise \nRasmuson Theater at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American \nIndian in Washington, DC, the Elmer and Mary Louise Rasmuson Center for \nRheumatic Disease at the Benaroya Research Institute of Virginia Mason \nHospital in Seattle, WA, and the Mary Louise Rasmuson Pavilion at the \nBoy Scouts of America Camp Gorsuch in Chugiak, AK. Mary Louise Rasmuson \nwill be missed by all who knew her, but her legacy will live forever in \nthe hearts and minds of Alaskans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5866-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SOFIA GUANA\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, today I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor Judy Kroll of Volga, SD.\n  Judy Kroll has spent her career serving the community of Brookings, \nSD, in her capacity as an educator, as well as the director of the \nthriving speech and debate program at Brookings High School.\n  Judy, who retired this summer, served as a South Dakota educator for \n37 years, teaching in both Madison and Parkston before starting at \nBrookings High School in 1980. During her 32 years as an educator and \ndebate coach in Brookings, she has left an indelible impact on her \nstudents, dedicating an immeasurable amount of time to positively \nimpacting the lives of young people. Judy has devoted countless hours \nto advance the critical and analytical skills of those students who she \ntaught, coached, and mentored.\n  During her coaching career, Judy has been awarded South Dakota \nForensic Coaches Association Coach of the Year on numerous occasions \nand coached her students to multiple State championships in various \nspeech and debate events. Her success as a coach was also demonstrated \nat the national level. She coached policy debate teams to 2nd and 3rd \nplace finishes in 2000 at the National Forensics League National Speech \nand Debate Tournament and a 7th place finish earlier this summer at the \nsame tournament.\n  Judy's longstanding involvement in the debate community has been \nrecognized not only by her South Dakota peers, but at a national level \nas well. In 2011, she was admitted to the National Forensics League \nHall of Fame. Of the thousands of debate coaches who have been a part \nof the National Forensics League since its inception in 1925, only 158 \nindividuals have earned this honor. Judy is one of four South Dakotans \nto have received this honor. In addition, she was recently named the \n2012 National Forensics League Coach of the Year. This award recognizes \nJudy's outstanding leadership and commitment to National Forensic \nLeague activities. Judy's receipt of this award marks only the second \ntime a South Dakotan has received such an honor since it was first \nawarded in 1953.\n  During her teaching and coaching career, Judy encouraged her students \nto never give up on accomplishing their goals. She promoted outstanding \nsportsmanship and for years a large display in her classroom read, \n``What is popular is not always right, and what is right is not always \npopular.'' Judy exemplified for her students the importance of working \nhard and attaining success without compromising ethics and sense of \ndoing what is right.\n  I join Judy's family, friends, and students in recognizing her \nmeritorious work and extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Judy \nfor all she has done for her students and the State of South Dakota, \nand wish her the best in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5866-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5866-S5867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 828.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to define \ncare coordination, include care coordination as a fully restorative \nservice, and detail the care coordination functions of the Assistant \nSecretary, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for the past 47 years, the Older Americans \nAct, OAA, has provided a wide array of services to improve the lives of \nolder Americans, family caregivers, and persons with disabilities. \nThrough the Act, millions of Americans receive critical home and \ncommunity-based services including, home-delivered meal programs, \ntransportation, adult day care, legal assistance and health promotion \nprograms. The National Aging Network delivers these vital services to \nlocal communities through the Administration on Aging, State Units on \nAging, SUAs, and over 600 Area Agencies on Aging, AAAs.\n  The aging network supports a number of health, prevention and \nwellness programs for older adults, such as, chronic disease self-\nmanagement programs, alcohol and substance abuse reduction, smoking \ncessation, weight loss and control, and health screenings. Despite this \nfocus on health promotion, currently, there is no definition of care \ncoordination included in the Older Americans Act. In fact, the unique \ncoordination needed for an older adult with multiple chronic conditions \nis absent from the definition of the OAA case manager role.\n  The inclusion of care coordination in the OAA is necessary to prepare \nthe aging network for their role in linking medical care to community \nlong-term services and supports. The Affordable Care Act is \ntransforming the health care delivery system through medical home \ndemonstration, Accountable Care Organizations, and the Partnership for \nPatient-Care Transitions. But to be truly successful, these reforms \nwill require the coordination of care between state and federal health \ncare programs and the aging network.\n  Today, I am introducing the Care Coordination for Older Americans \nAct, a bill that would integrate care coordination in the long-term \nservices and supports system. My legislation would include a definition \nof care coordination in the declaration of objectives of the Older \nAmericans Act and would require the aging network to develop and \nimplement a care coordination plan to address the needs of older \nindividuals with multiple chronic illnesses.\n  I would like to thank a number of aging organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of this legislation and who have endorsed \nit today, including: Aging Services of California, the American \nGeriatrics Society, the American Society on Aging, the Benjamin Rose \nInstitute on Aging, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Consumer \nCoalition for Quality Health Care, the Easter Seals, The Gerontological \nSociety of America, LeadingAge, the National Association of Area \nAgencies on Aging, n4a, the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, \nthe National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs, the \nNational Association of the Professional Geriatric Care Managers, the \nNational Center on Caregiving, the Family Caregiver Alliance, PHI \nQuality Care through Quality Jobs, the Social Work Leadership Institute \n/ New York Academy of Medicine, and the University of Illinois College \nof Nursing Institute for Health Care Innovation. In addition, the \nNational Coalition for Care Coordination was pivotal in their \nassistance developing a definition of care coordination which \nadequately addresses the needs of the aging network.\n  Since being enacted in 1965, the OAA has evolved over time to meet \nthe ever-changing needs of our aging population. As we work to \nreauthorize this successful program that has allowed millions of \nseniors to remain independent in their homes and communities, we should \nincorporate new initiatives that reflect the current challenges facing \nseniors, such as the lack of care coordination between health programs \nand community long-term services and supports.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nimportant legislation and to support its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the OAA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHANNS:\n  S. 3467. A bill to establish a moratorium on aerial surveillance \nconducted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \nissue I have brought up before in the Senate that continues to trouble \nme.\n  Whenever I meet with farmers and ranchers in Nebraska, they often \nraise concerns about regulatory overreach. I hear about the need for \nagencies such as the EPA to provide a more predictable and commonsense \nregulatory environment. So today I am introducing a bill that will do \nexactly that. It stops the EPA's use of aerial surveillance of\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nagricultural operations for a period of 12 months--1 year.\n  Earlier this year, I began hearing about this issue from constituents \nwho are worried about privacy concerns. Thus, a few of my colleagues \nand I wrote to Administrator Jackson in late May asking her several \nquestions about EPA's practice of flying over livestock operations and \ntaking pictures. We were curious about the scope of flights over \nagriculture operations in Nebraska and around the country. We asked how \nthe agency selects targets for surveillance and whether any images of \nresidences, land, or buildings not subject to EPA regulation were being \ncaptured.\n  Additionally, we asked a very fair question: We asked about the use \nof the images, where are they stored, how are they used, who are they \nshared with, and how long they would remain on file--all seemingly \nstraightforward, fair, basic questions.\n  Well, to say the least, EPA has been less than forthcoming about the \nuse of aerial surveillance. EPA has acknowledged aerial surveillance \nactivities in Nebraska, Iowa, and West Virginia. But despite repeated \nrequests, details concerning the national scope of this program and its \nmanagement by EPA headquarters have not been disclosed.\n  You see, I believe the American public deserves open, \nstraightforward, honest information about why EPA is flying over their \nland--not just in Nebraska but across the country.\n  Time and time again, farmers have consistently proven they are \nexcellent stewards of the environment. They make their living from the \nland, and they are very mindful of maintaining it and protecting it and \nleaving it improved.\n  I agree wholeheartedly that we should ensure our waterways are clean \nand our air is safe. So I want to be very clear: This legislation does \nnot affect EPA's ability to use traditional onsite inspections. But \ngiven EPA's track record of ignorance about agriculture, if not \ndownright contempt for it, farmers and ranchers do not trust this \nagency, and they sure as heck do not approve of EPA doing low-altitude \nsurveillance flights over citizens' private property.\n  So until EPA takes a more commonsense, transparent, open approach, we \nneed to step on the brakes. This bill simply does that. It places a 1-\nyear moratorium on EPA from using aerial surveillance. This will give \nthe agency time to come clean about its activities nationwide and make \nthe case that these flights are an appropriate use of agency authority \nand taxpayer money.\n  Unless the EPA does that openly, the level of trust between farmers \nand ranchers and the EPA will continue to erode. In the meantime, \npassage of this legislation will help provide our farmers and our \nranchers and others in rural America with much needed regulatory \ncertainty.\n  I offered an amendment on this issue during the recent farm bill \ndebate. It got broad bipartisan support--56 votes. Ten of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle joined me in this effort, so it is not a \npartisan issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue their support of this effort to \nbring accountability and transparency to the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3469. A bill to establish a new organization to manage nuclear \nwaste, provide a consensual process for siting nuclear waste \nfacilities, ensure adequate funding for managing nuclear waste, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill to \nimplement the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Commission on \nAmerica's Nuclear Future.\n  The Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by Secretary of Energy \nSteven Chu, at the request of President Obama, in March 2010. The \npurpose of the Commission was to examine the nation's nuclear waste \nmanagement policy, consider alternatives, and recommend a new approach. \nThe Commission was made up of 15 distinguished members, and co-chaired \nby Representative Lee Hamilton and General Brent Scowcroft. Two of our \nformer colleagues, Senator Domenici and Senator Hagel, were also \nmembers.\n  The Commission did an outstanding job. It met more than two dozen \ntimes over two years, conducted five public hearings across the \ncountry, heard testimony from countless experts and stakeholders, \nvisited nuclear waste management facilities both here and abroad, and \nassembled a very thorough, thoughtful, and authoritative report.\n  The Commission made eight clear, concise, and eminently sensible \nrecommendations. Principally, it recommended that we adopt a new, \nconsent-based approach to siting nuclear waste management facilities, \nand that we establish a new organization to manage the nuclear waste \nmanagement program. It affirmed the need to build one or more geologic \nrepositories in which nuclear waste can be permanently buried, and it \nendorsed the need to build one or more temporary storage facilities in \nwhich nuclear waste can be stored until it can be permanently disposed \nof in a repository. It emphasized the importance of giving the new \norganization access to the funds needed to implement the program. It \nalso made useful recommendations on transportation, and on the \nimportance of continued support for nuclear research and development \nand international nuclear non-proliferation programs.\n  The Commission published its report at the end of January, and the \ntwo co-chairs, Representative Hamilton and General Scowcroft, testified \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on it in early \nFebruary.\n  Since then, I have been working with the Ranking Republican on the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, and the \nChairman and Ranking Republican on the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Alexander, to try to put the commission's recommendations into \nlegislative language.\n  Much of our time and effort centered on the Commission's \nrecommendation for ``a new organization dedicated solely to \nimplementing the waste management program.'' The Commission recommended \nthat Congress establish a new ``single purpose organization,'' outside \nof the Department of Energy, but still within the Federal Government to \nmanage the nation's nuclear wastes in place of the Department of \nEnergy. More specifically, it proposed formation of a government \ncorporation, and suggested that the Tennessee Valley Authority might \nprovide a useful model.\n  Our initial efforts focused on the government corporation approach, \nbut we ultimately agreed to set that model aside in favor of a \nstructure that we believe may be both more effective and more \naccountable. We chose to focus full responsibility and authority for \nthe program in a single administrator, and to establish a separate \nboard made up of senior Federal officials to oversee the administrator.\n  Most of the rest of our discussions focused on the siting process for \ntemporary storage facilities and permanent geologic repositories. We \nagreed with the commission's recommendation that the new organization \nemploy a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities and \nwith the need for to establish interim storage facilities pending \ncompletion of a repository. But we were unable to agree on the \n``linkage'' between storage facilities and the repository.\n  Under current law, the Department of Energy cannot begin constructing \na storage facility until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues a \nlicense to construct the repository. The Commission found that this \ntight linkage has prevented a storage facility from being built and \nrecommended that it be eliminated. But the commission also recognized \nthe need for what it called ``positive linkages'' between storage and \ndisposal to ensure that progress continues on both fronts and interim \nstorage does not end up become permanent.\n  Meanwhile, while our discussions were underway, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee reported legislation that \nauthorizes the Secretary of Energy to begin storing nuclear waste at \ninterim storage sites. My proposal for ``positive linkages'' was to \nallow the new agency to store up to 10,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel at a storage facility built under the authority in the \nappropriations bill, even if no agreement has\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nbeen reached on a repository, but to require there to be an agreement \nfor a repository before allowing the new agency to store nuclear waste \nat other storage facilities.\n  Regrettably, we were not able to reach an agreement on this issue or \non whether the siting process for storage facilities should be \nidentical to the siting process for repositories wherever possible.\n  Nonetheless, we agreed that I should introduce the bill with the \nlinkages that I have proposed and that the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources should hold a hearing on it in September. I \nrecognize, of course, that the bill will not become law this year. But \nmy hope is to obtain testimony on it and to build a legislative record \nthat might serve as the foundation for further consideration and \nultimate enactment in the next Congress.\n  The Blue Ribbon Commission found that ``it is long past time for the \ngovernment to make good on its commitments to the American people to \nprovide for the safe disposal of nuclear waste.''\n  ``Put simply,'' the Commission said, ``this nation's failure to come \nto grips with the nuclear waste issue has already proved damaging and \ncostly. It will be even more damaging and more costly the longer it \ncontinues. . . . ''\n  The commission has performed a very valuable service to the nation in \nshowing us a way forward. Its recommendations merit our careful \nconsideration and deserve our approval. I have attempted to put them \ninto legislative form so that they can be enacted and implemented.\n  I recognize that will not happen this year. It will take a great deal \nmore time and work. But it must begin and I hope it will continue in \nthe next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct of 1974 to provide improvements to such Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about a \nbill that I have the pleasure of helping to lead with several of my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Grassley, who has been my long-\nstanding partner and a wonderful cochair of the foster care caucus. \nThere are any number of us, Republicans and Democrats, who have our \neyes on and our hearts connected to the 500,000 children who are \ntechnically being raised by the government.\n  The government does many things well, but raising children isn't one \nof them. So it is our responsibility, when we enter into or respond to \na case of abuse, gross abuse, neglect, or gross neglect, that we \nrespond appropriately by removing children from homes who have, \nunfortunately, been tortured at times by their own parents. That, of \ncourse, is inconceivable to me and to many, but, unfortunately, it \nhappens.\n  So we remove children--hopefully temporarily--until the situation at \nhome can be addressed with community services, faith-based services and \nsupport, where the children can be reunited with parents who have been \nhealed, possibly, of their situation. That is not always the case, and \nwe work as quickly as we can to find responsible and able relatives to \ntake in the child--willing and able relatives, the law says, to take in \nthe child with sibling groups intact. If that is not possible, then we \nseek to find a family in the community that will adopt these children.\n  The thing I want to say about these wonderful children is that while \ntheir families may be broken--families may disintegrate for all sorts \nof reasons, including mental health, drug abuse, uncontrollable \nviolence, criminal activity that disintegrates the family, and children \nare most certainly affected--these children, in many instances, aren't \nbroken. Their families are broken. The possibility of these children, \nfrom the ages of zero to 1 or 2 or 3 or 9 or 12 or 15, being given an \nopportunity to be adopted into the loving arms of a stable family who \nwill raise that child or children as their own or to be reunified with \nloving family members is ideal.\n  As I said, governments do many things well, but raising children \nisn't one of them. Human beings raise other human beings, and we need \nto do a better job of placing our children in quality, temporary foster \nhomes, and then finding permanent, loving homes.\n  We have this crazy notion in America and around the world that \nchildren are grown when they are 18, so we put all of their belongings \nin a plastic bag and we say goodbye to them, and we tell them: Please \nforget my cell phone number because you have aged out of the system.\n  Several of us have been working for years, including former Senator \nChafee, for one, to create more permanent opportunities for extended, \nindependent living. While I support that--it is much better than \nputting their things in a bag, their few little items after 18 years, \nand sending them on their way--we now can extend that help until they \nare 21. However, what we really need to be doing is finding families \nfor these children.\n  I am 57 and I still need my family. I still talk to my mother and \nfather almost every day. I was with my family this weekend. They will \nbe with me and have been with me for every important moment of my life. \nWhen did somebody get a notion that children don't need a family after \nthey are 18? It is a silly notion, and it is not even true. We would \nnot send our own children into the world alone by themselves. So our \nwhole foster system needs great reform, and we are working on that.\n  But one piece of this system that needs reform is what we are trying \nto address today by introducing the Uninterrupted Scholars Act, which \nis a bill that Senator Grassley and many others, including Senator \nBegich, Senator Blunt, Senator Boxer, Senator Franken, and Senator \nKlobuchar have graciously agreed to cosponsor and provide their \nleadership. Congresswoman Bass is a U.S. Representative from \nCalifornia's 33rd District. She, along with Congresswoman Bachmann from \nMinnesota, Congressman Marino from Pennsylvania, and Congressman \nMcDermott from Washington State, has introduced the same bipartisan \nbill in the House. So we are very excited about the strong bipartisan \nsupport for this bill.\n  All this bill says--and it makes such sense I can't believe it is not \nin the law already--is that when a child comes into the care of the \ngovernment, the government agency responsible for the care of this \nchild--now it is not parents any longer because the parents' rights \neither have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated--\nthe government will have the right, or the agencies representing the \ngovernment, to their academic records.\n  What is happening now is foster children are getting lost not only in \nthe system but lost in their schools because of the difficulty in \ngetting access to education records under the guise that these records \nshould be private, et cetera.\n  What is happening is some of these privacy rules are not protecting \nthe children, they are protecting the system that is broken, and that \nis the problem. We are doing everything we can to protect the privacy \nof the child, but what is happening is some of these privacy rules are \nputting up a screen so that we can't find out that the school is not \ndoing its job on behalf of the child, or the social workers are not \ndoing their job on behalf of the child.\n  So this simply streamlines the process of making sure academic \nrecords can be accessed by foster families--either adoptive families or \nguardians--without having to go through the courts for a long, extended \ntimeframe.\n  I think this is an important change. It is one of probably 100 \nchanges to this system that need to be made. Of course, we can make \nthese new laws in Washington. A lot of this has to be carried out with \nheart and compassion and common sense, which, unfortunately, we cannot \nlegislate from Washington. But what we can do is try, when we see a \nproblem--this problem was identified not by me or by my staff. It was \nactually identified by foster youth who came up here this summer to \nintern and brought to our attention the issue that some of their \nrecords are not accessible to their foster families who are trying \ntheir best to raise them and to help them, et cetera. So the young \npeople themselves have asked for this change. We are happy to \naccommodate that request.\n  Let me end by saying again, there are over 480,000--about 400,000 to \n500,000--children who are in our foster care system representing less \nthan one-half of 1 percent of all the children in America, which is \nabout 100 million. But it is an important one-half of 1 percent because \nthese are children whose families have failed them terribly. These are \nchildren who are vulnerable and need us to love them extra specially, \nto help them extra specially. That is what some of us spend a good bit \nof our time trying to do because they are willing and able to become \ngreat citizens of our Nation but need that extra special help.\n  So this Uninterrupted Scholars Act will give access, appropriately \nwith protections, to their academic records. Senator Franken has a bill \nto give them choice in public schools to help give them stability in \ntheir public schools, so they can stay with their friends, their \nteachers, as they, unfortunately, have to move around in the system.\n  Many people will benefit--most importantly, the youth involved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3473. A bill to replace automatic spending cuts with targeted \nreforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am waiting now for them to bring up a \nbill I have filed today and will have a number to go with it which I \nwill announce in a moment.\n  First of all, let me say that the talk of the whole country right now \nis on the sequestration problems we are having. I would only observe \nthat I don't know why it is so difficult for people to understand, but \nPresident Obama has written four budgets and these budgets have come \nbefore us, and if we add up all of the deficits in the four budgets, it \ncomes to $5.3 trillion worth of deficits. I suggest that is more \ndeficit than all Presidents in the history of this country for the past \n200-plus years.\n  So, people say, how did we get into this mess? Because when we have \nthose kinds of deficits over a period of time, we wonder where it is \ncoming from. Let me tell my colleagues where it didn't come from, where \nit wasn't spent, and that is military.\n  I went over the first budget President Obama had. I went over to \nAfghanistan so I could make sure I could get the attention of the \nAmerican people and let them know how this disarming of America by \nPresident Obama is going. Of course, if one of my colleagues was part \nof that first budget, they would know that it cut out our only fifth-\ngeneration fighter, the F-22; our lift capacity, the C-17; the future \ncombat system; the ground based interceptor in Poland. That was just \nthe first budget. Then it has gotten worse since that time. Since there \nisn't time to go over that detail year by year, I can only say that the \nPresident has already cut in his budget over the next decade $487 \nbillion, roughly $500 billion, $\\1/2\\ trillion--from defense spending \nover the next 10 years.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that the American people--this is \nsomething that is very frustrating, because they assume that when we \nsend our kids into battle, they have the best of equipment, and this \njust flat isn't true. The British have an AS90, a Howitzer that is \nbetter than ours. The Russians have the 2S19 that is better than ours. \nEven South Africa has a system that is a better nonline-of-sight cannon \nthan we have in our arsenal. The Chinese have a J-10 that is better \nthan ours. In fact, they are now cranking them out to where they rival \nour F-15s, F-16s, and F/A18s.\n  So the point I am making here is there has been no emphasis. If we go \nout and borrow and increase the deficit by $5.3 trillion as this \nPresident is doing, one would think we would be in a position to have a \nlot more robust military, but the military has been consistently cut \nover that period of time.\n  In the event the Obama sequestration as it is designed right now goes \nthrough, that will be another $\\1/2\\ trillion that will come out of the \nmilitary. Even the President's own Secretary of Defense, Secretary \nPanetta, has said if these cuts take place--talking about the Obama \nsequestration cuts--in addition to what he has already cut, it would be \n``devastating to the military.'' That means we would have the smallest \nground fleet since the 1940s, we would have the smallest fleet of ships \nsince 1915, and the smallest tactical fighter capability or force in \nthe history of the Air Force.\n  So if we want the United States to continue providing the type of \nglobal leadership our people have come to expect and meet the \nexpectations of the American people--when we talk to the American \npeople, they are shocked when they find out other countries have things \nthat are better than we have.\n  If we want to beat this, then we are going to have to do something \nabout, No. 1, what is happening to the military; and No. 2, the \nsequestration.\n  I have it all in one bill. In a minute we will get a number for that \nbill. Anyway, it is called the Sequestration Prevention Act of 2012. It \nreplaces the sequestration cuts with some smart reforms, and I am going \nto go over those in a minute to show my colleagues what they are. It \nreplaces the $1.2 trillion and then has a lot of money left over.\n  Let me just kind of go over what this bill would do. People keep \nsaying: We cannot do anything about it. We cannot do anything about the \nsequestration, the cuts.\n  We had this great committee that was supposed to be out there finding \n$1.2 trillion over a 10-year period and yet we have a President who was \nable to give us deficits of five times that much over just a 4-year \nperiod.\n  What it does, first of all, to come up with this $1.2 trillion, plus \nrebuilding the military--we want to rebuild the military, in my \nestimation, up to 4 percent of GDP. For the last 100 years, prior to \n1990--for 100 years--the average defense spending constituted 5.7 \npercent of GDP. That was the average, in times of war and in times of \npeace. Now it is all the way down, after his sequestration, to below 3 \npercent; in other words, about half of that.\n  What I wish to do with additional funds that come from this bill I am \nintroducing today is put that back into the military and bring us up to \n4 percent of GDP--still considerably less than where we have been over \nthe last 100 years.\n  The first thing it does is completely repeal ObamaCare and adopts \nPaul Ryan's approach to block granting the Medicaid Program so States \nhave complete control over the dollars they use to reach their low-\nincome populations with health care assistance. Together, these two \nchanges will reduce spending by $1.1 trillion over 10 years.\n  Secondly, it returns nondefense discretionary spending to the 2006 \nlevels. When this President came in, the amount of the nondefense \ndiscretionary spending surged. This would have a savings over that \nperiod of time of $952 billion.\n  The third thing it does is it block grants the Food Stamp Program and \nconverts it into a discretionary program so States have complete \ncontrol over the design of their nutrition assistance programs to best \nmeet the needs of their low-income populations. This provision reverses \nthe massive expansion we have seen of the Food Stamp Program under the \nObama administration, which has literally doubled in size, up to 100 \npercent, since he took office.\n  On President Obama's inauguration day, just under 32 million people \nwere on food stamps. Today, it is more than 46 million people, and they \nreceive these benefits. It is going to have to stop. It will continue \nto go up if we do not do something about it. This provision saves $285 \nbillion.\n  By the way, I think it is important to know, when we look at the farm \nprogram, the farm program is a welfare program because they increase \nall these provisions and call it part of the farm bill. But that is a \ndifferent subject, and I will talk about it later, not today but later.\n  The fourth thing the legislation does is it reduces the Federal \nworkforce by 10 percent through attrition. Nobody out there is going to \nbe fired. There are not going to be any cuts. In fact, it would \ncontinue to have some modest increases in payment for those who are \nthere. Through attrition, the savings would be about $144 billion over \n10 years.\n  The fifth thing the bill does is it repeals the authority of the \nFederal Government to spend taxpayer dollars on climate change or \nglobal warming. This is kind of interesting because very few people \nknow that--even though they remember that every time there has been a \nbill on cap and trade, there is a cost to the American people of \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year, and people's \nheads start spinning when we talk about these large amounts. Sometimes \nin my State of Oklahoma, what I have done is take the total number of \nfamilies who file Federal tax returns and then I apply this to it. This \nwould be about $3,000 per family in my State of Oklahoma. Yet even the \nDirector of the EPA admits that if we did this, it would not reduce \nCO2 emissions worldwide. That is the Director of the EPA, \nLisa Jackson, and that is on the record. I appreciate her honesty in \nthat respect.\n  If we do this right now--what people do not know is this President \nhas spent $68.4 billion since he has been President on all this global \nwarming stuff. That is without authority because we have clearly \ndefeated all those bills. What he has done through regulations is what \nhe could not do through legislation. But nobody knows about it, until \nnow. Now they know about it.\n  Anyway, if we stop doing that over the next 10 years, that will save \nan additional $83 billion.\n  Finally, the legislation includes comprehensive medical malpractice \nand\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\ntort reform. That is the same thing that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and that would save $74 billion over 10 years.\n  All told, all the savings generated would be $2.6 trillion--not $1.2 \ntrillion--$2.6 trillion over 10 years. So do not let anyone tell you, \nwe cannot get there from here. Clearly, we can get there from here.\n  We use the remaining amount to beef up the military to get back to \nour 4-percent level. I believe if we were to talk to the average \nAmerican, they would say: Yes, let's go ahead and do this. Why aren't \nwe doing it now?\n  Let me mention one other thing before I conclude; that is, we have \nsomething called the WARN Act. What that does is require the \nemployers--who know because of sequestration there are going to be \nlayoffs--to give pink slips at least 60 days prior to the time that \nwill happen. Under sequestration, if they do not adopt my act, if they \ndo that, then those pink slips would have to be out there by the 2nd of \nNovember.\n  The President does not want that to happen. He does not want the \nObama sequestration to be pointed out and identified as to what is \ncausing them to lose their jobs, so he is trying to get companies not \nto comply with the WARN Act.\n  Clearly, the WARN Act says ``an employer shall not order a plant \nclosing or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the \nemployer serves written notice of such an order.''\n  The WARN Act states--this is very significant because if there are \ncompanies out there that are listening to the President when he is \nasking them not to issue the pink slips, this is what would happen to \nthem--it states that ``any employer who orders a plant closing or mass \nlayoff in violation of Section 3 . . . shall be liable to each \naggrieved employee who suffers an employment loss as a result of such \nclosing or layoff.''\n  In other words, if they do not do it, then that opens the doors for \nall the trial lawyers to come in. Just imagine the cases. At Lockheed \nMartin, they say they are going to have to let go of some 120,000 \npeople. If they had a class action suit, each one who was let go would \nreceive something like $1,000. That would be $120 million that company \nwould have to pay. I cannot imagine the board of directors of any \ncompany anywhere in America not complying with this legal act called \nthe WARN Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Casey, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts):\n  S. 3477. A bill to ensure that the United States promotes women's \nmeaningful inclusion and participation in mediation and negotiation \nprocesses undertaken in order to prevent, mitigate, or resolve violent \nconflict and implements the United States National Action Plan on \nWomen, Peace, and Security; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women, \nPeace, and Security Act of 2012 with Senators Hutchison, Casey, Snowe, \nShaheen, Gillibrand and Scott Brown. A companion bill was also \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today by Representatives \nCarnahan, Berman and Schakowsky.\n  This important legislation will help codify the United States \nNational Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, which was released \nby the Obama administration in December, 2011, to help further ongoing \nU.S. initiatives regarding women, peace, and security and the \nobjectives of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, UNSCR \n1325.\n  UNSCR 1325 calls on all countries to establish national action plans \naimed at promoting the inclusion of women in conflict resolution \nefforts and peace-building institutions, such as police services.\n  This is essential because women and girls are disproportionately \nimpacted by violence and armed conflict. But at the same time, we know \nthat women are critical to helping prevent violence before it occurs \nand resolving crises once they begin. Furthermore, evidence shows that \nintegrating women into peace-building processes helps promote democracy \nand ensure the likelihood of a peace process succeeding.\n  With the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, the U.S. \njoins the more than 37 other countries who have released similar \nNational Action Plans recognizing women's contributions to peace \nbuilding and committing to support women's inclusion in all aspects of \npeace processes.\n  As Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nInternational Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy, \nand Global Women's Issues, I am proud of the Obama Administration for \nundertaking this important initiative, and remain committed to \ncontinuing to promote the full inclusion of women in all aspects of \npeace-building efforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/01/senate-section/article/S5882-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5882-S5883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 535--RECOGNIZING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE MOVEMENT \n                             IS LIFE CAUCUS\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise in support of a bipartisan \nresolution to designate National Chess Day as October 13, 2012. I \ngreatly appreciate the support of my colleagues, Senator Lamar \nAlexander of Tennessee and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.\n  National Chess Day is designed to enhance awareness and encourage \nstudents and adults to engage in a game known to enhance critical \nthinking and problem-solving skills.\n  There are over 80,000 members of the Chess Federation with many of \nthese members joining before the age of 10. Studies indicate that chess \nprograms aid in improving students' scores in math and reading and \ninterest students of all learning styles and strengths. Engaging \nstudents in such activities can make learning fun and help them develop \na lifelong pastime to exercise their skills.\n  Engaging students in chess is a wonderful opportunity to promote \neducation, and I hope as school begins in a few weeks, more students \nwill join the Chess Federation and learn to love this historical game.\n\n                              S.
