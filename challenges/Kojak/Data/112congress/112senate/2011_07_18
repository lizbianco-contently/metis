Mr. President, Senate Democrats sat down with Secretary Tim \nGeithner, and he painted a picture of what our world would look like if \nRepublicans in Congress force this Nation, for the first time in its \nhistory, to default on its financial obligations.\n  The picture was grim. This is how he described the state of our \ngovernment if Congress allows this unprecedented default: ``Lights \nout.''\n  He said default would result in a complete ``loss of capacity to \nfunction as a government.''\n  Even those who believe government should be small enough to drown in \na bathtub have to admit that a total shutdown of even the most basic \nand essential functions of government is very, very scary. It would not \nbe good for the American people, and it certainly would not be good for \nour economy.\n  The Senate has no more important task than making sure the United \nStates continues to pay its bills for preexisting obligations such as \nSocial Security.\n  I have spoken to the President's office today. Actually, I had a \nphone call scheduled with him, and he rescheduled it for later. But I \nhave talked to his people, and he understands the importance of our \nmeeting our responsibilities. Because of that, we are going to stay in \nsession every day, including Saturdays and Sundays, until Congress \npasses legislation that prevents the United States from defaulting on \nour obligations.\n  I have spoken to the Republican leader. He understands the necessity \nof our being in session. We have a lot to do, not as many things as \nnormal but extremely important things that are going to take time. So I \nknow it is maybe inconvenient to have people rearrange their schedules, \nbut this means\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nSaturdays and Sundays and Mondays we have to be in session \ncontinuously.\n  Secretary Geithner described how the 80 million checks cut by the \nTreasury every day--that is 80 million checks every day--would likely \nsimply stop coming. The Federal Government would, in effect, go dark.\n  Paychecks for troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and bases around the \nworld could stop. FAA towers could shut down. So could the FBI and the \nCIA. Border crossings could close. Safety inspections of the food \nAmericans eat and the cargo that enters our ports could halt. Literally \nevery function of government could cease--Social Security checks, \npayments to our veterans. We have heard that before. There would be no \ndiscussion of which operations and personnel are essential. All the \npayments would very likely stop.\n  Some have said we could prioritize which bills to pay. Even if that \nwould not irreparably damage the Nation's credit and our reputation in \nthe global economy and the global community--which it would--it is also \na complete fiction. Our government will not even be able to cover the \nbills due on August 3. It will simply run out of money. Because we will \nbe in default and our credit rating trashed, we will be able to borrow \nthe money not again to keep running even if we wanted to.\n  That is the picture Secretary Geithner painted. Like I said, it is \ngrim.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues understand this fact. They know what \nis at stake. It is not blanket for sure, but the irresponsible \nRepublicans who say default would not be an unmitigated disaster for \nthis country either do not know what they are talking about or are \ntwisting the truth for political gain.\n  Americans have gotten the message. Seventy-one percent of the \nAmerican people disapprove of the way Republicans have used this crisis \nto force an ideological agenda. That is in the press today. Even a \nmajority of Republicans disapprove of their unreasonable refusal to \ncompromise, which puts our entire Nation at risk.\n  Those who say this crisis would be a blip on the radar are wrong. \nDefault would be a plague that could haunt and would haunt our Nation \nfor years to come. Our credit rating would take years to rebuild. The \ncountry would never, ever be the same.\n\n  Some will say this is an exaggeration, but it is not. This is what \nTreasury Secretary Geithner told us. That is what business leaders, \neconomists, rating agencies, and bankers have all told us. If this \ncountry defaults on its obligations, they say--Secretary Geithner for \ncertain says--it will be ``much worse than the Great Depression.'' It \nwould make the massive financial crisis of 2008 look mild. ``It will \nmake what we just went through look like a quaint little crisis,'' \nSecretary Geithner said. I repeat: ``It will make what we just went \nthrough look like a quaint little crisis.''\n  That ``quaint little crisis'' led to the loss of almost 5 million \nAmerican jobs. It caused our banking system to nearly collapse. More \nthan $34 trillion--Mr. President, that is not million, it is not \nbillion, it is trillion--more than $34 trillion in wealth was destroyed \nin less than 2 years. The ripples were felt throughout this Nation and \naround the world.\n  The average American family lost $100,000 on its home and stock \nportfolio alone, and 400,000 families were plunged into poverty.\n  That crisis was minor, again, Geithner said, compared to the \npotential fallout from a U.S. default. No one should guess from what I \nhave said that Secretary Geithner thinks what has taken place because \nof the Wall Street collapse is minor. But it is minor compared to what \nhe believes would happen if we defaulted on our debt.\n  The leading business and economic voices of our time have said it \nagain and again: The risks of default are unthinkable. It would be a \ncatastrophe.\n  Secretary Geithner also said we are running out of time to avoid this \niceberg. This huge iceberg is in the ocean, and our ship of state is \nheaded toward it. The rating agencies have already placed our AAA \ncredit rating under review and could downgrade us at any time.\n  This is what Secretary Geithner said. Again, I quote:\n\n       The eyes of the country are on us. The eyes of the world \n     are on us, and we need to make sure we stand together and \n     send a definitive signal that we're going to take the steps \n     necessary to avoid default.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask what it will take to get my Republican \ncolleagues to wake up to the fact that they are playing a game of \npolitical chicken with the entire global economy. They must wake up \nsoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4624-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me echo the initial remarks of the \nmajority leader with regard to the decision, which in this particular \ninstance I think we would agree is a mutual decision, that we need to \nstay in every day until we resolve this crisis confronting our country. \nSo I concur with what the majority leader has said. We will stay in \nevery day, Monday through Sunday, and get this problem fixed for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could interrupt my friend and through \nthe Chair say this: I would hope the Republican leader noted the tone \nand content of my statement where I did not lump all Republicans in one \nbig bundle.\n  Pardon the interruption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend, the majority leader.\n  This is a pivotal week for America. Two years of reckless spending \nand debt have brought us to the point of crisis, and this week \nAmericans will see how their elected representatives decide to resolve \nit.\n  On the one side are those who believe that failing to rein in \nspending now would be calamitous, and that a government which borrows \n42 cents for every dollar it spends needs to sober up. Washington needs \nstrong medicine to heal its spending addiction now, not a false promise \nto do it later.\n  On the other side are those who want to pretend the status quo is \nacceptable, that everything will be fine if we freeze current spending \nhabits in place, raise job-killing taxes on small businesses, and do \nnothing about the long-term fiscal imbalance that imperils our economy.\n  Republicans have tried to persuade the President of the need for a \ncourse correction, but weeks of negotiations have shown that his \ncommitment to big government is simply too great to lead to the kind of \nlong-term reforms we need to put us on a path to balance and economic \ngrowth.\n  So we have decided to bring our case to the American people. That is \nwhy this week Republicans in the House and in the Senate will push for \nlegislation that would cut government spending now, cap it in the \nfuture, and which only raises the debt limit if it is accompanied by a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.\n  The cut, cap, and balance plan is the kind of strong medicine \nWashington needs and the American people want, and Republicans in both \nHouses of Congress will be pushing it aggressively this week.\n  I heard one of my Democratic colleagues say yesterday that the votes \nsimply do not exist to pass any bill in the Senate that balances the \nbudget. My question is, Why in the world not? If you cannot vote for a \nbill that says you will live within your means, then you have given up \nand you agree that the unsustainable path is the only one we have, and \nthat is really completely unacceptable.\n  Every single Republican in the Senate supports a balanced budget \namendment. All we need is for 20 Democrats to join us. By my count, at \nleast 23 of them have led their constituents to believe they would \nactually fight for it.\n  So my message to Senate Democrats this week is this: I would suggest \nyou think long and hard about whether you will vote for the cut, cap, \nand balance legislation the House is taking up tomorrow. Not only is \nthis legislation just the kind of thing Washington needs right now, it \nmay be the only option we have if you want to see the debt limit raised \nat all.\n  The White House has called for a balanced approach in this debate. \nWell, a bill that actually balances our books is coming to the Senate \nfloor this very\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\nweek. I strongly urge my Democratic friends to join us in supporting \nit. Some have said they think this bill goes too far. With all due \nrespect, I think most Americans believe Congress and the White House \nhave gone too far in creating the fiscal mess we are in right now.\n  It is time for real action. It is time to show the American people \nwhere we stand. It is time to balance our books.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4625-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier today, the President announced \nhis nominee to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  I remind him that Senate Republicans still are not interested in \napproving anyone to the position until the President agrees to make \nthis massive new government bureaucracy more accountable and \ntransparent to the American people.\n  Back on May 5 of this year, 44 Republican Senators signed a letter to \nthe President stating:\n\n       We will not support the consideration of any nominee, \n     regardless of party affiliation, to be the CFPB director \n     until the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau is reformed.\n\n  We have been very clear about what these reforms would need to look \nlike. Republicans have voiced our serious concerns over the creation of \nthe CFPB because it represents a government-driven solution to a \nproblem government helped create.\n  We have no doubt that without proper oversight the CFPB will only \nmultiply the kinds of countless burdensome regulations that are holding \nour economy back right now and that it will have countless unintended \nconsequences for individuals and small businesses that constrict \ncredit, stymie growth, and destroy jobs. That is why everyone from \nflorists to community bankers opposed its creation in the first place. \nThat is why we will insist on serious reforms to bring accountability \nand transparency to the agency before we consider any nominee to run \nit.\n  It took the President a year to nominate someone to this position. I \nhope he will not wait that long to address our concerns and bring the \nCFPB the accountability and transparency it currently lacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4625-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget and the \ndebt ceiling, following the Senate's failure to invoke cloture on a \nmeasure expressing that shared sacrifices from all Americans--including \nthe wealthiest--are necessary to reduce the budget deficit.\n  As the Senate Budget Committee chair has proposed, we must reach an \nagreement that strikes a balance between raising revenues and cutting \nspending, in which all Americans contribute to the solution.\n  Congress faces an important task. Americans are following this debate \nbecause they have a stake in its outcome.\n  If we do not raise the debt ceiling, it will force the government to \nchoose which of its many obligations it will meet.\n  As President Obama pointed out last week, we cannot guarantee that \nveterans and Social Security recipients will receive the checks we owe \nthem on August 3 if we fail to reach a compromise. If we fail, we will \ndamage our credit rating and worldwide confidence in our financial \nsystem.\n  To avoid such a situation, I call on all of my colleagues to \nnegotiate in good faith so that the creditworthiness of the United \nStates is not compromised. I hope we can reach an agreement that will \nbring down the debt without placing most of the burden on the \nvulnerable among us--the sick, the poor, the long-term unemployed, and \nthe elderly.\n  While we must reduce spending, we cannot forget to continue investing \nin our Nation's future. I came of age during the Great Depression and \nserved in World War II, along with my colleagues Senator Inouye and \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  We were the beneficiaries of one of the Federal Government's greatest \ninvestments: the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, more commonly \nknown as the G.I. Bill of Rights. This visionary Federal legislation \nenabled returning World War II veterans--many who, like myself, came \nfrom families of modest means and may never have otherwise attended \ncollege.\n  The G.I. Bill not only changed the lives of its beneficiaries, it \nchanged the United States by laying the groundwork for the emergence of \nour middle class, which remains the backbone of our country.\n  Many other valuable investments made in the years that followed, such \nas the Interstate Highway System and Federal funding for research \nprograms at the Nation's leading universities, propelled America into \none of history's greatest periods of economic expansion, social \nadvancement, and technological innovation.\n  None of these investments simply happened. They were made by past \nCongresses and Presidents from both parties. These legacies have proven \nrepeatedly that dedicated social and economic investments are effective \ndrivers of recovery, growth, and future success. As we move forward and \nmake difficult but necessary choices to cut spending, we must \nstrengthen those programs that are restoring our economic health.\n  Reaching an agreement on the debt ceiling and deficit reduction will \nundoubtedly require all of us to make difficult compromises on spending \nand revenues. As debate on these issues continues, I urge each of my \ncolleagues to remember the obligation that we have to preserve the \nNation's creditworthiness--and to defend our veterans and those \ndepending on Social Security and other safety net programs from harm--\nas we continue to make needed investments for recovery.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a moment here about the \nstatus of discussions that Members of Congress have been having with \nthe President and others regarding the debt ceiling, the extending of \nthe debt ceiling, and how we can solve the problem that confronts our \ncountry.\n  Obviously, in 10 minutes, I will be brief and hit some of the \nhighlights. But the first question I was asked on a program I was \ninvolved in was: Well, why wouldn't Republicans be supportive of \nraising taxes? So I want to answer that. There are three answers to \nthat question. The first is, if you go to the doctor and he is going to \ntreat you for what is wrong with you, he needs to figure out what is \nwrong and then treat that condition rather than something totally \ndifferent. So the reason we are not going to want to raise taxes here \nis because it has nothing to do with the problem we have.\n  I meant to have this chart blown up, but I wasn't able to do it in \ntime, but this shows how much money we are\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nspending. As you can see, when President Obama came into office, the \nspending spiked dramatically. We have historically spent about 20 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the country. With the Obama \nspending, we have gone straight up to about 25 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. The problem, in other words, is not taxing; the \nproblem is spending. So that is the first reason we should focus on \nspending, and reducing Federal spending, not focus on the Tax Code, \nwhich is not the problem.\n  The second problem with raising taxes as a part of this exercise is \nthe taxes the President is talking about are not just on millionaires \nand billionaires. There are 319,000 households that report income of \nover $1 million, so you can say 319,000 billionaires or millionaires. \nBut there are 3.6 million households also in the same tax bracket that \ndon't report incomes of even $1 million. So as we have done before, \nwith the alternative minimum tax, for example, we aim at the \nmillionaires and billionaires but we end up hitting a lot of other \nAmericans. This isn't just about taxing millionaires and billionaires.\n  Who are the other people who would be the target of the tax increases \nproposed by the President? Well, we know that 50 percent of all small \nbusiness income is reported in those top two brackets. So the first \nthing you have to think about here is doing harm to the economy. If you \nare hitting the small businesses with more taxes--which, by the way, \nhistorically create two-thirds of the jobs coming out of a recession--\nyou are going to inhibit economic growth. That is a problem that is \nrecognized even by the Obama administration and by the President. Last \nDecember, the President reached agreement with the Congress and we \nextended the existing tax rates--sometimes they are called the Bush tax \ncuts, but those tax rates have been in existence for a decade now--and \nthey were extended another 2 years.\n  At the time the President said: In the time of economic downturn, \nthat is the worst time to raise taxes so we shouldn't do it.\n  We are still in an economic downturn, one could say even worse than \nit was back then. We are now back up to 9.2 percent unemployment. The \neconomy is not getting better; it is still sick, and the worst medicine \nfor a sick economy, as even the President has said, is a tax increase.\n  One of the taxes the administration sought to increase was the \nsubject of a report by the Obama administration's small business \nagency, the SBA, and it said this particular tax increase ``could \nultimately force many small businesses to close.''\n  Why would you propose raising a tax which could ultimately force many \nsmall businesses to close? It doesn't make sense. That is the second \nreason we are focused on wasteful Washington spending, not on raising \ntaxes.\n  The third reason to talk about the problem of raising taxes is \nrelated to the second; that is, the effect it would have on job \ncreation and the economy. If you add the tax rate that will result from \nthe automatic tax increases in January of 2013 and the tax increases \nthat are part of ObamaCare, the top rate in this country will be 44.8 \npercent, and that is before your State income tax rates.\n  Corporations pay 35 percent, and they get a lot of deductions, so \nthey don't always pay 35 percent. So here you have a small business \nperson who is paying 10 percentage points above what a big corporation \npays, and the 35 percent is too high. The President himself has said: \nWe should get rid of corporate so-called tax expenditures or loopholes \nso we can, with that savings, reduce the corporate rate in America to \nsomething closer to 20 or 25 percent, which would make American \nbusinesses more competitive with our foreign competitors.\n  If we need to reduce the corporate rate down to 20 or 25 percent, it \nmakes absolutely no sense for us to have the small business \nentrepreneurs in our country paying almost 45 percent. That is why we \ndon't want to raise taxes on small businesses.\n  Moreover, some of these taxes are not just on those who are in the \ntop two income tax brackets but are in businesses that I mentioned, the \nretailers and manufacturers, that would be hit with one of the taxes \nthe SBA says could ultimately force many small businesses to close.\n  So those are the three key reasons why it is not the time to raise \ntaxes, why we ought to be focused on spending. Spending is the problem. \nIt has gone up from 20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic product in \nthis country. We have had a deficit now of $1.5 trillion each of the \nyears of the Obama administration.\n  The Obama administration, in just 5 years--if it gets the first year \nof the second term--in 5 years would double all the national debt of \nthis country all the way from George Washington to George W. Bush.\n  So if you take all Presidents and the debt we have acquired and then \nyou double it, that is what happens under 5 years of the Obama \nadministration budget and then the second 5 years would triple it. That \nis the problem we have. It is not taxes; it is spending. Secondly, \nbecause you are not just hitting millionaires and billionaires, and, \nthird, because it would be very bad for the economy.\n  The administration has said: Well, it is just not fair. We need some \n``shared sacrifice'' is their term, some shared sacrifice. I have two \nanswers to that.\n  First of all, how about before we ask people to sacrifice, let's get \nrid of the waste, fraud, and abuse, and initiate savings that the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office, the \nCBO, all these groups have found exists in our budget, if we would just \nget about it.\n  There is over $100 billion a year we could save by not making \noverpayments or improper payments in Medicare, Medicaid, and \nunemployment insurance, just those three alone. In unemployment \ninsurance, $1 out of every $9 is improperly paid. What is wrong with a \ngovernment that has that kind of error rate? That is $16.5 billion a \nyear. In Medicare, the error rate is over 10.5 percent and Medicaid 8.4 \npercent. You could save $87 billion a year just in those two programs. \nThat is well over $100 billion a year.\n  What does the administration say to that? No, we don't want to talk \nabout that.\n  That is not shared sacrifice. That is not any sacrifice. You are not \ntaking any benefit away from any beneficiary by just enforcing the law \nCongress has passed. The administration says, no, it doesn't want to \ntalk about those things.\n  The other reason is, I am just asking here: What is fair? You have to \nadmit, the top 1 percent of American taxpayers are wealthy people and \nso they pay twice as much in taxes. They represent 1 percent of the \ntaxpayers, of course. So do they pay 2 percent of the taxes? How about \n5 percent? Does the top 1 percent pay 10 percent of all the taxes, 20 \npercent, 30 percent? How about 38 percent? One percent of the people \npay 38 percent of the taxes in the country. I would call that shared \nsacrifice. The top 10 percent pay almost 70 percent. So how much do you \nwant the top 10 percent to pay, 80 percent, 90 percent?\n  How fair is that, when the bottom 50 percent pay nothing and all of \nthem receive benefits from the government and 30 percent of them \nreceive an EITC benefit or payments back from the government in some \nother form, directly to them. So you have half the people who pay no \nFederal income taxes, the top 10 percent pay 70 percent of all the \nincome tax.\n  We have said that is OK; we want to have a progressive tax rate. The \nOECD--these are the developed countries of the world--have done a \nstudy, and they make the point we have the most progressive income tax \nsystem in the world. Of all the developed countries in the world, we \nmake the wealthy pay the most. We have said that is OK.\n  But how much more can this one group pay? They cannot carry the \nentire government on their back. So it is, frankly, political \ndemagoguery for anybody to suggest that either we can solve the problem \nby taxing corporate jets or we can solve the problem by having \nmillionaires and billionaires pay more than they already do. That only \ngets you a little bit.\n  The people who end up paying the taxes are the broad middle class. \nThat is the way it always is.\n  So beware of the politician who says: I am just going to target the \nrich; you don't have to worry about it. The tax on millionaires was \nsupposed to hit\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nabout 125 millionaires, the AMT, that now hits somewhere between 20 \nmillion and 30 million Americans.\n  That is why I say we have to solve the problem. The problem is \nspending. It is not revenues. So when people ask me: Well, why aren't \nyou willing to meet the President halfway and agree to raise taxes, \nthose are the three reasons. It would stop our economy from creating \nthe jobs it needs in order to get out of the economic doldrums we are \nin and begin to produce the kind of economic recovery that produces \nwealth. When you are unemployed, you are not working, you are not \nmaking money, you are not paying taxes to the Federal Government.\n  We can pay the Federal Government a lot more in tax revenues every \nyear if we go back to work and if we are making more money and we are \nmore productive as a country. But as long as we are in the condition we \nare right now, the Federal revenues are going to decline.\n  That is the answer. Get the economy moving again, and you don't do \nthat by imposing another heavy burden of taxes on it. That is why we \nhave to focus on spending. I hope my colleagues and I can work together \nin the days to come and reach agreement so we can actually get the \ncountry moving on a path toward economic recovery and sound fiscal \nfuture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4627-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4627-S4629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EAST ASIA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, we spend probably the majority of the time \nwhen we discuss foreign policy on this floor talking about the crises \nin places such as Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan. If we talk about East Asia \nat all, we generally are discussing the economic situation as it \nportends to the future, especially with China.\n  But I would like to make a strong point here today; that is, if we \ndon't get it right with our relations in East Asia, we are in very \nserious trouble as a nation. It is vitally important for the United \nStates to continue to invigorate our relations with all the countries \nwith East and Southeast Asia on economic, security, and cultural \nlevels.\n  Today, I would like to talk about a few of these issues that are \naffecting our relations in that part of the world. This weekend, there \nwill be a regional forum for the Asian countries in Bali. Our Secretary \nof State will be there.\n  This forum is coming at a pivotal moment with respect to our \nrelations in Southeast Asia and the rest of East Asia. The recent \nmilitary provocations by China against the Philippines and Vietnam in \nthe South China Sea, which this body passed a resolution deploring, \naffect the mood of the entire region at this moment. There also have \nbeen political transitions in Thailand and in Burma and there are \nconsistent ecological threats in the Mekong River, with hydropower dams \nup river beginning in China and now also being proposed in Laos.\n  All of these issues underscore the need for vigorous multilateral \nengagement in this part of the world and the development of new \nstrategic relationships and the continuity of balance the United States \nhas been bringing to this vital region since the end of World War II.\n  We are going to be reauthorizing a piece of legislation called the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act in this session of Congress. I have \nan amendment to this act. I think it is an extremely important \namendment in terms of our relationship with friends and allies, \nparticularly in East Asia, and with representatives of highly developed \ngovernmental systems that have a lot of problems with the way we have \nimplemented this act in the past.\n  I, similar to everyone in the Senate, fully support the intentions of \nthis legislation and the intentions of the State Department to prevent \nhuman trafficking and to assist trafficking victims. But under our \npresent policy, we have a great deal of confusion and, quite frankly, \nresentment from many of these more developed governmental systems. This \npresent policy requires that a country be ranked against the progress \nit has made in the past year. In other words, a country is ranked \nagainst itself over a period of yearly behavior. This practice doesn't \nprovide countries with a consistent standard by which they might truly \nmeasure their efforts against human trafficking versus other countries \naround the world, and it creates a lot of misunderstandings.\n  The criteria used to judge a country's efforts are difficult to \nestimate with any precision. They are often very subjective. For \nexample by placing prosecutions for trafficking as a part of this \nevaluation over actual successes in areas such as the protection of \nvictims and the prevention of acts in the first place, we get a total \nmisreading of the success that many of these governmental systems \nactually have been able to bring about.\n  This is an excerpt from a press release that came out of Singapore's \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs on June 28 of this year, talking about \ntheir ranking under this Trafficking in Persons Report, the TIP Report.\n  They say: We note that the United States has again unabashedly \nawarded itself a tier 1 ranking. Yet the New York Times observed--this \nis from their press statement--that teenage girls coerced into \nprostitution in the United States are treated not as trafficking \nvictims but as miscreants who are arrested and prosecuted. This is \ndirectly opposite to Singapore's approach. The United States also \nsuffers from serious problems with illegal immigrants, many of whom are \ntrafficked by well-organized criminal gangs which seem to operate with \nimpunity.\n  Singapore, our friend, our ally, and an advanced governmental system \nby any determination, then says:\n\n       On any objective criteria, the United States has a more \n     serious TIP problem compared with Singapore.\n\n  Why are they angry? Why do they feel they have not been fairly \nevaluated? Because they are evaluated against themselves by standards \nthat may not apply. They are not alone, by the way. Singapore is not \nalone.\n  The last year's reporting showed Nigeria got a tier 1 rating. Japan, \nanother highly advanced governmental system and culture, got a tier 2 \nrating. Singapore got a tier 2 watch list rating, which means that they \ncould be in danger of losing a lot of the governmental interactions \nbetween our two countries if this continued. How would they rate a tier \n2 if we had a standard where we were evaluating all country systems \nagainst one another, rather than this approach we are now using?\n\n  Here is a good objective way to see if we cannot answer that \nquestion. These are the worldwide ratings from an organization called \nTransparency International. This is called the Corruption Perception \nIndex, from the same year. From the country rankings for corruption \nperception, internationally, Singapore is tied for first as the most \ntransparent governmental system. The United States is down here at No. \n22--again, below Japan. I mention Japan because under this TIP system, \nJapan got a tier 2 rating. Nigeria is over here tied for 134th. This is \nnot meant to be critical of the attempts of the Nigerian governmental \nsystem to fix their problems, but clearly, if we were evaluating these \ncountries among each other rather than by this very confusing standard, \nyou would not be seeing Singapore with a tier 2 watch list category and \nNigeria as a tier 1.\n  I will have a simple but I think very important amendment to the \nlegislation when it comes forward. It basically will require the State \nDepartment to categorize countries, first of all, as either in \ncompliance or not with our legislation and then rank countries on a \nsingle scale rather than by year-to-year progress against themselves \nand to eliminate the special watch list category. It maintains all the \nother existing criteria we have used in terms of examining whether \ntrafficking in persons is being addressed in these different countries; \nthe extent to which a country is a country of origin, transit, or \ndestination; the extent of noncompliance by the governments, including \ngovernment officials; and what measures are reasonable to bring the \ngovernment into compliance. This may seem a small matter on the floor \nof the Senate, but I can assure you this is not a small matter to \ncountries that have been our friends and allies and have advanced \ngovernmental systems and believe they are being wrongly categorized for \nthe rest of the world to see.\n  I would like to raise one other point today with respect to this part \nof the world--it goes back to what I said when I first began speaking--\nregarding\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\nissues of sovereignty and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea \nand recent activities which could quickly reach a level of volatility \nthat we would not like to see and to emphasize again that our country \nis the No. 1 reason we have had the kind of stability that has existed \nfor the most part in this very volatile region since the end of World \nWar II.\n  The red lines on this map are the areas in which China claims \nsovereignty in the South China Sea. As you can see from these lines, it \ngoes all the way past the coast of the Philippines, down into Borneo \nand Malaysia, up the coast of Vietnam, back into China.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have seen incidents that people in the \nUnited States, including military officials, too often seem to \nrecognize or deal with as tactical challenges rather than strategic \ndata points in terms of the ongoing issues of who actually controls \nthese areas.\n  These areas are claimed by many different countries. They are the \nmost highly trafficked sealanes, in terms of trade, in the world. Just \nin the last 1\\1/2\\ years, we have seen an incident off the coast of \nOkinawa, with a dispute between the Japanese and the Chinese \nGovernments. We have seen a military incident, a provocation by the \nChinese off the coast of the Philippines, which was protested by the \nPhilippines. We have seen two incidents off the coast of Vietnam, one \nin May and one in June. If you look at where these incidents have \noccurred, they mark the boundaries of the sovereignty claims that have \nbeen made by the Chinese.\n  This body unanimously passed a resolution condemning this use of \nmilitary actions in disputes that should be resolved in a multilateral \nway. I am very hopeful that Secretary Clinton will reinforce our \nconcerns in this area.\n  When I was on ``Meet The Press'' a couple of weeks ago, I said we \ncould be approaching a Munich moment in this region. That comment has \nbeen widely circulated. Let me explain what I mean by that. That \ndoesn't mean I see a Hitler out there; that doesn't mean I see a \nNeville Chamberlain here. What this means is when you have an \nexpansionist power that is making claims that it owns land in disputed \nareas and is provoking these other countries through the use of \nmilitary force, you are reaching the edge of a country unilaterally \nclaiming sovereignty over areas that require multilateral solutions. \nThat is not healthy. It is not healthy internationally.\n  This region historically has been a very volatile region, and the \nUnited States is the most important ingredient in making sure these \nissues are resolved multilaterally and without the use of force. Again, \nI strongly hope our Secretary of State will reinforce the comments she \nmade last year to the effect that the United States does have a vital \ninterest in resolving these issues in a multilateral way, just as we \ndo, by the way, in resolving the issues with respect to the Mekong \nRiver. Rather than having a strong, powerful country insisting only on \nbilateral adjustments with countries that it totally overpowers. We are \nthe essential ingredient. No one wants to see this issue go the wrong \nway.\n  We have the potential of resolving this with China and resolving our \nrelationships with the Chinese Government in a positive way, looking \ninto the future, but it is going to require clear, consistent comments \nand a credible approach by the U.S. Government.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Executive Nomination Referral\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I was very pleased that \nthe Senate recently acted to confirm the nomination of David Cohen to \nbe Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. \nI would like to pose a brief parliamentary inquiry as a followup to the \nSenate's action. For future nominees by the President to the position \nof Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, would \nall such nominees be referred, under current law and precedents of the \nSenate, to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is my understanding the Senator is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Wall Street Reform\n\n  Mr. President, Thursday marks the first anniversary of President \nObama signing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct into law. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I have a \nresponsibility to oversee implementation of this critical new law.\n  The Wall Street Reform Act was a direct response to the worst \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. While it appears that many \non Wall Street, and even some here in Washington, have already \nforgotten the painful costs of inadequate financial regulations, I have \nnot. And neither have the millions of Americans who lost their jobs, \ntheir homes, or their savings, and who are still waiting for the \nrecovery.\n  The financial crisis didn't just happen by itself. It was the result \nof reckless and irresponsible behavior on Wall Street, lack of consumer \nprotections, and failure by financial regulators to take action even as \nthe warning signs grew ever larger.\n  In response to the devastation, Congress passed new financial reforms \nthat created a sound regulatory foundation to protect consumers and \nhelp prevent future crises.\n  However, these reforms have been under constant attack since their \ninception. Opponents of Wall Street reform continually repeat \nmisleading claims that the new law was hastily conceived and will harm \nour economy.\n  The truth is the Wall Street reform law is a product of nearly 50 \nSenate hearings, and scores more in the House, that identified the \nabuses and loopholes that fueled the catastrophe and helped develop \nclear proposals to end them.\n  After a long series of hearings that began in 2007 and 2008 with \nexamination of the turmoil in the mortgage and credit markets, and \nafter months of hard work by bipartisan working groups of Senators, the \nBanking Committee reported out a Wall Street reform bill that \nincorporated many Republican ideas.\n  On the Senate floor, the bill had a thorough debate in an open \nprocess that lasted more than 3 weeks. Fifty-six amendments were \nconsidered and 32 amendments were approved, 15 of which were \nRepublican-sponsored amendments and 22 were bipartisan amendments. \nFinally, the bill was reconciled with the House version at an open \nconference committee which worked through more than 100 additional \namendments.\n  In short, through a rigorous, bipartisan, and transparent process, we \nproduced a comprehensive reform bill that the times demanded and the \nAmerican people deserved.\n  The Wall Street reform law enhances consumer protections to help \nensure people can make financial decisions with honest information, and \nit roots out predatory lenders who fueled the subprime mortgage bubble. \nThe reforms we passed 1 year ago will no longer allow the shadow \nbanking system that nearly destroyed our economy to continue to escape \nthe light of day.\n  The Wall Street reform law also enhances investor protections.\n  During the financial crisis, investors suffered enormous losses when \ntheir retirement accounts or other assets were decimated. Some had \ninvested in companies with compensation systems that encouraged \nexecutives to take on unmanageable risks. Some relied on mutual funds \nor pension funds that had bought mortgage-backed securities based on \npredatory loans that borrowers could not repay. New reforms will \nenhance transparency, increase accountability and allow oversight of \npreviously hidden parts of the financial system.\n  Unfortunately, some powerful Wall Street apologists are trying to \nrewrite history. They are claiming that new regulations are overly \nburdensome and\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nwill hurt their bottom line and the economy. Gaps in regulation hurt \nthe economy. Bad, reckless decisions on Wall Street hurt the economy. \nBut many top financial executives have apparently forgotten that the \nonly reason they are still in business is that the American taxpayer \nsaved them.\n  Now, many of these financial institutions have nearly fully \nrecovered, while Main Street Americans continue to pay the price for \nthose bad decisions and inadequate regulations.\n  The Wall Street Reform Act established responsible rules to make our \nfinancial system work for the benefit of all Americans, so that we \nnever return to the days of too big to fail bailouts, backroom \nderivatives deals, predatory subprime mortgages, and the threat of \neconomic collapse. Passing the Wall Street Reform Act was a monumental \nachievement, but there is much work left to be done. Now the financial \nregulators, the experts who have made it their life's work to \nunderstand these issues, must work to write rules and implement these \nreforms. This will take time, and we must get it right.\n  If the attacks on the law and its implementation are successful in \nweakening or eliminating these new protections, however, our economy \nwill once again be at risk. Since I became chairman earlier this year, \nthe Banking Committee has held more than 25 hearings and bipartisan \nbriefings on financial reform. We are exercising our oversight \nauthority, following the regulators' progress closely, and are \ncommitted to seeing the process of reforming Wall Street through to \ncompletion.\n  We all remember the economic nightmare we lived though 3 years ago, \nand we should never forget it. That is why I take my responsibility as \nchairman of the Banking Committee and custodian of this new law so \nseriously. I am fully committed to helping ensure Congress does its \npart to hold our regulators accountable and to providing Americans with \na financial system they can trust.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4629-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, what is the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Johnson amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 556, as Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 556 be modified with the modifications at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 114 between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       Sec. 301. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this \n     Act, the Executive Director of Arlington National Cemetery \n     shall provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives; the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee; the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee; \n     and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     Committee detailing the strategic plan and timetable to \n     modernize the Cemetery's Information Technology system, \n     including electronic burial records.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator McCaskill be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of J. Paul Oetken\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to rise in \nsupport of Paul Oetken's confirmation to the bench of the Southern \nDistrict of New York. We have a very deep pool of legal talent in New \nYork, but Paul's nomination is one everybody is talking about. Paul is \nbrilliant, well rounded, and unwavering in his dedication to public \nservice and his commitment to rule of law. His confirmation will only \nimprove the workings of one of the best and busiest courts in the \ncountry.\n  I look for three qualities in judicial candidates: excellence, \nmoderation, and diversity. Paul's Excellence is provable on paper. He \nis a graduate of the University of Iowa and Yale Law School and has \nworked in the highest echelons of two of the three branches of \ngovernment, including for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department \nof Justice and for Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. He has also \nclimbed the ranks of private legal practice, serving most recently as \nthe head of litigation for the large New York media company \nCablevision, one of our fine companies in New York.\n  I consider a broad range of experience to be an important training \nground for teaching judicial candidates the second quality I look for: \nmoderation. I do not like judges who tend to be too far to the right, \nbut I do not like judges who come from a perspective that is too far\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nleft either. Paul Oetken fits the bill of a mainstream, moderate judge. \nHis moderation and modesty were evident during his confirmation hearing \nand are clear to all who know him. When judges have in their resume \npractical experience dealing with real-world problems, they tend to \nunderstand that a judge cannot simply impose things from on high \nwithout understanding the effect of imposing those decrees on average \npeople, average businesses, and average governments.\n  When a candidate has these two qualities--excellence and moderation--\ndiversity is a bonus. But in this case, at this moment, Paul is not \njust an excellent candidate. As the first openly gay man to be \nconfirmed as a Federal judge and to serve on the Federal bench, he will \nbe a symbol of how much we have achieved as a country in the last few \ndecades. And importantly, he will give hope to many talented young \nlawyers who, until now, thought their paths might be limited because of \ntheir sexual orientation. When Paul becomes Judge Oetken, he will be \nliving proof to all those young lawyers that it does get better.\n  Paul Oetken's modest but brave act of going through the confirmation \nprocess makes this otherwise quiet moment historic. But long after \ntoday, what the history books will note about Paul is his achievement \nas a fair and brilliant judge.\n  In a short while, our country will take one step closer toward \nequality and away from bigotry and prejudice. I am very proud to have \nplayed a supporting role, and I look forward to Paul Oetken's service \non the bench in the Southern District of New York. Often quoted but \nstill one of my favorites is what Martin Luther King often said:\n\n       The arc of history is long, but it bends in the direction \n     of justice.\n\n  Paul Oetken's nomination to the Federal bench proves that point once \nagain.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe suspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4630-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4630-S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF J. PAUL OETKEN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will now report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of J. Paul Oetken, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate will vote on the nomination \nof J. Paul Oetken to the U.S. district judge for the Southern District \nof New York.\n  Today's vote marks the 28th judicial confirmation this year, and I am \npleased we are moving forward with filling another vacancy.\n  When I became ranking member of the Judiciary Committee earlier this \nyear, the courts had 103 vacancies. I have worked with the chairman and \nother members of the committee to reduce vacancies by confirming \nconsensus nominees. We have brought the vacancies down now to 89. Based \nupon media stories and other exaggerated statements that I hear from \ntime to time, you would think the Republicans are blocking every \njudicial nominee. The record shows something quite different. In total, \n60 percent of the President's judicial nominees have been confirmed; 33 \npercent of the nominees have been confirmed during this Congress.\n  We continue to achieve great progress in committee as well. Seventy-\nthree percent of the judicial nominees submitted this Congress have \nbeen afforded hearings. Only 57 percent of President Bush's nominees \nhad hearings for the comparable time period during his Presidency. We \nhave reported 58 percent of the judicial nominees, compared to only 54 \npercent of President Bush's nominees. In total, the committee has taken \npositive action on 62 of the 86 nominees submitted this Congress or 72 \npercent of those nominees submitted.\n  I could go on with other statistics which demonstrate our cooperation \nand positive action, but I think I have made my point. We are moving \nforward on the consensus nominees. Complaints to the contrary are not \nsupported by the facts.\n  I would like to say a few words about the nominee we are considering \ntoday, a nominee I will vote for.\n  Mr. Oetken grew up in my State of Iowa and attended the University of \nIowa, where he received his bachelor of arts degree with distinction in \n1988. Following graduation from Yale Law School in 1991, the nominee \nspent 3 years clerking. He first clerked for the Seventh Circuit, then \nthe DC Circuit, and finally for Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  After his clerkships Mr. Oetken entered private practice. In 1997, he \nbecame an attorney-adviser with the Department of Justice Office of \nLegal Counsel. In 1999, the nominee joined the White House Counsel's \nOffice as associate counsel to then-President Clinton. In 2001, he \nmoved to New York and returned to private practice. In 2004, the \nnominee joined the legal department of Cablevision Systems Corporation. \nCurrently, he is the senior vice president and associate general \ncounsel at Cablevision.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has given Mr. \nOetken a unanimous ``qualified'' rating. I support this nomination and \ncongratulate him on his professional accomplishments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the nomination of \nPaul Oetken of New York.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak for a moment on that. With \ntoday's vote on the nomination of Paul Oetken to fill a judicial \nvacancy on the Southern District of New York, the Senate is going to \nalso mark a new and important milestone. Mr. Oetken, of course, is a \nsuperbly qualified nominee. He is also the first openly gay man \nnominated to be a Federal district judge. I fully expect him to be \nconfirmed to a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. I am proud \nfirst of the President for taking this critical step to break down \nanother barrier, increase diversity in the Federal judiciary, but also \non the part of Paul Oetken, who stepped forward to serve. He was \nreported with the support of every member of the Judiciary Committee, \nDemocratic and Republican, and I commend my fellow Republicans and \nDemocrats for that vote. I think he is going to be confirmed by what I \nbelieve will be an overwhelming vote in the Senate. It is a sign as a \nnation we take a new and welcome step on the path of ensuring the \nFederal judiciary better reflects all Americans.\n  To reiterate, today, the Senate will finally vote on the nomination \nof Paul Oetken to fill a judicial vacancy on the Southern District of \nNew York. Mr. Oetken's nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee more than 3 months ago and could--and in my view \nshould--have been confirmed within days. Yet, like so many of President \nObama's qualified, consensus nominees, Mr. Oetken has been stuck \nwithout cause or explanation for months on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar. At a time when judicial vacancies are above 90 and have \nremained at that crisis level for 2 years, this kind of needless delay \nundermines the serious work we have to do to ensure the ability of our \nFederal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country.\n  With today's vote the Senate will mark a new and important milestone. \nMr. Oetken, a superbly qualified nominee, is the first openly gay man \nto be\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nnominated to be a Federal district judge. Today I expect he will be the \nfirst openly gay man to be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the \nFederal bench. All of us can be proud of President Obama for taking \nthis critical step to break down another barrier and increase diversity \nin the Federal judiciary. All of us in the Senate can also be proud \nthat Mr. Oetken was reported with the support of every Member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Democratic and Republican, and will be confirmed \nby what I believe will be an overwhelming vote in the Senate. It is a \nsign that, as a nation, we have taken a new and welcome step on the \npath of ensuring that our Federal judiciary better reflects all \nAmericans.\n  Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee was \npleased at Mr. Oetken's hearing in March that Mr. Oetken was a Phi Beta \nKappa graduate of the University of Iowa. As Senator Schumer said when \nintroducing Mr. Oetken to the committee, not every New York nominee has \nsuch a strong connection to Iowa. Born in Louisville, KY, Mr. Oetken \nearned his law degree from Yale Law School and then served as a law \nclerk at every level of the Federal judiciary, for Judge Louis F. \nOberdorfer of the District Court for the District of Columbia, for \nJudge Richard D. Cudahy of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nfor Justice Harry Blackmun on the Supreme Court. Mr. Oetken has worked \nin the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, as associate \ncounsel to President Clinton, as a litigator in private practice, and \nis now one of the top in-house counsels for Cablevision System \nCorporation.\n  Regrettably, Mr. Oetken's nomination is the only one the Republican \nleadership would consent to consider today. There is no reason the \nSenate is not also voting on the nomination of Paul Engelmayer, who was \nreported unanimously on April 7 along with Mr. Oetken to fill another \nvacancy--a judicial emergency--on the Southern District of New York. In \nfact, Mr. Oetken's nomination is only the fifth nomination we have \nconsidered in the last 2 months, at a time when vacancies have remained \nnear or above 90. I thank Senator Grassley for his cooperation in \nworking with me to make progress in committee considering judicial \nnominations in regular order. But that progress has not been matched in \nthe Senate, where agreements to debate and vote on judicial nominations \nare too few and too far between.\n  In addition to Mr. Oetken, there are now 22 judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the committee and ready to be debated and voted \non by the Senate, 17 of them having been pending on the Executive \nCalendar for a month or more. Before the Memorial Day recess I urged \nthat the Senate take up and vote on the many consensus judicial \nnominations then on the calendar, as it traditionally has done before a \nrecess. Republican Senators would not agree to consider a single one.\n  In June, I again urged the Senate to take steps to address the \njudicial needs of the American people by confirming the many qualified, \nconsensus judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee. However, Republicans would consent to vote on only four \njudicial nominations during that month. Three of them were confirmed \nunanimously. In fact, one of the nominees we considered was, finally, \nthe last of the judicial nominations that had been reported by the \ncommittee last year that, in my view, should have been considered then.\n  As a result, 17 judicial nominations reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee were left on the calendar throughout June and now \nhalfway into July, 14 of which were reported unanimously and could \neasily have been confirmed. Last week, the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported another five judicial nominations with significant \nbipartisan support, three of them unanimously. So in addition to Mr. \nOetken's nomination there are now 17 judicial nominations pending on \nthe Senate's Executive Calendar that, like his, were reported \nunanimously with the support of every Senator, Democratic or \nRepublican, on the Judiciary Committee.\n  All these nominees have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a \ndemonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. They are by any measure \nnoncontroversial and will, I expect, be confirmed unanimously when \nRepublicans consent to have votes on them. They should have an up-or-\ndown vote after being considered by the Judiciary Committee, and \nwithout additional weeks and months of needless delay.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Whereas the Democratic majority \nin the Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's \nfirst 2 years, judicial vacancies still number 91 2\\1/2\\ years into \nPresident Obama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have been cut \nin half, but we have barely kept up with attrition. If we join together \nto consider all of the judicial nominations now on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar, we would be able to reduce vacancies below 80 for \nthe first time since July 2009.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies as dramatically as \nwe did during the Bush administration. In fact, the Senate has reversed \ncourse during the Obama administration, with the slow pace of \nconfirmations keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 \nyears of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies staying near or above 90 since August 2009. The vacancy \nrate--which we reduced from 10 percent at the end of President \nClinton's term to 6 percent by this date in President Bush's third \nyear, and ultimately to less than 4 percent in 2008--is now back to \nmore than 10 percent.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations. \nWe confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the 17 months I \nwas chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, \nwell into President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only \nbeen allowed to consider 89 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees.\n  This is an area in which we must come together as Democrats and \nRepublicans for the American people. There is no reason Senators from \nboth parties cannot join together to finally bring down the excessive \nnumber of vacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout \nthe Nation for far too long, and which have led the Chief Justice, the \nPresident, the Attorney General and judges around the country to urge \nthe Senate to act.\n  The nomination that we confirm today is an important one for the \nSenate and for the American people. The only questions that should \nmatter for any judicial nominee are the questions I have asked about \nevery judicial nominee, whether nominated by a Democratic or a \nRepublican President--whether he or she will have judicial \nindependence. Does the nominee understand the role of a judge? Mr. \nOetken meets this standard, and I am proud to vote for his confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand this vote is scheduled for \n5:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask consent not to delay in any way the \nvote--we will still have the vote at 5:30--but that I be allowed to \ncontinue during the time remaining to me as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Extending Service of FBI Director Robert Mueller\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, back on May 12, the President requested \nthat Congress pass legislation to enable Robert Mueller to continue \nserving as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for up to 2 \nadditional years in light of the leadership transition at other key \nnational security agencies--the Secretary of Defense was leaving, there \nwas a change in the directorship of the CIA, and so forth--and, of \ncourse, the unique circumstances in\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nwhich we find ourselves as the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches in \nless than 2 months.\n  In response to the request of the President, a bipartisan group of \nSenators drafted and introduced S. 1103, a bill that would create a \none-time exception to the statute that limits the term of the FBI \nDirector to 10 years. This bill would allow the term of the incumbent \nFBI Director to continue for 2 additional years.\n  Given the continuing threats to our Nation and the need to provide \ncontinuity and stability in the President's national security team, it \nis important that this critical legislation be enacted without delay.\n  Director Mueller's term expires on August 2, 2011. Of the 12 weeks \nbetween the President's request and the expiration of Director \nMueller's term, 10 have passed. The time for responsible congressional \naction has all but elapsed. We are almost in the final hour.\n  Congressional leaders, including Republican leaders, reacted to the \nPresident's request saying that they supported it. On May 26, \nbipartisan legislation providing the one-time statutory exception, \nwhich was drafted by Senator Grassley, was introduced. It was \ncosponsored by me, Senator Grassley, and the chair and vice chair of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Chambliss.\n  The Judiciary Committee moved quickly to consider this legislation \nand report it to the full Senate. We proceeded at Senator Grassley's \nrequest to a prompt hearing on June 8. I listed the legislation on the \ncommittee's agenda for action on June 9. It was held over for another \nweek. Finally on June 16, the committee met, debated the matter, and \nreported the bill with an amendment to clarify its constitutionality. \nOn June 21, Senate Report 112-23 was filed regarding the bill. We have \nbeen trying to reach an agreement to consider the bill for more than a \nmonth, but Republican objections have stalled this effort.\n  On June 29, my statement to the Senate warned that we would have only \na few short weeks left this month to complete action and for the House \nto act. We should be acting responsibly and expeditiously. I have \nworked diligently in a bipartisan way with Senator Grassley in order to \nprevent a lapse in the term of the Director of the FBI. The bill enjoys \nthe strong support of law enforcement groups, including the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Police \nExecutive Research Forum, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational Native American Law Enforcement Association, and the FBI \nNational Academy Associates. They have all supported it.\n  We must act on this bill without further, unnecessary delays. The \nSenate must take it up, consider it and pass it, and then the House \nwill need to consider and pass the bill before the President has the \nopportunity to sign it. Each of these steps must be completed prior to \nthe expiration of the Director's current 10-year term on August 2, \n2011. There is no time to waste.\n  All Senate Democrats have been prepared to take up and pass this \nextension bill for weeks. There is no good reason for delay. At first \nit was reportedly Senator Coburn who was holding up consideration of \nthe bill, then Senator DeMint, and now apparently it is an objection by \nSenator Paul of Kentucky that is preventing the Senate from proceeding. \nI find it hard to understand why we would hold up a piece of \nlegislation like this. This sort of delay is inexplicable and \ninexcusable.\n  In order to accomplish our goal, I have even been willing to proceed \nalong the lines of an alternative approach demanded by Senator Coburn. \nThat approach is based on a constitutional problem that does not exist. \nThe bill reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee is an extension of \na term limit that Congress imposed on the service of the Director of \nthe FBI. As set forth in the committee report on the extension bill, \nand as reaffirmed in a June 20, 2011, memorandum opinion by the Office \nof Legal Counsel, the bill reported by a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to the Senate is constitutionally sound and \na proper response by Congress to the President's request. Nonetheless, \nI was prepared to proceed using Senator Coburn's language instead of \nSenator Grassley's and mine, so long as one further problem was \nremoved. Specifically, the major problem with Senator Coburn's approach \nis that it would necessitate the renomination of Director Mueller, and \nthen his reconsideration and reconfirmation by the Senate after \nenactment of Senator Coburn's alternative bill--and all before August \n2.\n  On June 29, I warned that this was an additional, unnecessary and \npossibly dangerous complication. I do not want Americans to approach \nthe 10th anniversary of 9/11 without an FBI Director in office. At the \nmarkup of this bill in our Judiciary Committee, I was assured by the \nSenator from Oklahoma that he would get unanimous consent to do all the \nshort time agreements to get the bill passed, get his amendment passed, \nget it through the House and back, and get Director Mueller confirmed \nwith a 2-hour time agreement. If we did all of that, it would not be \nthe best of solutions, but it would be better than what we have now.\n  Now we have the distractions from Director Mueller that have been \ncreated by these extended proceedings, which have been damaging enough. \nTo require his renomination and then allow it to be held hostage or \nused as leverage, as so many of President Obama's nominations have \nbeen, seemed to me a risk that was better avoided. I did not want the \nextension of Director Mueller's service leading the FBI to fall victim \nto the same objections that have obstructed Senate action on other \nimportant Presidential nominations and appointments. Unfortunately, as \nI had warned, that is precisely what has happened in this case.\n  I have spoken often about the unnecessary and inexcusable delays on \njudicial nominations. Even consensus nominees have faced long delays \nbefore Senate Republicans would allow a vote. Since President Obama was \nelected, we have had to overcome two filibusters on two circuit court \nnominees who were reported unanimously by the committee. These judges--\nJudge Barbara Keenan of the Fourth Circuit and Judge Denny Chin of the \nSecond Circuit--were then confirmed unanimously once the filibusters \nwere brought to an end. There are currently 17 judicial nominees who \nwere reported unanimously by all Republicans and Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee and yet are stuck on the Senate Executive Calendar \nbecause Senate Republicans will not consent to vote on them. These are \nconsensus nominations that should not have been delayed while the \nFederal courts are experiencing a judicial vacancies crisis.\n  This pattern of delay and obstruction has not been confined to \njudges. President Obama's executive nominations have been subjected to \nthe same unfair treatment. The first five U.S. attorneys appointed by \nPresident Obama were delayed more than 2 months for no good reason in \nthe summer of 2009. These are the top Federal law enforcement officers \nin those districts and yet it took from June 4 to August 7 before \nSenate Republicans would consent to their confirmations. They were then \nconfirmed unanimously. The Chairman of the United States Sentencing \nCommission was similarly delayed unnecessarily for almost 6 months, \nfrom May 7 until October 21, 2009. He, too, was ultimately confirmed \nwithout opposition, but after needless delay.\n  Among a slew of other troublesome examples are these: One Republican \nSenator objected to a nominee to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors because, according to that Senator, the nominee lacked the \nnecessary qualifications. The nominee was a Nobel Prize winner and MIT \neconomics professor. Another Republican Senator is blocking the \nconfirmation of two SEC Commissioners until he extracts action from the \nSEC related to a case against the Stanford Financial Group. A group of \nSenate Republicans have sent a letter to President Obama vowing to \noppose any nominee to be Director of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. Republican Senators are vowing to block President Obama's \nnominee to serve as the Secretary of Commerce.\n\n  In a particularly illustrative case, one Republican Senator lifted \nhis hold on the nomination of the Director of the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service only after the administration acceded to his \ndemands and issued 15\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\noffshore oil drilling permits. Shortly thereafter, another Republican \nSenator placed a hold on the very same nomination to force the Interior \nDepartment to release documents on the Department's ``wild lands'' \npolicy. It did not end there. When that dispute was resolved, a third \nRepublican Senator reportedly placed a hold on the nominee, demanding a \nreview of the protected status of wolves. That nominee has still not \nbeen confirmed.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans have ratcheted up the partisanship, \nlimiting the cooperation that used to allow nominations to move forward \nmore quickly. That hostage-taking should not affect this critical term \nextension for the head of the FBI, but it has. Another important \nnomination is being subjected to holds and delays. Another well-\nqualified national security nominee is being used as leverage by the \nRepublican Senate minority to extract other unrelated concessions. That \nis what Senator Coburn's alternative plan invited and that is what is \nhappening with Senator Paul's objection to proceeding.\n  Just recently, we finally broke through months of obstruction of the \nDeputy Attorney General and the Assistant Attorney General for National \nSecurity, key national security related nominations. In May, Senate \nRepublicans filibustered for the first time in American history the \nnomination of the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. The \nnomination of the Assistant Attorney General for the National Security \nDivision at the Department of Justice was subjected to similar, \ninexcusable delay. That nominee was approved unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and unanimously by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, and ultimately approved unanimously by the Senate. But \nthat nomination, approved unanimously all along the way, took 15 weeks. \nIt took more than a month just to schedule the Senate vote after the \nnomination was reported unanimously by two Senate committees. I warned \non June 29 that we have no guarantee that the President's nomination of \nan FBI Director would be treated any differently. Regrettably, that has \nbecome true. I wish I had been wrong, but unfortunately the same kinds \nof delays and obstructions for the sake of delays and obstructions have \noccurred.\n  Senate Republicans have known since we began consideration of the \nPresident's request to extend the FBI Director's term that his plan \ncould not be considered a viable alternative unless there was an \nagreement from Senate Republicans to ensure that the Senate would \ncomplete its work and have the FBI Director in place at the end of the \nsummer. That agreement would take the form of a unanimous consent \nagreement in the Senate, entered into by all Senators, and locked in, \non the Record, so that it could not be changed without unanimous \nconsent. That has not occurred. Senator Coburn was unable to convince \nhis leadership and the Republican caucus to agree. That was the only \nway to ensure Senate action on a nomination before August 2.\n  To complete action in accordance with Senator Coburn's alternative \nplan would mean not only passing legislation through both the Senate \nand House, but the Senate also receiving, considering and confirming \nthe renomination of Director Mueller. I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee back in 2001 when the Senate considered and confirmed \nDirector Mueller's initial nomination within 2 weeks. I worked hard to \nmake that happen. I predicted in June that given the current practices \nof Senate Republicans, and their unwillingness to agree on expedited \ntreatment for President Obama's nominations, it was foolhardy to think \nthat all Senate Republicans would cooperate. They have not. There has \nalready been a shifting series of Republican holds over the last month.\n  The bill was reported over 1 month ago and action has been stymied by \nRepublican objections every since. Senate Republicans have simply \nrefused to agree to proceed and now there is no time for a complicated \ntwo phase procedure. We need to pass the necessary statutory authority \nto allow Director Mueller to continue without further delay.\n  As I have said, all Senate Democrats are prepared to take up and pass \nthis extension bill, and send it to the House of Representatives for it \nto take final action before August 2. That is what we should be doing. \nWe should do that now. There is no good reason for delay. All that is \nlacking is Senate Republicans' consent.\n  Virtually everybody that I have heard from in the Senate says that \nDirector Mueller is the right person to lead the FBI at this critical \ntime. Now is not a time--2 months before the anniversary of 9/11--to \nhave somebody new on the job. I hope we will take up the bill soon. I \nwish we had done it at the time I urged Senators to.\n  I do applaud the Democratic side of the aisle for saying there would \nbe no objections on our side to moving forward to this legislation so \nthat we can extend for 2 years the term of Robert Mueller. I also \ncongratulate and thank Director Mueller and his wife for being willing \nto put on hold their plans for retirement for those 2 years for the \ngood of the country.\n\n  Given the continuing threat to our Nation, especially with the 10th \nanniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks approaching, and the \nneed to provide continuity and stability on the President's national \nsecurity team, it is important that we respond to the President's \nrequest and enact this necessary legislation swiftly. The incumbent FBI \nDirector's term otherwise expires on August 2, 2011. I hope cooler \nheads will prevail, and I urge the Senate to take up this critical \nlegislation and pass it without further delay.\n  (Mr. MANCHIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer my strong \nsupport to the nomination of James Paul Oetken to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. In Mr. Oetken, \nPresident Obama has sent to the Senate a nominee who we all should be \nproud to support.\n  J. Paul Oetken is a brilliant lawyer with a remarkable level of \naccomplishment. A graduate of the University of Iowa, where he received \nhis bachelor of arts degree with highest distinction, and Yale Law \nSchool, where he received his juris doctorate, Mr. Oetken has built a \nsuccessful career spanning the public and private sectors.\n  During the Clinton Administration, he served as an attorney-adviser \nat the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and at the \nWhite House as associate counsel to the President. Prior to that, he \nclerked for three distinguished Federal judges, including U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice Harry Blackmun.\n  He currently serves as senior vice president and associate general \ncounsel at Cablevision Systems Corporation, a New York Company, \nfollowing several years in private practice.\n  Throughout his career, J. Paul Oetken has demonstrated a strong \ncommitment to public service and civil rights, especially for gay and \nlesbian Americans. He has worked pro bono on amicus briefs defending \nthe rights of LGBT Americans against laws that discriminate based on an \nindividual's sexual orientation.\n  Mr. Oetken is the first openly gay man to be nominated to serve on \nthe U.S. district court, and if confirmed, will be only the second \nopenly gay individual serving in a U.S. district court or circuit court \nof appeals.\n  I firmly believe that the American people will be best served by a \nFederal judiciary that reflects our diversity as a nation, broadening \nthe range of perspectives and experiences represented on the Federal \nbench. J. Paul Oetken will bring a strong intellect and commitment to \njustice, but also the diversity of experience that is currently lacking \nin our Federal courts. It is for that reason that I particularly want \nto applaud the President for submitting this nomination to the Senate.\n  J. Paul Oetken was unanimously favorably reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and it is rare that we see a nominee come to the \nSenate floor with that kind of bipartisan support. To date, there are \nstill 90 judicial vacancies in article III Courts, and 53 pending \nnominations that still need to be acted on by the full Senate. This is \nsimply unacceptable. It is my hope that more of President Obama's \nhighly qualified nominees will be reported out of committee and receive \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  J. Paul Oetken has the experience, education, and commitment to the \nrule of law and equal rights to be an outstanding Federal judge. He \nreceived a\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nunanimous rating of ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary and I am confident that if \nconfirmed, he will be an excellent fit for the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting yes on this nomination.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I speak \ntoday on behalf of J. Paul Oetken's nomination to be U.S. District \nJudge for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Oetken and I knew each \nother while we were law students at Yale, and I have followed his \ncareer with great interest since then. Mr. Oetken is, in my view, a \nstrikingly intelligent man. His varied career--in private practice, \nwith Jenner & Block and Debevoise & Plimpton; in the public sector with \na number of admirable clerkships, culminating with a Supreme Court \nclerkship for Justice Blackmun; with the Office of Legal Counsel and \nthe White House Counsel's Office; and, now, in the business world, \nwhere he is vice president and associate general counsel for \nCablevision--demonstrates a searching intellect and great capability.\n  Mr. Oetken possesses a unique combination of perspectives and an \nexceptional series of qualifications. Given Mr. Oetken's obvious talent \nand broad experience, I am confident he will make a great Federal \njudge. In my view, it is an added and important bonus that, as the \nfirst openly gay man confirmed to the Federal bench, his service will \nalso move us closer to full equality in our Nation. His confirmation \nwill inspire future judges, lawyers and litigants with the knowledge \nthat, for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered Americans, it does \nget better in our Nation's long journey to inclusion and justice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of J. Paul Oetken, of New York, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of New York?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nHagan) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), \nthe Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nRubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to celebrate a \nfriend and a statesman, a former Member of the Senate, a marine \naviator, a pioneering astronaut, a beloved family man, and an American \nhero.\n  Today is the 90th birthday of John Herschel Glenn.\n  I was 10 years old when John Glenn observed three sunsets, three \nsunrises, and the wonder of the universe in just under 5 hours while \norbiting the Earth.\n  I was 16 years old when John Glenn presented to me and another couple \ndozen Eagle Scouts in Mansfield, OH, our Eagle Scout Award, teaching us \nyet again about community service and community pride.\n  When I was 54, in one of the most memorable moments of my \nprofessional life--with John's wife Annie and my wife Connie in the \ngallery--John Glenn escorted me into this Senate Chamber to be sworn in \nas a Senator from Ohio.\n  As a grandfather and a father, a husband and a Senator, I continue to \nbe inspired by the example of a life well lived--a life in public \nservice, a life fighting for the public good.\n  Born in Cambridge, OH, 150 miles east of Dayton, where the Wright \nbrothers first figured out how to fly, he attended public school and \nbecame an Eagle Scout in New Concord.\n  It was there where he would meet his childhood sweetheart and future \nwife Annie. As children, they literally shared a playpen. John says: \n``She was part of my life from the time of my first memory.''\n  On April 6, 1943, Annie and John married. Since then, they have \nearned the adulation and admiration from people around the world for \ntheir accomplishments and for their devoted love. By 1941, he had \nstudied mathematics at nearby Muskingum College and earned his pilot's \nlicense.\n  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he dropped out of college to enlist \nin the Navy and after 2 years of advanced aviator training was \nreassigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. John Glenn flew 59 combat missions \nwith the Marines in World War II and 90 combat missions with both the \nMarines and Air Force in Korea. On some of these flying missions, he \nhad baseball great Ted Williams on his wing. John Glenn was awarded \nnumerous commendations and citations for his heroic military service.\n  In 1959, he was selected by the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration (NASA) as one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts. \nIn 1962, President Kennedy made John Glenn the first American to orbit \nthe Earth, and 35 years later, John Glenn was asked by another \nPresident, Bill Clinton, to fly into space for a second time as a \nmission specialist on the Space Shuttle Discovery. At the age of 77, he \nbecame the oldest human being to fly in space, conducting a series of \nscientific investigations into the physiology of the human aging \nprocess and exploring the effects of space flight and aging.\n  By the 1960s, Glenn's service to his country had expanded into a \ncareer in politics. He was with Senator Robert F. Kennedy that fateful \nday in June in California, and he served as a pallbearer a few days \nlater at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  In 1974, John Glenn was elected to the Senate from my State of Ohio, \nserving four consecutive terms until his retirement 24 years later in \n1999. He served as chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. \nHe was the chief author of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978.\n  Throughout the years, he continually championed the advancement of\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nscience and technology, especially NASA, so much that 12 years ago, the \nNASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland--the only NASA facility north \nof the Mason-Dixon Line--was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn \nResearch Center.\n  After his retirement from the Senate, he and Annie founded the John \nGlenn School for Public Affairs at The Ohio State University saying: \n``If there is one thing I've learned in my years on this planet, it's \nthat the happiest and most fulfilled people I've known are those who \ndevoted themselves to something bigger and more profound than merely \ntheir own self-interest.''\n  Whether he was flying in the air or floating in space, walking the \ncampaign trails or in this Chamber, he remained grounded in his New \nConcord roots and always by the steady hand and constant love of Annie. \nWhen my family and I decided I should run for the Senate in the fall of \n2005, the first people we called were Annie and John Glenn.\n  Annie's advice to Connie then and now has been to ``be yourself and \nnot allow others to tell you who you should be.'' Connie, who was a \nnoted writer in Ohio, writes for the Cleveland Plain Dealer--Connie had \nthis to say about Annie:\n\n       ``Annie Glenn refuses to draw attention to herself, which \n     is one of the reasons so many of us cannot get enough of her. \n     She is that rare person who is genuinely interested in \n     whomever is standing right in front of her. You will never \n     capture her looking over your shoulder searching for someone \n     more interesting, more important. If you are looking into the \n     eyes of Annie Glenn, you have just become the most \n     fascinating person in the world. This is not to suggest Annie \n     is a wallflower. She was won many honors, changed many lives, \n     through her advocacy.\n       She is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions \n     earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was \n     scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie: \n     Americans rightly ooh and aah over John Glenn's courage in \n     space. But let us never forget the hero of a wife who gave \n     her public blessing, and then privately prayed until his safe \n     return.''\n\n  John and I traveled across Ohio on the campaign trail, hearing each \nother so often that we could finish each other's speeches and roll our \neyes at the same jokes we would tell.\n  John and Annie teach all of us about our own capacity for \nselflessness and to have the confidence to serve with humility and with \nhonor. They are dedicated public servants and trailblazers whose sense \nof humor and smiles brighten any room and in whose presence we better \nunderstand the meaning of love and compassion. It is a love and \nmarriage that everyone from lifelong New Concord friends to U.S. \nPresidents, to colleagues in this Chamber have described with \naffection.\n  Barack Obama said during a campaign stop in Columbus:\n\n       The thing I admire most about John Glenn is his \n     relationship to his wife, Annie. They have been married for \n     65 years--\n\n  That was then. Now it is 68--\n     and you should see the way he treats her. He's in love. \n     Sixty-five years later he's still in love. And no wonder, \n     because she is a remarkable woman.\n\n  Through John and Annie's remarkable American lives, we reveal and \nremember the greatness of our country, our capacity to love and to \nwonder and to see something greater than ourselves.\n  My wife Connie and I are fortunate to call Annie and John friends, \nand they remain trusted mentors and role models for us and so many. \nWhen his country was attacked, he enlisted. When his President asked, \nhe served. When his country needed it, he instilled a confidence in the \nAmerican spirit of scientific discovery. When his State needed his \nleadership, he represented the people of our State with honor.\n  Happy 90th birthday, John Glenn. Your life tells our Nation's story \nin the 20th century, our triumphs and our turbulence, and it tells how \nour Nation's spirit of discovery could be found in the humility of a \nhometown hero from New Concord, OH.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I did not know it was John Glenn's birthday. \nI am so happy I was on the floor when my dear friend from Ohio talked \nabout John Glenn. John Glenn--when I came to the Senate, one of the \nfirst Tuesday caucuses we had I watched John Glenn stand and say: I am \ngoing to go out on the aircraft career USS Kennedy on Saturday. Would \nanyone like to go?\n  I was a new Senator. I thought everyone would raise their hand and \nmarch off with him. I was the only one who raised my hand. So I did. I \nwent out with him. It was a wonderful experience. The seas were a \nlittle bit rough and we landed and that cable snagged that airplane \ngoing in. We were there for many hours and the seas got rougher and \nrougher.\n  The pilots coming in, this was the first time they had landed on an \naircraft carrier. We went out on the deck of the ship, and the planes \nwould come in. Oh, man. The crews there, if they did not think the \nplane could land--it was going too far off the end: ``Dirty. Dirty.''\n  That meant get the plane up off the carrier, go up and come back and \ntry it again. They did that for quite some time. Then, John Glenn said: \nI think I should go up in one of those airplanes. So John Glenn went up \nand flew an airplane. I do not know how old John Glenn was. It was 25 \nyears ago, so he was a young man--he was 65--and here he comes in, \nlanding on the aircraft carrier, John Glenn.\n\n  Totally changing the subject. A group from Nevada won the Double \nDutch skip-roping championship. They came to my office over in the Hart \nBuilding to show me how good they were. Of course, it takes a little \nspace to do it. So in one of the outside hallways there in the Hart \nBuilding they do this Double Dutch jumping.\n  They asked me to try it. I was so embarrassed. I could not get one \nstep. I did not realize, but from his office, John Glenn had been \nwatching these kids jumping rope. He comes out, the famous John Glenn, \nand says: Would you mind if I tried?\n  I do not know. I assume he was 70 years old at the time. He was \nperfect, did not miss a step. I mean, that is hard to do. Jumping rope \nis hard, but when you have two people flipping two different ropes, it \nis hard. He did that. What a physical specimen he was at 70 years old. \nThink what he must have been when he was 20 years old, a man who in \nWorld War II was an ace, meaning he shot down so many airplanes. He did \nthe same thing in Korea. Here is a man who was the first to orbit in \nspace. You can go see his spacecraft down in the Air and Space Museum. \nHe says: Go look at it. He said: What they said about that is I wore \nit. It was so small, but he went up there.\n  The stories he told, I just so loved John Glenn. He said: They did \nnot know what it would be like to go up in space. No one had ever done \nthis. He told me about all the precautions they did the first time he \nwent up in space. They did not know if the air sickness would come and \nthey could not handle the flight. He was trained. He had a big \nhypodermic syringe that would go through his space clothes, shoot him \nin the thigh so he would not get too sick up there.\n  He learned--I do not know how many--``I come in friendship''--in many \ndifferent languages because they did not know for sure, if the \nspacecraft would go down, who would be there. But they had a general \nidea where it would go. So he learned to say: ``I come in friendship'' \nin many different languages. Then, of course, he went up in space once \nagain.\n  He was such a wonderful human being. I had such admiration for him. \nTo think I was able to serve in the Senate with John Glenn says it all, \nand Sherrod Brown, Senator Brown, was absolutely right. This \nrelationship, this love affair, that John Glenn and Annie had and have, \ntheir 68 years of marriage is remarkable.\n  As the books have shown and the movies show, Annie had a very bad \nspeech impediment. She stammered. She stuttered. She stuttered until \nshe was, I do not know how old, but in her fifties, and she stammered \nvery much. John Glenn, when they were courting\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\neach other, would have to do her phone calls for her because she could \nnot talk on the phone very well.\n  What a wonderful human being, John Glenn. I know there are other \npeople wanting to speak. But I have to say a couple of things. He led a \ncongressional delegation when I was a relatively new Senator. We went \nbehind the Iron Curtain. I can remember going from Austria into \nCzechoslovakia, and the Communists had stopped the train we were on. \nThey had dogs and they had these soldiers looking under the train and \nthey went and looked at who we were.\n  But when things calmed down, one of the soldiers asked John Glenn for \nhis autograph. He is a world-famous man and is a man of such humility. \nI want him to know, and everyone within the sound of my voice, he is \none of the finest human beings I have ever met. He is a historical \nfigure now and for all time in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know Senator Grassley is waiting and I \nam going to be brief. I thank him for his indulgence.\n  But when Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio came to the floor to speak of \nJohn Glenn, I could not help but stay, and I am glad I did. First, for \nthose who were listening, the good news is we are celebrating his \nbirthday. He is still alive and well, with Annie, and we are sure happy \nthat is the case.\n  When I was just getting started in politics, 1982, I was running for \nCongress in Springfield, IL, and Senator John Glenn called and said: I \nam going to come and campaign for you. I cannot tell you how excited I \nwas to meet him face to face in my hometown. He is truly an American \nhero. For all his service to the United States, a naval pilot, Marine \npilot in World War II, in the Korean war, our first man into space, an \nastronaut who reprised his performance at the age of 77. He went back \ninto space. It tells you what kind of person he is, his courage and his \nstrength, his physical strength that he could do that.\n  I had the good fortune of being on the floor of the Senate for my \norientation in 1996, and your predecessor, Mr. President, Senator \nRobert Byrd, would sit in that chair and tell all the new Members and \ntheir spouses the history of the Senate. I sat right over here, and \nLoretta sat next to me. At one point, Senator Byrd said: Open that desk \ndrawer in front of you. You are going to see a great Senate tradition. \nRemember how the teachers told you, don't write on the desks. Well, the \nSenators never got the message.\n  Inside virtually every desk on this floor is the name of the Senator \nwho sat in the desk, scratched in the wood by the Senator at the bottom \nof the drawer. He said, pull out the drawer on the desk and see whose \nname is in there. Sure enough, it was John Glenn's. It was his desk I \nwas sitting at. Next to it was Paul Douglas, the man I worked for as a \ncollege intern, who inspired me to get started in public life. So I \nhave that desk today. I am honored to have it and to have added my name \nto the desk drawer of these two great men.\n\n  I didn't realize at the time that not only would I be able to have \nthis desk, but I would actually serve with John Glenn. I think there \nhave been fewer than 1,300 men and women who have had the honor to be \nin the Senate. Many have vanished into history and will never be \nremembered for anything significant. That is not true of John Glenn. \nWhat he has done in his public life is set an example to everybody who \naspires to this job. He literally risked his life for this country over \nand over. He is a humble, quiet, friendly person, and he is dedicated \nto Annie. The two of them have a relationship, as President Obama said, \nthat is extraordinary in American life.\n  The fact that I got to know him, got to serve with him, and he helped \nlaunch me on this political journey I am on today is something I will \nnever, ever forget. I wish John Glenn, our former colleague, a happy \nbirthday, and thank him again and again for all the service he has \ngiven to this great Nation. He has made America a better place. I am \nhonored to have been one of his colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Judicial Activism\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court earlier this month \nissued a very important decision which bothered me--a decision that I \nthink shows that dissenters in this decision are judicial activists. It \nis important not only on the merits of the case but because it shows \nhow this country is only one vote away from unprecedented judicial \nactivism.\n  The Obama administration is encouraging this judicial activism. The \nObama administration is taking legal positions that threaten the role \nof Congress as a coequal branch of our government. Those positions \nchallenge the separation of power that is designed to protect the \nfreedom of Americans, and even the right of people to govern \nthemselves, which is the basis of representative government and the \npurpose of the Congress.\n  The United States happens to be a party to the Vienna Convention on \nConsular Relations. This treaty gives rights to the citizens of \ncountries who are parties to that treaty to have access to their \ncountry's consular officials if they are arrested abroad. There are \nsome foreign nationals in this country who were sentenced to death \nwithout those rights being respected. All of these death sentences \nappear to be valid under the American Constitution.\n  The story is complicated, but in 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that \nfailure to comply with the treaty was not an obstacle to the execution \nof a foreign national who had been sentenced to death. This was the \ncase even if the President ordered a State to allow the criminal to \nchallenge his sentence in light of the treaty, and even if the criminal \nobtained a judgment from the International Court of Justice that his \nconviction violated international law. The Court said that Congress \ncould pass legislation to make the treaty apply to people on death row \nwho had not received consular access. We in the Congress have never \npassed such a law.\n  Now to the Supreme Court case that concerns me in light of this \nbackground on the consular relations treaty. In 1994, Humberto Leal \nGarcia, a Mexican national, kidnapped a 16-year-old girl, raped her, \nand bludgeoned her to death. He did not ask for access to the Mexican \nconsul, and he did not receive access. He did not challenge his failure \nto receive consular access during his trial. Only after he brought \nState habeas corpus litigation did he raise this claim; and even then, \nhe did not raise consular notification as an issue in his first habeas \ncorpus petition.\n  Mr. Leal did obtain a ruling from the International Court of Justice \nthat his conviction and sentence were obtained in violation of \ninternational law. The International Court of Justice ordered that he \nwas entitled under national law to receive another review of his \nconviction and sentence, regardless of whether habeas law allowed him \nto raise such an issue. But that ruling is obviously not binding on \nAmerican courts, as no country in the world, including the country of \nMexico, enforces International Court of Justice rulings as part of its \ndomestic law.\n  As his execution date approached, Mr. Leal sought a stay in the \nSupreme Court. Since Mr. Leal received a fair trial under American law, \nand there was no question concerning his guilt, his request should have \nbeen rejected, and rejected unanimously. But that is not what happened. \nHe was executed, but the Supreme Court's ruling was shockingly close--5 \nto 4.\n  The Department of Justice, through the Solicitor General, Donald \nVerrilli, asked the Supreme Court to grant the stay. Its brief was \ntruly astonishing. It did not argue that there was any doubt Mr. Leal \nwas guilty. It did not say Mr. Leal had been harmed in any way by the \nVienna Convention violation. It cited no case that provided an example \nwhere a stay had been issued in similar circumstances. It raised no \narguments for the stay that were based on American law, because \nAmerican law did not support a stay.\n  Instead, the Department of Justice relied on international law and \nmade policy arguments. It argued that Mr. Leal's execution would create \nnegative effects on America's international relations. It argued that \nhis execution would violate our international legal obligations, and it \nargued that the mere introduction of legislation--understand this, just \nintroducing a bill and at the same time having the support of the Obama \nadministration--\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nshould allow the Court to issue a stay to preserve its jurisdiction if \ntime were given to allow the bill to be enacted. This is the position \nthat worries me and threatens the role of Congress as a coequal branch \nof government.\n  Everyone knows bills are not laws. Bills are what we introduce. If we \npass bills, they become law. The Founding Fathers made it very \ndifficult to enact laws. There are two Houses of Congress, and each has \nto pass the same version of the bill and the President has to sign that \nbill or a supermajority of both Houses must override a veto.\n  This was done to protect the rights of the American people. Only if a \nbill passes through a specified process can a bill become a law. A \ncourt following the rule of law can only enforce what actually becomes \na law. There may be times when an agency might pay attention to a bill \nthat is introduced, but that is an agency. In the case of courts, a \ncourt should only apply what has actually become law--in other words, a \nbill passing both Houses of Congress, signed by the President--not pay \nattention to a bill that has just been introduced.\n  The Solicitor General's brief relied on a bill, not a law. The name \nof the bill is the Consular Notification Compliance Act. That bill \nwould retroactively allow prisoners on death row whose Vienna \nConvention rights were violated yet another bite at the apple. If the \nbill passed, they would be able to delay their death sentences--lawful \nsentences under American law--with another round of judicial review for \ncompliance with what? International law. Although the bill is strongly \nsupported by the Obama administration, it has not passed, so it is not \nlaw, it is a bill. It is going to have a hearing soon, but it is not \nscheduled to be placed on the committee agenda for markup. It is clear \nthere is no chance this Congress would pass a law that retroactively \nallowed foreign nationals who face lawful death penalties another round \nof judicial review based upon the Vienna Convention.\n  Congress simply will not pass a bill that gives Federal judges \nanother opportunity to display their dislikes of the death penalty by \ndelaying cases for no good reason. Only Congress can legislate. But the \nObama administration argued in the Court that the Supreme Court should \ngrant a stay, even though Congress has not legislated, simply because \nthe executive branch strongly supported the bill, which theoretically--\nbut only theoretically--could pass at some future time.\n  Do you know what disturbs me? Four Justices agreed with this \noutlandish position. There is absolutely no precedent for the position. \nThese dissenters accepted an Obama position that was made out of whole \ncloth. When courts rule based on law, we have the rule of law. When \nthey rule based upon policy preferences, we have judicial activism, not \nthe rule of law.\n  The Obama administration asked for a stay based upon policy \npreferences, based on international law, and based on that \nadministration's view that a bill it supports takes overwhelming \nprecedence over a considered decision of Congress not to pass that \nlegislation. Four Justices--just one short of a majority--were willing \nto disregard American law in favor of international law, and also in \nfavor of policy implications, and also based upon a bill being \nintroduced in Congress. This is not only inconsistent with the rule of \nlaw, it is a threat to American democracy. How extreme.\n  The American people, through their elected representatives, have \nenacted the death penalty and established limits on habeas corpus \npetitions that impede executions. The people's representatives--those \nof us in the Congress--also declined to enact a bill to implement the \nVienna Convention. Notwithstanding that decision of the people's \nrepresentatives, this administration and four Justices would have used \nan unpassed bill to delay a death sentence. How extreme. They would \nhave had the courts not allow the preferences of the American people as \nexpressed through their elected representatives but, instead, their own \npolicy preferences. How extreme. But under our system of government, \nthe results of the democratic process are entitled to prevail, unless \nthe Constitution--and only the Constitution--clearly provides \notherwise.\n  The position of the Obama administration and the four dissenting \nJustices also is harmful to American democracy in yet another way. If \nthe American people dislike what Congress is doing, it is very simple. \nIn the next election, they can elect new Representatives and Senators. \nThey can ask that Federal judicial nominees be stopped or that laws be \npassed that overturn judicial decisions made under Federal law. But \nwhat are the American people to do if judges make decisions based on \nthe views of foreign governments and international tribunals that are \ncontrary to our very own law? What if judicial rulings are designed to \nenforce decisions of the International Court of Justice, rulings that \nare not binding as Federal law? Americans cannot influence the views of \nforeign governments or the rulings of international tribunals.\n\n  Had the Obama administration and the four dissenting Justices \nprevailed, the American people would have lost a part of the right to \ngovern themselves. That right would have been replaced with ``obedience \nwithout recourse'' to foreign powers over whom our people exercise no \nvoice. That is not the system the Founding Fathers bequeathed us.\n  The question of whether courts should apply American law or foreign \nlaw is of great concern to me and to other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and maybe to a lot of Senators who aren't on that committee. \nThose of us on the committee have thought about this specific question \nlong before this recent Leal case that has come, I guess within the \nlast 3 weeks. And I have asked judicial and administration nominees \nabout these very issues at their confirmation hearings.\n  For instance, just a few months ago, I posed a question to the \nnominee for Solicitor General, Mr. Verrilli, about an amicus brief he \nhad filed on behalf of foreign nationals who had been sentenced to \ndeath. In that brief, Mr. Verrilli argued not that the prisoner's \nconstitutional rights had been violated, but that ``[i]t is in the \ninterests of the United States and the world community that the legal \nstandards of the United States should reflect and be informed by \ninternational human rights.''\n  I asked Mr. Verrilli, were he confirmed, whether there were any \ncircumstances in which he would argue before the Supreme Court in a \ndeath penalty case that the Court be ``informed by international \nrights?'' He responded:\n\n       I will adhere to the view that foreign law, including \n     international human rights law, has no authoritative force in \n     interpreting the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n     except in those rare instances where federal statutes \n     incorporate or make international and/or foreign court \n     decisions binding legal authority.\n\n  Responding to my question on the difference between international \nhuman rights and our own constitutional rights, Mr. Verrilli stated:\n\n       International human rights are set forth in international \n     treaties, conventions and customary international law. They \n     are not binding and enforceable in the United States unless \n     Congress has made them so.\n\n  The Leal case does not involve a Federal statute of the type Mr. \nVerrilli cited, nor does it concern any international standards binding \nand enforceable in the United States because Congress made them so. I \nbelieve Mr. Verrilli's brief as Solicitor General is very inconsistent \nwith what he related during his confirmation hearing.\n  The brief relied on international human rights, and its only \nreference to American law was this bill that I have referred to--not a \nlaw, a bill--which, under our constitutional system, is as different \nfrom a law as night is from day.\n  I would also note that Mr. Verrilli stated during his confirmation \nhearing:\n\n       If the Attorney General [or the President] directed that I \n     take a position . . . one that I believe to be an \n     indefensible view of the law, I would not lend my name or \n     that of the Office of Solicitor General to carrying out the \n     order, and would certainly resign rather than carry out the \n     order.\n\n  Mr. Verrilli obviously does not believe that reliance solely on \ninternational law and a bill is an indefensible view of the law. I \ndisagree with him on that point.\n  Similarly, during her confirmation hearing, Justice Sotomayor was \nasked about the application of foreign or American law. She was one of \nthese dissenters. She stated:\n\n       I do not believe foreign law should be used to determine \n     the result under constitutional\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\n     law or American law, except where American law directs.\n\n  In the Leal case, foreign law should not have been used to resolve \nthe case because American law did not direct that foreign law apply.\n  When Justice Kagan appeared for her confirmation hearing, she stated \nthat in deciding cases, ``you're looking at law all the way down, not \nyour political preferences, not your personal preferences.''\n  However, the law in the Leal case is clear. Executive branch policy \narguments and unenacted bills are not law.\n  I am not saying the Solicitor General or these Justices who dissented \nlied at their confirmation hearings or made a mockery of the \nconfirmation process, but Judiciary Committee members foresaw cases \nsuch as Leal and asked the nominees to address the role of foreign law \nin constitutional cases. I believe, although they do not, what these \nindividuals wrote in the Leal case is inconsistent with what they said \nat the time of their confirmation hearings.\n  Finally, one of these issues could arise again in a different legal \ncontext. Like the death penalty cases, there is ongoing litigation \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. Like \nthe death penalty cases, the Defense of Marriage Act is the subject of \na bill. The particular bill--called the Respect for Marriage Act--\nnotwithstanding its Orwellian name, would repeal the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  The Department of Justice has already decided not only to defend the \nDefense of Marriage Act but now argues the Defense of Marriage Act is \nunconstitutional. The Department, in light of its Leal brief, may be \nconsidering making the implausible argument the courts should strike \ndown the Defense of Marriage Act simply because a bill has been \nintroduced to repeal it--the same argument used in the Leal case before \nthe Supreme Court.\n  You might well argue the introduction of a bill that is strongly \nsupported by the administration is enough to lead courts to believe the \nCongress has already repealed the law anyway, so why not have the Court \nsimply declare the law unconstitutional. The Department should not make \nsuch an argument, and I can tell the courts that, like the bill to make \nthe Vienna Convention apply retroactively to convicted criminal \ndefendants who face the death penalty, this Congress will not--and I \nrepeat, will not--pass the Respect for Marriage Act and courts should \nnot consider its introduction in resolving DOMA's constitutionality.\n  Mr. President, obviously, I am disappointed the Obama administration \nhas advanced policy arguments rather than legal arguments in the \nSupreme Court. How ridiculous it is to try to convince the Supreme \nCourt that just because a bill is introduced they ought to make a \ndecision based upon that bill being introduced.\n  In the absence of arguments based on American law, it should not have \nasked the Court to rule based on policy. Rather, it should have either \nargued based on American law--even if American law did not conform to \nits view of desirable policy--or it should have declined to participate \nin the case.\n  I am also disappointed that four Supreme Court Justices voted to \nadvance their views of policy rather than law, which is the essence of \njudicial activism. We were--or you could say we are--only one vote away \nfrom a Supreme Court majority that would have applied policy \npreferences in favor of international law rather than American \nconstitutional law. We were only one vote away from a Supreme Court \nmajority that would have usurped the separation of powers by \nconsidering a bill to be the same as a law that Congress passed. And we \nwere only one vote away from a Supreme Court majority that would have \napplied the ruling of an international tribunal over which Americans \nhave no say rather than a body--as in this Congress of the United \nStates--that is representative of and answers only to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Bernier, \nwho died on June 25, 2011, from injuries sustained during combat in \nKherwar, Afghanistan, while supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. \nSpecialist Bernier was a combat medic with Headquarters, Headquarters \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat \nTeam, 10th Mountain Division based out of Fort Polk, LA.\n  A native of East Kingston, NH, and 2007 graduate of Exeter High \nSchool, Nicholas or Nick, as he was called by those who knew him, \nenlisted in the U.S. Army shortly after graduation. Prior to his \ndeployment to Afghanistan in October 2010, Nick provided medical care \nin Texas to wounded soldiers who had returned from overseas.\n  From a very young age, Nick stood out in his tight-knit community for \nhis desire to help others. It was, therefore, no surprise to his \nfriends and family when he answered the call to serve his country, to \nprotect his fellow Americans, and to care for his brothers in arms as a \nmedic on the frontlines in Afghanistan. This last assignment was, in \nfact, a natural fit for him.\n  Our Nation can never adequately thank Nick for his willingness to \nserve and to make the ultimate sacrifice defending the freedoms we hold \ndear. While words provide little comfort at such a time as this, I hope \nNick's family will find some solace in the deep appreciation all \nAmericans share for Nick, for the life he lived and for the ultimate \nsacrifice he made in the service of others. He was a true American \nhero.\n  Nick is survived by his parents, Paul Bernier of East Kingston, NH, \nand Tina Clements of Haverhill, MA; two brothers, Bradley and \nChristopher, and half-sister, Brittany. He also leaves behind a caring \nextended family and a community that loved him.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the \nlife, service, and sacrifice of SPC Nicholas P.

TRIAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great privilege that \ntoday I honor and express my thanks to Dr. Ines Triay, Assistant \nSecretary for Environmental Management at the Department of Energy for \nher service to our country.\n  The Environmental Management Program at DOE has consistently been a \npriority for me during my tenure in the Senate, as Washington State is \nhome to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. As a part of the Manhattan \nProject, Hanford produced plutonium from 1944 until 1987, and the \nefforts of Hanford workers and the Tri-Cities community helped end \nWorld War II.\n  Today, under the leadership of Dr. Triay, Hanford workers are \ninvolved in an environmental cleanup project of enormous scale \nnecessitated by the processes required to transform raw uranium into \nplutonium for bombs. These processes generated billions of gallons of \nliquid waste and millions of tons of solid waste which must now be \ncleaned up, removed, or remediated. Dr. Triay and her staff have worked \nclosely with both the Richland Operations Office and the Office of \nRiver Protection to ensure cleanup efforts at Hanford continue to move \nforward in a meaningful and timely fashion.\n  Ines has devoted her career to the safe and timely cleanup of \nradioactive waste and facilities from our Nation's Cold War nuclear \nweapon production and research sites. Ines, a Cuban-born\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nimmigrant who earned her Ph.D. in chemistry, has worked at DOE for 24 \nyears, rising from her position as a scientist at Los Alamos National \nLaboratory to Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management, a \nPresidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed position. During her tenure \nas Assistant Secretary, she has led the largest, most diverse, and \ntechnically complex environmental cleanup program in the world.\n  One of Ines' greatest successes came after Congress invested $6 \nbillion in the Environmental Management Program. Ines led the effort to \naccelerate important cleanup projects to reduce the Environmental \nManagement footprint across the country. The success of this investment \nhas been, by all measures, incredible--Ines and her team were able to \nreduce the footprint of the entire Environmental Management complex by \n50 percent.\n  For the past several years, I have worked closely with Ines and I \nhave seen firsthand her commitment to making sure the federal \ngovernment meets its obligations to protect the health of our \ncommunities at Hanford and around the country. Her professionalism, \npassion and knowledge has contributed significantly to the successes of \nthe Environmental Management Program in recent years, and I will miss \nworking with her and her staff on a daily basis.\n  On behalf of all Washingtonians, and on behalf of our country, I \nthank Ines for her dedication to the mission of the Environmental \nManagement Program, for her passion and expertise, and for her \ncommitment to the safety and well-being of the people working at \nHanford and at Environmental Management sites around the country. Ines \nwill be difficult to replace. I congratulate Dr. Triay on all of her \nsuccesses as Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management and wish \nher the best of luck moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4639-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4639-S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DAVID GETCHES\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, a few days ago, I came \nto the Senate floor to honor one of Colorado's great educators and \ncommunity leaders, David Getches, who passed away on Tuesday, July 5, \n2011, at the too-young age of 68. Today, I would like to add further to \nmy earlier remarks so that I may provide an even fuller picture of \nDavid's life.\n  This is more than a poignant moment for me. I originally had planned \nto come to the floor to discuss David's career and character because he \nwas stepping down after 8 very productive years as the dean of the \nUniversity of Colorado Law School.\n  We all have had this terrible experience in our lives when somebody \nwhom we love and respect suddenly finds they have a cancer that is \naggressive--beyond aggressive. Literally a month ago, David was \ndiagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the 4 weeks since that time, that \ncancer stole him from us. But he was always upbeat. He was always \nsomeone who we looked to for enthusiasm and inspiration. I will be \ninspired in my remarks by what he did. I will attempt not to dwell on \nhis loss.\n  As I said, David served as dean of the Colorado Law School for the \nlast 8 years. With him at the helm, CU Law became one of the most \nforward-looking institutions of legal training in the country. I want \nto share a few examples of his vision and leadership. I could not cover \nall of them if I had a full hour. I want to share some of them with the \nSenate and with his friends and admirers in Colorado.\n  He steered the law school through the construction of the new LEED \nGold Certified Wolf Law Building, which put CU and its law school at \nthe cutting edge of environmental sustainability and energy \nefficiency--two ideas that were connected to the values that David was \ncommitted to fostering throughout his career. David previously served \nas executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources \nand as an adviser to the Interior Secretary in the Clinton \nadministration. He had an extensive background in water, environmental, \nand public lands law. Through his work, David impressed upon all \nColoradans the importance of good stewardship of our State's precious \nnatural resources.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I do know David's efforts to teach and share \nthe legal framework that protects our resources could not have been \nmore critical to preserving our Western way of life.\n  David left a lasting impression on the demographic composition of CU \nLaw School. He was committed to a student body composed of people from \nmany different backgrounds and cultures, and that commitment made an \nindelible impact on the school and on Colorado's legal community. In \n2008, the Hispanic Bar Association awarded him their Community Service \nAward for increasing Hispanic enrollment, and he also assembled one of \nthe most diverse administrative teams of any law school in the country. \nHe didn't stop there, however. He then created a commission to produce \na groundbreaking report on diversity in the legal profession and how to \nincrease diversity in law firm recruitment. The highly skilled and \ndiverse alumni of the CU Law School reflect his efforts and successes.\n  Moreover, David built a legacy of access to legal education for all. \nHe worked to expand scholarships and financial aid awarded by the law \nschool to worthy students regardless of their financial background, \nincreasing scholarship awards from $600,000 in 2004 to a hefty $2.1 \nmillion in 3 short years by 2007. This came during a period of time \nwhere David expanded alumni giving and oversaw a 110-percent increase \nin the law school's endowment. And all the while, he continued to \nrecruit and retain top-notch faculty to guide students in their legal \neducation and produce world-class scholarship.\n  In 2008, David worked with the Colorado State Legislature to pass a \nlaw allowing public universities to offer loan repayment assistance \ngrants to graduates practicing public interest law and more recently \nfounded an endowment to award grants to CU Law School graduates in the \npublic sector. These actions reflected David's strong belief in \ntraining and inspiring future leaders to give back to their \ncommunities.\n  What David did by reducing the cost of law school was make public \nservice a viable alternative to private practice for bright, idealistic \ngraduates of the law school. Without question, those students, CU Law \nSchool, the State of Colorado, and I would venture to say the country \nwill reap the benefits in the future from David's foresight and \nthoughtful investments.\n  David's contributions went beyond his tenure as dean, and he had more \nthan an academic interest in the critical issues of our time, \nespecially environmental protection, civil rights, and social justice. \nHe put his social and conservation ethics to work every day, using the \nlaw to foster a fair and livable world. As a very young attorney with \nCalifornia Indian Legal Services, David represented tribal members in \nthe State of Washington who were being arrested for exercising their \ncenturies-old treaty rights to fish. David, alongside his clients, \ndevised a strategy to breathe life into the legal promises made to \ntribes, and the results he achieved changed the face of fisheries and \nwater management in the Northwest. His legal work helped create modern \nIndian law and will have an everlasting imprint on natural resources \nmanagement in the Northwest. He later became the founding executive \ndirector of the Native American Rights Fund, the leading nonprofit \norganization dedicated to tribal sovereignty, economic self-\ndetermination, and defense of treaty rights.\n  David was passionate about protection of the environment, especially \nthe spectacular landscapes, wild country, and treasured wildlife of the \nWest. As a water law expert, David was visionary with respect to the \nchanging needs of the West. He had a particular devotion to the \nColorado River Basin and strove to find ways to meet human demands for \nthe river's waters while conserving its fish and wildlife and other \nenvironmental values. He expressed his love for the West through \nservice on the boards of directors of the Grand Canyon Trust, the \nWilderness Society, and Defenders of Wildlife. He was the founding \nboard chair of the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, now called \nWestern Resource Advocates, and helped grow that fledgling organization \ninto an important regional voice for clean energy and wise stewardship \nof the region's lands and waters. He gave his time, energy, and \nthoughtful creativity to each organization and all have expressed \ngratitude for his wise counsel.\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n  It is also worth noting that even the vast expanse of the Western \nUnited States could not contain David. He even taught himself Spanish \nand published papers and books in that language, influencing water and \nnatural resources legal developments in Central and South America.\n  I cannot help but feel that David was the living expression of the \nbest of our ideals, a man of character and kindness, a modest but \ntireless achiever who preferred to be measured by his work, not by the \naccolades awarded by others. We were honored by his friendship and \nblessed by his many gifts.\n  At the heart of why I wanted to come to the floor today is that I \nthink we know we can all learn from David's passion for giving back to \nwhatever community in which he found himself. He led a life of service, \nand he also compiled an impressive academic record as well as serving \nas the dean of CU Law School. David cared about justice for \ndisenfranchised communities just as strongly as he cared about the \nlong-term health and sustainability of our natural resources. To David, \nthese matters were intertwined. He was, at his core, committed to the \nfuture of his children, our children, our grandchildren, and his \ngrandchildren, and he had a deep love for the Rocky Mountain Western \nway of life. He was an avid outdoorsman, he was fit, and he faced any \nand all physical challenges just like he faced intellectual and \nemotional challenges. As I said in the beginning of my remarks, he was \na mentor to all of us, and he always had his eye on the future. I know, \nas painful as it is for all of us who knew him to lose him so suddenly, \nhe would want us to be focused on the future.\n  David did this and much more for Colorado and our country, and I just \nwant to close with this. We have lost a unique man and a towering \nColorado figure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4640-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOEL MURRAY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a young man \nwho is now one of our Nation's finest Olympians.\n  Joel Murray of West Monroe, LA, was recently invited to represent the \nUnited States of America at the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer \nGames in Athens, Greece. Joel is an eight time Louisiana State golf \nchampion and a two time national gold medalist, and this year was the \nfirst time in his 13 years competing in the Special Olympics that he \nwas invited to compete in the World Summer Games.\n  As a result of his dedication and commitment to the game he loves, \nJoel competed in Level V Stroke Play, the highest and most challenging \nlevel, and won a silver medal.\n  Joel is also a 2011 Louisiana Special Olympics gold medalist, was \nrecognized as the Louisiana Special Olympics male athlete of the year \nand was inducted into the Louisiana Special Olympics Hall of Fame.\n  If his list of accolades wasn't long enough, in 2009, Joel set a 54-\nhole tournament record for the Special Olympics Golf National \nInvitational Tournament. And away from golf, Joel devotes his time to \ncounseling young adults with disabilities at the Louisiana Youth \nLeadership Forum.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to honor Joel Murray and applaud him on his \nremarkable accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4640-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4640-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4640-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2354.

A bill to complete construction of the 13-State Appalachian \ndevelopment highway system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, 46 years ago, Congress made a promise \nto the thirteen Appalachian Regional Commission member States--New \nYork, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, \nTennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and \nMississippi--to complete the ADHS. The initial Appalachian Regional \nCommission recognized that, while the Interstate Highway System was \nslated to provide historic economic benefits to most of our nation, the \nsystem was designed to bypass the Appalachian Region. The Commission \nfound that the limited access to these regions stifled the economic \nopportunities for countless communities--a problem that can \nunfortunately still be seen all these years later.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Appalachian Development Highway System \nAct of 2011. This legislation will move us toward the completion of the \nADHS and keep that promise. This bill would also allow states that have \nadditional ADHS funds they cannot spend to loan to other states \nthroughout the Appalachian region which have ADHS projects that are the \nclosest to commencing construction. Such a provision will mean that \nfunds are spent in the most efficient and streamlined manner possible.\n  West Virginia represents a microcosm of the transportation successes \nand difficulties throughout the country. While our state faces \nchallenges, they aren't unique to West Virginia. Communities throughout \nAppalachia are also tackling these same difficulties.\n  Since I was Governor, I have known how important ADHS funding is to \nthe economy of West Virginia. The completion of corridor G in the \nsouthern part of the state has become a critical link between \nPikeville, Kentucky and Charleston, WV much like Corridor D has in the \nnorthern part of the state between Bridgeport and Cincinnati, OH. \nToday, West Virginia has one more ADHS project left to complete, \nCorridor H. This four line highway between Weston and the Virginia \nState Line has approximately 58 miles left to construct until it will \nbe finished.\n  An effective transportation infrastructure encourages competition, \npromotes our national security, and creates economic growth. It is also \nimperative for building our communities by helping bring in businesses, \ncreating jobs, building the economies in our states and cities, and \nincreasing tourism.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, my Committee has jurisdiction over a wide variety of \nissues. My Committee oversees the safety of our nation's highways, \nskies, pipelines, waterways, and railroads and it sets the tone of the \ndebate when transportation issues come up in the Senate. I am working \non a number of fronts to transform our transportation network.\n  There is still much of the same isolation and lack of infrastructure \nin parts of Appalachia today as when the ADHS was envisioned. The \nFederal Government has a responsibility to keep the promise it made \ndecades ago to the people of Appalachia. Besides the essential need for \nroads, there is also a critical need for the types of jobs and economic \nstimulus that highway dollars will bring to these underserved areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4643-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4643-S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 25--WELCOMING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE \n REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN, CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH SUDAN FOR \nFREELY AND PEACEFULLY EXPRESSING THEIR WILL THROUGH AN INTERNATIONALLY \nACCEPTED REFERENDUM, AND CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE OF SUDAN \nAND SOUTH SUDAN TO PEACEFULLY RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES INCLUDING THE \n                         FINAL STATUS OF ABYEI\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. \nLevin) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas the United States was a witness to the 2005 \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which marked the end of \n     more than 2 decades of civil war between North and South \n     Sudan that resulted in the deaths of more than 2,000,000 \n     people;\n       Whereas the CPA provided the framework for the historic \n     referendum held between January 9, 2011, and January 15, \n     2011, in which the people of South Sudan voted overwhelmingly \n     in favor of independence;\n       Whereas the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), as \n     established by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1590 on March 24, 2005, was instrumental in supporting the \n     implementation of the CPA;\n       Whereas the mandate for the United Nations Mission in Sudan \n     (UNMIS) expired on July 9, 2011, with the completion of the \n     CPA Interim Period;\n       Whereas the mandate for the United Nations Mission in South \n     Sudan (UNMISS), as established by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1996 (2011), commenced on July 9, 2011;\n       Whereas, on February 7, 2011, the Southern Sudan Referendum \n     Commission announced that the people of South Sudan voted in \n     favor of succession by a margin of 98.8 percent, and \n     President Bashir, on behalf of the Government of Sudan, \n     accepted the results of the referendum;\n       Whereas the African Union, the Arab League, the United \n     Nations Secretary-General's Panel on the Referenda in Sudan, \n     Sudanese Network for Democratic Elections (SuNDE), Sudanese \n     Group for Democracy and Elections (SuGDE), and the Carter \n     Center were among those to report that voting in the \n     referendum was credible and transparent, allowing the people \n     of South Sudan to freely express their desire for \n     independence;\n       Whereas several outstanding issues and potential points of \n     conflict remain unresolved between the Government of Sudan \n     and the Government of South Sudan, including the final status \n     of the contested area of Abyei, disputed border areas, \n     popular consultations, citizenship rights and nationality, \n     division of oil resources and profits, currency, \n     international debt and assets, and other matters;\n       Whereas the CPA parties signed an agreement on June 20, \n     2011, on temporary administrative and security arrangements \n     for Abyei, including the establishment of a United Nations \n     Interim Security Force for Abyei and the redeployment of all \n     military forces of the Government of Sudan from the area;\n       Whereas fighting in Southern Kordofan over the past month \n     has resulted in deaths and injuries to civilians, the \n     displacement of thousands of residents, and restricted access \n     for humanitarian workers despite the framework agreement for \n     Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states signed by the \n     Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement-\n     North on June 28, 2011;\n       Whereas the needs for security, development, and democracy-\n     building are great throughout Sudan and South Sudan, and the \n     United States and the international community have invested \n     significant resources in order to provide assistance to the \n     people of both countries;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 refugees and internally \n     displaced persons from Sudan and South Sudan continue to be \n     displaced from their homes;\n       Whereas lasting peace and stability for all of Sudan cannot \n     be realized until a comprehensive peace in Darfur is secured \n     and an appropriate mechanism for accountability and justice \n     is established for those responsible for atrocities and \n     crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the United States has a compelling national \n     interest in the security, stability, and development of Sudan \n     and South Sudan in order to prevent conflict, humanitarian \n     crises, and the establishment of safe havens for terrorists;\n       Whereas Sudan was the first country to formally recognize \n     the Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011; and\n       Whereas the United States Government formally recognized \n     the Republic of South Sudan as a sovereign and independent \n     state on July 9, 2011: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\n       (1) welcomes the independence of the Republic of South \n     Sudan and recognizes South Sudan as the newest member of the \n     international community;\n       (2) congratulates the people of South Sudan for freely and \n     peacefully expressing their desire for independence through \n     an internationally accepted referendum, and notes the \n     Government of Sudan's recognition of the results of the \n     referendum and South Sudan's independence;\n       (3) commends the people and leaders of South Sudan on their \n     efforts to reach this historic milestone as well as the \n     members of the international community that assisted them, \n     including the United States, the European Union and its \n     member states, Norway, the United Nations, the African Union \n     and the AU High-Level Implementation Panel, the Arab League, \n     the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, neighboring \n     countries, and others;\n       (4) calls on the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     continue high level engagement to resolve outstanding matters \n     relating to the final status of Abyei, disputed border areas, \n     the completion of popular consultations, citizenship and \n     nationality, division of oil resources and profits, currency, \n     international debt and assets, and other matters in order to \n     ensure a smooth transition to two states and to mitigate \n     points of conflict;\n       (5) calls on all sides to fully implement their June 20, \n     2011, agreement on temporary arrangements for the contested \n     Abyei area and swiftly establish a cessation of hostilities \n     in Southern Kordofan to facilitate the delivery and resupply \n     of humanitarian assistance;\n       (6) welcomes the deployment of up to 4,200 Ethiopian \n     peacekeepers to Abyei and the new United Nations Mission in \n     South Sudan (UNMISS) to provide security and stability in \n     Sudan;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Sudan to allow for continued \n     United Nations peacekeeping operations in Southern Kordofan \n     and Blue Nile states to support new security arrangements and \n     the delivery of humanitarian assistance;\n       (8) calls on the United States Government and international \n     community, in coordination with the Governments of Sudan and \n     South Sudan, to support peace, rule of law, security, and \n     good governance in Sudan and South Sudan in order to--\n       (A) promote security and stability in both countries, \n     especially in critical areas such as Darfur, Blue Nile, and \n     Southern Kordofan and in Abyei;\n       (B) promote the human and civil rights of all--including \n     southerners living in Sudan and northerners living in South \n     Sudan--through laws and regulations fully respected by both \n     governments;\n       (C) encourage the Government of South Sudan to engage \n     opposition parties to foster open political space and vibrant \n     democratic institutions;\n       (D) encourage the Government of Sudan to facilitate the \n     development of multiple political parties with freedom of \n     speech and association;\n       (E) provide technical assistance and expertise to the \n     Government of South Sudan;\n       (F) promote access to humanitarian and development aid for \n     the people of Sudan and South Sudan, with a focus on the \n     critical areas of education, health care, and infrastructure, \n     and paying particular attention to historically marginalized \n     areas, including Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile \n     states, and Eastern Sudan;\n       (G) encourage the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     prevent terrorist groups from using their territories and to \n     continue to cooperate with the United States on \n     counterterrorism priorities; and\n       (H) encourage the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     continue to work together in a productive relationship that \n     recognizes the mutual need for cooperation and an open flow \n     of people and goods across borders and to refrain from the \n     use of proxy forces to foment conflict;\n       (9) urges that the Darfur peace process remain a priority \n     in United States relations with the Government of Sudan and \n     receives appropriate attention and resources, including--\n       (A) continued high level engagement to secure a just and \n     lasting peace in Darfur;\n       (B) a commitment to ensuring humanitarian access to \n     vulnerable populations; and\n       (C) sustained support for the African Union-United Nations \n     Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and its mandate to protect \n     civilians and move freely without seeking permission from the \n     armed forces of the Government of Sudan; and\n       (10) welcomes the anticipated nomination of a United States \n     ambassador to the Republic of South Sudan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4644-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 559.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 25\n\n       Whereas the United States was a witness to the 2005 \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which marked the end of \n     more than 2 decades of civil war between North and South \n     Sudan that resulted in the deaths of more than 2,000,000 \n     people;\n       Whereas the CPA provided the framework for the historic \n     referendum held between January 9, 2011, and January 15, \n     2011, in\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n     which the people of South Sudan voted overwhelmingly in favor \n     of independence;\n       Whereas the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), as \n     established by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1590 on March 24, 2005, was instrumental in supporting the \n     implementation of the CPA;\n       Whereas the mandate for the United Nations Mission in Sudan \n     (UNMIS) expired on July 9, 2011, with the completion of the \n     CPA Interim Period;\n       Whereas the mandate for the United Nations Mission in South \n     Sudan (UNMISS), as established by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1996 (2011), commenced on July 9, 2011;\n       Whereas, on February 7, 2011, the Southern Sudan Referendum \n     Commission announced that the people of South Sudan voted in \n     favor of succession by a margin of 98.8 percent, and \n     President Bashir, on behalf of the Government of Sudan, \n     accepted the results of the referendum;\n       Whereas the African Union, the Arab League, the United \n     Nations Secretary-General's Panel on the Referenda in Sudan, \n     Sudanese Network for Democratic Elections (SuNDE), Sudanese \n     Group for Democracy and Elections (SuGDE), and the Carter \n     Center were among those to report that voting in the \n     referendum was credible and transparent, allowing the people \n     of South Sudan to freely express their desire for \n     independence;\n       Whereas several outstanding issues and potential points of \n     conflict remain unresolved between the Government of Sudan \n     and the Government of South Sudan, including the final status \n     of the contested area of Abyei, disputed border areas, \n     popular consultations, citizenship rights and nationality, \n     division of oil resources and profits, currency, \n     international debt and assets, and other matters;\n       Whereas the CPA parties signed an agreement on June 20, \n     2011, on temporary administrative and security arrangements \n     for Abyei, including the establishment of a United Nations \n     Interim Security Force for Abyei and the redeployment of all \n     military forces of the Government of Sudan from the area;\n       Whereas fighting in Southern Kordofan over the past month \n     has resulted in deaths and injuries to civilians, the \n     displacement of thousands of residents, and restricted access \n     for humanitarian workers despite the framework agreement for \n     Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states signed by the \n     Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement-\n     North on June 28, 2011;\n       Whereas the needs for security, development, and democracy-\n     building are great throughout Sudan and South Sudan, and the \n     United States and the international community have invested \n     significant resources in order to provide assistance to the \n     people of both countries;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 refugees and internally \n     displaced persons from Sudan and South Sudan continue to be \n     displaced from their homes;\n       Whereas lasting peace and stability for all of Sudan cannot \n     be realized until a comprehensive peace in Darfur is secured \n     and an appropriate mechanism for accountability and justice \n     is established for those responsible for atrocities and \n     crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the United States has a compelling national \n     interest in the security, stability, and development of Sudan \n     and South Sudan in order to prevent conflict, humanitarian \n     crises, and the establishment of safe havens for terrorists;\n       Whereas Sudan was the first country to formally recognize \n     the Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011; and\n       Whereas the United States Government formally recognized \n     the Republic of South Sudan as a sovereign and independent \n     state on July 9, 2011: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the independence of the Republic of South \n     Sudan and recognizes South Sudan as the newest member of the \n     international community;\n       (2) congratulates the people of South Sudan for freely and \n     peacefully expressing their desire for independence through \n     an internationally accepted referendum, and notes the \n     Government of Sudan's recognition of the results of the \n     referendum and South Sudan's independence;\n       (3) commends the people and leaders of South Sudan on their \n     efforts to reach this historic milestone as well as the \n     members of the international community that assisted them, \n     including the United States, the European Union and its \n     member states, Norway, the United Nations, the African Union \n     and the AU High-Level Implementation Panel, the Arab League, \n     the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, neighboring \n     countries, and others;\n       (4) calls on the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     continue high level engagement to resolve outstanding matters \n     relating to the final status of Abyei, disputed border areas, \n     the completion of popular consultations, citizenship and \n     nationality, division of oil resources and profits, currency, \n     international debt and assets, and other matters in order to \n     ensure a smooth transition to two states and to mitigate \n     points of conflict;\n       (5) calls on all sides to fully implement their June 20, \n     2011, agreement on temporary arrangements for the contested \n     Abyei area and swiftly establish a cessation of hostilities \n     in Southern Kordofan to facilitate the delivery and resupply \n     of humanitarian assistance;\n       (6) welcomes the deployment of up to 4,200 Ethiopian \n     peacekeepers to Abyei and the new United Nations Mission in \n     South Sudan (UNMISS) to provide security and stability in \n     Sudan;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Sudan to allow for continued \n     United Nations peacekeeping operations in Southern Kordofan \n     and Blue Nile states to support new security arrangements and \n     the delivery of humanitarian assistance;\n       (8) calls on the United States Government and international \n     community, in coordination with the Governments of Sudan and \n     South Sudan, to support peace, rule of law, security, and \n     good governance in Sudan and South Sudan in order to--\n       (A) promote security and stability in both countries, \n     especially in critical areas such as Darfur, Blue Nile, and \n     Southern Kordofan and in Abyei;\n       (B) promote the human and civil rights of all--including \n     southerners living in Sudan and northerners living in South \n     Sudan--through laws and regulations fully respected by both \n     governments;\n       (C) encourage the Government of South Sudan to engage \n     opposition parties to foster open political space and vibrant \n     democratic institutions;\n       (D) encourage the Government of Sudan to facilitate the \n     development of multiple political parties with freedom of \n     speech and association;\n       (E) provide technical assistance and expertise to the \n     Government of South Sudan;\n       (F) promote access to humanitarian and development aid for \n     the people of Sudan and South Sudan, with a focus on the \n     critical areas of education, health care, and infrastructure, \n     and paying particular attention to historically marginalized \n     areas, including Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile \n     states, and Eastern Sudan;\n       (G) encourage the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     prevent terrorist groups from using their territories and to \n     continue to cooperate with the United States on \n     counterterrorism priorities; and\n       (H) encourage the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     continue to work together in a productive relationship that \n     recognizes the mutual need for cooperation and an open flow \n     of people and goods across borders and to refrain from the \n     use of proxy forces to foment conflict;\n       (9) urges that the Darfur peace process remain a priority \n     in United States relations with the Government of Sudan and \n     receives appropriate attention and resources, including--\n       (A) continued high level engagement to secure a just and \n     lasting peace in Darfur;\n       (B) a commitment to ensuring humanitarian access to \n     vulnerable populations; and\n       (C) sustained support for the African Union-United Nations \n     Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and its mandate to protect \n     civilians and move freely without seeking permission from the \n     armed forces of the Government of Sudan; and\n       (10) welcomes the anticipated nomination of a United States \n     ambassador to the Republic of South Sudan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/18/senate-section/article/S4645-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 19, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
