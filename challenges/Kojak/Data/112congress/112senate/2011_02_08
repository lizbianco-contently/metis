Madam President, I had a conversation last night with the \nRepublican leader. For all Senators, we need to have amendments on this \nbill, the FAA bill, laid down. We all know there is a lot of feigning \ngoing on around here, a little posturing. We still have one issue left \nthat deals with slots at airports. It is not going to be resolved. We \nhave worked on this for years, and it will not be resolved except on \nthe Senate floor. If it is not resolved and we do not have amendments \nlaid down, taken care of, I will file cloture on this bill on Monday.\n  It is a shame. I wish I could blame the Republicans for the impasse, \nbut it is both parties. We have people on both sides of the aisle who \nare trying to take advantage, as they see it, on this slot issue. This \nis an extremely important piece of legislation. I know the slots to \nindividual Senators is important. But it is not important enough to \nhold up this bill. We have been trying for years--years--to get this \nbill passed. This will create or save 280,000 jobs. It will improve the \nsafety of our air travels. It will give rights to people who are flying \nwho do not have those rights. We have a passengers' bill of rights. It \nis a shame this one issue is holding up this bill.\n  I repeat, if we do not have this matter resolved Monday, I am filing \ncloture on this bill. We have to complete this legislation. Before we \nleave for our President's Day recess to go back to work in our States, \nwe also have the FISA legislation that is a must. It expires. We have \nto take care of that before we leave. Of course, we have many other \nissues, but those are the two I am concerned about today. We have to \npass the FAA bill, and we have to take care of the FISA legislation \nagain.\n  So I would hope everyone understands that we are not going to be \nplaying around with this slot issue for another year. This bill has to \npass, and there is one way we can solve it: people offer their \namendments, and we will vote on them right down here in the well.\n  I heard yesterday there are meetings going on to try to resolve this \nissue. These meetings have been going on for months and months and \nmonths, and they have held up this legislation. That is unfair. So I \ntell everyone, we have to move forward on this legislation, and if we \ndo not have this issue worked out by Monday I am going to file cloture \non this bill. It is a shame.\n  I repeat, this is a bipartisan bill. This is not something that \nRepublicans are trying to hold up or Democrats are trying to jam \nthrough. This is a bill that Democrats and Republicans believe is for \nthe best interests of our country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as the debate over spending gears up \nahead of the President's budget next week, I thought it important that \nwe just step back this morning and note one thing: and that is the fact \nthat this debate has completely changed. Two years ago, the President \nand Democrats running Congress were not debating whether to cut \nspending. They were debating how much to spend.\n  You will recall that a lot of them were disappointed that the \nstimulus wasn't bigger than it ended up being. Some still are.\n  So we have seen a welcome shift. Today, the only debate is how much \nto cut. It is a debate that Republicans and, I think, the vast majority \nof Americans, are happy to have.\n  And it is in that context that I wanted to mention the President's \npledge to freeze his already outrageous spending levels for the next 5 \nyears, and some troubling estimates we got yesterday about what that \nwould mean for the deficit from the people whose job it is to analyze \nspending and debt here in Washington.\n  In their monthly budget review, the Congressional Budget Office said \nthat if the current spending levels are frozen at the same level as \nthey are now, and Congress were to enact no other legislation affecting \nspending or revenues, the Federal Government would end this fiscal year \nwith a deficit of $1.5 trillion, or about $200 billion more than the \ndeficit Democrats ran last year.\n  In other words, even if we do not add another dime to the current \nspending levels, the deficit will get even worse than last year. That \nis what would happen under the President's best offer, which is to lock \nin the dramatically higher spending levels from the past 2 years and \nput the budget on cruise control. The deficit would not stand still, it \nwill grow by $200 billion, over the next several months.\n  So yesterday's predictions by the CBO should be a wake up call to \nanyone who thinks they can hide behind a spending freeze. This is a \ndire warning that business as usual is a recipe for disaster. If we do \nnot immediately reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government, \nthe deficit will be even bigger than last year's record deficit.\n  So we have to get real. We need to listen to our constituents. \nFreezes are not going to cut it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/08/senate-section/article/S622-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

DONA ANA COUNTY AIRPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 23 of the Airport \n     and Airway Development Act of 1970 (as in effect on August 4, \n     1982), or sections 47125 and 27153 of title 49, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of Transportation may, subject to \n     subsection (b), grant releases from any of the terms, \n     conditions, reservations, and restrictions contained in the \n     deed of conveyance numbered 30-82-0048 and dated August 4, \n     1982, under which the United States conveyed certain land to \n     Dona Ana County, New Mexico, for airport purposes.\n       (b) Conditions.--Any release granted by the Secretary under \n     subsection (a) shall be subject to the following conditions:\n       (1) The County shall agree that in conveying any interest \n     in the land that the United States conveyed to the County by \n     the deed described in subsection (a), the County shall \n     receive an amount for the interest that is equal to the fair \n     market value.\n       (2) Any amount received by the County for the conveyance \n     shall be used by the County for the development, improvement, \n     operation, or maintenance of the airport.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, this amendment is simple. \nIt provides for a no-cost, fair-value land exchange between Dona Ana \nCounty in southern New Mexico and the adjacent property owners.\n  The Dona Ana County airport in Santa Teresa is a key component for \neconomic growth in the region.\n  Unfortunately, when the land patent was granted to the county in \n1982, it was described in aliquot parts. This created several triangles \nof land that have been difficult to improve because they meet at their \ncorners an do not share common boundaries.\n  The county has requested the land exchange so that they may create a \nsecondary access to the airport for general aviation. This new access \nwould separate general vehicle traffic from taxiing aircraft.\n  The land exchange will also provide an alternate entry to the \nairport's fuel farm. And it will allow the county to expand airport \ncapabilities to meet the needs of this growing community.\n  This region of New Mexico is growing and the airport needs to be able \nto expand to meet increased demand.\n  This land exchange will help achieve that goal and will improve the \neconomic opportunities in this region. I hope my colleagues will concur \nthat this amendment should be agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 51\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment so that I may call up amendment No. 51, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that all advanced imaging technology used as a \n  primary screening method for passengers be equipped with automatic \n                      target recognition software)\n\n       On page 311, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 733. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR AIRCRAFT PASSENGER \n                   SCREENING WITH ADVANCED IMAGING TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 44901 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(l) Limitations on Use of Advanced Imaging Technology for \n     Screening Passengers.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary of Homeland \n     Security (Transportation Security Administration) shall \n     ensure that advanced imaging technology is used for the \n     screening of passengers under this section only in accordance \n     with this subsection.\n       ``(2) Implementation of automated target recognition \n     software.--Beginning January 1, 2012, all advanced imaging \n     technology used as a primary screening method for passengers \n     shall be equipped with automatic target recognition software.\n       ``(3) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Advanced imaging technology.--The term `advanced \n     imaging technology'--\n       ``(i) means a device that creates a visual image of an \n     individual's body and reveals other objects on the body as \n     applicable, including narcotics, explosives, and other \n     weapons components; and\n       ``(ii) includes devices using backscatter x-rays or \n     millimeter waves and devices referred to as `whole-body \n     imaging technology' or `body scanning'.\n       ``(B) Automatic target recognition software.--The term \n     `automatic target recognition software' means software \n     installed on an advanced imaging technology machine that \n     produces a generic image of the individual being screened \n     that is the same as the images produced for all other \n     screened individuals.\n       ``(C) Primary screening.--The term `primary screening' \n     means the initial examination of any passenger at an airport \n     checkpoint, including using available screening technologies \n     to detect weapons, explosives, narcotics, or other \n     indications of unlawful action, in order to determine whether \n     to clear the passenger to board an aircraft or to further \n     examine the passenger.''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2012, the \n     Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation \n     Security Administration) shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report on the implementation of \n     section 44901(l) of title 49, United States Code, as added by \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A description of all matters the Assistant Secretary \n     considers relevant to the implementation of such section.\n       (B) The status of the compliance of the Transportation \n     Security Administration with the provisions of such section.\n       (C) If the Administration is not in full compliance with \n     such provisions--\n       (i) the reasons for such non-compliance; and\n       (ii) a timeline depicting when the Assistant Secretary \n     expects the Administration to achieve full compliance.\n       (3) Security classification.--The report required by \n     paragraph (1) shall be submitted, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, in an unclassified format, with a classified \n     annex, if necessary.\n       (4) Appropriate congressional committees defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     and Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, this amendment would \nsignificantly improve the privacy protections for passengers being \nscreened by TSA whole body scanners, also referred to as advanced, \nimagining technology, or AIT.\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\n  In 2010, the TSA greatly expanded the use of AIT machines at airport \ncheckpoints around the United States.\n  The image produced by an AIT machine is highly revealing and many \npassengers are uncomfortable being screened by the technology. \nUnfortunately, TSA's policy for passengers who refuse AIT screening is \nto conduct a full pat-down, hardly an ideal alternative for someone \nwith privacy concerns.\n  There is a promising option to address the ongoing privacy concerns \nwith AIT. New software, called automatic target recognition, can be \ninstalled on existing AIT machines to enhance privacy by eliminating \npassenger-specific images and instead detecting potential threat items \nand indicating their location on a generic outline of a person.\n  This month, TSA will begin testing the new software at Las Vegas \nMcCarran International Airport, Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta \nInternational, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n  Senate amendment No. 51 would require TSA to have automatic target \nrecognition software installed on all AIT machines by January 1, 2012. \nThis will provide ample time for TSA to thoroughly field test the \nsoftware and work with the manufacturers to make necessary adjustments.\n  However, by imposing a deadline, it will ensure that TSA and the \nmanufacturers make the implementation of the software a priority and \nwill eliminate the potential for unnecessary delay.\n  This is an issue that has received bi-partisan attention and I hope \nthat this amendment will receive strong support from both sides of the \naisle.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my chairman and ranking member for \ntheir hard work on the underlying bill.\n  It is an honor to serve with them and I look forward to working \ntogether on the many important issues before the committee.\n  Just to conclude, I thank our chairman of the Commerce Committee, Jay \nRockefeller. I think both Chairman Rockefeller and ranking member Kay \nBailey Hutchison have done an excellent job on this FAA authorization \nbill. I do not have any doubt that they, working in the committee, have \npulled us all together. It is a remarkable bill because it is a job-\ncreating bill. It is a bill that we need right now with the economic \nslowdown we have in America.\n  The other aspect of this bill that I think is very important is \nupdating the air traffic control system. That is something that is \nterribly important. It is called NextGen. We are moving on to the next \ngeneration of air traffic control. I think it is important to remind \npeople that we are behind the country of Mongolia when it comes to air \ntraffic control. So it is very important that we get this bill passed.\n  I agree with Leader Reid when he said we cannot be on this forever. \nWe need to move it along. I look forward to helping with that process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I want to reiterate something the \nleader has said and what the Senator from New Mexico said; that is, the \nvast importance of this bill. I have said many times on this floor \nthere are 11 million people who work for the aviation industry. That is \nonly the direct jobs. There are probably 2 or 3 million indirect jobs. \nIt is one of the major parts of our economy.\n  Here we stand, after 17 delays sort of kicking it down the road for 3 \nmonths, completely messing up FAA's ability to work with runways or \nmake improvements. We cannot fiddle around with runways. If something \ngoes wrong, they have to be fixed or people die. So the stakes are \nenormous. This business of slots has become a decision people will have \nto make. Do they want to see a bill which fails, which goes down, and \nwe go into our 18th or 19th, whatever it is--I have stopped counting--\nor do they want to see something which is major to the American \neconomy, major in terms of NASA research, in terms of air traffic \ncontrol systems and which is major in terms of a passenger bill of \nrights. We have a lot of people stuck. I drove back from Clarksburg, \nWV, to Washington on Saturday. The reason I drove back is I was so sick \nof that airline that comes out of Clarksburg getting canceled or having \nmechanical problems, which means they probably didn't have enough \npassengers because we are a small State. We often don't have enough \npassengers to meet the bottom line. I drove back. It was 6\\1/2\\ hours. \nThat was fine. I am prepared to do that. I hate doing that because it \nis a waste of my time. But the stakes are here.\n\n  This is huge, this bill. We have one good amendment, which we will do \nthis morning when Senator Nelson of Florida comes down, and then I \nthink we have to proceed. I appreciate the majority leader being quite \ntough about all this and saying he is going to lay down cloture. He \ndoesn't want to fool around with this bill. There is only one part of \nthis bill which is in any way contentious. That is slots. That has much \nmore to do with campaign commitments than with the good of the Nation.\n  Nobody gets everything they want. In West Virginia we get almost \nnothing. I don't complain. I understand we are at the end of the food \nchain because we are a little State. Whenever there is a recession or \nairlines aren't doing very well financially because of fuel prices, we \nget cut off. My view about that is sort of more bitter but more maybe \nwidespread and trying to look at the public good in general. As the \ntide rises, all the boats rise.\n  I strongly plead with Senators to consider the broader national \ninterest and air traffic control system, which is digitalized GPS and \nwhich is three or four times more safe. I know whenever there is a near \nmiss in the airways, when somebody has not calculated the distance \ncorrectly, either the pilot or the air traffic controller, I know about \nthose things. They happen very frequently. There were several in the \npapers last week. We are playing with life and death. We are playing \nwith the major exporter, by far the major exporter the United States \nhas to other countries in terms of products and goods. Yet people sort \nof want to have just what they want to have because that is what they \nsaid last year, and they can't back off because, if they did, they \nwould look weak or they are trying to protect a certain airline.\n  This, to me, is not about airlines. It is about passengers. The heck \nwith airlines. We need to have more passengers going west because the \nWest is growing faster than the East. They are underserved. There is \none flight a day from DC to Los Angeles. That doesn't make any sense. \nAll these things can be cured if people will be reasonable and not try \nto win out over some other group, some other constituency. My \nconstituency is the national interest in this bill.\n  I don't mean to sound prudish, but I so say and believe very deeply.\n  If it is all right with the Presiding Officer, I will yield the floor \nto Senator Ben Nelson. He will make his amendment pending and then \ndebate on the Nelson of Florida amendment will start at about 10:20.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 58\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I call up the amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Tester, Mr. Whitehouse, \n     and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 58.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Unauthorized recording and distribution of security screening \n    images..................................................2731''.....\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, the amendment Senators \nSchumer, Akaka, Shaheen, Tester, Whitehouse, Menendez, and I have \noffered is a commonsense approach to address the serious issue of \nprotecting individuals' privacy when they pass through security \ncheckpoints at both airports and public buildings. Senator Schumer and \nI have been working on this issue for some time, and I appreciate very \nmuch his input and counsel in taking this approach. I appreciate the \nsupport of the additional sponsors as well as the Presiding Officer, \nwho is one of those sponsors.\n  By creating a deterrent and establishing criminal penalties for those \nwho take and distribute body scan images inappropriately, we will help \nprotect the American people's privacy while making sure we are using \nevery resource available to try and assure their safety at the same \ntime.\n  This is not an abstract concern. There has already been a case where \nthese images, some 30,000, have been taken and posted, some of them, \nonline inappropriately. It is our hope this amendment will help prevent \nthat from occurring again.\n  By including this amendment in the FAA reauthorization, we are \ntelling our constituents we will not ignore their privacy in the \nprocess of making sure we have safe airports and Federal buildings. \nThat is what they are asking of us. That is what we are going to \ndeliver. I ask my colleagues to support our amendment when it comes up \nfor a rollcall vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 34\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, between the Senator \nfrom Florida and the Senator from Texas or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, while Senators are getting ready to \nspeak, we have made good progress on the bill. Amendments are now \ncoming in. Cloture is going to be filed Monday, so we need to have all \nthe relevant amendments in by then.\n  I support the Nelson of Florida amendment on which we will vote at \n10:30. We agreed last year, in a preconference meeting, that the \namendment he has to drop language from the bill would be dropped. I \nsupport the amendment. The NASA Reauthorization Act has intervened, and \nthat is the law of the land. It was passed unanimously by the Senate. I \nbelieve the Nelson of Florida amendment is a good one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I yield time to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise in support of the Nelson \namendment. The amendment would strike section 605, as Senator Hutchison \nsaid, from the FAA bill. Section 605 would establish an advisory \ncommittee on the future of aeronautics to, among other things, consider \ntransferring responsibility for civil aeronautics research and \ndevelopment from NASA to other existing departments. The sole purpose \nis to take away aeronautics from NASA. That is unacceptable. It belies \nthe very purpose of NASA in our space and aeronautics mission. NASA \nstands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. His \namendment ensures that NASA stays that way. This is a question of \nmaintaining our space, aeronautics, and economic competitiveness.\n  Remember, one of our Nation's top manufacturing exports--and we don't \nexport nearly enough manufactured goods--is aerospace, which includes \ncivilian aircraft components. Ohio is the center for the aerospace \nindustry. We make billions of dollars in components both for Boeing and \nAirbus and many other manufacturers. Section 605 would jeopardize \nAmerica's dominance in aerospace and would shift the programs that have \nstrengthened our Nation's global leadership away from the experience \nand expertise at NASA. A consortium of nonprofits and colleges and \nprivate corporations and other government agencies can be effective and \nhave been effective to promote public-private partnerships and economic \ndevelopment. But none of these entities, either by themselves or even \nworking together, will ever be able to conduct aerospace and \naeronautics research and development better than NASA. Its fundamental \naeronautics research capability is already fully integrated. It ensures \nthe future success of NASA space missions.\n  Furthermore, section 605 is in direct contradiction to the NASA \nAuthorization Act of 2010, which reaffirmed that aeronautics research \nremains vital to NASA's mission and deserves continued support. Simply \nput, section 605 jeopardizes not only the future of NASA but America's \ndominance in the global aerospace marketplace.\n  NASA centers across the country are unique in their ability to \nleverage space and aviation systems through their experienced technical \nresearchers. These NASA centers in Cleveland and nine other places \naround the country are stewards and operators of the Nation's civil \naeronautics R test infrastructure.\n  I applaud Senator Nelson of Florida for offering this amendment and \nhis leadership on the Science and Space Committee.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Hutchison and me in supporting \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I yield to Senator Paul to allow him \nto offer an amendment into the pending amendments so we will have that \ndone before cloture is filed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 18\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment 18.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 18.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provisions relating to clarifying a memorandum \n of understanding between the Federal Aviation Administration and the \n             Occupational Safety and Health Administration)\n\n       Strike section 509.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the amendment I am offering is to continue \nto have the airlines exempt from OSHA. This isn't because I am not \nconcerned with safety. It is that we have been doing it this way for 30 \nor 40 years. The FAA voluntarily adheres to OSHA standards in their own \nmanual. I take the President and the opposing party at their word that \nthey are concerned with adding frivolous paperwork and frivolous \nregulations when, in reality, we are not doing anything to add to \nsafety since the FAA is already adhering to these standards through \ntheir own manual. I also suspect that the FAA may be a little bit \nbetter in learning to have their own safety manuals and regulations \nthan would OSHA since they specifically have been involved in this.\n  We would like to ask Members to vote against allowing OSHA to become \ninvolved in the FAA.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 34\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, do I need to set aside the \npending amendment to call up amendment 34?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending, under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, others have already spoken on \nthis amendment. It is to take out unnecessary language in the bill that \nhas been superseded by the NASA authorization bill we have passed. The \nletters in NASA, the first A is aeronautics, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. Aeronautics research is a big part of the \nNASA bill. We have plussed up a lot of money for aeronautics research. \nThere is superfluous language in the bill about a study. Other studies \nhave already been done. We want to get rid of that redtape.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, we yield back any remaining time on \nour side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nNelson amendment No. 34.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Honoring the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the hard work and \ndedication of our men and women in the U.S. Army and all branches of \nservice.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the \nuncasing ceremony at Fort Riley, KS. It was an honor. For those who \nhave not attended an uncasing ceremony, it symbolizes a homecoming, and \ncertainly that was the case at Fort Riley. It signifies the presence of \nthe command and resumption of that command's authority. It offers a \ntime to reflect on the heroic efforts and the leadership of the men and \nwomen of the Big First.\n  Since returning to Kansas in 2006, the 1st Infantry Division's \nheadquarters deployed to Iraq. But this was not the first time the \ndivision has uncased its colors at Fort Riley. In fact, it was the \nfifth time in 55 years.\n  During their time in Basra, Iraq, the men and women of the Big Red \nOne assisted in completing many vital projects.\n  Approximately 850 soldiers deployed from Fort Riley in February of \nlast year. The division's efforts were supported by other services and \nalso government agencies. The mission was more offensive than \ndefensive--a change for the men and women of the Big Red One.\n  To quote Fort Riley's outstanding commanding general, MG Vincent \nBrooks:\n\n       The Big Red One as U.S. Division-South was a trusted \n     partner to the Iraqi Security Forces, to 9 U.S. Provincial \n     reconstruction teams led by the U.S. Department of State, \n     with participants from other agencies of the U.S. Government, \n     and to other U.S. forces in Iraq, the Big Red One ensured \n     that the hard-earned stability emerging in Iraq would never \n     drift away. Their success was our success.\n\n  The accomplishments of the Big Red One are numerous and merit the \nattention of my colleagues.\n  The division assisted Iraqis in completing the Basra Children's \nHospital, a cancer center noted as one of the most modern facilities in \nthe Middle East.\n  I was fortunate to spend time at the ceremony with about 30 soldiers \nin the unit. One noncommissioned officer in particular stood out. I \nasked all of them how many deployments they had made to Iraq or, for \nthat matter, Afghanistan, and the answers were two or three or four. \nBut this one noncommissioned officer had five deployments. I asked him \nwhat on Earth was wrong with the deployment situation in his case. He \nsaid: Oh, no, I wanted to come back to my unit, to the Big Red One; I \nwanted to come back to Iraq and continue the work I thought was so \nimportant. I asked him what the difference was, and he said: Well, when \nI was here first in Iraq, we lost nine in our unit; nine paid the \nultimate sacrifice. But in this deployment, no shots were fired.\n  If there ever was testimony from somebody on the front line, and \nobviously the NCOs run the Army, with due respect to the officers, but \nhe summed it up pretty well: first deployment, nine fatalities; last \ndeployment, no shots fired.\n  I am truly grateful that all of the soldiers deployed from the Big \nRed One's division headquarters returned safe this time around.\n  By the way, General Vincent Brooks, remember that name as I am sure \nyou will hear it again, will soon be receiving his third star and will \nbe reassigned to the Central Command. Anyone who knows General Brooks \nand his wife, Dr. Carole Brooks, is not surprised. This promotion in \nthe new command comes as no surprise to anyone in the area, especially \nthe people who served under General Brooks and have had the privilege \nof knowing him. Simply put, he is an inspirational leader with an \noutstanding record.\n  From the Kansas congressional delegation, General, well done, sir. \nYou will be missed, but our pride in your success, your future success, \nand the job you have done and the job you will do make us all proud. It \nis a pride we all share.\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have General Brooks's comments printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          1ID Colors Uncasing\n\n                       (By MG Brooks, 20 Jan. 10)\n\n       Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I want to first thank \n     the division band, the CG's Mounted Color Guard, Salute \n     Battery outside in the cold air--you both look and sound \n     great. You look and sound great and you make it possible for \n     us to be back.\n       We are joined today by many distinguished guests. Let me \n     first begin by saying thanks to Governor Sam Brownback, \n     Senator Pat Roberts--it seems we cannot have an important \n     ceremony without a major snowstorm--we certainly appreciate \n     you honoring us by taking the journey here to come here under \n     the conditions to be with us today. We're just honored by \n     your presence. Our civilian aide to the Secretary of the \n     Army. Other distinguished local, state and national elected \n     officials or their representatives, all of whom serve as \n     champions for the interests of Fort Riley in their official \n     capacities. Our friends from Kansas State University also who \n     had the opportunity to witness first-hand the great work our \n     soldiers in Iraq and the real opportunity that exists in \n     Iraq--we thank them for being bold enough to make the \n     journey. As I turn and look at this crowd I see many faces of \n     friends. Faces we have come to know not only as neighbors and \n     colleagues, but as dear friends.\n       Thank you all for joining us today as the division \n     headquarters symbolically and ceremonially returns from \n     accomplishing our mission and as we bring to a close another \n     chapter in the history of this great division.\n       This is a fitting occasion--because uncasing the 1st \n     Infantry Division Colors at Fort Riley, after accomplishing a \n     mission overseas has become a well-established practice. For \n     today marks the 5th time in the last 55 years that these \n     Colors--the Colors of America's 1st Division in name and in \n     fact, have been removed from their traveling case and opened \n     at Fort Riley.\n       Just as in 1955, 1970, 1991, and 2006, today in 2011 we \n     again uncase and unfurl these gallant Colors with new history \n     having been added to the Colors since they were last seen \n     here. Truly, Fort Riley is the home of the Big Red One and \n     now that we are back, again, we are truly at home in the \n     heartland. And it's good to be back home.\n       I hope you will indulge me for a few moments to tell you a \n     few highlights of the many accomplishments and achievements \n     that happened through our time of deployment and to thank \n     some people along the way. This is going to be a bit longer \n     than my usual speeches, certainly much longer than the one I \n     gave on the 3rd of January upon our return. I will do my best \n     to highlight some remarkable things that happened in our \n     campaign here as well as our campaign there, overseas. Plus, \n     it's been a while since most of you haven't had a speech from \n     me in a year. So I have to make up for some lost time. So \n     bare with me.\n       Let me begin by saying that the accomplishments on the \n     homefront here at Fort Riley were at least as impressive as \n     those that occurred in southern Iraq. I want to say that \n     something so that everybody is absolutely certain of that \n     great team that you have here.\n       You may recall that in this field house over a year ago the \n     division headquarters and the Victory 5 marched off to do our \n     duty first, leaving a rear command supported by a mostly \n     civilian mission support element and a mostly civilian U.S. \n     Army garrison command.\n       Brigadier General David ``Pete'' Petersen and Command \n     Sergeant Major Darrell ``Buddy'' Wallace took the lead for \n     Fort Riley, standing forth bravely in what is still, in many \n     ways, a journey in uncharted waters. You represented the \n     command exceedingly well and I am very proud of both of you \n     for all you did to shoulder a very, very heavy load with \n     really hard work to do. Thanks to your ladies, Karen and \n     ``Lefty'' also for your grace and patience and support of \n     these two warriors. General Pete, congratulations on your \n     upcoming promotion to Major general and recognition. And \n     Command Sergeant Major Buddy Wallace, congratulations on the \n     culminating role of a great career as you transition into the \n     ``U.S. Army--Retired'' ranks.\n\n     [Applaud]\n\n       Believe me, the rear command would not have succeeded in \n     the extraordinarily tough work that had to be done if there \n     had not been a group of professionals, Army civilians, called \n     the mission support element and led by Mr. Ollie Hunter. They \n     were the surrogate staff--referred to as the ``M staff'' \n     seated on the right behind BG Petersen and CSM Wallace, and \n     they were magnificent.\n       The primary task of generating forces for deployment abroad \n     fell to you--bringing together the modernization of equipment \n     with the arrival of personnel to the individual and \n     collective training that leads to forces ready to be \n     deployed--from four different bases in four different \n     states--in a year when every brigade under the division's \n     responsibility deployed or redeployed, in part or in-toto, in \n     some cases with a short-notice changes of theater and in some \n     cases with a significantly shortened period of training--no \n     matter the circumstances, no matter the curve ball pitched at \n     you--you knocked it out of the park.\n       Nothing was normal about what you were asked to do, nothing \n     was routine, there was no handbook and no standing operating \n     procedure. Yet, you accomplished the mission in true Big Red \n     One style, demonstrating what it means to say no mission too \n     difficult, no sacrifice too great, duty first. Well done. \n     Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a round of applause.\n\n     [Applaud]\n\n       Then, there is the U.S. Army garrison command under the \n     visionary and persistent leadership of Colonel Kevin Brown, \n     Ms. Linda Hoeffner, Command Sergeant Major Ian Mann, and \n     Colonel John Dvoracek all guiding the finest group of \n     professional civilian directors in the entire Army.\n       What you have accomplished here in one year is absolutely \n     amazing--and believe me that is understating the reality.\n       You moved the Fort Riley Campaign plan 2015, initiated last \n     January, into a solid set of accomplishments. The opening of \n     the Army's first warrior transition battalion complex; the \n     expanded community covenants connecting Fort Riley even more \n     to the 22 communities around Fort Riley; the start of the \n     ongoing construction of the Army's newest community hospital; \n     trail blazing resilience initiatives not only for soldiers \n     but for military family members as well--programs that have \n     been recognized as best practices throughout the Army; \n     attracting national level leaders to come to Fort Riley to \n     see the premier division level installation, in the making, \n     and to gain their support for initiatives like military \n     family housing and school expansion; the forward momentum of \n     the Flint Hills Regional Council; and the generation of . . . \n     conservatively . . . over $2.2 billion of revenue for the \n     state of Kansas.\n       These accomplishments, ladies and gentlemen, are figurative \n     ice chips from an iceberg of excellence. I am immensely proud \n     of the Garrison Command, and ladies and gentlemen please join \n     me in applauding their efforts.\n\n     [Applaud]\n\n       I want to take this opportunity also to say thanks to our \n     community leaders, our neighbors, our friends, for your \n     patience through the challenges of the last year, and for \n     your steadfast support not only of the leadership here at \n     Fort Riley but all the efforts I have already highlighted, \n     and also of our deployed soldiers and of our families who \n     stayed behind in the Flint Hills while we were gone.\n       Believe me when I say we truly could not have done what we \n     did without you. You are our reason for doing what we do and \n     we are forever indebted to you and we are joyous to be back \n     with you again.\n       Finally, I want to thank the families of the warriors who \n     were (and I should add: still are) deployed. You carry a \n     burden that cannot be described adequately, compared \n     accurately, or appreciated fully. You are our hope and our \n     inspiration. You are the focus of what we look forward to \n     while we are gone. You are the finest examples of grace and \n     strength. Thank you for who you are and for all you give. It \n     is so good to be back in your embrace.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, bear with me for just a few more \n     moments while I highlight what was accomplished by the \n     soldiers who stand before you and all who served under the \n     colors of the 1st Infantry Division in its role as United \n     States Division--South, responsible for all U.S. operations \n     in the southern half of the country of Iraq, 9 of the 18 \n     provinces--and an area positioned between Iran to the east, \n     Kuwait to the south and Saudi Arabia to the west. An area \n     where ancient human history meets the future of the middle \n     east.\n       Roughly 850 soldiers deployed from Fort Riley to fulfill \n     this headquarters mission which we officially began on the \n     2nd of February 2010 from our headquarters in Basra, the \n     second largest city in Iraq.\n       We commanded units from every part of our Army, and were \n     augmented by Navy, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard and \n     other government agency teammates joined together as a pick-\n     up team that resembled an all-star team.\n       The deployment was fast-paced, high-stakes, more \n     psychological than physical, more offensive than defensive, \n     more indirect than direct.\n       An abbreviated way to describe our greatest accomplishment \n     is to say--the Big Red 1 as U.S. Division--South was a \n     trusted partner to the Iraqi security forces, to 9 U.S. \n     provincial reconstruction teams led by the U.S. Department of \n     State with participants from other agencies of the U.S. \n     Government, and to the other U.S. Forces out there in Iraq, \n     ensuring that the hard-earned stability emerging in Iraq \n     would never drift away. Their success was our success.\n       All we had to do was help Iraq become the sovereign, \n     stable, and self-reliant strategic partner the U.S. has been \n     looking for in the Middle East--all in the face of internal \n     political intrigue and violence, and the ever-present \n     legitimate and illegitimate influences of neighboring \n     countries, especially Iran.\n       Our soldiers faced violence, uncertainty, and danger \n     courageously while also seizing every emerging every \n     opportunity to meet the challenges in new and creative ways \n     that led to remarkable successes and an acceleration of the \n     stability in southern Iraq well ahead of the rest of the \n     country.\n       16 Soldiers lost their lives while serving under the Colors \n     of the Big Red One, brigades and battalions assigned to us. \n     They\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n     will forever be a part of our history, they will always be in \n     our prayers and our thoughts go out to their families. Yet, \n     thanks be to God, every one of the 850 soldiers who deployed \n     from Fort Riley as part of the division headquarters returned \n     safely, despite repeated rocket attacks on our bases, \n     ambushes against our vehicles, hundreds of hours in aerial \n     flight, and the harsh conditions of extreme heat, Biblical \n     dust storms, and unforgiving military equipment.\n       These are the soldiers who developed the intelligence to \n     defeat the enemy networks so that they found no sanctuary.\n       These are the soldiers who planned the operations to \n     provide the surveillance that supported the Iraqis who then, \n     on their own, arrested the violent extremists and who taught \n     the Iraqi investigators and the judges how to gather evidence \n     that led to convictions under the rule of law.\n       These are the soldiers who established the satellite \n     communications to reach everywhere even places where no other \n     Army unit has been able to extend communications.\n       These are the soldiers who determined which Iraqis we \n     should develop relationships with to gain influence, who \n     committed money like a weapons system to change the \n     environment around us, who determined which projects should \n     receive our attention and fought for successful completion \n     and closure of 628 separate projects.\n       And these are the soldiers who planned and executed the \n     drawdown ending operation Iraqi Freedom, beginning operation \n     New Dawn, including the movement of 1,200 trucks, 14,000 \n     separate pieces of equipment, $286 million dollars worth of \n     U.S. property, responsibly moved out of the country of Iraq \n     and the closure of 30 of 58 military bases in southern Iraq \n     in only 6 months, including the conversion of a former prison \n     complex into a logistics city for commercial enterprises to \n     establish themselves.\n       These are the soldiers who created through their own \n     initiative a program and center for building resilience even \n     while deployed.\n       What a legacy to have been left by 800 Americans.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, these soldiers have truly added to \n     the illustrious history of the Big Red 1 and have earned \n     these decorations Command Sergeant Major Champagne and I \n     affixed to the Colors and I would ask you please join me in a \n     round of applause for these warriors.\n       Iraq is on the pathway to becoming sovereign, stable and \n     self-reliant and we helped them have a chance. Now we are \n     home and our attention is turned to rejoining our friends and \n     loved ones--on building our resilience--and finally on our \n     Fort Riley 2015 Campaign Plan which continues to move \n     forward. We will address all of these with the same vigor, \n     reunited and energized by the growth we have all experienced \n     over the last 12 months. Exciting times await us. Forward the \n     Big Red One.\n       Thank you again for joining us today. May God continue to \n     bless you all and may his protection be with those who remain \n     deployed and upon their families.\n       Duty First.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               President's Talk With Chamber of Commerce\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, President Obama talked with the chamber \nof commerce yesterday. I think that was a good step, but talk and \nrhetoric are not policy and not action. It is reported that he received \napplause from two different lines, and he got that in a 35-minute \naddress, which is a bit unusual.\n  It does appear the President understands he has a serious problem \nwith the job-creating community and is willing to at least meet with \npeople. But the problem really is policy and action. I am disappointed \nhe has not gone further to deal, in a realistic way, with the job \nproblems this Nation has.\n  He talked about lowering corporate taxes but not reducing the burden \nof government borne by these companies. In other words, he talked about \nlowering the rate through eliminating loopholes, and some of the \nloopholes, I am sure, are not justified. Some of them may be very \neffective in helping us to be competitive and create growth, not just \neliminating those and making it appear that the corporate tax burden \nhas been reduced.\n  I talked to the chamber of commerce and businesspeople, and they tell \nme we are in a competitive world environment, and businesses decide \nwhere to make products and hire workers based on the cost of doing \nbusiness in that area. A CEO in North America, for an international \ncompany in my home State, told me: We thought we were going to add 200 \njobs--at an Alabama plant that he oversees to make a chemical product. \nBut his headquarter company in Europe said: No, after considering \ntaxes, we are not going to build that plant in Alabama. It is going to \nbe in a foreign country. In other words, they had won the competition \non costs. Another country with lower tax rates on a corporation had won \nthe bid. The idea that you can have a high tax rate is not good.\n  We have the highest tax rate in the developed world--as soon as Japan \nbrings theirs down, which they are planning to do, then we will be the \nhighest corporate tax country in the world. This makes us less \ncompetitive, and it creates fewer jobs. Simply to eliminate loopholes \nand bring it down from 35 to the high twenties, as apparently is being \ndiscussed, does not reduce the burden of taxes on corporations. Many of \nour corporations are going to have a significant increase in their tax \nrates, and they will be less able to hire workers. This is a major \nissue that I think we have to confront. It is a competitiveness issue.\n  The President continued to talk, as he did in the State of the Union, \nabout more investment spending. We don't have the money to do more \nspending. I am disappointed that he has not begun to realize that the \nday is over that we can just waltz in with a lot of good ideas for new \nspending programs. He continued to talk about spending and the role of \ndemocracy in this region and key industries at a time when we need to \nstreamline regulations that are killing jobs in America. He did not \ncall for a vigorous and realistic plan to reduce spending.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I appreciate the President \nbeginning to enter into a dialog with the folks who create jobs. I am \nnot suggesting that we need to reduce corporate rates to be nice to \ncorporations. I do not have any grief to bear to try to make it somehow \neasier for corporate executives to make big amounts of money.\n  What I do understand is if we overtax American corporations, they \nwill move other places. Canada is looking to reduce its corporate tax \nrate to 16 percent. If we are at 35 percent and Canada goes to 16, will \nthat not be a factor in us losing jobs in competition with Canada? We \nhave to defend our interests.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader. I know he is busy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an outstanding \nRhode Islander, a Vietnam veteran, and champion of workers' rights and \njustice in the workplace who retired after 35 years of service--my \nfriend, Stan Israel.\n  After serving two tours in Vietnam, Stan began working for the \nService Employees International Union, SEIU, in 1974, first as an \norganizer with Local 1199, covering New York and Long Island. Stan \nrepresented health employees in hospitals and nursing homes organizing \nemployees around workplace safety and fair wages. Then, in 1983, after \na short stay in neighboring Connecticut, Stan moved to Rhode Island to \nhead the New England District of SEIU, where he recently retired as \nexecutive director.\n  For nearly three decades, Stan led Rhode Island's second largest \nunion, which represents hard-working health care employees at hospitals \nacross my State and hundreds of nursing and community health centers as \nwell. Stan is a man of principle, good judgment, and great character. \nMoreover, he has been an unmatched advocate for the social and economic \nconcerns of those in greatest need.\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n  Indeed, Stan's focus and dedication has always been geared towards \nimproving patient care in our hospitals and nursing homes and \npreserving the collective voice of workers' rights. He demonstrated an \nextraordinary commitment to workers and their families, which extended \nto their safety and health on and off the job.\n  Over the years, Stan organized the labor management committees at our \nhospitals to educate and train health care employees and worked to \nsecure funding for training and professional growth programs. Moreover, \nStan helped craft the Rhode Island Safe Patient Handling Act, a State \nlaw that has helped reduce the number of injuries suffered by patients \nand caretakers in health care facilities. And, after many years of \nStan's efforts and activism, another bill was signed into Rhode Island \nlaw preventing hospitals from forcing mandatory overtime for nurses and \nnurse's aides, except in the case of emergencies.\n  But these are only a handful of Stan's achievements. And while these \naccomplishments came with great sacrifice and setbacks, Stan never quit \nand never stopped fighting to elevate the dignity and value of workers.\n  Stan's career represents a lifetime of distinguished service to his \ncountry, his State, and above all his members.\n  Now, after a well-deserved retirement, congratulations and thank you. \nI wish you and your wife, Cynthia, your children, Caitlin and John, the \nvery best in all your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/08/senate-section/article/S629-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. \n             Collins):\n       S. 300.

A bill to prevent abuse of Government charge cards; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we often use the metaphor of credit \ncards to talk about uncontrolled government spending, but in some \ncases, wasteful government spending is quite literally enabled by the \nuse of charge cards in the hands of government bureaucrats. That is why \nI am reintroducing the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act. \nThis legislation will ensure that Federal departments and agencies have \nin place, and keep in place, the kinds of safeguards necessary to \nprevent waste, fraud, and abuse with government issued charge\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\ncards. We have made a lot of progress since I first started shining the \nspotlight on this issue with the help of the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO. This legislation will secure the gains we have made to \nprevent any backsliding while adding in extra mechanisms to prevent and \ndetect misuse of government charge cards.\n  In 1998, the General Service Administration, GSA, entered into a \ncontract with a set of commercial banks to utilize charge cards, not \nunlike those used by businesses large and small and millions of \nconsumers worldwide. This is called the SmartPay  program. These \ngovernment charge cards include government purchase cards, which are \nused for acquisition of commercial goods and services by agencies and \npaid directly by the agency, and government travel cards, which are \nused to pay for individual government travel expenses and issued in the \nname of individual government employees.\n  Government charge cards were intended as a low cost method to \nstreamline government acquisition and travel processes. The whole idea \nwas to adopt the best practices of the commercial sector. In the \nbusiness sector, charge cards have been a success. They save time and \nmoney. The main reason they work so well is because the control \nenvironment in the private sector is rock solid and accountability is a \nfact of life. When a business is spending its own money, it is going to \nbe sure that it accounts for every penny or it won't stay in business. \nAs a result, corporate America, if an employee is caught abusing a \ncard, they'll lose it or get fired.\n  It is certainly a good idea for government to learn lessons from the \nbusiness sector. However, there are certain fundamental differences \nbetween the private sector and the governmental sector that call for \nextra vigilance, mainly the fact that government spends other people's \nmoney. Human nature being what it is, most people are not nearly as \ncareful spending other people's money as they would be spending their \nown.\n  Sure enough, when the SmartPay  program was first implemented, \nFederal departments and agencies did not take near the care that a \nprivate business would when handing out company charge cards. When I \nstarted looking into this with the GAO, we uncovered blatant examples \nof wasteful spending. Government employees were using their government-\nissued charge cards to bypass any authorization and approval procedures \nand purchase items that had nothing to with their official duties. We \nare talking about LA-Z-Boy reclining chairs, kitchen appliances, and \neven a sapphire ring being paid for with government purchase cards, and \nwith the American taxpayer paying the bill no questions asked.\n  Government travel cards have been used for gambling, sporting events, \nconcerts, cruises, and even gentlemen's clubs and legalized brothels. \nWhile travel cards are not paid directly with taxpayers' money like \npurchase cards, failure by employees to repay these cards results in \nthe loss of millions of dollars in rebates to the Federal Government. \nAlso, when credit card companies are forced to charge off bad debt, \nthey raise interest rates and fees on everyone else.\n  A series of GAO reports over the last decade have identified an \ninadequate and inconsistent control environment across numerous Federal \nagencies with respect to both government purchase cards and government \ntravel cards. This has led to millions of dollars in taxpayers' money \nwasted. In some cases purchases were outright fraudulent, and others \nwere of questionable need or were unnecessarily expensive. In each \nreport it has issued, the GAO has made recommendations about what kind \nof controls need to be implemented to prevent such abuses from \noccurring in the future. In many cases, the same controls were often \nmissing or inadequate, and therefore the same recommendations are \nrepeated in report after report. One agency would promise to clean up \nits act, but then we would find the exact same problems with another. \nThat is why I worked to develop legislation that would incorporate \nGAO's recommendations regarding some of the most basic controls needed \nin every agency to prevent abuse of government charge cards.\n  As a result of the pressure applied by the relentless oversight of \nCongress, the GAO, and agency Inspectors General, we have seen some \nprogress toward establishing a better control environment. In fact, the \nOffice of Management and Budget has issued to Federal agencies a \ncircular that seeks to bring about many of the controls we identified. \nHowever, this progress would not have been possible without the \ncontinual spotlight being shone on the problem and the threat of \ncongressional action.\n  In addition to requiring the most important internal controls across \nthe government, the bill requires all Federal agencies to establish \npenalties for violations, including dismissal when circumstances \nwarrant. This is necessary not only so that taxpayers know that those \nwho would squander their money are held accountable, but also to send a \nmessage to other government employees that such behavior will not be \ntolerated. The bill also increases oversight by providing that each \nagency Inspector General periodically conduct risk assessments and \naudits to identify fraud and improper use of government charge cards. \nWe have had great success working with Inspectors General using \ntechniques like data mining to reveal instances of improper use of \ngovernment charge cards. Having this information on an ongoing basis \nwill help maintain and strengthen a rigorous system of internal \ncontrols to prevent future instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with \ngovernment charge cards.\n  This legislation has been revised a number of times with considerable \ninput from the GAO as well as the Inspector General community and other \nstakeholders. In crafting the very carefully thought out bill before us \ntoday, I have appreciated the help and support provided by Chairman \nLieberman and Ranking Member Collins, who have again joined me as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill. The version I have introduced today \nis the same bill that passed the Senate in the last Congress and I look \nforward to seeing it pass both houses of Congress and enacted into law \nin the very near future. That day, the American taxpayers will be able \nto rest just a little easier knowing that at least one avenue to \npotentially waste their hard earned money has been blocked.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 302. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue \nright-of-way permits for a natural gas transmission pipeline in \nnonwilderness areas within the boundary of Denali National Park, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat I first offered in 2009 to authorize a right-of-way for \nconstruction of an Alaska in-state natural gas pipeline. The bill is \nbeing co-sponsored by my colleague from Alaska, Sen. Mark Begich. The \npipeline would run along the State's main highway from Fairbanks to \nAnchorage, including 7 miles of highway through Denali National Park \nand Preserve.\n  While many in this body are familiar with plans for a large-volume \nnatural gas pipeline to run from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields to the \nLower 48 States, there is concern that the large-diameter pipeline will \nnot be finished in time to provide needed gas to Southcentral Alaska--\ngas that is vital for electric generation in Anchorage, the Mat-Su \nBorough, and Kenai Peninsula.\n  Currently, electricity in Alaska's southern Railbelt, as it is \ncalled, is largely generated by burning natural gas produced from the \ngas fields in Cook Inlet, south of Anchorage. Cook Inlet production has \nbeen falling for years and businesses have been forced to close as a \nresult.\n  Serious concerns exist regarding the region's ability to produce \nsufficient gas for electric generation and home heating for Alaska's \nmost populated area as early as the winter of 2014-15.\n  Given the pace of planning for construction of the main line, it is \nunlikely that a larger Alaska natural gas pipeline will be able to \ndeliver gas until 2020 or later--6 or more years too late to aid \nSouthcentral Alaska's growing need for natural gas. Thus, to provide a \nreliable natural gas supply, Alaska is considering investing in a \nsmaller pipeline to meet medium term demand.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n  There are two proposals for small-diameter, 24-inch, in-state \npipelines. One would run along the Richardson and Glenn Highways to the \neast, tying into existing transmission systems near Palmer, Alaska.\n  The other ``bullet'' line, is the pipeline of concern in this \nlegislation. It would run from Alaska's North Slope region, past \nFairbanks, along the Parks Highway to the Mat-Su Valley near Anchorage, \nbringing about 500 million cubic feet of gas a day to Southcentral \nAlaska. This project would be completed well in advance of when a \nlarger-diameter pipeline might be in service to deliver 4 to 4.5 \nbillion cubic feet a day to Lower 48 markets.\n  The shortest and most logical route for a pipeline through or around \nthe roughly 10-mile bottleneck of the Nenana River Canyon and Denali \nNational Park and Preserve follows the existing highway, 7 miles of \nwhich pass through the Park. This route causes the least environmental \nand visual impact due to its location in an existing corridor, and \nprovides a route that is easily accessible for routine pipeline \nmaintenance.\n  This route would be the least expensive to construct and operate. \nMoreover, it would offer several environmental advantages. Building the \npipeline along the existing, previously disturbed Parks Highway right-\nof-way, would allow for electricity generation from natural gas in the \npark facilities at Denali. For the first time, reasonably priced \ncompressed natural gas, CNG, would be available to power park vehicles. \nCurrently, National Park Service permitted diesel tour buses travel 1 \nmillion road miles annually. Converting the buses to CNG would \nsignificantly reduce air emissions in the park.\n  Another benefit is that in order for the pipe to cross the Nenana \nRiver, a new bridge will need to be built. The bridge would provide a \npedestrian access/bicycle path for visitors who otherwise must walk \nalong the heavily traveled highway.\n  For these reasons, 8 environmental groups have expressed support for \npipeline construction along the existing highway right-of-way through \nDenali Park. These groups are the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation, the Alaska Conservation Alliance, the Denali Citizens \nCouncil, The Wilderness Society, Cook Inlet Keeper, the Alaska Center \nfor the Environment, the Wrangell Mountain Center, and the Alaska \nWildlife Alliance.\n  Last year, the State of Alaska finished a preliminary study of the \nproject. It continues to consider whether to permit and facilitate a \n``bullet'' line project, compared to other options, in order to meet \nfuture Southcentral power needs. Alaska state regulators and financial \nmarkets will ultimately decide which pipeline projects will go forward. \nIt is my desire, however, to introduce legislation that would clear \nlegal impediments to planning for the Parks Highway route.\n  Approval of the right-of-way would remove a key unknown and provide \ngreater certainty in the cost estimates and the timing for a project. \nEliminating the uncertainty of permitting and regulatory delays will \nenable the Parks Highway route to compete on a level playing field with \nother pipeline projects.\n  In 2009, this bill was modified to meet concerns voiced by the \nenvironmental community, congressional staff, and the National Park \nService. The version reintroduced today was approved unanimously by the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and added to the American \nClean Energy Leadership Act that passed from the Committee on June 17, \n2009. The provision, according to the Congressional Budget Office, had \nnominal fiscal impacts when scored as part of the larger bill--S. 1462.\n  With the pressing need of Southcentral Alaskans in mind for natural \ngas, I implore this body to quickly approve this legislation in the \n112th Session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 303. A bill to amend the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \nto require the Bureau of Land Management to provide a claimant of a \nsmall miner waiver from claim maintenance fees with a period of 60 days \nafter written receipt of 1 or more defects is provided to the claimant \nby registered mail to cure the 1 or more defects or pay the claim \nmaintenance fee, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation, being cosponsored by my colleague Senator Mark Begich from \nAlaska, to clarify Federal mining law and remedy a problem that has \narisen from the extension process for ``small'' miner land claims.\n  Under revisions to the Federal Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 28(f), \nholders of unpatented mineral claims must pay a claim maintenance fee \noriginally set at $100 per claim by a deadline, set by regulation, of \nSeptember 1st each year. Since 2004 that fee has risen to $125 per \nclaim. But Congress also has provided a claim maintenance fee waiver \nfor ``small'' miners, those who hold 10 or fewer claims, that they do \nnot have to submit the fee, but that they must file to renew their \nclaims and submit an affidavit of annual labor, work conducted on the \nclaim, Dec. 31st each year, certifying that they had performed more \nthan $100 of work on the claim in the preceding year, 30 U.S.C. \n28f(d)(1). The waiver provision further states: ``If a small miner \nwaiver application is determined to be defective for any reason, the \nclaimant shall have a period of 60 days after receipt of written \nnotification of the defect or defects by the Bureau of Land Management \nto: cure such defect or defects or pay the $100 claim maintenance fee \ndue for such a period.''\n  Since the last revision to the law last decade, there have been a \nseries of incidents where miners have argued that they submitted their \napplications and affidavits of annual labor in a timely manner, but due \nto clerical error by BLM staff, mailing delays or for unexplained \nreasons, the applications or documents were not recorded as having been \nreceived in a timely fashion--and that BLM has then moved to terminate \nthe claims, deeming them null and void. While mining claim holders have \nargued that the law provides them time to cure claim defects, BLM has \nargued that the cure only applies when applications or fees have been \nreceived in a timely manner. Thus, there is no administrative remedy \nfor miners who believe that clerical errors by BLM or mail issues \nresulted in loss or the late recording of claim extension applications.\n  There have been a number of cases where Congress has been asked to \noverride BLM determinations and reinstate mining claims simply because \nof the disputes over whether the claims had been filed in a timely \nmanner. Congress in 2003 reinstated such claims in a previous Alaska \ncase, and claims in another incident were reinstated following a U.S. \nDistrict Court case in the 10th Circuit in 2009 in the case of Miller \nv. United States. Legislation similar to this provision actually \ncleared the Senate in 2007, but did not ultimately become law.\n  This bill is intended to short circuit continued litigation and pleas \nfor claim reinstatement by clarifying the intent of Congress that \nminers do have to be informed that their claims are in jeopardy of \nbeing voided and given 60 days notice to cure defects, including giving \nthem time to submit their applications and to submit affidavits of \nannual labor, should their submittals not be received and processed by \nBLM officials on time. If all defects are not cured within 60 days--the \nobvious intent of Congress in passing the original act--then claims \nstill are subject to voidance.\n  The transition rule included in this measure will solve two pending \ncases in Alaska, one where a holder of nine claims on the Kenai \nPeninsula, near Hope, Alaska, has lost title to claims that he had held \nfrom 1982 to 2004. In this case, John Trautner had a consistent record \nof having paid the annual labor assessment fee for the previous 22 \nyears and the local BLM office did have a time-date-stamped record that \nthe maintenance fee waiver certification form had been filed weeks \nbefore the deadline, but just not a record that the affidavit of annual \nlabor had arrived. In the second case Don and Judy Mullikin of Homer, \nAlaska, lost title to nine claims on the Seward Peninsula outside of \nNome in Alaska because the Anchorage BLM office has no record of them \nreceiving the paperwork, even though the owners have computer time \nstamps of them having completed the paperwork 5 months before the \ndeadline, but no other evidence\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\nof filing to meet BLM regulations. They lost their appeal in late 2009. \nThese are claims that have been worked in Alaska yearly since 1937 and \nare the main livelihood for the Mullikins.\n  This legislation, supported by the Alaska Miners Association--S. 3175 \nin the 111th Congress--clearly is intended to remedy a simple drafting \nerror in congressional crafting of the small miner claim defect \nprocess. While only a few cases of potential clerical errors have \noccurred over the past decade, it still makes sense for Congress to \nclarify that claim holders have a right to know that their applications \nhave not been processed, in time for them to cure application-claim \ndefects prior to being informed of the loss of the claim rights \nforever. Simple equity and due process requires no less.\n  Given the minute cost of this administrative change to the Department \nof the Interior, but its big impact on affected small mineral claim \nholders, I hope this bill can be considered and approved promptly this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 304. A bill to amend the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act to \nimprove the Alaska pipeline construction training program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would make a minor technical change to a provision that this \nCongress approved in 2004 to further construction of an Alaska natural \ngas pipeline system to move Alaska's conventional gas to market.\n  In 2004 Congress approved two pieces of legislation to help \nfacilitate construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline. In Public \nLaw 108-324 Congress approved a Federal loan guarantee program, \nstreamlined regulatory processes and approved a worker training program \nto guarantee a domestic labor supply for construction of the largest \nprivate-sector capital infrastructure project in the world's history. \nIn a separate bill, Public Law 108-357, Congress also approved tax \nchanges to provide accelerated depreciation for the pipe and a related \ngas conditioning plant needed for the project. A pipeline to move \nAlaska's 35 trillion cubic feet of known gas reserves, and its likely \n315 trillion cubic feet of additional Arctic gas reserves from lands \nand Arctic waters would have a host of benefits to the Nation.\n  Being able to market only the known gas reserves at the Prudhoe Bay \nfield will involve construction of a pipeline system estimated to cost \nbetween $26 and $40 billion. It is expected to produce 38,000 direct \njob-years of labor in Alaska and up to 31,000 direct jobs at the peak \nof construction. According to the National Defense Foundation it will \nproduce direct employment of 172,369 jobs nationwide when related \nsteel, pipe, valve and equipment jobs are included, not counting many \nmore indirect jobs. At current prices it will generate about $100 \nbillion in Federal tax revenues, not counting $40 billion in Alaska \nState revenues and $30 billion in Canadian tax revenues over its first \n20 years of operation. Recent estimates, however, indicate that \ndevelopment of gas from the offshore Arctic that a gas line will permit \nto occur, would add an average of an additional 54,700 new jobs in the \nU.S.--91,500 at peak employment. That would provide $145 billion in \ntotal payroll--$82 billion to workers in the Lower 48--and provide $167 \nbillion in tax and royalty revenues to the Federal Government, $15 \nbillion to the State of Alaska and total revenues of $193 billion at \nforecast gas prices.\n  In the intervening 7 years since the gas line loan-permitting package \nbecame law, it has become clear that changes are needed. While those \nchanges include revisions in the loan guarantee program, they also \ninvolve changes in the construction worker training provisions.\n  In the 2004 act, Sect. 113, the bill authorized $20 million for \nworker training programs, with at least 15 percent of those funds going \nto pay for ``design and construction of a training facility to be \nlocated in Fairbanks, Alaska.'' But language in the bill has prevented \nthat training center from moving forward. This proposed bill would \nauthorize Federal funding to be released immediately upon the request \nof the Governor of Alaska, to fund construction of the training center, \nand to broaden the center to permit it also to train oil, besides gas \nfield workers, and environmental response employees.\n  According to the Alaska Department of Labor, the demand for skilled \nworkers for gas and oil line projects on Alaska's North Slope grew by \n50 percent from 2005 to 2009 to nearly 12,000 workers. At the same \ntime, the average age of Alaska's skilled workforce is now 53, meaning \nthat Alaska needs to train 1,000 new construction and pipeline workers \nannually simply to maintain the State's existing skilled workforce. \nSince it takes roughly 5 years to train a skilled construction/\npipefitter, it is imperative that such training begin far in advance of \nestimated pipeline construction. According to State data, there are \nonly about 2,130 plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters working in \nAlaska and another 1,004 welders, solderers, brazers, and machine \nsetters. Past estimates by one of the two consortia proposing to build \nan Alaska gas pipeline are that the gas line alone will require 1,650 \nwelders/helpers, 2,000 equipment operators, 418 inspectors and 90 UT \ntechnicians, just to build the Alaska sections of the pipeline. That \nmeans there is an urgent need for the pipeline training center now.\n  The Fairbanks Pipeline Training Center's core mission is to provide a \nhighly trained workforce that will meet the needs of the entire oil/\ngas/pipeline/refining industry; which is a significant component of \nAlaska's economy, providing 80 percent of the State's industrial tax \nbase, 74 percent of all resources produced in the State, and 85 percent \nof State revenues) and a crucial component of the Nation's domestic \nenergy supply, currently 13 percent of all domestically produced oil, \nwhile the proposed overland gas line will produce 7 percent of the \nNation's total estimated gas demand in 2020. The necessity for this \nworkforce is further emphasized because it is clear that an aging \ninfrastructure will require an accelerated repair, replacement, and \nmaintenance regime if production requirements and safety standard are \nto be met.\n  The training center is an innovative statewide collaboration between \nlabor, industry, and local, State, and Federal Governments. \nAdditionally, it is understood that as alternative fuel technologies \nemerge and are commercialize, a highly skilled, highly trained, highly \nmotivated workforce will be required. Again, through collaboration with \nothers: the University of Alaska, the Cold Climate Housing Research \nCenter, United Technologies Corporation, General Electric, and Alaskan \ncommercial interests, requisite evolving workforce needs are understood \nand can be met.\n  The facility needs to be located in Interior Alaska, because the \nclimate will permit workers to be fully trained in the real-world \nconditions they will face on the job. In order to complete the training \ncenter and thereby meet anticipated labor demand in a timely manner, \nfunds must be secured in the upcoming budget cycle. Federal funding \nneeded includes: $5.5 million for Central Facility classrooms and \nshops, $1.5 million for a Construction Camp Facility, $1.0 million for \na Pipeline Coating Training Facility and for corrosion control \ntraining, $0.5 million for civil work improvements to the Field \nTraining Site, and $1.5 million for pipeline and transportation/\nlogistical equipment.\n  The bill's changes will permit the creation of a domestic energy \nworkforce that is stable, productive, and encourages safe working \npractices that will help to protect Alaska's environment and wildlife, \nwhile producing the energy that America needs. The proposal does not \nexpand the size of the funding authorization approved in 2004. It \nsimply makes it more likely that American workers will benefit from a \ngas line project when it proceeds--an important fact when the national \nunemployment rate remains at 9.4 percent. I hope that this Congress \nwill consider this bill for quick consideration and passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 307. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 217 West King Street, Martinsburg, West Virginia, \nas the ``W.\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\nCraig Broadwater Federal Building and United States Courthouse'', to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I come to \nthe floor today to discuss legislation that I am introducing to name \nthe Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Martinsburg, WV, \nin honor of a dear friend, W. Craig Broadwater.\n  Judge Broadwater served at this courthouse during his tenure on the \nFederal bench, until his untimely death in 2006 after a battle with \ncancer. This legislation is a small, yet fitting tribute to his \nremarkable service to West Virginia and America.\n  It is difficult to put into words how tremendous of a loss his death \nwas to his family, friends, community, State, and Nation. But I think \nit becomes much clearer when one looks at his life--his contributions \nto Justice and the Defense of our Nation, his love for his family, and \nthe difference he made in the lives of those who were fortunate enough \nto know him.\n  Craig earned his undergraduate degree from West Virginia University \nin 1972 and his law degree from the West Virginia University College of \nLaw in 1977. He spent the next several years in private practice in \nWheeling, West Virginia, and also served as a hearing examiner for the \nWest Virginia Worker's Compensation Fund and a special prosecuting \nattorney for Ohio County.\n  His career on the bench dates back to when I was Governor of West \nVirginia and had the honor of appointing him in 1983 to be a Circuit \nJudge for Ohio, Brooke, and Hancock Counties. There, he worked to \nprotect our State's most vulnerable children as Chair of the Committee \nto Develop Child Abuse and Neglect Rules. The ``Broadwater Committee'', \nas it became known, reformed our courts' response to the needs of \nchildren in our judicial system.\n  Craig served as a state court judge until he was nominated by \nPresident Clinton to be a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District \nof West Virginia. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 12, 1996, and \ncommissioned to serve on July 26, 1996.\n  During his ten years on the Federal bench, Craig exhibited all of the \ncharacteristics that we hope for in a judge. He was intelligent, \nthoughtful, principled, and fair. Anyone who appeared before him knew \nthat the case would be decided on the merits, without bias towards any \nof the claimants.\n  But beyond his service on the bench, Craig was also a hero and a \npatriot who answered the call of duty time and again. He began his \nmilitary career in 1972 with a tour in Korea as an Army Military \nIntelligence Officer. He continued his service as a member of the West \nVirginia National Guard, where he rose to the rank of Brigadier \nGeneral. Even while serving on the Federal bench, Craig fought to \nprotect our country. His service included a 2003 deployment as Deputy \nCommander of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa at Camp \nLemonier, Djibouti, and a 2005 deployment to Iraq as Commanding General \nof the Joint Interagency Task Force-High Value Individuals at Camp \nVictory, Iraq. His awards are too numerous to count, but among them are \nthe Defense Superior Service Medal and the Bronze Star.\n  But despite all of his awards and accomplishments, the thing that \nmade Craig the most proud was his family. I am privileged to know his \nwife Chong, and his children Chandra, Taeja, and Shane--and to have \ntheir blessing in introducing this legislation.\n  As I reflect on Craig's life and career, I still remember the day he \nwas confirmed by the Senate for a seat on the Federal bench. It was a \ngreat day for me and for all West Virginians. At the time, I came to \nthe floor and said that Senator Byrd and I had recommended him for this \nposition because he ``represents the very best of our State''--and how \ntrue that is even today.\n  Those of us who were fortunate enough to know him personally describe \nhim as courageous, kind, compassionate, and loving. And although his \nlife was cut short, he had already achieved more than most of us could \never hope to accomplish in several lifetimes.\n  I am very appreciative that Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito has \nagreed to join me in introducing companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives, and is going to work with me to get this bill signed \ninto law. The bipartisan nature of our effort is truly a testament to \nthe impact that Craig had on all of us, regardless of political \naffiliation.\n  In closing, the naming of a Federal courthouse in his honor is such a \nsmall gesture, especially compared to what Craig did for our country.\n  But it is my hope that whenever the citizens of West Virginia visit \nor pass by the W. Craig Broadwater Federal Building and United States \nCourthouse in Martinsburg, West Virginia, they will remember his life \nand be inspired, as I have been inspired, to give back to our country \nin such a meaningful way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Hagan, and \n        Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 309. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nMoldova; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment, normal trade \nrelations treatment, to the products of Moldova. This legislation would \nrepeal the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions on Moldovan \nproducts. Moldova has been in compliance with Jackson-Vanik-related \nconcerns for some time now, and repeal of this legislation will provide \nan important impetus for improving trade relations between the United \nStates and Moldova, advancing Moldova's Western ambitions, and laying \nthe foundation for closer U.S.-Moldovan political engagement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 311. A bill to provide for the coverage of medically necessary \nfood under Federal health programs and private health insurance, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year an estimated 2,550 children in \nthe United States are diagnosed with metabolism disorders. For the rest \nof their lives they will need modified foods that do not have the \nnutrients their body is incapable of processing. They may also require \nsupplementation with pharmacological doses of vitamins and amino acids. \nThe good news is that with treatment they can lead normal, productive \nlives. But without these foods and supplements, patients can become \nseverely brain-damaged and hospitalized.\n  Through bipartisan efforts, we have made great strides in improving \nhow quickly babies with these disorders are diagnosed. Newborn \nscreening has made a tremendous difference in the early diagnosis of \nmetabolic disorders. However, affordable and accessible treatment \noptions remain out of reach for too many Americans. Medical foods and \nsupplements which are necessary for treatment may not be covered by \ninsurance policies and can be prohibitively expensive for too many \nfamilies. For those with a metabolic disorder, medical foods are \ncritical in treatment, just as other conditions are treated with pills \nor injections. The sporadic insurance coverage of treatment is a \nproblem. In response, over 35 States have enacted laws to enforce \ncoverage of medical foods. However, too many loopholes remain and \nfederal legislation is necessary to ensure that these individuals \nreceive what they need to stay well. It is time that we get treatment \nfor those patients lost in insurance loopholes.\n  The Medical Foods Equity Act follows the April 2009 recommendations \nof the U.S. Health and Human Services, Secretary's Advisory Committee \non Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. It will ensure \ncoverage of medical foods and necessary supplements for individuals \nwith disorders as recommended by the Advisory Committee and, most \nimportantly, peace of mind for those families affected by inborn errors \nof metabolism.\n  The lack of medical food coverage available to families has a \nsignificant impact on their lives. With the current situation of \nvarying regulations between States and insurance providers, even \nfamilies with coverage find themselves living in fear that a change in \ninsurance provider will lead to reduced or nonexistent coverage. Too \nmany Americans across the country are struggling to access the \ntreatment they need for this type of disorder.\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\n  Take the story of Donna McGrath from Wilmington, Massachusetts. Donna \nhas two daughters with phenylketonuria, PKU, and she speaks eloquently \nabout the frustration she experienced after her employer switched \ninsurance plans. Because medical foods are not listed along with other \nnecessary medicines, Donna was forced to navigate a long list mostly \nmade up of durable medical equipment providers unequipped to help her. \nEven when she finally found a pharmacy that could order the formula, \nshe was told that they required an upfront payment because they were \nwary of not being reimbursed by insurance companies. In Donna's own \nwords, she was dismayed at ``having that feeling like you're being held \nhostage every time a change may occur in your insurance or carrier.'' \nMedical treatment for inborn error of metabolism disorders is just as \nnecessary as treatment for other conditions--like insulin for a \ndiabetic or chemotherapy for a cancer patient.\n  As newborn screening and medical advances continue to improve the \nability of those born with an inborn error of metabolism to lead full, \nhealthy lives, we must make sure that the necessary treatments are \navailable. That is why Senator Casey and I are introducing the Medical \nFoods Equity Act. Our legislation would require medically necessary \nfoods and supplements to be included in the definition of essential \nhealth benefits for qualified health plans, covered by federal health \nprograms, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, and by the private health \ninsurance market, fully insured group health plans, self-insured group \nhealth plans, and non-group health plans. The legislation requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make a determination of \nminimum coverage levels for medically necessary foods and supplements \nfor certain rare metabolic conditions.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Medical Foods Equity Act and who \nhave endorsed it today, including the National PKU Alliance, the Save \nBabies Through Screening Foundation, the National Organization for Rare \nDisorders, NORD, Genetic Alliance, and the American Dietetic \nAssociation.\n  The Medical Foods Equity Act will close existing loopholes in \ncoverage and provide the parity in coverage these families deserve. It \nis my hope that we can move forward with this bill in a bipartisan \nmanner. I ask all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/08/senate-section/article/S634-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 46--REQUIRING THAT LEGISLATION CONSIDERED BY THE \n                SENATE TO BE CONFINED TO A SINGLE ISSUE\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Barrasso) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

An affirmative vote of two-thirds of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the legislative \nclimate the United States Senate has found itself operating in. Like \nmany of my colleagues, I began my political career in local government. \nI was mayor in my hometown and then served as a legislator in the \nWyoming State Legislature. It was during this time I learned that the \nmost effective legislation comes from a process that is transparent and \nfocused. For example, the Wyoming State Legislature requires that all \nbills must be focused on one issue. They cannot be loaded up with \nrandom provisions, riders, and add-ons that have nothing to do with the \noverall legislation. In Congress, we often use omnibus bills to pass \nmultiple legislative items that should be considered on their own \nmerit. Omnibus bills often create more problems in the long run than \nthey solve.\n  Instead of focusing on one policy issue at a time, we have allowed \nlegislative logjams to foul up the Senate's work and ill-considered \nlegislation to be hastily pushed through this institution. These \nlegislative practices, which have become the norm, are a gangrene that \neats away at this institution.\n  Legislation that is fundamental to our country's well-being has \nbecome politicized and burdened with extraneous provisions that have \nnot been fully vetted through the regular order. Most of the time \nMembers have not had the opportunity to read the bills they are voting \non, let alone the public which will have to live under and pay for \nwhatever lurks in the unseen pages. By tolerating this behavior, the \nSenate is allowing legislation needed to address our Nation's most \npressing challenges to go through unrefined and lousy with special \ninterest provisions.\n  To help bring this institution back in line with its original \npurpose, today I reintroduce my Single Issue Legislation bill. I want \nthis bill to be a starting point for changing the attitude the Senate \nhas toward building bills. It will allow us to focus on getting \nindividual issues addressed more effectively. Specifically, this bill \nenacts a standing order that creates a point of order against a bill or \nresolution that is not confined to a single issue. This point of order \ncan only be overruled by a supermajority.\n  My Single Issue Legislation gives the Senate the flexibility in the \namendment process it has always enjoyed and allows the Senate as a \nlegislative body to develop the structure and scope of the standing \norder through practice and precedent rather than through arbitrary \nrules. At the same time, we ensure that our legislative process is \nfocused and productive. In short, we bring ourselves back to how the \nFounding Fathers intended and wanted our legislative process to \noperate.\n  Our job is not to score political points by stuffing as many pet \nprojects and knee-jerk provisions as we can into bills, but rather to \nrepresent the needs of our constituents, our States, and our country by \ndoing what is best for us as a nation. We must get back to a better \nprocess for crafting and considering legislation so that we can enact \neffective policies to meet the many challenges we face today. This is \nwhy we were elected to serve in the United States Senate. We owe it to \nthe people we represent to work through a process that allows \nlegislation to be properly and thoroughly considered and debated. My \nSingle Issue Legislation bill helps us do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/08/senate-section/article/S634-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 57.
