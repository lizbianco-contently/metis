Mr. President, in this country, owning a home means more \nthan a roof over your head. It is the centerpiece of the American \nDream.\n  For many responsible Americans, the dream of home ownership has \nbecome a nightmare. When Wall Street greed collapsed the economy in \n2008, the housing market also collapsed. That meant free-falling home \nprices and a staggering number of foreclosures.\n  No State in the Union was hit harder than Nevada, but California was \nhit extremely hard, Michigan, Arizona, and Florida. But for 5 \nconsecutive years, Nevada has led the Nation in foreclosures. The \nforeclosure rate in Nevada is 400 percent of the national average.\n  Behind those statistics are people. Whether it is Nevada, Arizona, \nFlorida, Michigan, or anyplace else in the country, statistics are \npeople--families who bought homes where they could raise their families \nand enjoy life. Many Nevadans, like other Americans who worked hard, \nsaved money and shopped responsibly, are now so far under water they \ncan't see a way out.\n  So who is responsible? There is plenty of blame to go around. Brokers \nsold loans that could never be repaid, buyers bought houses they \ncouldn't afford, and banks bought bad loans to sell to investors. \nRegardless of who is at fault, millions of homeowners who did \neverything right are still on the hook for a financial crisis they \ndidn't cause. Many of them have never missed a payment.\n  Unlike some Republicans, I don't believe the answer is to throw up \nour hands and do nothing. Homeowners who have watched their equity \nevaporate don't have time to watch the market hit rock bottom, as one \nRepublican candidate suggested. The President and Congress have taken \naction to ease this crisis. Not everything we have done to ease the \ncrisis has worked, but we need to continue programs that are working \nand fix the ones that aren't. I support the President's efforts to \nreduce the hurdles to financing, and refinancing, for sure. Nearly 15 \nmillion Americans could benefit from refinancing their loans at today's \nhistorically low interest rates.\n  We must keep those who have lost their jobs from losing their homes \nas well. This proposal will help them reduce their monthly payments and \nsave thousands of dollars every year. And for families who owe more \nthan their house is worth, it will help them rebuild the equity they \nlost because of the collapse in the housing markets.\n  Redtape should no longer keep responsible homeowners from refinancing \ntheir loans and restoring their futures.\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nRedtape, I repeat, should no longer keep responsible homeowners from \nrefinancing their homes and restoring their futures.\n  There are some who advocate a do-nothing policy. There is nothing we \ncan do to help. They couldn't be more wrong. Here is one example. My \nNevada offices have posted several foreclosure workshops. More than \n2,000 people have taken the opportunity to sit down and face their \nlenders--often for the first time. Several thousand more have gotten \nhelp from caseworkers in my office. Caseworkers and owners have worked \ntogether literally to save homes from the auction block. I am hosting \nanother workshop in Las Vegas this Saturday.\n  We can't help everyone, but we must do more to help those we can. It \nis time for more Federal action. It is time to give homeowners in every \nState the tools they need to hold on to their homes and to hold on to \nthe American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S362-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to make a couple of observations \nthis morning about the bipartisan support that exists for extending a \npayroll tax holiday. I will start with the obvious: Republicans \nstrongly support extending this tax cut for the rest of the year. \nAmericans have suffered long enough as a result of this President's \neconomic policies. They do not need to suffer more because of his \nfailure to turn the economy around 3 years into his administration.\n  But the fact is any solution requires both sides to engage in good-\nfaith negotiations. When my friend, the majority leader of the Senate, \ncomes to the floor and says that Republicans in Congress are only \nwilling to extend this tax cut if they are allowed to poison Americans' \ndrinking water, then I think it is pretty safe to say it is time for \nfewer partisan attacks and more efforts to finish the job.\n  When a tax hike that has been rejected repeatedly by Members of both \nparties over the past year is the opening bid in a negotiation, I think \nit is safe to say that Democrats are more interested in scoring \npolitical points than in scoring a tax cut that millions of middle-\nclass Americans are counting on.\n  When the majority leader of the Senate suddenly announces he is \nworking on a proposal of his own to extend this tax cut, even as the \nconference committee is in the midst of negotiating a bipartisan \nsolution that everybody can support, I think it is pretty obvious where \nthe problem lies. It is with the Democratic majority and a President \nwho we thought were elected to lead.\n  I think most Americans would expect that at a moment such as this, \nwhen a solution to a pressing problem is sought, the majority party \nbears the responsibility to find it. It is worth noting that in the \nHouse, the majority party did its work and passed a 1-year extension. \nYet all we get from the Democratic majority in the Senate are \nexaggerated claims, ad hominem attacks, and false accusations aimed at \ndelaying a solution rather than achieving one.\n  So I would remind my friend the majority leader that the particular \npiece of legislation he railed against yesterday as an effort to poison \npeople has broad bipartisan support, including 12 Democratic cosponsors \nhere in the Senate--and rightly so in the midst of a jobs crisis. We \nshould seize every opportunity we have to help job creators at a time \nwhen more than 13 million Americans are looking for work and can't find \nit.\n  The only thing controversial about this proposal--the only thing \ncontroversial about this proposal--is the idea of opposing it.\n  I would also remind the majority leader that the Federal pay freeze \nreceived more than 300 votes in the House, and that he himself already \nagreed to spending cuts during negotiations this past fall that would \ncover the cost of extending this payroll tax cut for the remainder of \nthe year.\n  So let us allow the conferees to finish their work and get this \npayroll tax cut extended for the rest of the year. That is what \nRepublicans want. That is what the President says he wants. And there \nis no reason we shouldn't be able to get this done. The Democratic \nmajority of the Senate should be leading that effort, not rooting for \nits failure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S362-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma and I know he is waiting to go and I appreciate his courtesy \nthat I might go first. Let me speak in my capacity as chair of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Two weeks ago, when the Senate confirmed only 1 of the 19 judicial \nnominations on which votes were delayed from last year, I urged Senate \nRepublicans to join with Democrats and take long overdue steps to \nremedy the serious vacancies crisis on Federal courts throughout the \ncountry. Nearly 1 out of every 10 Federal judgeships is vacant. \nNonetheless, Senate Republicans refuse to consent to votes on consensus \nnominees who could fill many of those vacancies without further delay. \nThese are well-qualified judicial nominees who were reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee many months ago; there has been \nno explanation for the delay in their confirmation. During the last 2 \nmonths, Senate Republicans have consented to votes on only 2 of the 23 \njudicial nominees ready for final Senate action.\n  Of the 19 judicial nominations now awaiting a final vote by the \nSenate, 16 were reported by the Judiciary Committee with the support of \nevery Senator on the Committee, Democratic and Republican. No Senator \ncan or should have any reason to oppose these nominees in the Senate. \nBut, month after month and year after year, Senate Republicans find new \nreasons and new tactics to delay confirmation of consensus judicial \nnominees for no good reason. I have never seen anything like this. \nThese delays are a disservice to the American people. They prevent the \nSenate from fulfilling its constitutional duty. And they are damaging \nto the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans \naround the country.\n  Regrettably, the last 2 weeks evidences more of the same, a \ncontinuation of the delaying tactics we have seen for years, as Senate \nRepublicans continue their across-the-board obstruction of President \nObama's judicial nominations. For the second year in a row, Senate \nRepublicans refused to consent to votes on judicial nominations before \nthe end of the Senate's session in December. At the end of 2011, they \nagain refused to follow Senate's traditional, longstanding practice of\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nvoting to confirm consensus nominations before the end of the Senate \nsession, a practice followed by Democrats and Republicans with \nPresidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton and George W. Bush.\n  Their tactics have worked, to the detriment of the Federal courts and \nthe American people. By nearly any measure we are well behind where we \nshould be. Three years into President Obama's first term, the Senate \nhas confirmed a lower percentage of President Obama's judicial nominees \nthan those of any President in the last 35 years. The Senate has \nconfirmed just over 70 percent of President Obama's circuit and \ndistrict nominees, with more than one in four not confirmed. This is in \nstark contrast to the nearly 87 percent of President George W. Bush's \nnominees who were confirmed, nearly nine out of every 10 nominees he \nsent to the Senate.\n  We remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President \nBush's first term. By this date in President Bush's first term, the \nSenate had confirmed 170 Federal circuit and district court nominations \non the way to 205, and had lowered judicial vacancies to 46. By the \ntime Americans went to the polls in November 2004, we had reduced \nvacancies to 28 nationwide, the lowest level in the last 20 years. In \ncontrast, the Senate has confirmed only 125 of President Obama's \ndistrict and circuit nominees, and judicial vacancies remain over 85. \nThe vacancy rate is double what it was at this point in the Bush \nadministration.\n  I wonder when I hear some Republican Senators claim credit for \nprogress on nominations and point to what they like to call ``positive \naction''--how they can ignore the 19 judicial nominations being blocked \nfor no reason. I wonder how they can claim progress for the American \npeople when judicial vacancies remain well above 80 more than 3 years \ninto President Obama's first term. In this setting, after years of \ndelay and lack of real progress, it is troubling to hear Senate \nRepublicans already talking about how they plan to resort to the \nThurmond Rule to shut down all judicial confirmations for the rest of \nthe year. Their obstruction has already resulted in the Senate having \nconfirmed 45 fewer judicial nominations after 3 years of the Obama \nadministration than after 3 years of the Bush administration. We still \nhave a long way to go to catch up and to lower judicial vacancies \nbefore anyone talks about a confirmation shutdown.\n  I wish Senate Republicans would abandon their rhetoric and do as \nSenate Democrats did when we worked to confirm 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 17 months. In fact, we continued to work to reduce \njudicial vacancies by considering and confirming President Bush's \njudicial nominations late into the Presidential election years of 2004 \nand 2008, reducing the vacancy rates in those years to their lowest \nlevels in decades.\n  The cost of this across the board Republican obstruction is borne by \nthe American people. More than half of all Americans, nearly 160 \nmillion, live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy \nthat could be filled today if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on \nthe nominations that have been reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is wrong to delay votes on these qualified, consensus \njudicial nominees. The Senate should fill these numerous, extended \njudicial vacancies, not delay final action for no good reason.\n  The result of the Senate Republicans' inaction is that the people of \nNew York, California, West Virginia, Florida, Nebraska, Missouri, \nWashington, Utah, the District of Columbia, Nevada, Louisiana, and \nTexas are without the judges they need. The result is that judicial \nemergency vacancies in Florida, Utah, California, Nevada and Texas \nremain unfilled.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who seek \ntheir day in Federal court to suffer unnecessary delays. When an \ninjured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of medical expenses, that \nplaintiff should not have to wait for 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute. \nWith one in 10 Federal judgeships currently vacant, the Senate should \nhave come together to remedy the serious judicial vacancies crisis on \nFederal courts around the country.\n  This Republican obstruction began long before President Obama's \nrecent recess appointment of a handful of Executive branch nominees \nneeded for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National \nLabor Relations Board to function. Indeed, despite 3 years of delays \nand across the board obstruction of his judicial nominations, President \nObama has not recess appointed a single judicial nominee. That is \nsomething President Bush did, not President Obama. Senate Democrats \nthat year consented to consider noncontroversial judicial nominations, \nconfirming a total of 205 circuit and district court nominations in \nPresident Bush's first term and lowering judicial vacancies \ndramatically. In fact, the Senate proceeded to an up or down vote and \nconfirmed 1 of the judicial nominees President Bush had recess \nappointed, William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Senate Republicans have been blocking votes on 18 of the President's \njudicial nominees since last year. Eight of the judicial nominations \nRepublicans are blocking were reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee in September and October last year. Another 5 nominations \nwere reported in November, and 4 in December. All of these judicial \nnominations could and should have been considered by the Senate last \nyear. Indeed, when Republicans held up scores of nominees in December, \nincluding these judicial nominees, they did so to ``punish'' the \nadministration for not assuring them that the President would not use \nhis recess appointment power. That delay, now of more than 2 months, \nhas already taken a measure of revenge. They continue to hurt the \ncountry by engaging in more obstruction and delay now to seek a double \nmeasure of retaliation.\n  Instead of exacerbating the conflict, Senate Republicans should \nreconsider their tactics and moderate their use of filibusters and \nstalling. This President has reached out to work with Senators from \nboth parties with respect to judicial nominations. Every one of the 19 \njudicial nominations awaiting final Senate action has the support of \nhis or her home State Senators, Republican as well as Democratic. There \nis no excuse for continued stalling of President Obama's consensus \njudicial nominees. The courts and the country cannot afford another \nyear of across the board delays of President Obama's judicial \nnominations. I urge votes on Jesse Furman for the Southern District of \nNew York, Cathy Bencivengo for the Southern District of California, \nGina Groh for the Northern District of West Virginia, Margo Brodie for \nthe Southern District of New York, Adalberto Jordan for the Eleventh \nCircuit, Beth Phillips for the Western District of Missouri, Thomas \nRice for the Eastern District of Washington, David Nuffer for the \nDistrict of Utah, Stephanie Thacker for the Fourth Circuit, Michael \nFitzgerald for the Central District of California, Ronnie Abrams for \nthe Southern District of New York, Rudolph Contreras for the District \nof Washington DC, Susie Morgan for the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nJacqueline Nguyen for the Ninth Circuit, Gregg Costa for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, David Guaderrama for the Western District of Texas, \nand Brian Wimes for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nOklahoma for his courtesy and his leadership on so many issues.\n  Mr. President, I want to particularly say to my colleague from \nVermont how much I appreciate his leadership on the Judiciary \nCommittee, where I serve. Leadership is the mark of his work there. He \nbrings together Members of both parties on so many issues, including \nthis one involving the Federal judiciary. It is, as he has said so \neloquently, one of the marvels of the world, one of the historic \naccomplishments of our republican democracy, that we have a truly \nindependent judiciary that exemplifies the qualities of \nprofessionalism, scholarship, integrity, and, yes, independence.\n  We are here today because we have a crisis in our judiciary. It is a \ncrisis not created by our judges but by this body. It is a judicial \nvacancy crisis because nearly 1 out of 10--I repeat, 1 out of 10--\njudgeships in this country are now vacant. The vacancies are double \nwhat they were at this point in President Bush's first term.\n  Every time I go back to Connecticut--as I am sure happens to the \nPresiding Officer in his State of West Virginia and to Senator Inhofe \nin Oklahoma--people ask me: Why can't you do better in Washington? Why \ncan't you bring both parties together and avoid the waste and the \nacrimony and rancor and the gridlock that is the reason for this \njudicial vacancy crisis? We need to come together and avoid the kind of \nparalysis that has such lasting and damaging effects on our judiciary.\n  The President has done his work in recommending qualified nominees to \nthis body. The Judiciary Committee has done its work in reporting many \nof these judicial nominees to the floor, in many cases with unanimous \nsupport. Despite that unanimous support, those nominations languish \nhere.\n  As we speak, 19 judicial nominations are still pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. Mr. President, 16 of those nominations \nwere reported unanimously to the floor and all but 2 of them are \nconsensus nominees who received strong bipartisan support in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  They have been blocked by the Republican minority. They have been \nblocked from up-or-down votes. They have been denied those up-or-down \nvotes. That is unfair not only to them but to the American people. It \nis damaging to this country. It undermines the independence of the \njudiciary, its credibility and respect. It causes delays in the \ndecisions on cases that vitally affect ordinary men and women who come \nto our Federal courts for justice. The old saying ``justice delayed is \njustice denied'' holds true whether it is the great historic cases of \nthis country or the ordinary, mundane, routine cases that involve \ninjuries to individual plaintiffs or defendants. And it discourages \nqualified people from permitting their names to be placed in \nnomination. The uncertainty of those delays, the need to put their \nlives on hold, when they are lawyers in private practice or judges \nserving on the bench now, causes a severe disincentive that deters \nqualified people from beginning this uncertain process.\n  Outside of Washington, there is a clear consensus that the Senate \nmust do better. Outside of the Senate, there is a clear consensus that \nwe need bipartisan cooperation. Not just among politically elected \nleaders, but the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, members of \nthe bar on both sides of the aisle all agree we must move these \nnominations. So I call on my colleagues, as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has done, to do better. President Obama has \nnominated qualified members of the bar to serve on our district courts, \nincluding, most recently, Michael Shea of my State to replace Judge \nDroney, who has just been confirmed as a member of the court of \nappeals.\n  Judge Droney's nomination waited here on the Senate calendar for 130 \ndays, despite the clear consensus in his favor. Eventually, he was \nconfirmed by a vote of 88 to 0. That delay, in turn, caused a delay to \nthe nomination of a district court judge to replace him.\n  I am hopeful Michael Shea will be confirmed expeditiously.\n  We should never minimize the importance of careful vetting and \nscrutiny when it comes to these nominees. But once that process is \ncomplete in the Judiciary Committee, blocking these nominees can only \nbe bad for the American people, as well as for the 160 million \nAmericans who live in districts and circuits with vacancies whose \nnominees are sitting on the Senate calendar. They should not have their \nability to access justice denied or delayed. We should reduce the \nburdens on our courts as quickly as possible so our system of justice \nwill continue to be--and justifiably--regarded as one of the great \nmarvels in the history of democracy, of governance in this world, on \nthis planet.\n  Our nominees deserve prompt and fair consideration by the full \nSenate, and I am hopeful the Senate will do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going to be considering today--and \nI think the rest of this week, and probably into next week--one of the \nmost significant things we are supposed to be doing here.\n  I wish to start off by saying--in endorsing and encouraging a highway \nreauthorization bill--I want people to know this is coming from someone \nwho is a conservative. I think there are a lot of conservative \norganizations out there that have mistakenly thought of this as being a \nbig spending bill without realizing this has been, since its inception \nback during the Eisenhower administration, an approach to building \nroads, highways, infrastructure that is necessary in this country, and \nto have that as a top priority.\n  There are some problems that have come up with the highway trust \nfund, and I want to share that with my colleagues but, first of all, \nmake sure everyone knows, who might be watching--and particularly some \nof the organizations that are conservative organizations--that these \nwords are coming from me. I have probably been recognized as the most \nconservative Member of this body as much as anybody else has, maybe \nmore. Yet, I have always said--even though I am a leading \nconservative--there are two areas where I am a big spender. One is in \nnational defense and one is in our infrastructure.\n\n  For that reason, I say to the Presiding Officer, when I was first \nelected back in 1994, I selected two committees to be on. One was the \nArmed Services Committee, where I could try to keep a strong national \ndefense. The other was the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am \nnow the second ranking member on the Armed Services Committee and the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Back when \nthe Republicans were a majority, I was actually the chairman of that \ncommittee. That is when we did our last bill.\n  Our last highway reauthorization bill was in 2005. It was one that \nwent through the process and was very successful. Conservatives and \nliberals alike joined and said this is a major function of America. \nThis is what we are supposed to be doing here.\n  A strong defense and our infrastructure system are not going to be \ndone by anybody else. It is going to have to be done by us. If we want \nto make sure we maintain a strong national defense, which this \nPresident has not been doing with the cuts he has made--actually, we \ncould have as much as $1 trillion in cuts in our defense budget over \nthe next 10 years, all due, quite frankly, to one person. That is \nPresident Obama. So he does not care that much about defending America \nin putting the resources there. Here is a President who, in his own \nbudget, has proposed a deficit each year, for four budgets, of over $1 \ntrillion each year.\n  You would think, with these huge deficits, we would not be having a \nproblem in defense spending, as well as in our roads and highways, in \ncoming up with a bill that would be a transportation reauthorization \nbill. The transportation reauthorization bill for 2005--where I was the \nsponsor of it because I was chairman of the committee--was a $286.4 \nbillion bill. It was one that even at that time barely maintained what \nwas out there already. Certainly I do not have to tell the occupier of \nthe chair from West Virginia that I have been through his State and \nthere is a lot of room for improvements in the road system, and I know \nhe is a strong supporter of this. This is certainly true\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\nin my State of Oklahoma. It happens that my State of Oklahoma is tied, \nthe last time I checked, with Missouri as being dead last in the \nquality of our bridges.\n  We have actually had deaths in Oklahoma. We had a lady not too long \nago in Oklahoma City, the mother of three small children, who was \ndriving and a chunk of concrete came off a bridge and killed her. This \nis serious stuff. This is what we are supposed to be doing here.\n  So we had this bill back in 2005. Since that time, we have been \noperating on extensions. We have done eight extensions. It is kind of \ncomplicated, but I want to explain how this works. The proceeds of the \nhighway trust fund come from the gas tax. About 18 cents, when you buy \ngas at the pump, goes to maintenance of the highways and bridges in \nthat program.\n  The problem has been that in recent years--it started about 10 years \nago--we had surpluses in the highway trust fund, and with other people \nwho wanted to get their deal in on the highway trust fund, we have \nthings that have nothing to do with transportation that are there. That \nis one of the problems we have.\n  But the other problem we have is that through the efforts to \nencourage people to use electric cars and get better mileage and all \nthat, we do not have the proceeds we had in years past. I think \nprobably if we had been smart initially, we would have had the highway \ntrust funded by a percentage as opposed to a ``centage.'' If it is 18 \ncents, it does not make any difference, it is going to be 18 cents. But \nif the price of fuel goes up, if it had been a percentage, then we \nwould not be faced with the situation we have today. So that is what we \nhave.\n  I applaud, I thank Senator Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate, for \nwanting to give it the attention, the priority in getting it on the \nfloor so we can talk about it. In a minute, I will also be very \ncomplimentary of Senator Boxer from California.\n  This is something that is kind of interesting that is unique in \ntransportation only. Here I am ranked always as one of the top three \nmost conservative Members. Senator Boxer from California is a very \nproud liberal. One thing: I do not mind people being liberals if they \nare proud liberals and admit it. Well, she does. She is a liberal. She \nfeels the government should have greater control of some of the things \nwe do. Consequently, she is doing essentially the same thing as the \ncurrent chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee as I \nwould be doing if I had still been chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee; that is, coming up with a highway bill.\n  Well, we are looking at it right now. I have to share with my \ncolleagues on the right--the Republicans, the conservatives--what we \nare looking at. A lot of people do not realize the bill that is coming \nup is a bill of compromise. We actually passed this out of the \ncommittee unanimously. All the Republicans and all the Democrats voted \nfor it. It is a bill where, I have to say, Senator Boxer worked very \nclosely with us. We have reforms in here.\n  Going back to my comment about extensions, if we do not pass a bill, \nwe have to operate on extending the current legislation, the current \nbill, the remnants, I might say, of the 2005 transportation \nreauthorization bill.\n  Now, if we do that, we do not get any reforms. So one of the things \nwe did in this bill that gained the support of the Republicans on the \ncommittee, and most of the Republicans here, was the reforms we had.\n  For example, in this bill we gave--the bill that is up for \nconsideration now--more flexibility to the States. I have long \nbelieved--and I served many years ago in the State legislature--the \ncloser you get to home the more responsible government is. And I can \ntell you right now, giving the flexibility to the States to make these \ndeterminations--who are we to say that we, in our infinite wisdom and \nknowledge in Washington DC, are smarter than they are at the State \nlevel? We are not. Certainly, we do not know the needs like the States \nknow the needs.\n  So we have the situation in this legislation where we are giving more \nflexibility to the States. We are reducing the number of programs. This \nis a big thing. I cannot tell you exactly how many programs there are \nbecause I do not have that in my notes. But I do know we have reduced \nthe number by eliminating and consolidating programs that might be \nduplicative of each other by two-thirds. In other words, we only have \none-third of the programs we had before. That is in this bill. That is \na major improvement.\n  Now, looking, also, at the streamlining of project delivery, we have \nsomething called NEPA. NEPA looks after the environmental concerns when \nwe are building roads and bridges. This bill expands the number of \ncategorical exclusions available under NEPA and allows for steps within \nthe lengthy NEPA process to be combined so we can get things done.\n  You have heard the stories--I am sure you have--of problems with \neverything from endangered species to other environmental concerns that \ncause these things to drag on and on and on, and the expense is so much \ngreater. Well, we are eliminating a lot of those categorical \nexclusions. We are increasing the number so that we will be able to get \nthat much more done.\n  Another thing in this law--this is very complicated--is called \nenhancements. I opposed it back years ago when they started putting \nenhancements on the highway bill. I have always said it is a moral \nissue. When people pay their 18.4 cents a gallon, and it goes into the \nhighway trust fund, they are led to believe that money is going to be \ngoing to transportation, for improving the roads and the bridges. That \nis not quite true because other deals have kind of moved in so that \nthey are involved with it. So they passed this thing called \nenhancements where 2 percent of the total highway funding would have to \ngo to what they called transportation enhancements.\n  A lot of people say 10 percent. It is 10 percent of the States' \nsurface transportation funding or 2 percent of the total highway \nfunding. I would like to do away with the enhancement program \naltogether. Unfortunately, that means we could not get a highway bill.\n  Working with Senator Boxer and with the Democrats in the committee, \nwe came up with the perfect solution. We do not have to eliminate \nenhancements because the solution under this bill will allow the States \nto make the determination as to how they are going to spend that 2 \npercent of their total highway funding. Instead of using it for museums \nand other things that have nothing to do with transportation, we are, \nunder the provisions of this bill that we are talking about, able to \nuse that money for any other requirements for unfunded mandates--and \nthere are plenty of them there, such as endangered species mitigation, \nstorm water runoff, wetlands mitigation. They are a part of every \nproject. So we can take that 2 percent, and instead of applying it to \nenhancements, we can offset the requirements that are there.\n  So for all practical purposes, like in my State of Oklahoma, we are \nnot going to have any of that 2 percent for enhancements. It is not \nthere. We have solved the problem. But we put that in the hands of \nStates. So there will be amendments that would want to do away with \nenhancements. I would say we do not have to do that now because we have \nreformed that process.\n  It is a little bit complicated because we are merely saying that we \nhave a block of money which constitutes 2 percent of the total highway \nfunding, and instead of that going to things that we hear about that \nhave nothing to do with transportation, we do not have to do that \nanymore. That will be up to the States. However, some States may feel \ndifferently. If they do, that is not their problem; that is not my \nproblem.\n  So that is the type of thing we are doing in this bill that has not \nbeen there before. If we do not do it, we would be cutting highway \nspending down to the highway trust fund receipts. That calculates into \na 34-percent cut to the States' road and bridge funding. Right now--to \nput this into perspective so that people will, hopefully, understand \nand listen--we need, and we are in the process of getting, an \nadditional $7.2 billion in order to be able to fund this bill as we \npassed it--$7.2 billion.\n  Stop and think about that. If we go back to the $800 billion stimulus \nbill that President Obama had--I know Senator Boxer agreed with me--\nmore of that should have gone to highway funding. Only 3 percent of \nit--3 percent--went to highway funding. So we\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nare talking about $800 billion which was spent. We are trying to come \nup with $7.2 billion.\n  I have to say this and bring it up. We all remember the $700 billion \nbailout. A lot of Republicans ended up voting for that, and right now \nwe are down to--the cost is probably going to be leveling out at $130 \nbillion. That is the bailout that was passed.\n  Well, $130 billion, when all we are looking for now is $7.2 billion, \nwe cannot say it is not there. As I said when I opened, this President, \nin his budget, has had over $1 trillion in deficit each year for 4 \nyears. Again, that is not the Democrats, not the Republicans, it is not \nthe House, it is not the Senate. That is President Obama. That is his \nbudget. That is the way it works.\n  I have often said when we look at the hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--and yet one of the prime functions we have is \nroads and highways, and we are just $7.2 billion short. I think they \nhave come up with it. I applaud the Finance Committee which has been \nworking on this and recognized it in terms of priority that we ought to \nbe able to do it.\n  They have come up with a package now that--again, this is not in my \nend of it; this is the Finance Committee. A lot of people think the \nhighway bill is all in the Environment and Public Works Committee. It \nis not. We have the Commerce Committee, the Budget Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and our committee. But that end of it is in the \nFinance Committee. They have worked diligently. I appreciate the hard \nwork that has came from the Democrats and the Republicans on that \ncommittee.\n\n  Now, in the event that we do not do this, we are going to go back--it \nwill be our ninth extension. When we have an extension, none of these \nreforms I just talked about, none of them will end up being done. It \nwill just be major cuts in programs.\n  I would only ask this: I would ask any Member of the Senate, before \nyou draw yourself into a box where you are going to be opposed to this, \nwhat you need to do is call your State departments of transportation. \nTalk to them about it. Talk to the chambers. Talk to the labor unions \nback in your States. See what they think. This is one of the few issues \nwhere they are all in agreement--labor, chambers, all of them. They \nrealize we have to have infrastructure in America.\n  I know my State is not the only State that has road problems. But I \nam more familiar with them because that is where I live and raise my 20 \nkids and grandkids. So I would hope that we look at the opportunities \nthat we have in what is called MAP-21. That is the transportation \nreauthorization bill that we have under consideration at this time, and \nthat we will do the responsible thing.\n  If we do rely, by the way, on extensions, our highway trust fund will \nbe totally depleted by this next summer. Then we are going to have to \ndo an extension or be forced to bail out the highway trust fund. We do \nnot want that to happen. We can preclude that from happening. All we \nhave to do is be responsible today.\n  Again, this is one of the few areas where back home organized labor \nas well as business is all for it. Here we have the extremes, such as \nSenator Boxer from California and myself. We both agree this is one of \nthe two primary functions of government. This is our opportunity to do \nit. I hope there will not be people on the outside looking at this and \ncompletely disregarding these hundreds of billions of dollars that, in \nmy opinion, have been wasted and not pay attention to one of the prime \nfunctions of government; that is, doing the infrastructure for the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.)

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about jobs, energy \nindependence, and good environmental stewardship for our country. I \nrise to speak about working with our strongest ally and trading \npartner, Canada. I rise to speak about moving forward on behalf of the \nAmerican people and not delaying, not failing to act in their best \ninterests.\n  Yesterday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper left for China. He \nleft for China with five of his top Ministers, including his Minister \nof Trade and his Minister of Natural Resources. He also took along 40 \nleading businessmen from Canada, including many of their leading \nbusinessmen in the area of energy, oil, and gas. He left on a trade \nmission to China. And what is at the very top of his list? At the very \ntop of his list in his trade mission to China is selling Canadian oil \nto China. Why is that?\n  The reason is because our current administration evidently would \nprefer that we buy oil from the Middle East and from Venezuela rather \nthan buying oil from our closest friend and our No. 1 trading partner, \nCanada.\n  That seems hard to believe but, if not, how else can we explain the \nadministration turning down the Keystone XL Pipeline project after more \nthan 3 years of study--not 60 days but more than 3 years of study. We \nrecently passed legislation in this Chamber and in the House that was \napproved by the President, and in that legislation we said the \nPresident needs to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline within \n60 days of the date of that legislation, but that is after 3 years of \nstudy.\n  The administration came back and said: Well, it cannot make a \ndecision in 60 days but forgot to mention they have been looking at it \nfor over 3 years. In fact, let's go through that timeline. I think it \nis important that the American people understand the real timeline.\n  The real timeline has nothing to do with 60 days. The real timeline \nis more than 3 years that a project has been held in limbo. On \nSeptember 19, 2008, TransCanada applied for a permit to build the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. That is more than 3 years ago. Both the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the State Department said they \nwould have an answer on the project before the end of last year. They \nmade it very clear that after going through the full NEPA process--\nincluding the full environmental impact statement, doing all of the due \ndiligence, all the work over more than a 3-year period--they would have \nan answer before the end of the year.\n  The administration then says: No, that is not enough time. We don't \nhave enough time in more than 3 years to make a decision, so the \ndecision is null. You ask: Why would that be? Is this such a unique \nproject that we have never done this before; that after more than 3 \nyears of study--not 60 days--this is so unique we cannot make a \ndecision in that amount of time? So the administration says no.\n  On this chart we see this red line that runs from Hardisty, which is \nAlberta, Canada, all the way down to Patoka, IL, to refineries we have \nin this country. This is the Keystone Pipeline. That was approved in 2 \nyears, roughly 2006 to 2008, and then constructed. It now moves almost \n600,000 barrels of oil a day from the Canadian oil sands down to our \nrefineries. So that project already exists. We are talking about \nbuilding a sister pipeline, the Keystone XL Pipeline, that will bring \nit from the\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\nCalgary area, the Province of Alberta, Canada, down to Cushing, which \nis a major oil hub, and our refineries in the gulf.\n  So it is not a new concept; we are already doing it. This pipeline \ncarries almost 600,000 barrels a day. The new pipeline would carry \n830,000 barrels a day.\n  It is not just about Canada. It is not just about moving Canadian \ncrude to our refineries. My home State of North Dakota, and Montana, \nproduce oil as well--light, sweet, Bakken crude--good stuff. We need to \nget that product to market as well; 100,000 barrels a day from North \nDakota and Montana will go into this pipeline. Now, that is incredibly \nimportant to States such as North Dakota and Montana because right now \nwe have to move that product by truck and by train. There is incredible \nwear and tear on our roads, and with the congestion on our roads, there \nare also traffic accidents and traffic fatalities.\n  Mr. President, 100,000 barrels a day represents 500 truck loads a day \non some of our highways in western North Dakota and eastern Montana.\n  This pipeline would reduce the number of truck miles to move that \nproduct by 17 million truck miles a year. So it is not just about \nmoving that product from Canada to our refineries, it is about moving \nour own crude, crude that we produce in this country to market. Our \nStates need that vital infrastructure, and the government is not \nbuilding this infrastructure--not one penny of tax money, not one penny \nof Federal Government spending. This is a $7 billion-plus investment \nfrom the private sector to give us the infrastructure we need to get \nour oil to our refineries.\n  So it is not a new project. It has been done before.\n  As a matter of fact, as my next chart shows, not only has this been \ndone before, but the Obama administration has approved similar projects \nbefore.\n  In August of 2009 the current administration approved a 1,000-mile \npipeline that moves 800,000 barrels of oil a day that is moving oil \nright now. They approved this project in August 2009. It came online in \nOctober 2010. It goes from the Province of Alberta down to refineries \nin Wisconsin. So they approved it in August 2009.\n  So what is going on here? Well, the issue they have talked about is \nthat they have to delay this because of the western Sandhills region of \nNebraska. The western Sandhills region of Nebraska includes something \ncalled the Ogallala Aquifer. The Ogallala Aquifer is obviously very \nimportant for water supply and irrigation. That is here in western \nNebraska, so that concern has been raised. So we put forward \nlegislation that addresses that issue.\n  We put forward legislation that follows the lead of the State of \nNebraska and says: We will reroute the pipeline in Nebraska. For \nexample, rerouting it over here where there is already the existing \nKeystone Pipeline. But in the legislation we put forward we say we will \nreroute the pipeline in Nebraska; that issue will be fully addressed, \nand we do not set a timeline on doing it and we expressly provide that \nwe work with the State of Nebraska to do it.\n  Nebraska had a special session in November. After their special \nsession where we all agreed to do the rerouting, the State of \nNebraska--their legislature, their Governor, and their Senators--\nsupported the project. They said: Yes, we need to move forward with the \nproject.\n  As you can see, there are many pipelines through there already. \nNevertheless, we said: OK, the administration said that is an issue. We \ndo the rerouting and we set no time limit to do it. So why aren't we \nproceeding with the project? What are we waiting for? And what are the \nramifications of waiting? Look at all these pipelines. This is not a \nnew concept.\n  So I take a step back to what I mentioned earlier: What is going on \nhere? Why is it that Prime Minister Harper, the Prime Minister of \nCanada in China today, is arranging to sell oil that they produce in \nCanada to China rather than to us in the United States when we need it \nso badly--not just for our economy, not just for the jobs, but for \nenergy security at a time of incredible upheaval in the Middle East? \nNow this oil is going to go to China. What is going on here?\n  Well, the only thing that I guess we can figure is that the \nadministration has decided they don't want oil produced from the \nCanadian oil sands. They have decided they don't want oil that is \nproduced in Canada in the oil sands. The argument is that somehow that \noil will have higher greenhouse gas emissions, so we are not going to \ntake it and somehow that is not going to be produced. So it is an \nenvironmental issue. The only problem with that is that it is going to \nbe produced. It just won't come to us, it will go to China. And maybe \nan even bigger irony--although certainly not a bigger problem but a \nbigger irony--is that the environmental stewardship will then be worse, \nnot better. So if that is the argument, it is going in the wrong \ndirection.\n\n  This oil, which will be produced up here--that is exactly the \nagreement Prime Minister Harper is now working on with China and, \nbelieve me, China wants the oil. There is no question about that. They \nhave made it very clear. While we continue to put Canada on hold, China \nis working very hard to make sure that oil comes to them.\n  Lets talk about the environmental aspect of that. Now, instead of \nbringing this oil in a pipeline down to our refineries--the best \ntechnology in the world in terms of refining, so we put it in a \npipeline and we have lower emissions in the very best refineries in the \nworld--we are going to put this oil in thousands and thousands of \ntankers that have to go across the ocean, producing greenhouse gases, \nand it is going to be refined in China, where they have lower emission \nstandards, meaning higher emissions. They don't have the same standards \nwe do, so we end up with more greenhouse gas, and yet at the same time \nwe continue to have tankers of oil coming in from the Middle East \nproducing more greenhouse gas because we can't get the oil from Canada.\n  So if that is the argument, what are we doing? We are saying: OK, we \nare going to say no to the jobs and we are going to say no to the fact \nthat we can be energy independent in terms of oil. Between the United \nStates and Canada, we can be independent in our oil needs. We won't \nneed to get oil from Venezuela and we won't need to get oil from the \nMiddle East--a huge national security issue. Look at what is going on \nin Syria and look at what is going on in Egypt and look at what is \ngoing on in Iran. Look at what is going on with the price of gasoline. \nWe can become oil independent with our best friend and ally, Canada, \nbut we say no instead. After 3 years, we are going to say no to the \nproject, so Canada sells it to China and we get worse environmental \nstewardship.\n  I hope the American people fully understand exactly what is going on \nhere because it is time to act. Right now, Prime Minister Harper is \ntalking to President Hu Jintao, the President of China and, believe me, \nChina wants the oil. Prime Minister Harper and Canada, our closest ally \nin the world, have waited 3 years--3 years--to get a ``no'' answer from \nthe administration. So we will see what kind of agreement he comes back \nwith from China.\n  The reality is, it is time to act. Here are some of the pipelines \nthat are moving crude oil and other product around our country. Do we \nreally think that is a problem, particularly when we put in \nlegislation--when we went specifically and found out what the \nadministration's concern was and we solved it and we built it into the \nlegislation? The time has come to act. I call on my colleagues to join \nme. We put forward legislation that addresses the concerns. But it is \ntime to act for the good of the American people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator rescind the suggestion, \nplease.\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

Mr. President, the January jobs report shows that \nPresident Obama and many others have joined to help put our economy on \nthe path to recovery. The economy added 257,000 private sector jobs in \nJanuary. That is the 23rd month in a row that the economy has added \nprivate sector jobs, for a total of 3.7 million payroll jobs over that \nsame period.\n  In January, the unemployment rate fell again from 8.5 to 8.3 percent. \nThe unemployment rate has fallen .8 percent since August. That is the \nfirst time in almost 17 years that the unemployment rate has fallen for \n5 consecutive months.\n  Job growth is occurring across many sectors of our economy. In \nIllinois, we are seeing manufacturing jobs return, some from overseas, \nand across the country last month the manufacturing sector added 50,000 \nnew good-paying jobs.\n  Don't get me wrong, we still have a long way to go. We have to \nquickly agree on the extension of the payroll tax cut, which will \nexpire in just a few days. We have to ensure that unemployment benefits \nfor those looking for work are continued. We are on the right track, \nbut we shouldn't rest in our efforts to foster an economy that is built \nto last.\n  I am not a deficit and debt denier. I understand the gravity of our \nfiscal challenge, and we need to work to resolve these problems. I hope \nmy work on the President's fiscal commission and as part of the Gang of \n6 shows a commitment to this issue. However, as Ben Bernanke, Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, said last week:\n\n       Even as fiscal policymakers address the urgent issue of \n     fiscal sustainability, they should take care not to \n     necessarily impede the current economic recovery.\n       Fortunately, the two goals of achieving long-term fiscal \n     sustainability and avoiding additional fiscal headwinds for \n     the current recovery are fully compatible--indeed, they are \n     mutually reinforcing.\n       On the one hand, a more robust recovery will lead to lower \n     deficits and debt in coming years. On the other hand, a plan \n     that clearly and credibly puts fiscal policy on a path to \n     sustainability could help keep longer-term interest rates low \n     and improve household and business confidence, thereby \n     supporting improved economic performance today.\n\n  We can grow our economy and reduce the deficit. In fact, it is \narguable that we can't balance our books or the budget with 14 million \npeople out of work. We have to work to put this economy back on its \nfeet, to put Americans back to work earning good incomes, paying their \nfair share of taxes, and sustaining a growing economy.\n  A credible deficit reduction plan will include investments that look \nto the future. Not only can we be fiscally responsible and still invest \nin infrastructure, education, and innovation, we can only be fiscally \nresponsible if we do make those investments. Failing to invest in the \nfuture is a recipe for more intractable fiscal problems in the years to \ncome.\n  Those who say just cut spending and ignore the consequences ignore \nthe reality. There are those who say that government spending is \nholding our economy back. They say that if we cut government spending, \nsomehow we are going to enliven and rejuvenate this economy. History \ntells us quite a different story. President Clinton presided over the \nstrongest period of private sector growth in recent memory, and he did \nso while government spending grew every year from 1995 to 2000. In 3 of \nthose years, President Clinton generated a balanced budget--the last \nbalanced budget we have seen in Washington.\n  It is clear to me that we should be heartened by the recent positive \neconomic data, but we can't mistake it for a signal to retreat. We have \nto continue working to build a strong and fiscally sound economy for \nthe 21st century. A critical element in that is unemployment insurance. \nThe January report, as I mentioned, says we are on the road to \nrecovery, adding 257,000 private sector jobs, with the unemployment \nrate dipping from 8.5 to 8.3 percent. Even with these gains, more than \n12\\1/2\\ million people are still unemployed and actively looking for \nwork. Even more concerning is the number of longer term unemployed, \nwhich remains at about 5.5 million. The trouble finding work isn't due \nto lack of initiative. We need more jobs. And until there are more jobs \navailable, we should maintain unemployment insurance benefits at \ncurrent levels.\n  Maintaining the current level of Federal unemployment insurance has \nproven to be one of the best things Congress can do to breathe life \ninto this economy. The Congressional Budget Office--respected and \nbipartisan--estimates that every dollar we put into unemployment \ninsurance not only goes into the economy but is respent and is worth \n$1.90 in economic activity. Late last year, the Economic Policy \nInstitute estimated that extending Federal unemployment benefits for 1 \nadditional year generates $72 billion in economic growth, creating over \n560,000 jobs over the course of the year.\n  An estimated 3.2 million people were kept out of poverty simply \nbecause of unemployment insurance checks. As of the end of last year, \n200,000 individuals were collecting unemployment in Illinois, with 43 \npercent of those unemployed people having children in their homes.\n  I came to the floor today to reinforce for my colleagues and the \nconferees working on the payroll tax-unemployment insurance bill that \nthis isn't just about numbers, it is about real lives.\n  I received a letter from Laurel in December, who does a far better \njob of illustrating the role of unemployment benefits than anything I \ncan say. Here is what Laurel wrote:\n\n       Thank you for working late nights. I am from Evanston, IL. \n     I graduated from Evanston Township High School. My position \n     as Ethics and Compliance Manager in a large multi-national \n     conglomerate was eliminated last December 2010.\n       I am trained as a lawyer, and have worked in international \n     law, economics and policy. In addition to a law degree, I \n     have a Master of Science in International Relations from the \n     London School of Economics. I wrote my thesis about US trade \n     policy, the now expired Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, \n     and international economics and labor at LSE.\n       After working for a think tank in London on democracy and \n     participation, I went to law school. During law school, I \n     interned at the United Nations and later for the legal and \n     regulatory group of a Wall Street research service.\n       I was working in the legal department of Smiths Group on \n     international compliance issues when I was laid off. While \n     working for Smiths Group, I studied for an LLM in \n     international comparative law in the evenings.\n       After being laid off, I received severance from my previous \n     employer and was able to get a short-term contract with the \n     World Bank after only a few weeks of unemployment. However, \n     since the end of that contract in July, I have not been able \n     to find a job or get a contract.\n       My first phase of unemployment ended in November. I have \n     now been receiving unemployment insurance payments for 7 \n     months, just beginning Phase II. If unemployment insurance \n     extensions are not renewed, I understand I will no longer \n     receive payments.\n       I am a 38-year-old single female living alone. My parents \n     are elderly, and my mother was just diagnosed with breast \n     cancer. My dad has had two strokes in the last 6 years.\n       I am paying $402 a month in COBRA payments to keep my \n     health insurance. I rent an apartment and unemployment just \n     barely covers my rent. I have been living on savings since \n     July. Without the help of unemployment, I will not be able to \n     pay my rent, and I am terrified.\n       I have had over 20 informational interviews and applied to \n     42 jobs since I first heard my job might be eliminated last \n     November.\n       The extension of unemployment insurance means something to \n     me personally. I need more time. I believe at least with some \n     of the applications I have submitted in both the private \n     sector and government agencies, the companies have not hired \n     anyone despite posting a job. I believe many companies are \n     waiting to see what will happen with government contracts, \n     and agencies are stalled due to the hiring freeze or funding. \n     I know something has to come through soon . . . I support the \n     efforts to support the extension of unemployment benefits.\n\n  Is this an example of someone who is not trying, someone who is not \ntrained and educated? Just the opposite. Here is a person who clearly \nhas been driven her entire life to develop skills, to challenge \nherself, to improve her ability to earn and learn, and here she is out \nof work and desperate. She doesn't know which way to turn. She is \nsingle. She may not be able to pay her rent. Are unemployment benefits \nimportant for her to keep her on the track of finding a job? Of course \nthey are. The money we give her will be spent back into the economy to \ncreate a better economic climate.\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\n  I have received thousands of letters along these lines in the last 2 \nyears. If Congress doesn't move quickly to maintain unemployment \ninsurance benefits, millions of workers relying on this program will be \nleft without a lifeline. The Joint Economic Committee estimates that \n3.3 million workers will exhaust benefits by June if we fail to act--\nnearly 170,000 in Illinois. I am concerned about what this will do to \nour country and especially what it will do to these people--our \nneighbors, members of our families, friends, folks who just need a \nhelping hand.\n  Prematurely ending unemployment insurance or the payroll tax cut \nwould make our economic recovery more difficult. There may be some \npolitical strategists who would applaud that, saying: Well, a little \nbit of pain for a few months here and we can change that President into \nanother person. Let someone else take the job.\n  I think that is very shortsighted. Of course, I support the \nPresident, make no mistake about it, but to sacrifice the well-being of \nthis country and the growth of our economy for the sake of an election \nis just plain wrong.\n  Conferees in the Congress must act soon to maintain a robust \nunemployment insurance system for those still struggling to find work. \nNow is not the time to roll back unemployment insurance.\n\n\n                        Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. President, there is one other issue I would like to raise at this \npoint, and it is one I have worked on for some period of time with \nSenator Mike Enzi. It relates to a phenomena all of us are aware of--\nInternet sales. There is hardly an American with access to a computer \nwho doesn't buy something on the computer. I do, and lots of families \ndo--some of the basics, in addition to some other things that may be \njust aspirational purchasing. But the interesting thing that has \nhappened over the years is we have allowed the Internet retailer to \nhave a different position when it comes to their tax liability.\n  I talked to a lot of local businesses in Illinois, small businesses, \nbusinesses on Main Street. Some of them think things are getting better \nand I do too. They sense the worst may be behind us and the future is \nlooking brighter. But at the same time, they share with me the \nfrustration they have currently now with customers coming into their \nshops and businesses looking for everything from running shoes to \nsporting equipment--you name it--and then, just about the time when \nthey have tried on the second or third pair of shoes, looked in the \nmirror, got everything squared away as to what they are going to buy, \nthey sometimes pull out their phones, turn on an app, and take a \npicture of the barcode on the product.\n  You see, there is an app which allows a person to find out where they \ncan buy that very same product cheapest on the Internet. So here is the \nlocal retailer doing their part to make a sale, and it turns out they \nget nothing from the experience.\n  What is the advantage that Internet sellers have over those who have \nbusinesses on streets and highways across America? One advantage \nrelates to sales tax. In my home State of Illinois, the payment of \nsales tax on Internet purchases is voluntary and personal. If one does \nnot declare it and pay it, it is not collected. We are supposed to pay \nit, but many people do not. So those selling on the Internet, subject \nto local sales tax, in fact are not collecting that sales tax. I think \nthat can change and should.\n  Becky Anderson owns Anderson Bookstores in Naperville, IL--a great \nlittle town. She described to me how she loses sales every day because \nconsumers walk in, ask her questions, and then buy an item online from \nremote retailers because they do not collect sales tax.\n  Becky understands most customers do not realize they do owe the sales \ntax to the State of Illinois and local units of the government. They \nsay:\n\n       This runaway train may undermine more than our bottom \n     lines. It's not a stretch to say entire Main Street districts \n     could disappear.\n\n  That is Becky's conclusion after having watched what happens with \nthese Internet sales not collecting sales tax.\n  She talks about how a local shoestore in downtown Naperville was \nforced to close and lay off employees, strictly because of Internet \nsales. The local business owner, Michael Abt, president of Electronics, \nin Glenview, IL, described in detail how our current system results in \na built-in price advantage for Internet retailers. Mike said:\n\n       Oftentimes with consumer electronics, the profit margin is \n     10 percent or less. Abt collects 9.25 percent sales tax. When \n     an online competitor does not collect it and then offers free \n     shipping, it is a huge advantage for [his] competition.\n\n  Local businesses will never be able to compete if we continue to \nprovide a built-in price advantage for online retailers by exempting \nthem from sales and use tax collection. There was a time, I guess--and \nI heard the argument here--that we did not consider the sales tax for \nonline sales because, the argument was made, they may not survive; it \nis a fledgling industry.\n  That day is long gone. They are certainly not fledgling; they are in \nfull flight.\n  Over the past decade, online retail has become an important part of \nAmerican commerce. Online retail allows customers to compare prices, \nshop around right in the comfort of their living room. At the same \ntime, local businesses such as Anderson Bookstores in Naperville \ncompete with online retailers by trying to provide good service at the \nlowest prices they can. These local businesses also invest in our \ncommunities. They hire local workers. They pay local property taxes. \nThey are involved in communities supporting baseball teams and charity \nefforts in their community. They are our neighbors and they deserve a \nfair shake.\n  Last year, Senator Enzi, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and I joined \nin introducing the Marketplace Fairness Act, with seven additional \ncosponsors--Senators Tim Johnson, Boozman, Jack Reed, Blunt of \nMissouri, Whitehouse, Corker and Pryor. We recently added Senators \nBennet and Cardin. This bipartisan group of Senators understands we \nhave to do more to ensure a fair marketplace for American businesses. \nThe bill will level the playing field for Main Street businesses and \nlimit the current built-in price advantage given to online retailers. \nIt allows States to treat brick and mortar retailers the same as online \nretailers by providing two streamlined approaches for States to require \ncollection of both sales and use taxes.\n  The bill also includes a small seller exemption that will ensure \nsmall online retailers are exempt from the requirement to collect sales \nand use taxes. The notion is that if Grandma Franken has an apple \nbutter recipe and makes a few cases each year to the delight of all her \nneighbors, she will not be burdened with this responsibility of selling \nit online and collecting sales tax.\n  Let me be clear. This bill does not impose any new taxes. This bill \ndoes not raise taxes, period. It does not amend the Internal Revenue \nCode at all. It simply is a collection issue that for too long has put \nlocal businesses at a disadvantage. The real job creators in America, \nmany of them, are the small businesses in our communities that struggle \nto get by every day, and when they get better and they get well, \nAmerica gets well. Now is the time to help these retailers.\n  It also is going to help State and local budgets, those that are \ntrying to make ends meet in a tough economy. I hope we can get this \ndone and done quickly.\n  One thing I would like to add. The largest online retailer in \nAmerica, amazon.com, supports our legislation. We are not at war with \nonline retailers. They have concluded it is best to have a uniform, \nstreamlined system that uses available software for collection from a \nretailer and distribution through the State departments of revenue. It \nis voluntary. We do not impose a mandate on any State to adopt this, \nalthough I think every one of them will, and this moves us finally in \nthe direction of fairness--fairness not only for those who are doing \nthe bricks and mortar sales but fairness for all customers and all \nretailers across America.\n  I commend this bill to all colleagues. If we truly believe, as many \nof us have spoken time and again, in the value of small business to \neconomic recovery, most small businesspeople will tell you this is a \ncritical element in their competitive edge and their ability to hire \nmore people and be able to be profitable all across the Nation.\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Madam President, I rise today to call upon the President \nof the United States to rescind one of the most radical and \nunconstitutional mandates ever issued, a mandate that requires faith-\nbased organizations, hospitals, and educational institutions to provide \nand pay for health insurance coverage that violates the fundamental \ntenets of their faith.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed so deeply in the importance of \nreligious freedom that they made it the very first American principle \nin the Bill of Rights. The first amendment to the Constitution reads, \nin part:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n  On January 20, the Obama administration announced one of the greatest \ndeviations from this constitutional guarantee of religious freedom in \nour Nation's history. This Federal rule is a blatant assault on the \nconscience rights of any organization or any individual who opposes \nabortion or the use of contraceptives.\n  While I am a pro-life Senator and believe that life begins at \nconception, I am not someone that supports banning contraception. But I \ndo support the right of those who hold the belief that those tenets \nshould be respected, and that Federal mandates, Federal regulations, \nand Federal laws should not be used to overturn that belief.\n  I do not believe this ruling was an oversight. The Obama \nadministration doubled down on its ruling by ignoring the numerous \nefforts by faith-based organizations to be granted an exemption. This \nissue is not a debate over whether the use of contraceptives is right \nor wrong. This is not a debate over whether the health care law is the \nright policy or the wrong policy. I do believe personally that the \nObamaCare policy is the wrong policy for this Nation. But this is a \ndebate over whether the Congress is going to sit idly by and watch the \nadministration walk all over freedom of religion--and not just the \nCongress but the institutions of America and the people of America--a \ncore American principle or will we stand and protect what our Founding \nFathers put their lives on the line for and what millions of Americans \npractice each day.\n  Catholic institutions, whether they be social services or \nuniversities such as the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, will \nhave one of two choices: they can either pay for health insurance that \ncovers things such as sterilization or birth control, despite their \ndeeply held religious objections, or they can refuse to offer any sort \nof health insurance to their employees, which will result in these \norganizations facing significant fines and penalties while their \nemployees are forced to seek health insurance elsewhere.\n  In other words, the Obama administration is saying: Compromise your \nreligious beliefs to comply with our massive Federal health care law or \nyou and your employees will face a penalty.\n  While this decision will greatly impact many in the Catholic faith, \nit will also extend beyond a singular religious denomination. A wide \nvariety of religious institutions and organizations across the country \nwill resist providing insurance coverage for birth control. Cardinal-\ndesignate Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference on Catholic \nBishops, said:\n\n       Never before has the Federal Government forced individuals \n     and organizations to go out into the marketplace and buy a \n     product that violates their conscience. This shouldn't happen \n     in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in the \n     Bill of Rights.\n\n  Although a blatant violation of the first amendment, this ruling is a \nculmination of attacks on religious and faith-based organizations by \nthis administration. I fear, as Washington Post columnist Michael \nGerson noted in his article today, that such a trend will threaten the \ngood work being done by faith-based groups--of any faith--whether it be \nCatholic, Protestant, Jewish or Muslim. Any group or nonprofit hospital \nor charity that is working to provide services to people in need now \nhas to compromise their basic religious tenets in order to continue to \nprovide that insurance coverage for their employees or pay a fine by \nnot doing so.\n  There have been some bills introduced in the Senate to rescind this. \nI would hope that those in the administration who are listening to the \npeople and listening to the protests that are being made against this \nalmost unconscionable mandate will not stand by idly and wait to see \nwhether Congress will act because we will act. We will act as soon as \nwe can. I would hope that they would reconsider this sweeping \nunconstitutional ruling which is in direct violation of the first \namendment.\n  George Washington once said:\n\n       Every man, conducting himself as a good citizen and being \n     accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to \n     be protected in worshiping the Deity according to the \n     dictates of his own conscience.\n\n  We must take a stand to protect this inalienable right, the right of \nconscience established by our Founding Fathers and sustained for over \n200 years.\n  Mr. President, you can undo this wrong by rescinding this mandate \nthat has been imposed in violation of the most basic of human rights \nand principles of our Constitution. I am calling on you to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask that I be recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to add my \nvoice in opposition to President Obama's unwillingness to respect the \nconscience rights of religious institutions.\n  On January 20, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a \nmandate requiring almost all private health insurance policies, \nincluding those issued by religious institutions, to cover free \nsterilizations and contraceptives at no cost to policyholders.\n  What this means, in simple terms, is that churches are exempt from \nthe mandate, but institutions such as church-run universities, \nhospitals, and nonprofits must comply with the government regulation. \nTherefore, in order to continue to operate, these church-run \ninstitutions must violate the very beliefs that inspire them to care \nfor the least among us.\n  I would not be surprised to see many of these faith-based \ninstitutions disappear should this mandate move forward. Despite the \nPresident's contention this outcome is not what he intends, his mandate \nunfairly forces people to choose between their health and their moral \nor religious values.\n  Many parents, Christians and others, object to sterilization, agents \nthat abort, and contraceptives. Americans should not have to pay for \nservices or health care plans that conflict with their deeply held \nreligious beliefs. This is purely a political decision on the part of \nthe administration, and it shows that President Obama will do whatever \nnecessary to appease his base and protect his own job, even if it means \nthe blatant infringement on first amendment rights.\n  With this mandate, President Obama is not only trampling religious \nliberties, he is also confirming what many feared when this health care \nbill became law. Americans saw this massive expansion of government as \na threat to individual rights. This mandate, one of the first based on \nthe President's health care bill, does little to comfort those \nconcerns. In fact, it comes across as confirmation the President \nintends to force on us his belief that he knows what is best for \nAmericans when it comes to our health care choices.\n  In an effort to fight the administration's overreach, I have joined \nwith several of my colleagues in supporting legislation to protect \nfreedom of conscience and prohibit the government from imposing \nmandates on our religious employers. Religious institutions play a \ncritical role in our communities. If Federal policies make it difficult \nfor those institutions to continue important social services without \ngoing\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\nagainst their principles, it will hurt the least fortunate among us by \nthreatening the much-needed assistance and outreach provided by \nreligious groups across the Nation.\n  The seemingly endless number of regulations this administration has \nhanded down to the American people needs to end.

The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S371-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S371-S372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHILD FARM LABOR RULES\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am here today to raise once again a \ntopic about how we raise our children in rural America, and I want to \ntalk for a few moments about the proposed Department of Labor child \nfarm labor rules.\n  Last week, we had perhaps what would be considered a piece of good \nnews. The Department of Labor announced it would withdraw and repropose \nthe parental exemption portion of their proposed child labor rules. I \nam worried, however, despite this good news, there are still a lot of \nconsequences that will occur as a result of the proposed rules that are \nnot being withdrawn, and there is no suggestion they are going to be \nreproposed.\n  The thing I want to make clear to my colleagues is that while the \nDepartment of Labor announced they were going to withdraw a portion of \nthe rules, unfortunately, the majority of what is going to be \noffensive, difficult, and a challenge for our way of life in rural \nAmerica remains.\n  Last year, of their own volition--no direction by Congress--the \nDepartment of Labor proposed a set of rules to put restrictions in \nplace upon a young person's ability to work on a farm, including their \nown family farm. What we are talking about here is youth less than 16 \nyears of age. Those rules, as proposed, would actually restrict the \nability of a son or daughter to work on their parents' farm.\n  The current rule is that if your parents own a substantial interest \nof that farming operation, you can work on your family's farm. The \nrules as proposed by the DOL are going to narrow that definition, as \nfollows: If your family operates in a family farming corporation or a \nlimited liability company, these new restrictions would apply. \nFortunately, that portion of the proposed rules the Department of Labor \nhas withdrawn, and I assume they will be reproposing what their \ndefinition of a family farm is.\n  The point I want to make is that so much of the proposed rules yet \nremain, and the remaining portions of the rules still threaten to \nfundamentally alter agriculture as we know it today. If the DOL rules, \nas now proposed, go forward, the education and training for the next \ngeneration of farmers and ranchers will be severely disrupted.\n  We have relied upon 4-H, FFA, and county extension programs to \nprovide farm safety training and certification for a long time. The \nDepartment of Labor now says they no longer want those programs to \nqualify because they are too local. They want a national standard. They \nwant to replace with a Department of Labor safety training program what \nhas traditionally and very effectively occurred through 4-H, FFA, and \ncounty extension programs.\n  The Department has, in my view, ignored research that shows the \nprograms we currently have in place with FFA and 4-H and county \nextension improve the safety habits of young people, and instead \ncriticizes these training programs for being too locally driven and \nlacking Federal direction. Their solution is to nationalize these \nprograms and have them run by the Department of Labor. In my view, \nlocal experts in our high schools, our FFA programs, and our 4-H clubs \nshould be the ones conducting training programs and educating our young \npeople. And parents and communities should be allowed to look after the \nbest interests of their families and their communities and citizens.\n  The Department of Labor, in addition to attacking the programs that \nare in place, that are valuable to us in rural America, is also \nproposing to change the so-called agricultural hazard occupations. The \nproposed rules would prohibit a young person under the age of 16 from \nparticipating--even with the certification and safety training from the \nDepartment of Labor--in doing such things as rounding up cattle on \nhorseback or operating a tractor.\n  The proposed rules say you cannot be involved in production \nagriculture if you are more than 6 feet off the ground. In today's \nenvironment, in today's agriculture, tractors and combines are 6 feet \noff the ground.\n\n  You can't clean out a stall with a shovel and a wheelbarrow. Those \nare things I am sure the 15-year-old does not want to do, but they are \nimportant to a family's farming operation, they are important to \nagriculture and of value to a young person in their training and \ndeveloping skills that are important to them for the rest of their \nlife.\n  They can't work in a pen with a bull or mama cow. Here is one that \nreally stands out to me: No engaging or assisting in animal husbandry \npractices that ``inflict pain upon the animal,'' such as branding, \nbreeding, dehorning vaccinating, castrating, and treating sick animals. \nThe ``inflicting pain'' restriction sounds like something more than an \ninterest--``inflicting pain'' sounds like a different standard than \nreally worrying about the young person's safety. These are important \ntasks that have to be done on a farm and that young people can safely \ndo.\n  One additional example that stands out to me is that they are \nsuggesting in the rules that they would limit a young person's exposure \nto direct sunlight if the temperature reaches a certain limit once you \nfactor in wind velocity and humidity. How does that work in the \npractical world of agriculture and farming today? For someone in \nWashington, DC, to propose rules that restrict a young person's ability \nto work on a neighbor's farm because of the amount of sunlight, wind \nvelocity, and humidity is something that again, in my view, \ndemonstrates a lack of understanding about how things work in the real \nworld.\n  One would assume the Department of Labor, before making such drastic \nchanges to farm labor rules, would have identified reliable evidence \nand data to show the need for changes. In fact, the Department of Labor \nadmits it lacks the data to justify many of its suggested changes.\n  Furthermore, according to the National Farm Medicine Center, youth-\nrelated injuries from farm accidents have declined nearly 60 percent \nfrom 1998 to 2009. I have no doubt that if you ask a farmer or a \nrancher about the importance of safety, they would tell you that safety \nis a top concern, especially when they are dealing with a young person. \nBut they would also tell you that critical to a rural way of life is \nbeing able to train and encourage the next generation to safely and \nsuccessfully pursue careers in agriculture. If today's young person is \nnot given the chance to learn at a young age what it takes to operate a \nfarm, we put at risk the future of agriculture in our Nation.\n  I have always had a strong interest in agriculture. The economy of my \nState of Kansas revolves in many ways around the success of farmers and \nranchers. Communities across our State are dependent upon the success, \nthe profitability of production agriculture. But I also have known and \nstrongly believe there is something more than just economics to family \nfarms. This is the way that historically, in our country, in our \nNation's history, we have transmitted our character, our values, our \nintegrity, our love of life, and our understanding of how things work \nfrom generation to generation. It has worked. It has been an important \ncomponent of our country's history, who we are as American people.\n  Today, across Kansas, when I visit with business owners, they tell me \nthey love to hire farm kids because they have a different \ncharacteristic, a different makeup, a standard that is different from \nother people. They learn something about reliability and that work does \nnot get done if you do not show up, that it is not about punching the \nclock to check in and to check out, that a calf is born at times that \nare inconvenient to a farmer. There is just a different set of \ncharacteristics a young person develops by growing up and working on a \nfamily farm. If these changes go into effect--and the rule as\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nproposed is being considered, and it is expected we will have an answer \nfrom the Department of Labor within several months as to what the final \nregulations will be--if these rules go into effect as they are written, \nnot only will we see a shrinking rural workforce, but our Nation's \nyouth will be deprived of valuable career-training opportunities and a \ncertain way of life many of us highly value will disappear.\n  It is important to us as a country--certainly to a State such as \nmine--that a young person experience the value of farming. I do not \nknow how many times you talk to somebody who has determined what their \ncareer is going to be based on an experience they had as a young person \nand their ability to know what they want to do with their life is \ndetermined by the experiences they had as a young child. Our country \ncannot afford to lose the next generation of farmers and ranchers.\n  This rule should be withdrawn in its entirety. We know rural \nAmerica's values are not always Washington values, and in the weeks \nahead I ask my colleagues and Americans across the country to express \ntheir opposition to the Department of Labor for this destructive rule. \nDo not allow it to move forward so we can protect our values for the \nnext generation of American farmers and make sure rural America remains \na great place to live, grow, and raise a family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am pleased to rise in the Senate \ntoday to congratulate Eli Manning and the New York Giants football team \nfor their great victory in the National Football League championship \ngame. As most Senators probably know, Eli is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Mississippi and he lives in Oxford, MS, during the off-\nseason.\n  The Giants' 21-to-17 victory was the second NFL championship for this \nteam in the last 4 years.\n  Eli Manning began the game by completing his first nine passes, which \nwas a new Super Bowl record, and he was named the Most Valuable Player \nof the game. He became the fifth player in NFL history to win multiple \nSuper Bowl Most Valuable Player awards. During the regular season, \nManning threw for 4,933 yards and 29 touchdown passes, including a NFL \nrecord of 15 touchdown passes in fourth quarters. He also led six game-\nwinning drives that allowed the Giants to overcome deficits in the \nfinal stage of their games.\n  Manning and his wife Abby have supported many worthy causes and have \nmade a strong commitment to the health and education of young people in \nMississippi. They have made a pledge to raise $2.5 million for the Eli \nManning Children's Clinic at the Hospital for Children in Jackson, MS, \nand they have also donated $1 million to start the Ole Miss Opportunity \nScholarship Program, which helps children in Mississippi with special \nfinancial needs to have the opportunity to attend college.\n  Manning has served as a member of President Bush's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports and is active with many other \norganizations, such as the March of Dimes and the American Red Cross. \nHis commitment to voluntarism and national service is very impressive \nand worthy of high praise.\n  I am very proud to congratulate Eli Manning and the New York Giants \nas Super Bowl champions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, throughout my Senate career I have \nspent a lot of time defending the first amendment. Most of it I spent \ndefending one particular clause of that amendment, the one relating to \nthe right of free speech, but recent events have shown quite \nunexpectedly the urgent need to defend another clause in the first \namendment. I am referring, of course, to the right of free exercise of \nreligion.\n  Make no mistake, the Obama administration's decision to force \nreligious hospitals, charities, and schools to comply with a mandate \nthat violates their religious views is abhorrent to the foundational \nprinciples of our Nation. No one in the United States--no one--should \never be compelled by their government to choose between violating their \nreligious beliefs and being penalized for refusing. Yet that is \nprecisely what this mandate would do.\n  One out of six patients in America is treated at a Catholic hospital. \nCatholic Charities is the largest provider of social services to poor \nchildren, families, and individuals in America. The Catholic Church \nruns the largest network of private schools in this country. These \ninstitutions have thrived because they have been allowed to freely \npursue their religious convictions in a country that, until now, \nrespected their constitutional right to do so. But this ruling should \nsend a chill up the spine of people of all religious faiths and even of \nthose with no faith at all because if the state--in this case, the \nFederal Government--is allowed to violate the religious rights of one \nreligion, then surely it can violate those of others. If the rights of \nsome are not protected, the rights of all are in danger. Isn't that \nwhat history clearly teaches? Isn't that what the Constitution is all \nabout?\n  The Obama administration has crossed a dangerous line. The Founders \nknew that the right of religious belief is inviolable. They gave this \nGod-given right the pride of place they knew it deserved, right there \nin the first amendment, so that Americans would never have to fear its \nloss. Unfortunately, because of the actions of this administration, \nAmericans now do.\n  This is a huge mistake that I hope the administration is currently \nreconsidering, and if they do not, Congress will act. The first \namendment rights of the American people must be protected. Those of us \nwho recognize the fundamental importance of religious freedom to our \nNation will see to it that it is respected by this government and \nrestored in full.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk about this recent HHS \ndirective to faith-based organizations on health care and suggest that \nit is exactly the kind of problem many of us were concerned would \ndevelop when the government said it was going to take a greater role in \ndeciding what health care would be like and who would make health care \ndecisions. In this case, what kind of insurance could an employer give \nits employees if it is a religious organization?\n  There are several pieces of legislation that might deal with this \nissue. My guess is there will be several more unless the administration \ndeals with it quickly and withdraws the position they have taken, which \nis that faith-based institutions would have to offer health insurance \npolicies that violated their faith principles. It is a fundamental \nfirst amendment right of Americans to have the ability to pursue their \nfaith-based principles.\n  In the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, passed by a \nCongress with a Democratic majority in both the House and Senate and \nsigned by President Clinton, it appears to be clear that this is an \nincursion that the law itself, as well as the Constitution, does not \nallow. One of the most objectionable issues about the White House \nposition--the administration's position--is that we want you to change \nyour principles, and we are going to give you a year to accommodate \nthat change.\n  Principles based on faith cannot be accommodated in a year. In fact, \nthey should not be accommodated in a lifetime. They are exactly that; \nthey are principles based on faith. This is about institutions that run \nhospitals, schools, daycare centers, all sorts of things under the \numbrella of the mission of who they are. This is about how their \nemployees relate to them as providers of health care insurance and the \nkind of insurance they provide. This is\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nnot about just anybody you might run into; this is someone who has \nchosen to work for one of these institutions. This is someone who has \nchosen to affiliate themselves with one of these faith-based \norganizations.\n  Clearly, the Catholic bishops are outraged. I have a letter here from \nBishop Carlson in St. Louis that was read in Missouri churches last \nweek talking about this, and it says: In so ruling, the administration \nhas cast aside the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates, denying to Catholics our Nation's first and most fundamental \nfreedom, that of religious liberty. As a result, unless the rule is \noverturned, we Catholics will be compelled either to violate our \nconsciences or to drop health coverage for our employees and suffer the \npenalties for doing so. The administration's sole concession was to \ngive nonprofit employers, like hospitals and universities, which do not \ncurrently provide such coverage--the coverage which the administration \nwas demanding--one year in which to comply.\n  I have another report from the chief of the Catholic military \nchaplains who wanted to send a letter to be read and which the military \ninitially said could not be read. The U.S. Army said that the letter \nwritten and sent by the archbishop in charge of Catholic military \nchaplains could not be read in services. And after a discussion with \nthe Secretary of the Army, that was changed but apparently only if some \nof the letter would be taken out.\n  This is way over the line of where the government should be. \nUnfortunately, it is exactly the line that many of us feared would be \ncrossed whenever the government begins to think that the government is \nthe person to make health care decisions, whether that is a decision \nthat you and your doctor should be making between the two of you or the \nkind of insurance you and your family choose to have or, in this case, \nthe kind of insurance you and the institution you represent chooses to \noffer to the people who are working there. This is wrong. I think \npeople know it is wrong. This is something that cannot be allowed to \nstand, and I wish to turn to my friend from New Hampshire to talk about \nthis with me for a little bit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I certainly share the concerns of my \ncolleague from Missouri, and I share the concerns of my constituents in \nNew Hampshire and citizens across this Nation who see the recent rule \nissued by the administration for what it is, an unprecedented, \nunnecessary affront to religious liberty in our country.\n  I wish to say at the outset that this issue is not limited to the \nCatholic Church. The administration's new health care mandates on \nreligious institutions impact all religions. Religious freedom is a \nfoundational American right enshrined in our Bill of Rights. The first \namendment to our Constitution makes clear that Congress shall make no \nlaw respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\n  Unfortunately, I see the administration chipping away at these \nbedrock freedoms as it engages in a troubling pattern here with respect \nto this rule, and I think we saw that the President's new mandate on \nreligious institutions highlights the deep flaws in the health care \nbill.\n  This unconstitutional law was moved through Congress and signed by \nthe President 2 years ago without the type of due consideration, \ntransparency, or accountability we would all expect, and we have been \nsuffering the consequences since. It is highlighted with what we see \nwith these recent mandates from Health and Human Services.\n  I wish to share some of the concerns my constituents have raised \nabout these mandates that were recently issued by Health and Human \nServices. There is a letter I received this week from William Edmund \nFahey, who is the president of Thomas More College in Merrimack, NH, \nand he says: To condition the availability of medical benefits upon a \ncommunity's willingness to violate a cardinal teaching of its faith \neffectively prevents the full practice of its religion; and thus, \nagain, violates the free exercise of a constitutional liberty.\n  He pleaded with our delegation, the New Hampshire congressional \ndelegation, and he said: I hope you will see that the mandate \nundermines the Constitution, compromises the integrity of the \ngovernment and abuses the foundational principle that free associations \nform an essential part of the social fabric of the United States.\n  We are fortunate in New Hampshire to have a number of very effective \nCatholic institutions and organizations. We have the Catholic Medical \nCenter in Manchester which serves so many in the Manchester community \nand surrounding areas. The Catholic Medical Center has also expressed \nconcerns about the mandate, saying: It would force us to offer services \nthat were against our ethical and religious directive or force us not \nto offer insurance altogether.\n  They added: Neither are acceptable options.\n  The president of one of our great colleges in New Hampshire, Saint \nAnselm College, President Jonathan DeFelice, said: In a country and a \nState that values and respects individuals' rights to exercise their \nreligious beliefs and live according to their conscience's best light, \nit is simply appalling to think that this mandate is anything other \nthan an unprecedented incursion into freedom of conscience.\n  I have heard many concerns from my constituents, and I would hope \nthat Health and Human Services would stop what it is doing right now, \nthis mandate that places religious institutions in this impossible \nposition, with this impossible choice of violating their core beliefs \nin order to comply with a mandate or dropping employee insurance \ncoverage altogether. We should not be putting these organizations that \ndo great work throughout this country in that position. And, again, \nthis is not an issue that just applies to the Catholic Church; this \napplies to all religious institutions.\n\n  I would ask my colleague from the State of Missouri: As a result of \nour concerns about the actions of the administration, we have offered \nlegislation to address this, and what does that legislation do in order \nto make sure that this mandate does not go forward?\n  Mr. BLUNT. That is a good point. I wish also to say that this is not \nabout just about one set of religious beliefs. The current discussion \nis about specific items in a health care plan, but there are lots of \nfaith-based groups with different views of how you deliver health \nservices that have been working on these issues for some time now, and \nI met with a lot of these groups. This is an issue of conscience, \nwhether it is the Catholic Church, the Christian Science Church, the \nSeventh Day Adventist Church, the Baptist Church that I am a member of. \nThere may be different views of this, but the views are not views that \ncan be put forth by the government, and that becomes the government \nview.\n  There was a recent Supreme Court case, Hosanna Tabor Lutheran \nEvangelical Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, where the Court voted 9 to 0 that faith-based institutions \nhave privileges that others do not have because that is what makes them \nfaith-based institutions. The hiring decisions, the firing decisions, \nthe workplace decisions are different because if they are not \ndifferent, it is just another school or another hospital that might \nhappen to have a theology department or might happen to have a chapel \nonce a week. That is what it is.\n  Senator Ayotte, Senator Rubio, and I have worked on various ways to \napproach this. We offered a bill some weeks ago on these issues of \nconscience that would create a respect for rights of conscience. The \nRespect for Rights of Conscience Act, which was drafted early last \nyear, has the full support of the major groups that are concerned about \nthese conscience issues. The Christian Medical Association, the Becket \nFund, and others have said that we need to be concerned about these \nissues, whether it is a hiring decision now or a health care decision, \nand what do we do to protect health care providers and insurers, \nincluding purchasers, from being forced to violate their own principles \nby buying a policy or offering a policy that provides things they don't \nbelieve in their faith group are the right things to offer.\n  I saw one of the President's advisers early this morning beginning to \nback away from this and say: Suddenly this one year has become--we are \njust seeking information during this year. That\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nis not what they were doing at all. What they are doing is saying, you \nare going to comply with this rule and we are going to give you a year \nto figure out how to compromise your principles in a way that applies, \nand that is the wrong thing to do. Whether it is the Respect for Rights \nof Conscience Act or other legislation, if the administration doesn't \ntake care of this administratively, I believe it will be taken care of \nlegislatively.\n  When you have bishops, church leaders, and people who have spent \ntheir lives dedicated to hospitals, schools, and other institutions \nthat reflect their faith principles, you cannot suddenly decide that \nthose don't matter or they can be changed in a year. They also will \nneed to have some legal cause of action to pursue this, just like the \nReligious Freedom Act in 1993 created cause of action. One cannot go in \nand have an unreasonable incursion on the faith beliefs of people under \nthe first amendment. No matter how good you think the cause might be, \nit is not good enough to violate that fundamental principle.\n  Senator Ayotte has had lots of contact--I think many of us have. If \nyou were in a military service last week, you might have heard one of \nthese letters read. I saw the line that had to be taken out of the \nletter apparently that the Army wouldn't otherwise--was standing in \nfront of, but was read in the other services, which was the line that \nsaid: We cannot, we will not comply with this unjust law.\n  When the government begins to tell people to do things that violate \ntheir faith principles, the government has gone too far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I claim 10 minutes of the Democratic \nmajority time. I come to the floor to speak about women's health. I \ncome to speak about the issue of prevention, and I want everybody to \nfundamentally remember what we debated and what we did in the health \ncare bill.\n  For the first time in a long time, our Nation is talking about \nwomen's health. Am I glad to hear that. It has mostly been happening on \nthe morning talk shows and on the front pages of our newspapers. But, \nunfortunately, too much of the conversation isn't about women's health; \nit is politics disguised as women's health.\n  What should we be talking about when it comes to women? We should be \ntalking about the top killers of women: cancer--that dread ``C'' word--\nincluding breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer. They are the \nhighest killers of women: lung cancer, cervical cancer, and breast \ncancer. Then there are the silent killers of women: undetected diabetes \nas well as the consequences of heart and vascular disease. What did we \ntalk about in the health care bill to deal with these issues? We talked \nabout the fact that we needed preventive services, that we believed in \nearly detection, that we believed in screening for early detection so \nwe could identify those consequences that would negatively impact women \nin terms of their health care.\n  One of the things we know is that many women don't have health \ninsurance at all. Seventeen million are uninsured. Women are most \nlikely to neglect their treatment because of cost. Women of \nchildbearing age are also even more at risk because they are performing \njobs that tend to be starting out and they don't pay for health \ninsurance.\n  We tackled a lot of this in the health care bill. I am so proud that \none of the first things we did was end general discrimination in health \ncare--the punitive practices of insurance companies discriminating \nagainst women by charging more for women of the same age and the same \nhealth status as men. But we came together, united, and passed it as \npart of the affordable health care act, and we ended gender \ndiscrimination.\n  Then we saw that simply being a woman meant being treated as a \npreexisting condition. I held a hearing about this that was bone-\nchilling, when we listened to how women were discriminated against and \naspects that had happened to them were viewed as a preexisting \ncondition. In eight States if a woman was a victim of domestic \nviolence, she could not get health insurance.\n  In another bone-chilling story, which was breathtaking, a woman \ntestified at our hearing that because she had a C-Section, her \ninsurance company told her they would drop her from their insurance \nplan unless she got sterilized. That was in the hearing. She had a \nletter from her insurance company. We were aghast on both sides of the \naisle, regardless of how one feels about some of these reproductive \nissues. Nobody felt that should happen in America. So the people on the \ncommittee, led by myself, said: We can't have that. So we have ended \ndiscrimination against women getting health care on the basis of \npreexisting conditions.\n  We wanted to go further, and one of the issues we looked at was that \nof prevention. This is a subject of great debate. The very first \namendment on the Senate floor during the health care debate was one to \nadd preventive health care benefits. I offered an amendment, and the \nSenator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, offered a counteramendment. Her \namendment was terrific. She had every preventive service that I would \nhave ever loved. CBO, though, scored it at something such as $50 \nmillion. The CBO's score sunk the Murkowski amendment, but the Mikulski \namendment prevailed, in which we said we will leave it to the Institute \nof Medicine to determine what would be some of these amendments for \nwomen.\n  So guess what we have. In our preventive health amendment, which is \nnow the subject of such debate, such controversy and, unfortunately, \nsuch misinformation, our amendment said this: First of all, if a woman \nis over 50, she gets a free yearly mammogram, one of our highest risks. \nSecond, if a woman is over 40, she gets an annual well woman preventive \ncare visit. This then goes to the screenings that then go to the \nhighest risk for the highest diseases we have.\n  We have early detection and early screening. For young women who are \npregnant, we guarantee they can be screened for diabetes, but also in \nour prevention amendment we provided for maternity services. We provide \nfor maternity services so these women can get proper prenatal care. \nWorking with their doctor, we can ensure the health of the mother and \nsurvivability and the ability to carry her pregnancy to term. We looked \nout for those maternity benefits.\n  IOM also said that as part of prevention we should add contraceptive \ncoverage. That was a recommendation not of Senator Barb and not of \nSenator Jeanne Shaheen; this was a recommendation of the Institute of \nMedicine. Why do they say that? First of all, there are over 15 or 20 \npercent of women who need to take birth control in order to deal with \nthe medical issues associated with their menstrual cycles. This isn't \nthe place to go into the biology of being a woman, but for many this is \nwhere people long before--young women and adolescents who were not \nsexually active were experiencing some significant hormonal problems. \nSo it is not always about being sexually active.\n  So this whole thing about the preventive amendment being all about \nbirth control is so exaggerated, so overblown, so out of context with \nwhat we wanted to do. I am shocked and--I am just shocked.\n  We looked at our bill, in addition to my amendment, and we included \npreventive services for men and women, those services that affect both \nsexes, including colorectal screening for adults over 50. That also \nincludes prostate screening for men. We have diabetes and high blood \npressure screening. There is also the ability to do alcohol misuse \nscreening which, in many instances, is an undetected and silent killer \nnot only of lives but of families.\n  So one of our major thrusts was prevention. We won maternity benefits \nso a mother can be safe and well herself and be able to carry her \npregnancy to term in a way that ensures the health of both the mother \nand the child, when the child is born. The fact that we had these other \nscreenings, including mammograms, prostate cancer, diabetes--\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\nthe things that are killers of us all--some of these will close the \nhealth disparity gap because so many African-American men face terrible \nproblems with high blood pressure that leads to the terrible \nconsequences of stroke. Diabetes is rampant in our country but \nparticularly rampant among people of color. So that is what we were \ndoing.\n\n  I find it troubling that instead of focusing on our preventive health \nservices, we are focusing on birth control. Birth control was never the \nfocus of health care reform. It was a recommendation to be included in \nthe benefit that came from the Institute of Medicine.\n  There is another bit of confusion out there about mandating churches \nto do something against their will. I wish to draw a distinction \nbetween what the bill does and mandating the provision of service and \nproviding insurance coverage. The bill does include insurance coverage. \nBut there is no place in the bill that mandates a religious \norganization provide something against their principle in providing a \nservice. So if you are St. Mary's Hospital, you do not have to give out \nbirth control in your women's health clinic. If you are Notre Dame \nUniversity or Georgetown University or a Catholic women's college, you \ndo not have to give out birth control in your student health clinic.\n  What the Obama-Sebelius regulations say is that there has to be \ninsurance coverage available, particularly to those who are non-\nCatholic. For all of us who go to these wonderful institutes and have \nbenefited from their services, they are nondiscriminatory. One does not \nhave to be Catholic to teach at a Catholic college. One does not have \nto be Catholic to work at a Catholic hospital. One does not have to be \nCatholic. So these institutions hire people of a variety of religious \npreferences.\n  I don't want to get into a debate on the first amendment, but I do \nwelcome a debate on what the health care bill did and what it intended.\n  The health care bill, I felt, was one of the greatest social justice \ninitiatives I have participated in in the Senate. It was going to work \nand organize in an effective way to make sure we were on the road that \nevery American had access to affordable care. Then we removed the \nbarriers that were not only financial but often these discriminatory \npractices, these punitive practices that often were directed against \nwomen and preexisting conditions or in gender discrimination and the \nway they set their prices.\n  The best care is preventive care, and one of the tools well known in \nthe public health field is these screenings tests that we worked to \nprovide, and we turned to the eminent and distinguished people in \nlearned societies, in this case the Institute of Medicine, to tell us \nnot based on politics but to tell us based on science what the benefits \nshould be, and they added contraceptive coverage.\n  That is the history. I hope it clears up the misinformation. But we \ndid work to move our citizens to greater health care and remove the \nfinancial and other societal barriers to getting health care in our \nsociety, with a fantastic emphasis on prevention. We have gotten off to \nthe wrong debate and the wrong discussion. Let's get back to talking \nabout how we improve the health care of women and how we can keep \nmoving on our preventive aspects that not only help women but help the \nmen who so love us and support us, and we want to return the favor by \nmaking sure they get their screenings too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The senior Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to join my \ncolleague from Maryland to try and point out how this issue is being \nmanipulated.\n  Almost 2 years ago, Congress--this institution--voted to end \ndiscrimination against women by health insurance plans. We voted to \nmake it easier for women to seek referrals to see the health \nspecialists they need, and we voted to give women greater access to \naffordable preventive health care services, including contraception.\n  These are important historic advances for women's health, and they \nshould not fall victim to ideological policies.\n  Over the last several weeks, we have seen women all across this \ncountry stand in huge numbers to support women's health. That \ngrassroots support will be needed again and again to stave off \nideological attacks on women's health care.\n  Over the past year, House Republicans have repeatedly attempted to \nboth eliminate funding for title X family planning and Planned \nParenthood. Thankfully, we have been able to block these attempts in \nthe Senate.\n  Ninety-seven percent of the reproductive health services provided by \nPlanned Parenthood in New Hampshire and across the country is \npreventive care. As we all know, preventive health care lowers health \ncare costs and saves lives.\n  We were reminded of the important role Planned Parenthood plays in \npreventive health when the Susan G. Komen Foundation decided to end its \ncontracts with the provider. It is unfair to politicize women's health \nin the way we saw played out in the media last week. Women from across \nthe country let their voices be heard. The 750,000 women who received \nbreast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood clinics with support \nfrom the Komen Foundation deserve better. They did not ask to be thrown \ninto the political fire. They merely sought detection and treatment \nagainst a life-threatening disease.\n  I am pleased Komen reversed that decision.\n  I also commend the President for standing for women's health and \nreaffirming the recommendation of the Institute of Medicine to protect \naccess to affordable birth control for all women. The decision \nrequiring health care plans to cover contraception with no copays or \ndeductibles will improve the lives of millions of women and their \nfamilies.\n  Birth control pills can cost up to $600 a year. It can be a serious \neconomic issue for some women. Studies have shown it costs employers as \nmuch as 17 percent more to exclude contraceptive coverage in employee \nhealth care plans than to provide such coverage.\n  Birth control is also a fundamental health care issue. Doctors and \npublic health experts agree that increased access to birth control \nprevents unintended pregnancies. It is directly linked to declines in \nmaternal and infant mortality and a reduction in the risk of ovarian \ncancer. It is linked to overall good health outcomes.\n  Permanent and temporary contraception is critical for family planning \npurposes, but many women--a full 14 percent--use birth control for \nmedical and health reasons, including helping to reduce the risk of \nsome cancers, treatment for endometriosis, serious infections, and \ncysts.\n  Let's be clear. In talking about the health benefits of birth \ncontrol, I am not telling women they must use it. The decision on \nwhether to pursue contraception is an individual choice that each woman \nmust make for herself with her family. No part of the affordable care \nact or the President's ruling regarding insurance coverage forces any \nwoman to use contraception.\n  However, birth control will now be affordable and accessible for any \nwoman who, in consultation with her doctor, decides she needs or wants \nto use it. The policy represents one of the greatest advances for \nwomen's health in decades.\n  Sadly, there is an aggressive and misleading campaign to deny this \nbenefit to women. A conscience clause exists that exempts religious \ninstitutions such as churches from having to carry insurance that \ncovers contraception. Mr. President, 335,000 churches and their \nemployees in this country are exempt. Many have argued that conscience \nclause should be expanded to include religiously affiliated hospitals \nand universities in the name of religious liberty.\n  The millions of women who work in a Catholic hospital or university--\nfrom the overnight nurse to the classroom aide or cafeteria worker--who \nchoose to use birth control should have the same access as their \ncounterparts at other institutions. That is their decision. It is not \ntheir employer's.\n  There are religions that believe divorce is a sin. Should these \ninstitutions be exempt from our labor laws and be allowed to \ndiscriminate based on marital status? Of course not, and this is no \ndifferent.\n  A recent survey showed that 71 percent of American voters, including \n77 percent of Catholic women voters, support the requirement to make \nbirth\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\ncontrol available to all. They understand that religious freedom means \nthat all women--Catholic or non-Catholic--should have the opportunity \nto make their own decisions when it comes to birth control.\n  I applaud the President for his decision and for putting women's \nhealth above politics.\n  We know ideological attacks on women's health care will continue. But \nI thank my colleagues who are here today for speaking out against those \nwho want to turn the clock back on women, who want to limit access and \navailability of women's health services. We are watching, and we are \ngoing to continue to be watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week, we saw something amazing \nhappening in communities across the country. When the news got out that \nthe Susan G. Komen Foundation had cut off funding for breast cancer \nscreenings at Planned Parenthood, men and women across this country \nwere just outraged. They did not understand the decision, they did not \nagree with it, and they did something about it.\n  They picked up their phones, they talked to their friends, they e-\nmailed, they tweeted, they called their elected officials, they made \ntheir voices heard loudly and clearly, and they got results.\n  On Friday of last week, Komen did the right thing and announced they \nhad reversed their initial decision. I wish to commend them for that \nbecause their mission and their great work in the fight against breast \ncancer is just too important to get mixed up in partisan politics.\n  But although that reversal was a great victory for so many women and \nmen across the country, let's be clear: Our fight for women's health \ncare did not end there. There are still many who continue to push \npartisan politics ahead of women's health, and we need to make sure the \ngrassroots support and energy that successfully came together to right \nthis wrong last week continues to stand firm against each and every \nattack that comes our way, because we do know those attacks are coming. \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have been waging a war on \nwomen's health since the moment they came into power.\n\n  After campaigning across the country a year and a half ago on a \nplatform of jobs and the economy, the first three bills they introduced \nwere direct attacks on women's health in America.\n  The very first one, H.R. 1, would have totally eliminated title X \nfunding for family planning and teen pregnancy prevention. It included \nan amendment that would have completely defunded Planned Parenthood and \ncut off support for the millions of women in this country who count on \nit.\n  Another one of their opening round of bills would have permanently \ncodified the Hyde amendment and the DC abortion ban. The original \nversion of their bill did not even include an exception for the health \nof the mother.\n  Finally, they introduced a bill right away that would have rolled \nback every single one of the gains we made for women in the health care \nreform bill.\n  Their bill would have removed the caps on out-of-pocket expenses that \nprotect women from losing their homes or their life savings if they get \nsick.\n  It would have ended the ban on lifetime limits on coverage.\n  It would have allowed insurance companies to once again discriminate \nagainst women by charging them higher premiums or even denying women \ncare because of the so-called preexisting conditions--such as being \npregnant.\n  It would have rolled back the guarantee that insurance companies \ncover contraceptives, which will save the overwhelming majority of \nwomen who use them hundreds and hundreds of dollars a year.\n  We know ensuring access to effective birth control is directly linked \nto declines in maternal and infant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian \ncancer, better overall health outcomes for women, and far fewer \nunintended pregnancies and abortions, which is a goal we all share.\n  Contraceptive coverage should not be a controversial issue. It is \nsupported by the vast majority of Americans who understand how \nimportant it is for women and families.\n  I also wish to note that the affordable contraceptive policy we put \nin place preserves the freedoms of conscience and religion for every \nAmerican. Churches and other religious institutions are exempt, and no \ndoctor would ever have to dispense contraceptives if that is at odds \nwith his or her religious views.\n  But it also protects the rights of the millions of Americans who do \nuse contraceptives, who believe family planning is the right choice for \nthem personally, and who do not deserve to have politics or an extreme \nminority's ideology prevent them from getting the coverage they \ndeserve.\n  I am very glad, joining with all my colleagues, that we beat back \nthat effort by the House Republicans, and I truly wish to commend \nPresident Obama for moving forward with this sound policy for women \nacross America. Because that is what this is truly about. It is what it \nneeds to be about: women and their health care needs, not partisan \npolitics, not point scoring.\n  House Republicans and their allies have demonstrated they will stop \nat nothing to politicize this issue. Last year, they even threatened to \nshut down the Federal Government in a failed attempt to defund an \norganization that provides critical health care services for millions \nof women in this country. Now they are trying to cut off contraceptive \ncoverage for women across America.\n  They can keep trying to push their extreme agenda, but they should \nknow we are going to fight back just as hard in the Senate, as we \nclearly saw this past week, with the voices of millions of people \nacross America who feel very strongly that politics should never come \nbetween a woman and her health care--men and women who will be watching \nwhat is happening here in DC and who, I am confident, stand ready to \nact again.\n  I am proud to be here with my colleagues today. I am proud of the \nvictory of last week, and I am determined to remain vigilant and keep \nup the fight for women, for men, and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am also very proud to be here with my \ncolleagues. I think Senator Murray was eloquent, along with Senator \nShaheen and Senator Mikulski. I am here to put it in my own words; that \nis, here they go again. Sadly, politics has once again entered into \nwomen's health care. This time we see an attempt to deprive women of a \ncritical benefit: access to contraception through their health \ninsurance plans.\n  Just last week, what did we see? A move to punish women by taking \naway their free breast cancer screenings all because of rightwing \npolitics.\n  Before that, as Senator Murray eloquently indicated, we saw a \nRepublican move to defund family planning because of politics.\n  My Republican colleagues almost shut down the government over family \nplanning, and now, if they have their way, millions of women could lose \ntheir contraceptive coverage, which could expose them to declining \nhealth outcomes and their babies to declining health outcomes and could \ncost them about $600 a year.\n  Let's step back and look at where we are.\n  Some months ago, the Institute of Medicine, which is comprised of a \nnumber of leading scientific and health experts, made a decision.\n  They advised the Obama administration on what preventative benefits \nshould be included for women--specifically for women--in new health \ninsurance plans. That is what this whole to-do is all about. This \norganization that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do \nwith health care made a very clear recommendation to the Obama \nadministration. They said there are a number of preventative benefits \nthat should be included for free for the women of this country: \nscreening for gestational diabetes, HIV screening, cervical cancer \nprevention, annual well women visits, and access to contraception.\n  Now, just as these women, our women of this Nation, are ready for \nthese preventative services--services they need, services most of them \nwant--my Republican friends, from\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nPresidential candidates Romney to Newt Gingrich to the Senate and House \nRepublican leaders--I heard Senator McConnell threaten legislation to \ntake away these benefits--to Speaker Boehner to individual Republicans \nin both Houses, they are gearing up to repeal one of these benefits: \naccess to birth control--access to birth control.\n  Now, I believe women in this country deserve respect. Some of them do \nnot want access to birth control. They have a religion that dictates \ntheir views, and they have every right to make that decision. Others \ndecide that they need to have access to birth control. So the Obama \nadministration said to the women of this great Nation that they believe \nthere ought to be access. But I think it is very important that the \nInstitute of Medicine said: No exception. They think access to \ncontraception is so important to women's health, they did not want any \nexception. But the Obama administration made an exception for churches \nand for religious institutions, and under the Obama administration's \nrule, 335,000 religious organizations will not have to offer birth \ncontrol if they have a conscience reason not to do so. That is a \ncompromise.\n  Remember, the health experts said: No exceptions. The Obama \nadministration said: Well, I want to respect the religious institutions \nand so I will allow them, if their mission is religious, and the people \nthey serve and the employees they hire are basically of one religion, \nthey are a religious institution, they will not have to offer \ncontraception in the health care benefits to their employees.\n  But guess what. There is another part of this equation. Women. Women. \nThey have to have their religious beliefs respected. That is why the \nPresident also said: If you run an organization that serves a diverse \nnumber of people from different religions, and so on, and different \nbeliefs, let them have the right to make that decision if they want to \nobtain free birth control through their insurance.\n  Now, here is the thing. This outcry is astonishing to me since 28 \nStates already assure access to birth control. I have never heard any \nof my colleagues--maybe they did. Maybe they did come on the Senate \nfloor and complain. But more than half of our women--over 28 States, \nmore than half of women have similar access to birth control. So this \nis not some new benefit. This is just making sure all women, except \nthat very narrow band that work for strictly religious institutions, \nhave the right to have access to free birth control.\n  The outcry is unbelievable, a political outcry making this a \npolitical issue when it is a medical issue. The President compromised. \nHe said: If you are strictly a religious institution, you do not have \nto do this if you do not want to.\n  Now, here is the other thing. All organizations that have any \nreligious issue have an extra year to determine if they are going to \noffer this or how they can do it. They may be able to find a way in \nthat year to get women access and at the same time not violate their \nconsciences. They have an extra year to do that. But, oh, no, we are \ngoing to see legislation--I can assure you we are going to see \nlegislation to overturn this, legislation that even goes further than \nthis. And it is going to be a battle on the floor of the Senate, I am \nafraid.\n  I am not afraid of the fight; I welcome it because, let's be clear: \nVirtually all women have used birth control at some point in their \nlives. Let me repeat this. Virtually all women have used birth control \nat some point in their lives, including 98 percent of Catholic women. \nThat is a fact. And 71 percent of American voters, including 77 percent \nof Catholic women voters, support the administration's policy.\n  So if my colleagues decide they are going to take this issue on in \nthe face of overwhelming support for this policy by the American \npeople, I say we are ready. We are ready to make the case.\n  Access to birth control is directly linked to maternal and infant \nhealth. This is not some theoretical right. It is a right that is \nnecessary. Health experts tell us that women with unintended \npregnancies are less likely to get prenatal care in the first \ntrimester, and in some cases they never get it. If there is one thing \nthat should unite us, it is healthy babies, healthy outcomes from \nhealthy pregnancies. That is what we are talking about.\n  I want to talk about something else we do not hear enough of. I want \nto compliment Senator Gillibrand on this because she is the one who \nbrought this issue to my attention.\n  A full 14 percent of women who use birth control pills--that is 1.5 \nmillion women--use them to treat serious medical conditions, not to \nprevent pregnancies. One of those conditions: Debilitating monthly \npain, irregular cycles, conditions like endometriosis, serious \nconditions.\n  I just learned of a young woman at Georgetown University. Their \ninsurance policy did not cover free birth control. Her doctor told her \nshe had a serious medical condition and she needed to use birth control \npills that had nothing to do with pregnancy or anything else, or \npreventing pregnancy. It was a serious medical condition. The diagnosis \nwas--I may not say it right--polycystic ovary syndrome.\n  Now, what happened is, she was told: You must go on birth control \npills. But we at Georgetown, we will not pay for that benefit. She had \nto go out and get it. It was more than $100 a month. She could not \nafford it. Within months she developed a large ovarian cyst that had to \nbe removed surgically. In addition, she lost an ovary.\n  So please do not stand here and tell us that women do not need access \nto birth control pills or contraception because we have story after \nstory after story.\n  Let me tell you something else some folks may not know; that is, on \nmany occasions when a woman wants to become pregnant and has irregular \ncycles and cannot, she will be put on birth control pills. A British \nscientific study came out and showed that after 5 years on birth \ncontrol pills, women who wanted to get pregnant had a decreased risk of \ndelayed conception--so they were better able to become pregnant and \nbecome mothers. So this is not some simple pat statement. This is about \nmaking sure the women of this country--the young women, the middle-aged \nwomen of child-bearing age and older woman who have other conditions--\nget the medicine they need--and, by the way, get them for free because \n$600 a year for many middle-class or working poor women is just out of \nreach.\n\n  So I say to my Republican friends who came to the floor previous to \nour statements, do not punish women again. Do not try to. Under the \nadministration's plan, churches are respected and women are respected. \nAll sides are respected. No one is forced to use birth control; it is \nup to the women. In 28 States more than 50 percent of the women already \nhave this benefit. Why are you bringing politics into this?\n  My Republican friends want to turn back the clock on birth control. \nSome of us remember the days when birth control was illegal. Well, I \nhave news for them. This is the 21st century. Wake up. Look at your \ncalendar. It is the 21st century, and women ought to be respected. \nWomen ought to be trusted, and their families ought to be trusted and \nrespected. We are not going quietly into the night on this one. We will \nbe here. We will fight back. We will fight for women and their families \nand health care, and we will fight to keep politics out of the \nequation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I come to the floor now as a father \nand a grandfather. Bonnie and I have five daughters and are \ngrandparents of eight granddaughters. Nothing in our family and nothing \nin families across this country have anything more critical on their \nminds than the health of their children and their daughters and our \nfamilies.\n  Women in this rich country have a right to expect affordable quality \nhealth care. But those rights are under attack, and the attack is \ncoming from what I call the ``maleogarchy''.\n  Several years ago, I initiated the name ``maleogarchy'' right here on \nthe Senate floor. A maleogarchy is made up of men in Congress who \nalways decide what they want to do for women, even taking away their \nrights.\n  These days the maleogarchy has declared war on women's health. We saw \nit when the Republicans in the House tried to defund Planned \nParenthood. Now we are seeing it again this week in\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nthe Republican efforts to take away affordable birth control, basic \nhealth care for women in our country.\n  Under a historic provision of the health care reform law, health \ninsurance companies will be required to cover contraception with no \nadditional copays or fees. This landmark requirement is scheduled to go \ninto effect this summer. But as women cheer this new law, the \nmaleogarchy is looking to take it away.\n  Here in the Senate, there is a Republican bill to get rid of these \nbenefits for women. Imagine. This body, principally made up of males, \nwants to take away benefits for women.\n  The top Presidential candidate on the Republican side is Mitt Romney. \nHe just said one of the first things he will do--I heard it, everybody \nheard it; it was loudly broadcast, it was vividly broadcast on \ntelevision--he will do as the first thing, if elected, is overturn \nthese new policies making birth control more affordable. Imagine. That \nis why he wants to be elected. I hope the American public is listening \ncarefully to what is being said.\n\n  Affordable birth control shouldn't be controversial. I thought we put \nthis question to rest long ago. Back in 1965, the Supreme Court \noverturned the State of Connecticut's ban on contraception. Today, 99 \npercent of women either use birth control or have used it at some point \nduring their lives. It has become a critical component of health care \nfor women in our country. But, as so many women know, birth control is \nalso significantly expensive. One-third of all women have struggled to \npay for it, and even if you have health insurance it is a struggle. \nCopays for birth control can be as much as $50 a month, and $50 a month \nadds up to $600 a year. Yet now the other side wants to take this \nbenefit away. President Obama and many of us in Congress believe that \nis fundamentally unfair.\n  Mr. President, everyone needs to speak against this attack on women's \nhealth, just as they did last week when the Komen Foundation--a \nfoundation that was named after Susan Komen, a young woman who died of \nbreast cancer--allowed a partisan agenda to cancel its mission to fight \nbreast cancer. Imagine that--this organization named for a young woman \nwho died, and now they want to cut out these examinations for women who \nwish to see whether breast cancer is ahead for them. Komen tried to cut \nfunding to Planned Parenthood, a trusted provider of lifesaving breast \ncancer exams for hundreds of thousands of women in our country. Across \nAmerica, women were offended, hurt, and angry, so they spoke up and \nspoke out against Komen's narrowminded decision. People were outraged \nand justifiably so.\n  I was proud to bring together more than two dozen of our Senate \ncolleagues to join the fight. We persuaded Komen to see the error of \ntheir ways, and they reversed their decision a few days later. Now the \nKomen organization and Planned Parenthood are getting back to doing \nwhat they do best--protecting women's health.\n  Let's be clear. It would have been wrong to take away resources that \ncould save their lives, just as it is wrong to deny women the right to \naffordable contraception. So I call on my Republican colleagues to \ndisband the maleogarchy view. Join us and stand up for women in our \ncountry. Politics don't belong in our doctors' offices, examination \nrooms, or in our medical clinics. Politics should never be used to \nblock women's rights to get the care they need for healthier lives. I \nask my friends on the other side of the aisle to consider what they are \ndoing before they vote to take away those rights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today after my \ndistinguished colleagues have spoken on this issue so powerfully and \neloquently, but I do so reluctantly because I rise in the face of a \ncontinuing assault on women's health care in this country--an assault \non women's health care that is unworthy of our political system because \nthese health care decisions involving women should be made by them. \nThey are a matter of their conscience and their choice. Politics has no \nplace in health care decisions.\n  This assault is waged by a group on the radical right. It is an \nideologically based attack on personal health care decisions of women \nand their families, and they are wasting taxpayer dollars doing it. \nThis ideologically based stand on women's health care over these years \nis nothing less than unconscionable and unbelievable.\n  I have only been in this body for a short time, but one of the first \nvotes I cast was on H.R. 1, which wasn't about growing jobs or \nstrengthening our economy, it was known best for completely eliminating \nthe funding for responsible family planning programs. The fact is \nfamily planning can prevent unintended high-risk pregnancies, reduce \nabortion rates--reduce abortion rates--and they are cost-effective. \nThey provide $4 of return for every $1 that is spent on family \nplanning, invested in those programs. But there are some on the radical \nright who would rather have the people of our Nation pay $11 billion a \nyear in unplanned pregnancies rather than receive a nearly threefold \nreturn on investment for family planning services.\n  This debate is about more than dollars and cents, and it is about \nmore than cost. It is about protecting the right of every woman to \nreceive good-quality preventive care and equal access to preventive \nhealth care benefits from the provider they trust. And these decisions \nshould be made between the provider a woman trusts and herself.\n  In 2010, Congress took a great step forward, as my colleague Senator \nMikulski has described so powerfully. A decision was made to require \nhealth care plans to cover a core packet of preventive health services, \nmoving our country dramatically and historically toward a trend of \noverall lifetime health.\n  The Institute of Medicine--an unbiased scientific organization--was \ntasked with evaluating the most important preventive services to \ninclude in the best health outcomes for women, seeking those best \nhealth outcomes for every woman in America. This scientific \norganization named birth control as one of those core benefits--birth \ncontrol. Let's be very clear. We are talking about birth control--the \npill that 99 percent of women use as part of their daily preventive \nhealth care. At some point in their lives, 99 percent of women use it.\n  That very same benefit--coverage for it--is guaranteed by 28 States \naround the Nation. They already require health care plans to cover it. \nAnd more than half of the women of our Nation live in those States. Now \nthe radical right would seek to take away that guarantee--that \ncoverage, that basic health care outcome. They would take away that \nright--repeal it, restrict it, remove it as an option for women. That \nis unacceptable.\n  Women spend an average of $500 per year for birth control--a cost men \nwill never have to incur. That is why the Institute of Medicine \nrecommended that birth control be included as part of the package of \npreventive services without copays--because costs should not be a \nbarrier to those 99 percent of women in the United States who use birth \ncontrol. Yet the radical right has decided that the politics of taking \nbirth control away from women is more important, and they have used \nevery tool in their arsenal--creating misunderstandings--to try to take \nthis right away from women, including misrepresenting what the \nadministration has decided to do. One of these mistruths they are \nspreading is that churches will be required to offer birth control. Not \nso. Another is that institutions affiliated with churches will be \nrequired to provide those services. Not true. What any institution is \nrequired to cover is, in fact, the coverage, not necessarily provide \nthe service, and that is a key distinction.\n\n  The majority of Americans agree that employers should be required to \nprovide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception \nand birth control at no cost. The majority of Americans believe that is \ntrue. Nearly two-thirds of young Americans of childbearing age agree \nthat employer health care coverage should include birth control at no \ncost.\n  In short, this decision should be a matter of conscience, a matter of \nchoice for individual women. Politicians should not be permitted to \nexploit it, as some are doing now. I stand for women making choices \nabout their own health care, and I stand against politicians telling \nthem what they should do. This issue before this body\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nand this Nation is one of the critical issues of this time, and \npolitics has no place in these health care decisions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the continued \nattacks on the rights of women to control their own reproductive \nchoices.\n  Women should have access to comprehensive reproductive care and \nshould be able to decide for themselves how to use that care.\n  Here is the problem. The politics of women's health care has reached \nan extreme point, most recently with the decision of the Susan G. Komen \nFoundation to stop funding for breast cancer screenings at Planned \nParenthood.\n  Following the outrage of millions of men and women around the \ncountry, the Foundation reversed its course, at least for this year.\n  A year ago, House Republicans passed a budget that would have \neliminated the Title X Family Planning Program and defunded Planned \nParenthood.\n  Annually, these programs serve almost 8 million Americans nationwide \nproviding primary care, cancer screenings, well baby care, \ncontraceptive services, education, annual exams, STD and HIV testing, \nand flu vaccines.\n  These programs provide critical health care services to many women \nwho simply cannot afford to go anywhere else.\n  It is ironic to defund these programs because family planning \neducation and access to contraception can save money. For example, \ntitle X supported family planning centers prevented 406,000 abortions \nand saved taxpayers $3.4 billion in 2008 alone.\n  The same House-passed budget would have also eliminated the Teen \nPregnancy Prevention Program. Teen pregnancy costs taxpayers billions \nof dollars annually.\n  Recently, the Obama administration announced its final policy on \ncontraception coverage as part of the preventive health services \nrecommended for women. The policy concluded employers are required to \nprovide no-cost contraception or another option to their employees.\n  The administration included a very narrow exemption to this \nrequirement, and allowed religious organizations, such as churches or \nsynagogues that primarily employ people of their own faith, to opt-out.\n  This narrow religious exemption, which does not include hospitals, \nuniversities, or other organizations with religious affiliations, was \nthe right decision. It ensures that millions of women of all faiths, \nincluding nurses, janitors, doctors, and college instructors, will \naccess to good health care, including contraception, if they want it.\n  A nurse seeking employment should not have to choose between one \nemployer who provides contraception coverage and one who doesn't.\n  Access to contraception is widely supported. Today, two new polls \nwere released that showed the majority of catholic voters support \ncoverage for prescription birth control.\n  Seventy-one percent of American voters, including 77 percent of \nCatholic women voters, support health plans covering birth control \nwithout co-pays.\n  Moreover, 28 States, including California, already require employer-\nprovided health plans to include contraception coverage if the plan \nprovides prescription drug coverage.\n  In 2004, the California Supreme Court held that Catholic Charities \nwas no different from any other employer and therefore required to \nprovide contraception coverage for their employees.\n  I agree.\n  Access to contraception can reduce rates of unintended pregnancy, \nhelp with certain health problems, and reduce the risks of some \ncancers. Expanding the exemption would have caused unacceptable harm to \nwomen.\n  The administration should keep this exemption narrow.\n  House Republicans insisted on including a ban on local funding for \nabortions in the District of Columbia in the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations bill.\n  They have introduced and passed numerous bills that would \nsignificantly restrict a women's right to choose. This past October, \nthe House passed a bill that would prohibit Federal funds from being \nused for any health plan that offers abortion coverage.\n  This would mean that any women receiving Federal subsidies to help \nthem afford health insurance would effectively be prohibited from \npurchasing coverage that included abortion services.\n  Last May, the House passed a bill that falsely claimed to end public \nfunding for abortion. There are already stringent Federal protections \nthat prohibit Federal dollars from being used for abortions; this bill \nwas not about that.\n  Instead this bill was an attempt to reopen a contentious debate and \nto impose unprecedented limitations on women using their own money for \nabortion services.\n  Even worse, this bill would have allowed hospitals to refuse to \nprovide abortion care or refer a patient to a hospital that would \nprovide it, even when a woman's life is in critical danger.\n  This attack on women's health must be defeated. All women deserve \naccess to quality comprehensive health care, regardless of their income \nlevel or place of employment.\n  There is a balance between respecting America's democratic values and \nincreasing access to important health services for women. In addition \nto being a health concern, for many women it is an economic concern as \nwell.\n  Better health policies for women help them save on out of pockets \ncosts. When women are healthy, communities are healthy. I will continue \nto stand for women's health and fight for equal access to care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, products that are labeled ``Made in \nChina'' can be found in our cars, in our closets, and in our cupboards. \nSo too are the ingredients in the foods we eat often, the medicine we \ntake, the candy our children enjoy, and the toys they play with. But \nhow many times have we heard in the last few years of illness and death \nfrom contaminated foods or drugs or toys that were made in China? In \nToledo, OH, patients died after taking contaminated Heparin to treat \ntheir heart conditions.\n  Drug manufacturers have acknowledged that they turn to countries such \nas China to buy ingredients to put into pharmaceuticals. U.S. companies \noften move production to China, buy ingredients there, put these drugs \ntogether, and sell them back into the United States with ingredients \nthat may not pass some of the safety inspections they should. One \ncompany acknowledged that 17 percent of its active ingredients in \nmanufacturing are outsourced, often to countries with weaker drug \nsafety standards.\n  When high lead levels were discovered in toys several years ago, I \nurged stronger oversight to help keep our children safe. Four years \nago, I asked Dr. Jeffrey Weidenhamer of Ashland University in north \ncentral Ohio to test lead levels. He had already begun testing with the \nstudents, and we asked him to do it again, to test the lead level in \nHalloween toys, including the\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\ncups and the buckets that Ohio children would be eating out of and \ndecorations families would be using that children often put into their \nmouths during the holidays. He tested products in the fall of 2007 for \nHalloween and the spring of 2008 for Easter toys. He identified 12 of \n97 products contaminated with high quantities--much higher than what is \nconsidered safe by our government--high lead contents in this lead-\nbased paint on our toys; among them, candy buckets, drinking cups, fake \nteeth, and other Halloween props. At Easter, it was eggs and baskets \nand other things. It included products bought at leading national \nretailers.\n  At the same time, it was clear that our trading system, patterned in \nmany ways and with businesses following this business plan of shutting \ndown production in places such as Rhode Island, which the Presiding \nOfficer represents, and Ohio, shutting down production in our country \nand moving it to China, manufacturing products there, and selling \nproducts back here, that trade system has failed basic consumer and \npublic safety standards.\n  There is nothing free about trade that puts children in the hospital \nfor playing with a toy or eating candy or brushing their teeth. That is \nwhy Congress passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. The \nact sent a simple message to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nwhich is charged with protecting consumers: Protect American children, \nprotect families, protect companies from unsafe and possibly fatal \nproducts.\n  That job has gotten a lot harder to protect the American public on \nfood products, on toys, on pharmaceuticals, and on pet food, which I \nwill discuss, because the business plan for so many companies has been \nto shut down production in Canton, OH, and move it to Guangzhou, China, \nshut down production in Toledo or Dayton, OH, and move it to Wuhan or \nShiyan, China, in order to save money, in order to cut worker safety \ncosts, in order to evade environmental and consumer regulations \nsometimes.\n  The new law that we passed meant that hundreds of thousands of toys \nand food and other imports from China and elsewhere can be recalled \nwhen they are unsafe. The key is inspection of these products, and the \nkey is making the companies liable that outsource the jobs to China in \norder to save money. We don't want more court cases and more \nlitigation, but if these companies are going to move production to \nChina, they need to take responsibility for the toys if the toys have \nbeen painted with lead-based paint. They need to take responsibility \nfor the pharmaceutical ingredients--sometimes dangerous ingredients \nthat somebody has somehow put in these pharmaceuticals when production \ncomes from China. They need to be careful about food safety. They need \nto be careful about treats for pets that have been contaminated.\n  That act has been a success. Last year, Dr. Weidenhamer conducted \nanother test and found no lead-based paint contamination in Halloween \nitems.\n  But there is a gap in our trade system that threatens public health \nand public safety. We passed a law to close that gap. Public safety has \nbenefited, and companies are still able to make and sell their products \nin this free market.\n  One year ago, Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nbipartisan Food Safety Modernization Act. The law provides the FDA with \nthe tools needed to better protect our food supply, to recall tainted \nor adulterated food, and to respond more effectively to foodborne \nillness outbreaks. It empowered the FDA with new authority to establish \na traceability system; that is, when a product comes to your table, \nwhether it is food in this case, a pharmaceutical, or whether it is a \ntoy, the company that sells that product needs to be able to trace back \nall the ingredients, all the components, where they came from, how they \nwere produced, and under what conditions they were produced. It is that \ntype of public safety infrastructure that is so important.\n  Yet, as we have seen with food and toys and drugs imported from \nChina, now we are seeing it with pet food. Yesterday I met with Kevin \nThaxton of Cuyahoga County--the Cleveland area--whose wife Candance \nwrote to me after one of their dogs, a 9-year-old pug, died from kidney \nfailure. They thought it was the pug simply getting older. I had a pug \nonce, and they don't usually live much beyond 10 years. Then, as they \ngot another dog that got sick immediately, they figured out it was \nlikely from eating Chinese-made chicken jerky treats. Until the second \ndog, they didn't make the connection between the pet food and the pet \nillness, when the second dog, the puppy, had a life-threatening \nillness.\n  Another Ohioan, Terry Safranek, joined us at our meeting 2 days ago. \nTerry lost her 9-year-old fox terrier earlier this year. She did not \nrealize that tainted chicken jerky treats could be responsible for her \ndog's death until she saw the Thaxton's story on the evening news.\n  These two families, the Thaxtons and the Safraneks, and the 62 \npercent of U.S. households who own a pet shouldn't have to worry about \nthe safety of the food they give their pets. It is an example again of \na trade issue transforming into a safety issue.\n\n  To explain this, so many companies in the United States as part of \ntheir business plan decide--in order to save money, in order to evade \nconsumer protection laws, food safety laws, worker safety laws, and \nenvironmental laws, or for whatever reason--to move their production to \nChina, with significantly cheaper labor. They shut down in Columbus or \nCincinnati, OH, and they move to China to manufacture these products \nthey sell back into the United States.\n  Probably unprecedented in economic or world history is where \ncompanies shut down one place, move overseas, produce the same item, \nand then sell them back into the home market. We know that with that \nwhole trade regimen, that whole construct of that business plan of \nshutting down production and moving overseas and selling back in, there \nare significant health and safety problems. Again, there are problems \nwith lead-based paint and there are problems with the safety of other \nconsumer items. There are problems with food safety, there are problems \nwith pharmaceutical ingredients contamination, and now there are \nproblems with pet foods.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has logged more than 350 reports of \npet illnesses thought to be connected to chicken jerky treats made in \nChina. Although the FDA has already issued a warning about illness, \nthey have not yet for sure identified a contaminant. The treats remain \non market shelves in stores across the country.\n  I would never on this Senate floor suggest people buy something or \nboycott something else. I would suggest, though, that people look at \nthe product when they buy something for their pet and that they look at \nwhere it is made and make the judgment based on that.\n  I am calling on the FDA to accelerate its investigation of imported \npet food, especially food imported from China, where the possibility of \nfood contamination is higher. That is the FDA's job.\n  Earlier this week, I sent a letter to Dr. Hamburg, the FDA \nCommissioner, urging her agency to act swiftly to make sure that \nproducts found to be harmful are pulled from retail outlets. I have \nasked the FDA to improve its notification system so pet owners know \nabout items under investigation for pet food safety breaches. The FDA \nshould promptly pursue efforts to find the contaminant in these pet \ntreats and ensure they are pulled from store shelves to prevent any \nunnecessary pet deaths.\n  Contaminated toys, hard-to-trace medical ingredients, and now pet \nfood have all forced Americans to turn to the government to ensure the \nsafety of the products we import. It is a problem with trade law that \nwe have set this up to happen far too often.\n  It is an example of when government works when we stepped in on lead-\nbased paint, kept those products off the market, and made sure that \nproducts coming in now are safer because we passed the consumer \nprotection revision. It shows that government stepping in, in the right \nway, can make a difference in saving the lives of children, protecting \npeople's pets, protecting pharmaceuticals--making sure that \npharmaceutical safety is guaranteed as much as possible.\n  We have been down this road before. There is nothing free about trade \nthat\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nundermines basic health rules. There is nothing free about trade that \nweakens safety rules, the very rules that help keep food safe to eat \nand water and air safe to drink and to breathe. The FDA should take \naction now to protect American pet owners from tainted products that \ncan harm the health of their pets.\n  It has been a longtime victory for the American people that the air \nwe breathe, the water we drink, the food we take, the toys we buy for \nour children, the treats we buy for our pets--we have done a good job \nin this country in the last several decades of the government \npartnering with businesses to make sure these products are generally \nsafe for our families--for ourselves, for our children, and for our \npets. Now, these holes in our trade laws--these trade laws that \nencourage companies to go overseas and produce products and sell them \nback here--clearly have undermined so much of what we have accomplished \nbipartisanly for so many years for the health and safety of the \nAmerican public.\n  Thus the role of government can be important to show that we do know \nhow to do this to protect our families. I urge the FDA to step in here \non this issue and help American families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S381-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S381-S382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I watched many of the statements made by \nso many of our women Senators who came to the floor in the past hour to \ntalk about this issue of women's preventive health services. I was \nunable to get to the floor at the time. I want to be here now because, \nunfortunately, there is a lot of confusion about what the Affordable \nCare Act does and does not do with respect to women's preventive health \nservices.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nand as someone who is very much involved in crafting this legislation, \nespecially the preventive services part of that legislation, I hope to \nexplain the facts and debunk the myths and the misinformation that has \nrecently arisen on this issue.\n  First, women--nurses, teachers, professors, homemakers, attorneys--\neveryone from all walks of life, all women in America now have the \nright to preventive health care services. Beginning this August, the \nAffordable Care Act guarantees that insured women will have access to \nexpert recommended preventive health care services. These basic \nservices include well-women visits, mammograms, prenatal care, cervical \ncancer screenings, and contraception.\n  These critical services will be offered without any out-of-pocket \ncosts such as copays or deductibles. It is the latter, the ability of \nwomen to have a health insurance plan that covers contraceptives that \nhas led to this recent controversy, this outpouring, this outburst of \npolitical accusations.\n  Here let me emphasize people of strong faith and good conscious have \nvery different views when it comes to these matters. I understand that. \nI have great admiration for the many contributions that religious \ninstitutions make to our country. Catholic charities provide vital \nassistance to low-income Americans. Religious universities teach and \nprepare thousands of young people to be outstanding citizens and \nproductive members of our society. In fact, I attended law school at \nCatholic University right up the street. I also attended Catholic \nelementary schools and Catholic high school.\n  Catholic hospitals are instrumental in providing first-class health \ncare to so many of our fellow citizens. I have spoken many times about \nthe care that Mercy Hospital in Des Moines, a Catholic hospital, gave \nto my father when he was elderly and in bad health because of black \nlung disease and he had no money. They provided care for him at no \ncost. So I have very deep feelings about the generosity and the care \nthat these religious hospitals provide.\n  It is for this reason I would oppose any measure that threatens the \nfundamental religious liberties of these institutions. I believe, \nhowever, that the President properly balanced the essential health care \nneeds of women with the rights of religious institutions. Let me \nclarify what this rule does, and most importantly does not do since \nfolks, such as Governor Romney, are misleading the American people--\nperhaps intentionally distorting the facts--using the issue for \ndemagoguery.\n  First, churches and other houses of worship are specifically exempt \nfrom the requirement that they carry insurance plans that provide \ncontraception.\n  Second, no individual health care provider, neither religious nor \nsecular, will be forced to prescribe contraception. The President and \nhis administration have previously and continue to express strong \nsupport for existing conscience protections. Moreover, other \nreligiously affiliated organizations that employ people of different \nfaiths--such as Catholic colleges and hospitals--can qualify for a 1-\nyear transition period as they prepare to comply with the new law.\n  Let me point out, no individual will be forced to buy or use \ncontraception. No individual will be forced to buy or use \ncontraception. Under this policy, women who want contraception will \nhave access to it through their insurance without having to pay a copay \nor deductible, but no one will be forced to buy or to use \ncontraception. Let's make that clear.\n  Drugs that cause abortion, such as RU486, the morning-after pill, are \nnot covered by this policy. Let me repeat that. Drugs that cause \nabortion, such as RU486, the morning-after pill, are not covered by \nthis policy and nothing about this policy changes the President's firm \ncommitment to maintain strict limitations on Federal funding for \nabortions. No Federal tax dollars are used for elective abortions.\n  Let me quote what Governor Romney said in Colorado just yesterday:\n\n       Just this last week, this same administration said that in \n     churches and the institutions they run, such as schools, and \n     let's say adoption agencies, hospitals, that they have to \n     provide for their employees, free of charge, contraceptives, \n     morning-after pills--in other words abortive pills and the \n     like at no cost.\n  Mr. Romney said.\n\n       Think what that does to people in faiths without sharing \n     those views. This is a violation of conscience.\n\n  Mr. Romney, this does not cover morning-after pills. And the adoption \nagencies and the hospitals do not have to provide free of charge \ncontraceptives. All they have to do is to make available, through the \nbroad insurance coverage they have, for women who choose to use \ncontraceptive services, that they can get those without any copays or \ndeductibles. But this does not cover the morning-after pill. Yet I keep \nhearing it.\n  I was working out this morning while watching CNN, and somebody else \ncame on talking about how the Catholic Church is opposed to abortions; \nthey should not be forced to fund abortions. This has nothing to do \nwith that. All it says is, if you have a broad-based insurance policy \nand you are not a religious institution or a church and you are, let's \nsay a hospital, and you have insurance that covers a broad array of \npeople, we have said that insurance must cover a broad variety of \npreventive services: mammograms, cervical cancer screening, well-women \nvisits--all of that--and contraception--and contraception, a preventive \nservice.\n  Mr. Romney is going around saying these things, but it is not true. \nIt is simply not true. He is either misinformed or he is purposely \ntrying to mislead the American people--neither of which is acceptable. \nAs I said, churches and other houses of worship are specifically exempt \nfrom the requirement that they carry insurance plans that provide \ncontraception.\n  Second, no individual health care provider, neither religious nor \nsecular, will be forced to prescribe contraception. No individual will \nbe forced to buy or use contraception against her own conscience. All \nthe rules the President announced ensure that all women, no matter \nwho their employer, have the opportunity to enjoy the same insurance \nand the same vital preventive services--every woman. In fact, there is \nnothing radical about such a policy. Fifty percent of Americans \ncurrently live in 28 States that require insurance companies to cover \ncontraception. Imagine that.\n\n  Several of these States--such as Arizona, New York, Oregon, and \nCalifornia--have had this law in effect for years, saying if you have \ninsurance\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\ncoverage, you have to provide contraceptive services under that broad \ncoverage of insurance, and these four States have identical religious \nemployer exemptions as the rule the President announced.\n  Let me repeat, Arizona, New York, Oregon and California have \nidentical religious employer exemptions, the same as the rule the \nPresident announced. I did not hear Mr. Romney going after the \nGovernors of Arizona or of New York or Oregon or California. This has \nnow become a political issue, and it should not be. It should not be.\n  Religious institutions continue to serve the public by providing \nexemplary health, education, and antipoverty services in these States, \nand I am hopeful that nothing will change in the rest of the country. \nTwenty-eight States, half the people who already live in those States \nthat cover the same thing.\n  The health of women in this Nation is far too important to become a \nsound bite on the evening news, a headline in the morning paper, or \npolitical rhetoric--again, to divide us. The President's policy and \nwhat we have done does not divide us. In fact, if anything it unifies \nthe country. I do not think anyone thinks we should pass a law banning \ncontraceptives. We did in the old days, you know. There was a Supreme \nCourt case about that. As a matter of fact, I read it in law school \nwhen I was at Catholic University Law School: Griswold v. Connecticut, \nif I am not mistaken.\n  The Supreme Court said, no; the State has no interest, no vital \ninterest in telling women they cannot use contraceptive services and \ndevices. That is an old case. If someone is conscience-bound and they \nsay they don't want to--that is fine. No one is being forced to do \nanything against their consciences. No one is being forced to do \nanything we have not already done in this country in 28 States. But now \nit has become political rhetoric. How else do we explain Mr. Romney's \ntotal misinformation? To try to divide us as a country again.\n  It is time to put this aside. It is time to put aside these \ndifferences, these divisions, and focus on giving people access to the \naffordable health care they deserve. That is what the Affordable Care \nAct does, and we should not let political rhetoric, political \ngamesmanship, a political campaign again try to tear us apart, try to \nmisinform people to inflame passions that somehow we have gone off on a \ndifferent path; that we are doing something totally different than what \nwe have done before. We are not. We are not. To include in this the \ninflammatory rhetoric of abortion and all that it entails is doing a \ndisservice to the women of this country.\n  I hope the truth will get out, that this misinformation will fall by \nthe wayside, and people will see this for the political rhetoric it is, \nand that we will move forward with a health care system that does \nprovide broad preventive services to every woman in America. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night, the Senate adopted the final \nversion of a long term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. The process has been long and less than elegant as we \nworked through differences between the chambers, across parties and \nregional differences. I voted for the bill and am pleased that there is \nnow more stable funding and policy to support our national aviation \nsystem. There are aspects of this bill that I do not agree with and \nwould have done differently.\n  The FAA authorization expired in October of 2007. For more than 4 \nyears, we have been operating on short-term extensions--23 total short \nterm extensions. The FAA, airlines and flying public all deserve a \nlong-term authorization to provide certainty to our national aviation \nsystem.\n  One reason I voted for this legislation is that it is a jobs bill. \nThe FAA estimates commercial aviation is responsible for 5.2 percent of \ngross domestic product and generates $1.2 trillion in economic \nactivity. The aviation industry provides $346 billion in earnings and \n11 million jobs. And this bill will help grow those numbers.\n  The funding provided in this bill will support 280,000 jobs. The \neconomist Mark Zandi said, ``Aviation is the glue that keeps the global \neconomy together.'' This bill will boost our economy now and keep the \nUnited States competitive in the global marketplace in the future.\n  As importantly, this bill will improve the safety of our aviation \nsystem. Improving runway safety is one of the National Transportation \nSafety Board's ``Most Wanted'' list. There were 988 runway incursions \nlast year. This year there have already been 66 incidents. This bill \nwill require FAA to review all commercial service airports in the \nUnited States and initiate action to improve lighting, signage, and \nrunway and taxiway markings.\n  Another key component of this bill is NextGen, the term we use to \ndescribe our transition from radar-based air traffic control system to \na GPS-driven system. NextGen will give pilots and air traffic \ncontrollers the ability to accurately pinpoint aircraft in the sky--to \navoid problems, to monitor traffic, to move things more smoothly, \nsafely and efficiently. The FAA has called for action on implementing \nNextGen.\n  Last year, U.S. airlines carried 704 million passengers. Soon, those \nnumbers will increase significantly. The FAA reports that U.S. airlines \nwill carry more than one billion passengers by 2023 and more than 1.2 \nbillion passengers by 2030. Our outdated air traffic control systems \ncannot safely and reliably handle this increase in traffic. But with \nNextGen, we hope to triple the capacity of our national aviation \nsystem.\n  This technology will allow planes to fly the straightest, quickest \nroute from point A to point B. And with more precise information and \nbetter communication between the ground and the cockpit, we can fit \nmore planes safely in our airspace. Doing so will save airlines at \nleast 3.3 billion gallons of fuel a year--or more than $10 billion \nannually by 2025. NextGen should also reduce airport delays \nsignificantly.\n  Chicago's Midway Airport was ranked dead last over the past few \nmonths for on-time departures. Chicago's O'Hare airport has won that \ndubious distinction more than once. The\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\nmain reason for these delays is the lack of capacity in our aviation \nsystem. Fully implementing NextGen could reduce those delays by half.\n  NextGen will also save more than 1.4 billion gallons of fuel and \nprovide $22 billion in savings to airlines and flyers. This is a great \ninvestment. This bill will help airports and air travelers in Illinois \nand nationwide save time and money.\n  In Illinois, we are in the middle of the largest airport expansion \nproject in U.S. history at O'Hare airport. This $6.6 billion project \nwill completely reconfigure the runways at O'Hare to make sure we can \nmove more traffic in and out of Chicago more efficiently. Moving this \nproject along means a lot to the people of Chicago and Illinois.\n  O'Hare already generates 450,000 jobs and $38 billion in economic \nactivity for the Chicago region and the State of Illinois. The O'Hare \nmodernization project will create 195,000 more jobs, and another $18 \nbillion in annual economic activity. This bill will allow O'Hare to \nkeep moving forward by funding the airport improvement program at \nhealthy levels. And it isn't just O'Hare. Airports in Illinois will \nbenefits from more than $3.3 billion per year for AIP projects.\n  Last year, airports in the Quad Cities, Rockford, Decatur and \nSpringfield all used AIP program funds to make critical improvements to \ntheir airfields. Keeping this funding flowing will allow these airports \nto handle the traffic of today and the future increases of tomorrow.\n  The bill helps rural areas keep the commercial air service they have \nnow and attract new service in the future. The Senate Conferees \ndefeated an attempt to completely dismantle the essential air service \nprogram. This bill fully funds essential air service and puts in place \nimportant reforms so the Department of Transportation works with \nbusinesses, local communities and the airline industry to start and \nretain quality air service to rural communities.\n  Without a robust EAS program, many rural communities would have no \ncommercial air service at all, and residents of smaller cities would \nhave to travel significant distances for flights. This bill will ensure \ncommunities in Quincy, Marion and Decatur have scheduled commercial air \nservice--an enormous tool for communities to retain and attract \nbusinesses. Scheduled air service as an important requirement for many \nbusinesses when they choose a headquarters or office.\n  While I voted for this bill for all the reasons I have already \nmentioned, I have very serious concerns about some of the labor \nprovisions included in this bill. Several times, Republicans held up \npassage of a reauthorization bill on unrelated labor issues. And last \nyear, these disagreements led to a lapse of authorization for several \ndays before we were able to pass the latest short term extension. \nDuring that lapse, some 4,000 Federal aviation workers were furloughed, \nairline construction projects like the O'Hare Modernization Project \nwere threatened, and it cost the Federal Government roughly $25 million \nin tax revenue each day.\n  So, Senator Reid made a tough decision--he negotiated with House \nRepublicans for the removal of language overturning the National \nMediation Board rule, but in exchange the bill now includes the current \nlabor provision which could make it more difficult for workers to \norganize and form a union. It is unfortunate that Republicans insisted \non bringing Federal labor law into this legislation without hearings or \nadequate debate. But I could not allow Republicans to continue holding \nthis bill hostage. It is too important to airline safety, the economy, \nmy State, and the country as whole.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support a clean extension of the FAA \nbill. But I cannot support the conference report that's before the \nSenate today because it includes a radical provision to undermine our \nrail and airline workers' right to organize.\n  The FAA bill is a jobs bill that keeps air safety employees and \nconstruction workers at airports on the job. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, every dollar spent on transportation \nisn't just an investment in concrete and steel, it is an investment in \nour workers that creates jobs. Reauthorizing this bill keeps thousands \nof Federal employees and tens of thousands of construction workers on \nthe job and not worrying about whether they will receive a paycheck.\n  A reauthorization of the FAA bill means 4 years of stability. It will \nmodernize and upgrade our air traffic control system. And it will \nprovide billions in investments to improve our airports with new \nrunways, aprons, lighting, and land purchases. A clean FAA bill saves \njobs, protects the flying public, and stimulates our economy.\n  But this FAA bill comes with a poison pill labor provision that was \nadded in Conference. I cannot vote for such a radical provision that \nmakes it more difficult for rail and airline workers to organize and \nsets a dangerous precedent of opening the Railway Labor Act up for \nhostile anti-worker amendments on unrelated must-do transportation \nbills.\n  This is just another example in a persistent pattern of attacking \nworkers' rights. The Republicans have made it clear that the price of \ntheir support for a much-needed investment in our air infrastructure is \nto undermine our workers' right to organize and decide whether they \nwant to be represented by a union.\n  During the Senate's debate of the FAA bill last year, the Republicans \ntried to strip hardworking Transportation Security Administration \nworkers of their collective bargaining rights.\n  Last summer, the FAA shut down for 2 weeks because the House \nRepublicans insisted on a provision to make it harder for rail and \nairline workers to form unions. Now, we are days away from the \nexpiration of the latest of 23 short-term extensions to the FAA bill, \nand the conference report includes another attack on workers' rights. \nThe Republicans need to get off of it with labor, and get on with the \nbusiness of creating jobs.\n  Unions play a vital role in ensuring safe and fair working \nconditions. We encourage the right to organize around the world. We \nneed to encourage it on our own FAA bill.\n  Our rail and airline workers are hard at work every day protecting \nAmericans. They keep us safe and secure as we travel. In return, they \ndeserve a decent wage and safe working conditions. They deserve to have \ntheir right to organize and negotiate protected. And they deserve our \nthanks and respect.\n  I support a reauthorization of the FAA bill, but I am not prepared to \ntrade away our workers' rights to get it done. I cannot support this \nconference report.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support to the \nFederal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act conference \nreport which was passed by the Senate last night, and will provide a \ngreater sense of financial security than the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, has seen in a long time. No agency should be \nsubjected to the budget uncertainties that FAA has been forced to \nexperience, nor strung along year after year unable to make long-term \nplans. For more than 4 years, the FAA has operated under more than 20 \nshort-term funding extensions. I think that is unprecedented in the \nhistory of agency funding. At any rate, it is no way to run a railroad \nor a national aviation system.\n  I also support the conference report because it would finally allow \nthe FAA to move forward on the NextGen air navigation program, would \ngive the passenger's bill of rights the force of law, and would provide \nbillions of dollars to improve and develop public airports across the \ncountry. For these reasons, the legislation is long overdue and sorely \nneeded.\n  The conference report, however, does contain a provision about \naviation security and the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, \nthat is deeply troubling to me and about which I feel duty bound to \nexpress my disapproval.\n  At stake is TSA's management of the Screening Partnership Program, \nSPP, which allows a limited number of airports around the country to \nreplace Transportation Security Officers, TSOs, with private \ncontractors to screen passengers and their baggage. TSA has implemented \nthis program at airports where, due to low-traffic volume, full-time, \nyear-round Federal staff is unnecessary. A handful of larger airports \ntake part in the program so TSA can measure and assess its performance \nand cost effectiveness\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nagainst the private contractors. It is telling that TSA's assessment \nafter comparing the two systems is that it can secure airports more \neconomically than private screeners can.\n  Regrettably, some of my colleagues in the House and Senate are \nresolved to undermine TSA--and therefore airport security itself--by \nadvocating for the pre-9/11 system of screening by private contractors. \nMy response to that is, how quickly we forget.\n  Mr. President, we have already tried an aviation security system run \nby private contractors. It very tragically did not work. The 9/11 \nattacks did not occur because of one, two, or three specific \nvulnerabilities. They occurred because a number of our defenses--\nincluding our system of airport screening--were simply inadequate.\n  I know everyone has vivid memories of the days after the 9/11 \nattacks, and it is hard to forget the dramatic loss of confidence the \npublic felt for the aviation security system. Air travel dropped off \nprecipitously in the weeks and months after 9/11, the aviation industry \nwas shaken to its core, and our economy suffered because of it.\n  It became clear to many of us that aviation security was inseparable \nfrom national security, and we could not, and should not, rely on the \nprivate sector to do the job. The security of our skies would have to \nbecome a government responsibility. Americans need to be safe and \nsecure wherever and whenever they travel. And while I would not want to \ncast blame or criticism on any one contractor, we have already \nwitnessed the results of a system utilizing private security companies \nwhich were constantly pressured to focus on costs first and security \nsecond.\n  Less than 2 weeks after the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan group of 21 \nSenators introduced the legislation that would create TSA and turn \nairport screening over to Federal officials. Barely a month after 9/11, \nthe Senate passed that bill by a vote of 100 to 0. The bipartisanship \nof that vote was heartening and demonstrated a unity among Members that \nI wish we could experience more often. In the years since, we have had \na few near misses, and our defenses have been penetrated more than \nonce, but no hijackings or terrorist incidents have been successfully \ncarried out. In large part, we have a dedicated corps of TSOs to thank \nfor that.\n  I know it is fashionable in some quarters to criticize TSA. \nUnderstandably, people are unhappy with pat-downs, body scans, and \ninvasions of privacy. But TSA establishes its policies for a reason. \nThey are a direct response to real terrorist threats, and they have \nevolved as the threat has evolved. When a terrorist put explosives in \nhis shoes and tried to light them afire mid-flight in 2001, TSA asked \npassengers to remove their shoes for screening. When a terrorist plot \nwas uncovered in 2006 that involved lighting flammable liquids aboard \nseveral planes, liquids, except in small quantities, were prohibited. \nAfter the Christmas Day 2009 attempted attack with explosives hidden in \na terrorist's clothing, better screening technology was developed. \nThese are not hypothetical cases or academic scenarios. They are real \nincidents and the reason that TSA makes so many demands on the flying \npublic. And we should not delude ourselves or the American people into \nthinking that adopting a contract workforce will eliminate the need for \nbody scanners, pat-downs, or any other security procedure TSA \ndetermines is necessary to secure air travel. Regardless of whether a \nU.S. airport uses Federal screeners or private ones, the security \nprocedures implemented are the same.\n  Yet a provision has been tucked into this bill that would make it \nmore difficult for TSA to maintain its current system by lowering the \nburden of proof for admitting additional airports to the Screening \nPartnership Program. Right now, airports must demonstrate that a \nprivate screening workforce would be more effective, secure, and \nefficient, than the TSA. The standard tucked into this bill, however, \nwould only require airports to demonstrate that using private screeners \n``would not compromise security or detrimentally affect the cost-\nefficiency or the effectiveness of screening.''\n  While the TSA Administrator would still have the authority to deny an \napplication to the Screening Partnership Program, this lower standard \nwould make it far more difficult for him to do so. TSA Administrator \nPistole has said that the Screening Partnership Program should be used \njudiciously and that airport screening is and should remain a core \nmission for the Department of Homeland Security since 9/11, and I agree \nwith him wholeheartedly.\n  Another provision in the bill strikes me as counterproductive. This \nprovision would require TSA to provide recommendations to an airport \nthat was denied its application to the SPP on how that airport can \novercome the denial, if it decides to resubmit its application. If TSA \nbelieves that it can screen passengers and baggage better and with more \ncost efficiency than a private contractor, why would it provide tips on \nhow an airport can escape that system?\n  Private screening could also limit TSA's ability to react nimbly to \nintelligence threats. If screeners are privately employed and managed \nairport by airport, TSA may not be able to respond effectively by \nshifting personnel to where it is most needed or modifying procedures \nif it cannot exert direct control over screeners.\n  Mr. President, private screening at airports could undermine not just \npublic confidence in the aviation security system but in aviation \nsecurity itself. We have been there and experienced the consequences of \nprivate screening. The American public must feel secure when it \ntravels, and security is the first priority of TSA.\n  Ultimately, I voted for the Federal Aviation Administration \nModernization and Reform Act. But I believe we should reconsider and \nrevisit the language related to TSA's Screening Partnership Program. I \nwould urge my colleagues to remember the lessons learned after 9/11 and \nwork with me to ensure we won't make the same mistakes again.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the long-awaited passage of the long term \nFAA reauthorization conference report is a great achievement for \nChairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchinson, and the many other \nSenators and staff members who were involved in this legislation. I'm \npleased with the important nationwide achievements in this bill--\nNextGen radar systems, improved passengers' rights, and airline ticket \ntransparency, to name a few.\n  But I wanted to take a few moments to talk about the huge positive \nimpact this legislation is going to have throughout almost every part \nof my home State of Oregon.\n  The big news for the Portland region is that the new slot exemptions \nat Washington National Airport will likely allow for the first direct \nflight from Portland International Airport to Washington National. This \nwas not an easy victory for the northwest--many of my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle had opinions on this issue and it seemed like \nwe were not going to be able to come to an agreement. But I'm proud to \nsay that both sides came to a compromise that will improve air service \nin the northwest and throughout the country.\n  One of the things I'm most proud of is that this bill permanently \nprotects Crater Lake from the threat of noisy air tours. As most folks \nwho have visited Crater Lake know, the quiet and peace of the park is \njust as important as its scenic beauty. This legislation says that \nCrater Lake is specifically off limits to any overflights that might \nthreaten that tranquility.\n  This bill creates six new test areas for commercial use of unmanned \naerial systems. In Central Oregon, folks are excited about the \npotential for using those test areas to advance the cutting edge \naviation industry that already exists there. It's also an opportunity \nto monitor wildlife, do meteorological testing, and improve law \nenforcement in the vast acres of public lands now being co-opted by \ndrug traffickers.\n  Perhaps the folks who are most directly helped by this legislation \nare in Independence, OR. Independence has a community of general \naviation enthusiasts who live near Independence Airport and who keep \ntheir planes on their own property. The FAA recently decided to change \nthe rules on them, putting their future in doubt. This legislation \nerases that doubt and allows those folks to continue an arrangement \nthey've had for nearly 40 years with no significant safety issues and \nno significant noise complaints.\n  Finally, this legislation includes language to encourage recycling at \nairports, something I have been working\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\non for nearly a half dozen years. I'm glad that it will provide \nimportant tools for airport recycling going forward.\n  I commend my colleagues for moving this legislation forward as a \npositive step for the country and for my home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S385-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FLOOD PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their help in \npassing S. 2039 by unanimous consent last month. This bill, which \nestablishes a pilot program in North Dakota, will provide a great deal \nof help to citizens in my State.\n  I sponsored this legislation because Federal policy has stood in the \nway of flood protection measures necessary for communities in North \nDakota. I want to highlight a couple of situations, one in Fargo and \none in Minot, that illustrate the need for this bill.\n  First, Fargo, ND, has faced repeated flooding in the Red River, which \nruns through the heart of the city. The city has constructed a \npermanent levee to run along as much of the river as possible. However, \nover the years, some properties along the river bank were bought out \nusing funds from FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. HMGP \nguidelines prohibit the construction of any structure, including a \nlevee, on land bought out under the program. So as a result, Fargo's \nlevee stops every time it comes up to HMGP land. When the waters rise, \nthe city builds a temporary extension of its levee that goes over the \nHMGP land and connects to the next section of the permanent levee, and \nwhen the waters recede, the city has to take down the temporary levee \nto remain in compliance with the HMGP no-construction policy. Year \nafter year, Fargo has constructed and then removed several temporary \nlevees at great expense and for no apparent reason other than the \nletter of the HMGP law.\n  Second, Minot, ND, is about to run into the same problem currently \nfacing Fargo. As my colleagues know, Minot faced enormous flooding \nduring the summer of 2011, losing thousands of homes and sustaining \nhundreds of millions in damages. In response, the city plans to build a \nmajor new flood protection system, including levees through the middle \nof town along the river. In order to build that system, Minot will have \nto buy out dozens of properties and create space for a levee. The \nFederal Government will make money available through the HMGP program \nfor property buyouts, but we are unable to use it if spending it \nprecludes construction of a levee on these properties.\n  In both cases, the solution is simply to permit levee construction on \nproperty purchased with HMGP funds. HMGP restrictions on construction \nwere intended to ensure that the Federal Government would not be on the \nhook to pay for future flood damages on property it had bought out. For \nthe most part, that makes sense. But when a community wants to add \nflood protection in the form of a levee, it should be allowed to do so. \nA levee across HMGP-purchased land does not create future liabilities \nfor the Federal Government; instead, it increases flood protection for \nlocal residents--something that will save the government money in \nfuture flood situations.\n  The text of S. 2039 allows for levee construction on North Dakota \nland purchased through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The \nlegislation directs the FEMA Administrator to approve construction of a \nlevee on HMGP land after the Administrator determines that the levee \nwould provide better flood risk mitigation than maintaining the \nproperty as open space. The Administrator is also directed to ensure \nthat the levee would comply with relevant levee construction and \nmaintenance standards and would minimize future costs to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  And I would like to put particular emphasis on the subject of costs \nto the Federal Government. This legislation does not affect the amounts \nof money provided under the HMGP program. It does, however, allow \ncommunities like Minot to use HMGP dollars more efficiently by \npermitting property buyouts to be linked with new flood protection \nplans. The legislation eliminates the costs FEMA and the Army Corps of \nEngineers incur every time they are forced to build and then tear down \ntemporary levees on HMGP properties. Finally, the legislation ensures \nthat any costs associated with the process the FEMA Administrator and \nthe Army Corps Chief of Engineers use to approve levee construction are \nborne by the State, local, or tribal government requesting the levee. \nAny Federal funds approved elsewhere of course remain available for \nlevee construction and are not affected by this legislation.\n  S. 2039 has moved on to the House of Representatives where I hope it \ncan be approved expeditiously and sent to the President. The bill will \nprovide important benefits to the people of Fargo, Minot, Devils Lake, \nand other North Dakota communities facing repeated flood risks. I thank \nmy colleagues for their support of this common sense legislation, and I \nhope it can be an example of how to improve flood protection \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S385-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S385-S386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMEMBERING FOUR CHAPLAINS OF THE USAT ``DORCHESTER''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to four \nAmerican heroes who embody the spirit of what it means to serve your \nfellow man. Those heroes are the four Army chaplains who served on \nboard the United States Transport Ship Dorchester in 1943--Methodist \nMinister Reverend George L. Fox, Rabbi Alexander D. Goode, Roman \nCatholic Priest John P. Washington, and Reformed Church in America \nminister Reverend Clark V. Poling.\n  On February 2, 1943, the Dorchester was making its way across the \nNorth Atlantic, carrying 904 service men, merchant seamen, and civilian \nworkers. This area was under constant patrol by German submarines; it \nwas a dangerous area for American vessels and several ships had already \nbeen sunk between Newfoundland and Greenland, the Dorchester's intended \ndestination. At 12:55 a.m. on February 3, a German U-boat spotted the \nDorchester and fired 3 torpedoes at the American ship, delivering a \nfatal blow.\n  The Dorchester began to take on water and would sink beneath the \nfreezing ocean in under 25 minutes. Many had been killed or injured in \nthe initial blast, and panic set in as the passengers and crew \nattempted to find life vests and get into lifeboats. Many of the \nsurviving passengers recall the calm disposition of the four chaplains \nwho made their way to a storage locker and handed out lifejackets. When \nthere were no more lifejackets, the chaplains removed their own and \ngave them to four passengers who were without. Rabbi Goode was seen \ngiving away his only pair of gloves, and throughout the chaos and panic \nsurvivors could hear the chaplains preaching courage as the ship went \ndown.\n  There were not enough rubber suits onboard to protect the passengers \nfrom the frigid North Atlantic waters. Of the 14 lifeboats aboard, only \n2 were successfully used in abandoning ship. Of the 904 passengers, \nonly 229 were saved by nearby vessels. 14 bodies were recovered, and \n661, including the 4 Army chaplains, were missing and unreported.\n  In recognition of the extraordinary heroism displayed by the \nchaplains when they sacrificed their lives by giving up their life \npreservers to other men aboard the Dorchester, Congress authorized the \nSpecial Medal for Heroism which was awarded by President Eisenhower on \nJanuary 18, 1961. No such medal has been awarded again in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Millions of men and women have served bravely in our military. Many, \nlike the chaplains onboard the Dorchester, have gone above and beyond \nthe call of duty. The 4 chaplains on board, despite their differences \nin faith, came together to bring comfort to the 904 men on board the \nDorchester. And they proved that it is possible to serve not only their \ncountry and their God but also their fellow man.\n  On February 14, a monument to the four chaplains of the Dorchester \nwill be unveiled in Sebastian, FL. In January, I had a chance to meet \nErnie Heaton, the last living survivor of the Dorchester sinking and a \nkey leader in the push to get a monument put up in Sebastian. It was \nclear after meeting Ernie that witnessing the four chaplains' sacrifice \nfirst-hand made a lasting impact on him, just as their story continues \nto inspire all of us.\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S386-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RACHEL BRISTOL\n\n Mr. MERKLEY.

Before joining the Oregon Food Bank, \nRachel graduated with honors from the University of Oregon with a \ndegree in community development and public administration and served as \na VISTA volunteer at the Oregon Food Share in 1983. Her devotion to \nfeeding the hungry soon led her to the job of Acting Executive Director \nat the OFS. In 1988, she was a key player in the merger with \nInteragency Food Bank to form the Oregon Food Bank. Just 2 years later, \nBristol was named the executive director & CEO of the OFB.\n  Rachel's legacy at the Oregon Food Bank is well-known and widespread. \nUnder her leadership, the food bank expanded from a 10,000 square foot \nsite to 4 facilities totaling more than 155,000 square feet. Rachel's \ndevotion to improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of hungry \nchildren has garnered recognition from the University of Portland, the \nPaul G. Allen Foundation, Feeding America, and the Portland Business \nJournal, and thanks from the families whose lives have changed because \nof her hard work and dedication.\n  I will be sad to see Rachel Bristol go, but thank her for her 29 \nyears of service. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S386-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE KLUSE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I congratulate one of my \nconstituents, Mike Kluse, on being recognized as the 2012 Laboratory \nDirector of the Year by the Federal Laboratory Consortium, FLC. Mike is \nthe Director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, \nlocated in Richland, WA.\n  This award is a true honor and testament to Mike's leadership and \nefforts at PNNL. For the past 5 years he has guided the laboratory to \nmany accolades. The laboratory has filed more than 1,000 invention \ndisclosures, received more than 200 patents, and issued nearly 150 new \nlicenses. PNNL has also earned 16 R 100 awards as well as 12 FLC \nawards for excellence in technology transfer. PNNL has the newest and \nmost modern physical infrastructure in the Department of Energy, DOE, \nsystem. And PNNL's overall performance has been judged by DOE and other \nFederal agencies it supports as outstanding under Mike's stewardship.\n  PNNL's research and development portfolio spans many missions of \nimportance to our country: national security, homeland security, clean \nenergy development, environmental remediation programs at the Hanford \nSite, and scientific research ranging from systems biology to \nsupercomputing.\n  Under Mike's leadership, PNNL has been involved in the formation of \nInnovate Washington, a nonprofit organization that aims to accelerate \ntechnological innovation by bringing together universities, national \nlabs, entrepreneurs, and others involved in technology transfer. Mike \nis also a frequent public advocate for the strategic alignment of \nresearch with technology transfer and strongly supported the \nstreamlining of PNNL's technology transfer operations.\n  PNNL also deserves praise for the safety and excellent work \nenvironment it provides for its employees and the surrounding \ncommunity. As director, Mike has sustained an exceptional record for \nPNNL and built upon its history to make it one of the region's \nstrongest corporate citizens. He's also been a tireless supporter of \ncommunity activities and programs. Furthermore, Mike's outstanding \nleadership led to DOE extending PNNL's contract in 2011.\n  Therefore, it is with great pride that today on behalf of the \ncitizens of Washington State I thank Mike for all his work. With that \nsaid, we know that PNNL's great successes could not be achieved without \nthe strong support from the PNNL family, so my thanks also extends to \nthe extraordinary scientists, engineers, and personnel that continue to \nmake a difference in our region and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S386-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK HAMILL\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mark Hamill, \na native Montanan and a veteran of Operation Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Mark's service during the first \ngulf war. Mark was in the Army Reserves as a helicopter crew chief. In \nthe fall of 1990, he was assigned to a Medivac unit and deployed to \nSaudi Arabia.\n  As a helicopter crew chief, Mark was responsible for making sure the \nMedivac helicopters were ready to fly at a moment's notice. Two \nhelicopters went to Bahrain and two were on standby to go north for \nMedivac calls.\n  When Mark returned to the United States, the maintenance platoon \nnever got their medals from the U.S. Army. The pilots and medics from \nthe helicopters did but the men and women who were responsible for the \nsafety of the helicopters were forgotten about.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of Mark's wife, parents, and \nfriends, it was my honor to correct this oversight and finally present \nMark with the medals he earned nearly 20 years ago.\n  I presented to Mark the Southwest Asia Service Medal with Three \nBronze Stars, and the Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  I also had the honor of presenting to Mark the Kuwait Liberation \nMedal--Saudi Arabia, and the Kuwait Liberation Medal--Kuwait.\n  These four decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful \nsymbols of true heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S386-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL WALBORN\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Paul Walborn, \na veteran of Vietnam.\n  Paul, on behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say \n``thank you'' for your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Paul Walborn's sacrifice in \nVietnam, because no story of heroism should ever fall through the \ncracks.\n  Paul joined the Navy in December of 1963. He was an Electrician's \nMate, based on a landing craft. From Coronado, CA, he flew to Japan. On \nMay 5, 1965, one of Paul's first assignments was to be part of a convoy \nfrom Okinawa, Japan to Vietnam. Paul was part of the third wave that \ntook Marine Corps artillery equipment to the Chu Lai beach. \nIntelligence reports were unclear whether Viet Cong forces would meet \nthem on the beach.\n  From Chu Lai, Paul went to Da Nang where he unloaded Navy and \nMerchant Marine equipment. His boat then made several trips up the \nPerfume River to deliver equipment to support the war effort.\n  When Paul returned to America, he wanted to get back to normal life. \nHis DD-214 form was correct but the Navy had no record of him serving \nin Vietnam, even though he unloaded cargo onto Vietnamese beaches.\n  He says there was just too much going on in 1967 for the Navy to \nworry about getting his paperwork processed correctly.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of his family, it was my honor to \nfinally present to Paul the National Defense Service Medal, and the \nVietnam Service Medal with one Bronze Star.\n  I also presented to Paul the Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon, \nand the Vietnam Campaign Medal with the 1960 device.\n  These four decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful \nsymbols of true heroism. Sacrifice. And dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S386-5", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S386-S387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM\n\n Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about an \nimportant health issue that impacts the lives of many people across the \ncountry. Each year, more than 18,000 Americans are diagnosed with a \nserious blood disease and require a bone marrow transplant. \nUnfortunately, only 30 percent of those patients in need will find a \nsuitable match within their family. Although about 5,000 patients each \nyear receive a marrow transplant, others will pass away while awaiting \na match.\n  Since 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program, NMDP, now publically\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nknown as Be The Match, has undertaken a laudable effort to connect \ntransplant patients with healthy, unrelated donors through the Be The \nMatch Registry. Today, the registry includes more than 9.5 million \nregistered donors. Despite their success in raising awareness and \nsoliciting support, a small percentage of our population is registered. \nPatients from ethnic and minority communities face particular \ndifficulty in finding matches due to limited diversity within the \nregistry, further complicating the search for a viable genetic match. \nDeutsche Knochenmarkspenderdatei gGmbH, DKMS, currently the largest \nbone marrow donor center in the world, shares Be The Match's commitment \nto increasing donor recruitment and diversifying the marrow donor \nregistry.\n  This year, marrow donor registry drives will take place in \ncommunities across America. One in particular, known as Simon's \nSaturday, will take place in Emmaus, PA. The bone marrow donor drive is \nnamed after Simon Ernst, an energetic 8-year-old from Upper Milford, \nwho is bravely battling leukemia and awaiting a bone marrow transplant. \nParticipation in the marrow donor registry is simple and safe. \nInterested participants must meet the age and health requirements, fill \nout a registration form, and provide a swab of cheek cells. I would \nlike to encourage those interested to attend a bone marrow drive in \ntheir community or to join online by visiting the NDMP website at \nwww.BeTheMatch.org or the DKMS website at www.getswabbed.org.\n  The bone marrow donor program is a cause close to my family's heart, \nwhich is why I intend to participate in a bone marrow registry drive on \nFebruary 18, 2012. This issue is especially important to my wife Kris, \nwho has been a registered donor through Be The Match for the last 16 \nyears, and I look forward to joining her and the more than 9.5 million \nindividuals who have already joined. Together we can help provide hope \nand save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/07/senate-section/article/S387-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL BECK\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

A bill to close unjustified corporate tax loopholes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Conrad and \nothers, I am introducing S. 2075, the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes \nAct, or CUT Loopholes Act. This legislation will help us meet three \nimportant goals: Reducing the budget deficit, protecting important \npriorities, and restoring some of the fairness to our tax system.\n  Our legislation would reduce the deficit by $155 billion. It would do \nso by closing tax loopholes that favor wealthy individuals and \ncorporations while raising the tax burden that American families must \ncarry. It would provide more than enough revenue to pay for a full-year \nextension of the payroll tax cut now in place, or put a significant \ndent in the deficit reduction we need to avoid draconian automatic cuts \nthrough sequestration.\n  It is clear to almost everyone that revenue must be a part of our \ndeficit reduction strategy. Presidents from Reagan to Bush, Sr. to \nClinton have used balanced strategies that included revenue as well as \nspending cuts.\n  I will continue to fight for a number of other revenue measures such \nas a surtax on millionaires and billionaires; eliminating tax subsidies \nfor oil and gas companies; ending the Bush-era tax cuts for those \nearning more than $250,000; and ending the carried interest loophole. \nWe need to make those changes. But so far, they have run into an \nideological brick wall, as many here in Congress refuse to consider \nreasonable revenue measures. But even that rigid ideological stance \nshould allow for ending the kinds of egregious loopholes we are \ndiscussing today.\n  First is offshore tax haven abuse. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair, has spent years shedding light on how \nthese abuses aid the wealthy and corporations. Based in part on S. \n1346, the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, our bill would, in part: Give \nTreasury the authority to combat tax haven banks and jurisdictions that \nhelp U.S. clients hide assets and dodge U.S. taxes; crack down on \noffshore corporations that are managed from the U.S. from claiming \nforeign status to dodge taxes; eliminate tax incentives for moving U.S. \njobs overseas or for transferring intellectual property offshore; and \nestablish the presumption that, unless a taxpayer proves otherwise, a \ncorporation formed by, receiving assets from, or benefiting a U.S. \ntaxpayer is considered under that taxpayer's control for tax purposes.\n  These provisions and others would reduce the deficit by at least $130 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Our bill's second focus is on a tax loophole that subsidizes \ncorporations giving stock options to corporate executives. Today, \ncorporations can take massive tax deductions for stock options, but \nusually show much lower expense on their books. Our subcommittee found \nthat from 2005-2009, this loophole allowed excess tax deductions \nranging from $12 billion to as high as $61 billion in a single year.\n  The CUT Loopholes Act would prevent corporate income tax deductions \nfor stock options that exceed the expense shown on company books. It \nwould preserve current tax treatment for individuals receiving options \nand\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nfor incentive stock options used by start-up companies.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, these measures would \nreduce the deficit by $25 billion over 10 years.\n  The time for these measures is now.\n  First, the math is inescapable. We can't reduce the deficit and do \nother important things--protect our country, care for our seniors, \neducate our young--if tax revenue remains at its lowest level in \ndecades, and if the effective corporate tax rate is at historic lows, \nthanks in part to these and other tax loopholes.\n  Second, there is a growing recognition among Americans that loopholes \nlike these and many others leave the deck stacked against them and \ntheir families. Overwhelmingly Americans tell us: Close those loopholes \ndown.\n  Third, this is not just a realization by Democrats. Strong majorities \nof Independents and Republicans say that we need balanced deficit \nreduction, and that closing loopholes is one way to do that. Just this \nweek, a national poll showed that 90 percent of small business owners--\na majority of them Republicans--believe big corporations use loopholes \nto avoid taxes that small businesses still have to pay.\n  Reducing the deficit and protecting important programs is hard. We \nface many tough decisions and difficult fights in the months ahead.\n  But this decision should be easy. We should close these loopholes and \nmake a bipartisan statement that we can reduce the deficit, serve \nimportant priorities, and restore fairness to the tax code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Boozman, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2076. A bill to improve security at State and local courthouses; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, Sue Lantto is an advocate of victims of \ndomestic violence. She often visits a local courthouse in suburban \nMinneapolis to help her clients obtain protective orders. Last month, \nshe wrote an editorial in which she acknowledged that ``[m]ost of us \nwho work at the courthouse have had moments when we were frightened'' \nbecause cases sometimes ``become volatile.''\n  Patricia Buss handles family court matters in Dakota County, MN. She \nsays she ``personally think[s] of the risks every time [she] walk[s] \ninto the courthouses.''\n  John Baker is an attorney in Maplewood, MN. He is also a retired \nmarine. He concurs with Sue and Patricia. He says:\n\n       I am not saying that we need to create fortresses in our \n     courthouses, but basic security screening and training can go \n     a long way. That is not being done.\n\n  The local courthouse is a workplace for many people, for secretaries, \ncustodians, and clerks who clock in and clock out every day. It is also \nwhere justice is administered. It is where we report for jury duty and \nfight traffic tickets. It is where adoptions are processed, divorces \nare finalized, and misdemeanors are adjudicated. But as Sue, Patricia \nand John explained, local courthouses can be dangerous places--stakes \nare high, tempers flare, victims confront their assailants, defendants \nconfront their accusers, prosecutors argue with defense lawyers. A rash \nof incidents in late 2011 raised concerns about security at local \ncourthouses, especially in rural and suburban communities.\n  In September, a defendant opened fire in the Crawford County \nCourthouse in Arkansas, shooting a judge's secretary. Authorities \nreported the gunman entered the courthouse unopposed, wearing tactical \ngear, armed with semiautomatic weapons. The local newspaper later noted \nthe shooting ``highlighted the vulnerability of the state's many small, \nrural courthouses where the guards, armed police and metal detectors \ncommon in large cities are often too expensive.''\n  Two days later, there was a shooting in the Adams County Superior \nCourt in Indiana. According to media accounts, that courthouse did not \nhave a metal detector either. A local judge observed that there were \n``a lot of security problems here that need to be corrected'' and that \nthe shooting ``really drove home the point that things need to \nchange.''\n  Then, in December, a defendant retrieved a gun from his car and \nwalked into the Cook County Courthouse in Grand Marais, MN. The \ncourthouse did not have a metal detector and the gunman was not \nscreened. He shot and wounded the prosecuting attorney and a witness. \nThe bailiff also was injured during the encounter. After the shooting, \na Minnesota judge wrote to his colleagues expressing concerns about \ncourthouse security. He put the issue very well. He said: ``I'm no \nlonger willing to risk my life, the life of court staff, the life of \nthe public who have no choice about going to court.'' He said he was \nworried about being ``carried out in a body bag.''\n  These are not isolated incidents. The Center for Judicial and \nExecutive Security in St. Paul tracks court-targeted acts of violence \nacross the Nation and estimates there were 23 such incidents at local \ncourthouses in 2010 and 2011 or about 1 per month. This is not the \nfirst time we have confronted this issue in Minnesota. A few years ago, \na man took hostages at the courthouse in Morrison County. After the \nshooting in Grand Marais, in December, a local sheriff recalled that \n``[t]here were a lot of heroes who really averted something much more \nserious.''\n  I am grateful for those heroes. Minnesota's sheriffs and law \nenforcement personnel across our Nation are among them. These brave men \nand women have many duties, including the daunting task of keeping our \nlocal courthouses safe. In fact, the National Sheriffs Association sent \nme a letter last week. I think it is worth noting, so let me read it.\n\n       Sheriffs are typically responsible for the safety and \n     security of the local courthouses in their counties--along \n     with performing traditional law enforcement duties and \n     operating the local jails. Sadly, in recent years, there has \n     been a spike in violent incidents in courthouses across the \n     country. This violence places law enforcement, judicial \n     personnel, and the general public in harm's way. As such, it \n     is imperative that sheriffs have the resources, particularly \n     in rural areas where resources are extremely limited, to \n     ensure courthouses have the appropriate equipment and tools \n     necessary to improve security, enabling for the protection of \n     courthouses throughout the United States.\n\n  Our sheriffs need support, and we should not wait for the next \ncourthouse shooting before we give it to them. That is why today I am \nintroducing the bipartisan Local Courthouse Safety Act. It does three \nsimple, commonsense things.\n  First, the bill cuts through bureaucratic redtape, giving local \ncourts direct access to security equipment that Federal agencies no \nlonger are using. This provision is modeled after a Defense Department \nprogram that allows the Pentagon to give its excess equipment to local \npolice and firefighters. The Local Courthouse Safety Act would do the \nsame thing for local courts. It would give them direct access to the \nFederal Government's excess metal detectors, wands, and baggage \nscreening machines.\n  Second, the Local Courthouse Safety Act gives States the flexibility \nthey need to make investments in courthouse security. It clarifies that \nStates may use their Byrne Justice Assistance grants, the Byrne JAG \ngrants, and State Homeland Security grants to improve safety at local \ncourthouses. The bill does not require any new spending, and it does \nnot impose any new mandates on anyone. It simply says that States can \nuse existing Federal resources for courthouse security upgrades if they \nso choose.\n  Finally, the Local Courthouse Safety Act provides statutory \nauthorization for the Justice Department's VALOR Initiative, which \nprovides training and technical assistance to local law enforcement \nofficers teaching them how to anticipate and survive violent \nencounters.\n  This is a bipartisan issue, and this should be legislation we can \npass even in this divided Congress. I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation with Senator Boozman, my Republican colleague from \nArkansas, and a champion for law enforcement personnel in his State and \nacross the country. I encourage my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to join Senator Boozman and me in advancing this bill. In doing \nso, they will join a long and growing list of groups who support it, \nincluding the National Sheriffs Association, the Conference of Chief \nJustices, and the Conference of State Court Administrators.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
