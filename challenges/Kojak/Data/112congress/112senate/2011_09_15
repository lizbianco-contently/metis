He is \na person of real significance in the Rhode Island community. He has \nserved as the rabbi of Temple Beth El for 40 years, which means he has \nofficiated at the weddings of the children of people whose bar mitzvahs \nat which he officiated, and he has officiated at the bar mitzvahs of \nthe grandchildren of people whose weddings at which he officiated.

Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will be \nin morning business for 1 hour. The majority will control the first \nhalf and the Republicans will control the final half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nH.J. Res. 66, which is a joint resolution regarding Burma sanctions and \nthe legislative vehicle for additional FEMA funding. The filing \ndeadline for all first-degree amendments to the substitute amendment \nand to H.J. Res. 66 is 1 p.m. today. I filed cloture on the substitute \namendment and on H.J. Res. 66 last night. If no agreement is reached, \nthere will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment on tomorrow \nmorning. We hope to reach an\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nagreement to complete action on the joint resolution as well as FAA and \nhighway extension today. Senators will be notified when votes are \nscheduled.\n\n\n                   Remembering Senator Malcolm Wallop\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming is a man with whom \nI served in the Senate for approximately 10 years. He represented the \nState of Wyoming. During that time, I can remember the work he and Alan \nSimpson did together--Alan Simpson, another retired Senator from \nWyoming. Senator Wallop died yesterday. He was 78 years old.\n  Senator Wallop was a fine man. His roots in Wyoming stem back to \npioneer ancestors in the Big Horn. Although he was born in New York, he \nserved his country admirably in the Army and then worked for many years \nas a cattle rancher and businessman before running for office. He was \nextremely good friends with the great Nevadan Paul Laxalt.\n  There were occasions when Malcolm and I didn't agree on political \nissues, but he was always an agreeable man, a very fine man. I honor \nhis service today, both as a soldier and a Senator, and certainly will \nmiss him, as everyone in Wyoming will and all of his colleagues who \nworked with him here in the Senate.\n\n\n                        Hispanic Heritage Month\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in my office right across the hall, I have a \nwonderful picture painted by a Nevadan. It is a big painting, and it \nshows this handsome young man on this horse with all the trappings of a \nhorse that is really nice, a nice horse and a beautiful saddle, and all \nthe adornments on this man's clothes are good. I am sure the painting \ndidn't take into consideration how he really looked when he arrived in \nthe Las Vegas Valley because this man, Rafael Rivera, was the first \nnon-Indian to see the Las Vegas Valley, and I am sure he was worn out \nand tired because he was basically lost. He was part of a Spanish \nexpedition, and he left them almost 100 miles from where he wound up in \nLas Vegas. But for us, Rafael Rivera is the person who founded Las \nVegas. He was able to see this beautiful place in 1829, and as a result \nof that, we have a number of facilities named after Rafael Rivera, as \nwell they should be, in Las Vegas Valley.\n  The picture is painted perfectly. It shows Las Vegas Valley's Sunrise \nMountain. The difference is, there are no people there. Now there are 3 \nmillion people in Nevada, and we have little Sunrise Mountain there. In \nthe painting, there is no one or anything around it, but of course now \nthere are buildings and hotels and lots of activity there.\n  Today, though, Mr. President, I join more than 50 million Hispanic \nAmericans in the United States in marking the first day of Hispanic \nHeritage Month. This celebration of history and culture lasts through \nOctober 15. So I look forward to the opportunity of bringing Hispanic \nheritage and all it has to Nevada and the rest of the country to honor \nthe contributions of a population that is such an integral part of our \nnational identity. For hundreds of years, Latinos have helped shape the \nface of this Nation.\n  I wrote a history of my birthplace, Searchlight, NV, and one of the \ninteresting things I found in my research is that the railroad was \nbuilt into Searchlight in the early 1900s, it is 26 miles, and it was a \ndifficult railroad to build, but it was basically built by Mexicans who \nhad come to the United States to do the labor that it took to do that. \nSome 7,000 of them built that railroad. It is not very long--26 miles \nlong--but it took a lot of work to get it done.\n  So everyplace you go in America, everyplace especially you go in the \nWest, you find contributions made by Hispanics. They have made \ncontributions in the battlefield, in the workplace, and the classroom. \nThey have spurred progress in the laboratory, playing field in all \nathletics, and, of course, in the halls of justice. They have shaped \nthe way we farm and the way we do business. They have influenced our \nart and our literature. Construction sites of casinos and shopping \ncenters around the State of Nevada--they have contributed mightily to \nthat work that is being done and has been done.\n  The language has even influenced the name of the State of Nevada, \nwhich means ``snow covered.'' Las Vegas means ``the meadows'' in \nSpanish.\n  Hispanic Americans have also played an important role in this \nNation's Armed Forces, as I mentioned just a minute ago. They have \nserved in every conflict since the Revolutionary War. Nearly 30,000 of \nthem have fought for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan and are still \nfighting. I thank them for their brave and dedicated service.\n  Every year, Latinos help propel contributions to our economy. More \nthan 2.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses employ millions of Americans \nand provide crucial goods and services.\n  Mr. President, before leaving the subject of veterans and the good \nthings they do, I want to make sure the Republican leader recognizes \nthat we all celebrate a Kentuckian who today is going to be awarded the \nMedal of Honor, for this 23-year-old boy, in the fields of Afghanistan, \nsaved the lives of about 40 soldiers--1 person. They had a wonderful \npiece on public broadcast today about his courage and what he did--of \ncourse wounded himself, but he carried people to and from battle and \nsaved the lives, as I indicated, of a couple score of people. His name \nis Dakota Meyer. So I congratulate the Republican leader for having \nsuch fine people come from the State of Kentucky.\n  Today, the Senate recognizes the commitment of more than 50 million \nHispanic Americans, family, community, and country. And that is the way \nit should be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5638-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5638-S5639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to spread on the record how much I \nappreciate the support of the Republicans in allowing us to be able to \nget on the FEMA bill. We are on that bill now. We have some amendments \npending. If we are not able to work out an agreement on that today, we \nwill have votes on a number of cloture issues relating to that most \nimportant legislation affecting millions of Americans who have been \ndevastated by Mother Nature.\n  I am disappointed, however, in one of our Republican colleagues who \nat this stage is holding up something that is so vitally necessary.\n  The House sent us two pieces of legislation that passed \noverwhelmingly in the House, one that will keep 1.7 or 1.8 million \npeople working on highway and other construction around the country \ndealing with highways. That is an extension of 6 months. They also sent \nto us a 4-month extension, fully funded, of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, also vitally important.\n  Unless my friend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, agrees to allow \nus to go forward, one Senator will stop 80,000 people from working. I \nhope he will reconsider. The issue he has presented is a little \nunusual. He says he doesn't like bike paths being part of the highway \nbill. Well, for most Americans they are absolutely important. They are \ngood for purposes of allowing people to travel without burning all the \nfossil fuel on the highways.\n  I got up this morning very early, and I went out and did my exercise. \nI am not exaggerating, there were scores, at least 30 or 40 bikes--so \nscores may be a slight exaggeration--of people not just for exercise \nbut traveling to work with backpacks on. That is what bike paths are \nall about.\n  We have told my friend the Senator from Oklahoma: If you don't like \nit, we will have a vote on it.\n  He said: I don't want a vote.\n  He said: Whatever I want, I want stuck in that bill.\n  We can't do that. That isn't what the House sent us, and we can't do \nthat.\n  He said: Well, separate the two bills.\n  We have the bills from the House of Representatives. That is the \narrangement we have made, and it is a good arrangement to get these two \nvitally important pieces of legislation passed so that we can keep \npeople--almost 2 million people--working.\n  I am disappointed in that. I hope we can work something out during \nthe day because it is really unfair for him to hold up this extremely \nimportant legislation.\n  There is not a State in the Union that does not have problems with \n80,000 people laid off. In Nevada we have a new tower being built at \nMcCarran Field. That is important. These people will have to stop \nworking. That is wrong. One Senator? It is not fair to the Senate or to \nthe country.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5639-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the report this week about the rate of \npoverty in America is an eye opener. The numbers that have been \nreported are stunning. The number of Americans living in poverty now \nstands at 46.2 million people. That is an increase of 8.9 million since \n2007, just in 4 years. This has increased significantly since the year \n2000. The poverty threshold for a mother and father with two children \nis an annual income of $22,000 a year. That is less than $2,000 a \nmonth. So for that family of four, what we are seeing is 46 million \nAmericans make less than that. I think all of us understand how \ndifficult it is in this day and age to survive and raise a family, but \nthis national poverty rate should be a wake-up call to us. I hope it \nputs a couple of things in perspective.\n  I spoke on the floor yesterday about visiting a warehouse in \nChampagne, IL, a warehouse for the food depositories in the area. It is \na warehouse where they process and send out food for food pantries that \nare managed by local groups, churches and the like. Almost every State \nhas them--I am sure they do. I was in this warehouse during the August \nrecess to talk about the increased volume of people who are going to \nfood pantries on a regular basis. I visit these food pantries to \nintroduce myself to those who are coming in and to learn as much as \nthey want to tell me about their circumstances.\n  At this warehouse in Champagne, IL, was a woman who was very \nattractive and well-dressed, standing there, and I assumed she worked \nat the warehouse. It turned out I was wrong because she said at one \npoint she was a teacher's aide in the local school district. I thought, \nWhy is she here? I kept thinking to myself, I wonder why she is here. \nMaybe she is on the board of this food depository. It turns out she was \nthere to tell me her story. She is a single mom with two young \nchildren. She has a full-time job as a teacher's aide in the school \ndistrict. Because her income is below the poverty level, she qualifies \nfor not only food stamps but also uses these food pantries. She said to \nme she wanted to express her gratitude that we now have extended the \nSNAP program, the food stamp program, to include fresh produce, fruits, \nand vegetables. She said it means I can take my kids to the local \nfarmers market and they get to meet the farmers and ask questions and \nhear stories about where these thing come from, the fruits and \nvegetables we buy and, she said, I get to buy healthy food to give to \nmy kids.\n  I never would have picked her out of a crowd as a person who needed \nhelp to feed her children--and she did. She told me: Without this, I \nwould be struggling. It is an eye opener for all Americans, when we \nhear 46 million of us are living in poverty. These are our neighbors, \nour friends, the people with whom we go to church. These are folks you \nmay see in the store. They are people who are struggling, many of them \nworking but not making enough money. Some have full-time jobs, many \nhave part-time jobs. It is a reminder, as we get into this deficit \ndebate, never to lose sight of the safety net in America.\n  We are a kind and caring people. We have proven that over many \ngenerations. We do things many other countries do not do. For one \nthing, we have our young men and women volunteer to risk their lives in \nforeign lands to try to bring peace.\n  In addition to that, we have been engaged for over a century in \nhelping other countries that are struggling. I just received a \nhandwritten letter from two grade school children in Illinois about \nthose who are starving in Somalia. It was a heartfelt letter, asking me \nto do something. That is not unusual. It is a sentiment expressed over \nand over again in our country. We need to have the same empathy and the \nsame compassion for our own in America.\n  What that means is not only saying good things and perhaps helping \nthrough our churches and other charities, but also making certain that \nthe safety net programs in our country are there for those who are \nstruggling. We are engaged in a mighty debate now about deficit \nreduction. I have been part of it for a little while in some \ncapacities. I keep reminding those who are in the debate that there are \nsome programs that are absolutely essential. Some of them are obvious: \nthe food stamp program, to make sure the lady I mentioned and others \nlike her have enough food for their children; the Medicaid Program, \nwhich provides health insurance for one-third of America's children. In \nIllinois it pays for over 50 percent of births and it takes care of our \nelderly when they are in a nursing home and run out of their savings.\n  As we talk about deficit reduction, let us focus on making certain at \nthe end of the day the safety net is still in place. Let us make sure \nthe childcare deductions that we have in the Tax Code are there for \nworking families, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program started under \nPresident Reagan which acknowledges that many people who are working \nstill need a helping hand in our Tax Code; Medicaid, that I mentioned \nearlier; the food stamp program; housing programs for those who are \nhomeless and need a helping hand. The safety net has to be honored and \nhas to be preserved in the course of our deficit debate.\n  But I would also say, at this point, the President has challenged us \nto stop giving speeches and to start moving forward on getting America \nback to work. He made a proposal in last Thursday's joint session of \nCongress to give working families across America a payroll tax cut. \nWhat would it mean in Illinois? The average income in Illinois is about \n$53,000 a year. The President's payroll tax cut would be worth $1,400 \nto every family making that amount of money. That is $120 a month. It \nmay not sound like much for people who are wealthy, but for those who \nare struggling paycheck to paycheck, it could make a difference.\n  President Obama wants to give more income security to middle-income \nfamilies. That is what his proposal is about. He has turned around and \nsaid when it comes to small businesses, let us give them incentives to \nhire the unemployed. The only line the President delivered a week ago \nthat I remember got a standing ovation from both sides is when the \nPresident said let's incentivize employers to hire our veterans. \nEverybody stood up. We know that is the right thing. They served our \ncountry, they came home, and we ought to give them a hand to help them. \nThat is part of the President's plan.\n  But he went beyond that and said if people have been unemployed and \nan employer is willing to hire them, let us give them a tax credit to \ndo it. The President is moving tax benefits to small businesses, the \nso-called job creators we hear so much about, and I believe they are, \nas well as to working families. But it is all paid for. This is where \nmany Republicans take exception.\n  How does the President pay for getting America back to work? He asked \nfor sacrifice from the wealthiest people in America. There are some \nmembers of the Republican Party who would not impose 1 penny more in \ntaxes on the wealthiest people in America. They are prepared to see \nevery other family in America sacrifice except for those who can \nsacrifice without feeling any pain in their lives. I don't think that \nis fair and I think the President is right. Those who are making the \nhighest incomes in America should join with\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nevery other family in America and help us get beyond this recession.\n  Also, the President starts eliminating the subsidies, the Federal \nsubsidies for oil companies. I don't have to remind Americans what the \nprice of gasoline is; they know it. In Illinois it is over $4 a gallon \nin many places I traveled to during the recess. These oil companies are \nwitnessing the highest profits in the history of American business. The \nPresident has said, and I agree: It is time to cut the Federal subsidy, \nthe tax subsidy for oil companies, these profitable companies that make \nso much money for their shareholders and give so many bonuses to their \nofficers.\n  Many Republicans object. They do not want to raise taxes on the oil \ncompanies. They do not want to raise taxes on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. I think they ought to put it in perspective. If we can help \nmiddle-income and working families get through the recession, stop \nliving paycheck to paycheck and have a little bit of a cushion in their \nlives, if we can give small businesses incentive to hire Americans and \nturn this economy around, that is what America needs. Let's get beyond \nthe rhetoric that has stalled efforts in Washington. Let's get beyond \nthe obstructionism and the obstacles. Let us finally work together with \nthe President's leadership and come up with a plan to put America back \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In a ceremony at the White House this afternoon, SGT \nDakota Meyer of the U.S. Marine Corps will become the first living \nMarine recipient of the Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest award for \nvalor, the first recipient in 41 years.\n  The Medal of Honor is awarded for conspicuous gallantry and bravery \nat the risk of one's own life, above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Every American can be proud of Sergeant Meyer, age 23, for his \nexceptional valor in combat in Afghanistan. I am particularly proud \nthat Sergeant Meyer is a Kentuckian. I am honored that heroes like him \ncome from the Bluegrass State. Sergeant Meyer hails from Columbia, KY, \nand is a 2006 graduate of Green County High School where he played on \nthe football team. On September 8, 2009, his unit assignment was with \nMarine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, \noperating in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. That day he was sent to aid a \ngroup of marines, soldiers, and Afghans trapped under heavy enemy fire \nfrom three different sides. ``We're surrounded,'' one of them broadcast \nover the radio. ``They're moving in on us.''\n  Air support to assist the Marines was unavailable, as the fighting \nwas too fierce for helicopters to land. Then-Corporal Meyer requested \npermission to enter the zone of fire to come to their aid four times, \nand four times his request was denied. After four denials he decided to \ngo anyway, in an armored vehicle mounted with a .50-caliber machine gun \nwith one other marine as a driver. Twice they attempted to reach their \ncomrades and twice were forced back by bullets, rocket-propelled \ngrenades, and mortars. A bullet hit the vehicle's gun turret, striking \nCorporal Meyer's elbow with shrapnel. Ignoring his injury, he left the \nvehicle and charged ahead alone to rescue his fellow fighters. Under \nintense enemy fire, he reached a trench where helicopter pilots had \nreported their position. There he found his three fellow marines and a \nNavy hospital corpsman all dead from gunshot wounds. Still under fire, \nCorporal Meyer carried their bodies back to a humvee with the help of \nAfghan troops and escorted them to a forward-operating base about 1 \nmile away. He was determined to fulfill the Marines' credo, to never \nleave a marine behind. Corporal Meyer and the three marines whom he \nrefused to abandon all knew each other well and worked together in the \nsame four-man training team. He considered them close friends.\n\n  In addition to the four Americans Corporal Meyer pulled out of the \nfirefight, a U.S. Army soldier and at least eight Afghan troops plus an \nAfghan interpreter were killed in the attack. They had faced more than \n50 enemy insurgents armed with machine guns, assault rifles, and \nrocket-propelled grenades during a 6-hour firefight.\n  Now a sergeant, Meyer combines his great heroism with great humility. \nHe said:\n\n       This isn't about me. If anything comes out of it for me, \n     it's for those guys.\n\n  He left Active-Duty service in June 2010 and currently serves in the \nInactive Ready Reserve of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.\n  I know my colleagues join me in saluting SGT Dakota Meyer for his \nextraordinary display of selfless valor, for which he will be awarded \nthe Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony this afternoon. He may not \nthink of himself as a hero, but his country certainly does. His heroism \nand meritorious service has already been recognized in the many awards, \nmedals, and decorations he has received, including the Purple Heart \nMedal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with ``V'' Device \nfor valor, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Good \nConduct Medal, and the Combat Action Ribbon.\n  His fellow Kentuckians and an entire grateful Nation thank him for \nhis service. Brave men and women like him honor us and our country and \nmake us proud that America boasts the finest Armed Forces in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5640-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5640-S5641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It has been 1 week now since the President unveiled \nhis second stimulus. Today, 1 week later, White House aides are \nexpected to hold a briefing to explain it all to the Democrats who do \nnot understand the details.\n  One would think they would want to be briefed on details before the \nPresident demanded they pass it right away, not after. Then, again, the \nWhite House probably expected stronger support from Democrats than it \nhas gotten so far. After all, this bill's top selling point, according \nto the President, is that both parties should like it. Yet so far the \nonly thing both parties in Congress seem to agree on is there has to be \na better way.\n  Earlier this week, after several of us suggested the President would \nhave a hard time convincing Members of his own party to support this \nplan, a number of them have proved us right. While the President was in \nOhio insisting over and over that Congress pass the bill, it seemed as \nthough the only Democrats who were even willing to talk about it on \nCapitol Hill were tearing it apart. We had the Democratic majority \nleader basically treating it like a legislative afterthought. One \nfreshman Senator called parts of the bill frustrating and unfair. \nAnother Democrat called a central part of the bill terrible. One \nveteran Democrat was tamping down expectations of it passing in one \npiece. Another veteran Democrat suggested a completely different \napproach to jobs. I know the President and his advisers are keen on \nthis idea of making Republicans look bad, but from what I can tell, he \nhas a big problem at the moment lining up supporters in his own party.\n  That brings me to the real issue. The truth is, the President has a \nproblem that no amount of political strategizing can solve: His \neconomic policies simply have not worked. Yet he and his advisers seem \nto be the only folks in Washington who are not ready to admit it. We \nare in the middle of a crisis. The average length of unemployment is at \nan alltime high. Median income is going down instead of up. Poverty \nlevels are higher than they have ever been in two decades. Millions of \nAmericans cannot find work. The numbers just keep getting worse and the \nPresident's solution is to demand another Washington stimulus bill. Is \nthat because the first one worked out so well?\n  The first stimulus is a national punch line: turtle tunnels, \nsidewalks to nowhere, and now we are hearing reports that the White \nHouse fast-tracked a $\\1/2\\ billion loan to a politically connected \nenergy firm that their own analyst said was not ready for prime time. \nThis place, this energy firm, was supposed to be the poster child of \nhow the original stimulus would create jobs. Now it is bankrupt and \nmost of its 1,100 employees are out of work. And they want another \nstimulus?\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\n  Even if we do not know about any of the waste or the alleged \ncronyism, here is the bottom line: 2\\1/2\\ years after the President \nsigned the first stimulus, there are 1.7 million fewer jobs in this \ncountry. That is 1.7 million fewer jobs after borrowing and spending \n$825 billion to create them. What more do we need to know than that? We \nhave done that. We have gone down that road before. Shouldn't we try \nsomething different? How about we do what just about every job creator \nin America is telling us they need in order to create jobs? Tax reform. \nLoosening the grip of government regulations and free-trade agreements. \nThat is how we will create a better environment for jobs in our \ncountry. It might mean the President doesn't get his tax hikes, but it \nwould mean more jobs.\n  I know some people sometimes get attached to a single idea, and this \nPresident seems to have come into office with one big idea; that there \nis not a problem we have in this country that bigger government cannot \nsolve. At a certain point, we have to take stock. We have to check the \nresults and see how we are doing. I think it is pretty clear to most \npeople what the results suggest. It is time to change course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the world in which we live, every \nAmerican's job is on the line. As every American knows, better schools \nmean better jobs. Schools and jobs are alike in this sense: Washington \ncannot create good jobs and Washington cannot create better schools, \nbut Washington can create an environment in which others can create \ngood jobs and environments in which teachers and principals and \nstudents and communities can create better schools, along with their \nparents.\n  A good place for Washington to start is with the five pieces of \nlegislation we introduced today to fix the law known as No Child Left \nBehind. No Child Left Behind was a bipartisan effort in 2001 and 2002. \nPresident Bush and Democratic Members of the Senate and the House and \nRepublicans as well agreed on it. By the 2013-14 school year, the law \nsaid that all 50 million students in nearly 100,000 public schools \nwould be proficient in reading and math. There would be State \nstandards, tests to measure performance against those standards, and \nrequirements that the more than 3,000 teachers in America be highly \nqualified. There would be school report cards, disaggregated by \nsubgroups of students, and schools that failed to make what was called \nadequate yearly progress would receive Federal sanctions. There would \nalso be more choices of schools and charter schools for parents.\n  During the last 9 years, Federal funding for elementary and secondary \neducation programs has increased by 73 percent, while student \nachievement has stayed relatively flat. Our legislative proposals would \nset a new, realistic, but challenging goal to help all students succeed \nand to end the Federal mandates which have Washington, DC deciding \nwhich students and teachers are succeeding and failing.\n  Our legislation would require States to have high standards that \npromote college and career readiness for all students and would \ncontinue the reporting of student progress so parents, teachers, and \ncommunities can know whether students are succeeding. It would \nencourage teacher and principal evaluation systems, relating especially \nto student achievement, and would replace the Federal definition of a \nhighly qualified teacher. It would consolidate Federal programs and \nmake it easier to transfer funds within local school districts. It \nwould expand charter schools and give parents more choices. For the \nbottom 5 percent of schools, the Federal Government would help States \nturn them around. Much has happened during the last 10 years, and it is \ntime to transfer back to States and to local governments the \nresponsibility for deciding whether schools and teachers are succeeding \nor failing.\n  Since 2002, 44 States have adopted common core academic standards. \nTwo groups of States are developing common tests to see whether the \nstudents are meeting those standards, and more than 30 States are \nworking together to develop common principles for holding schools and \ndistricts accountable for student achievement. Thanks to No Child Left \nBehind, we now have several years of school-by-school information about \nstudent progress that puts the spotlight on success and puts the \nspotlight on where work needs to be done.\n  In addition, many States and school districts are finding ways to \nreward outstanding teaching and school leadership and to include \nstudent performance as a part of that evaluation. As common sense as \nthat idea may seem, it was not until Tennessee created the Master \nTeacher Program in 1984 that one State paid one teacher one penny more \nfor teaching well. All the sponsors of the five pieces of legislation \nwe introduced today are Republicans. Many of the ideas were either \nfirst advanced or have been worked out in concert with President Obama \nand with his excellent Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, as well as \nwith Democratic Senators here and with Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues in the House. In other words, we have made a lot of \nprogress.\n  In the Senate, my judgment is that we are not far from agreement on a \nbipartisan bill, with most of the differences of opinion centering \naround what I would characterize as provisions that would create a \nnational school board. We on the Republican side want to continue to \nwork with our colleagues across the aisle and in the House. Our purpose \nin offering our ideas is to spur progress so we can enact a bill before \nthe end of the year. The House of Representatives has passed its first \nbill to fix No Child Left Behind with bipartisan support. It would \nexpand charter schools and is similar to the charter school bill \nSenator Kirk will introduce today. The President has met with us and \ngiven us his blueprint. The Secretary has warned us that, under \nexisting law, most schools will be labeled as failing within a few \nyears, and he is proposing to use his waiver authority to avoid that. \nThe Secretary clearly has that waiver authority under the law, and I \nsupport his use of it in appropriate ways.\n  I am introducing legislation today to make it clear that the \nappropriate use means using the waiver to accept or reject State \nproposals based upon whether those proposals enhance student \nachievement and not to impose a new set of Washington mandates. But the \nbest way for us to relieve the Secretary of the need to consider \nwaivers and to help American children learn what they need to know is \nfor us to work together in the Senate and in the House to fix No Child \nLeft Behind.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks, and following the remarks of all the Senators, \nthe following documents: Why we need to fix No Child Left Behind; how \nthe environment has changed in the past 10 years; a summary of the nine \nproposals Secretary Duncan, Senator Harkin, Senator Enzi, and others of \nus have worked on; a summary of the legislation introduced by Senator \nIsakson to fix title I; a summary of the legislation that I am\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\na principal sponsor of to fix title II; a summary of Senator Burr's \nproposal on titles II and IV; a summary of Senator Kirk's legislation \non charter schools; and a summary of the legislation that I am also \nintroducing on waivers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Isakson of Georgia has a \ndistinguished career in education, not just as a leader in the Senate \nof Georgia, but as chairman of the Georgia School Board, appointed by \nGov. Zell Miller, and as a former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who was a key author of No Child Left Behind when it \nwas enacted in 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the great Senator from the State \nof Tennessee for his recognition and whose own record in education is \nquite distinguished, including his tenure as a university president at \nthe University of Tennessee, to his leadership on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and, obviously, his service \nas Secretary of Education for the United States of America.\n  I appreciate the reference to 10 years ago when we wrote No Child \nLeft Behind. There were nine of us, five Republicans and four \nDemocrats, who locked ourselves up in the House Education Committee \noffices for about 6 weeks writing the document that became the law of \nthe land, and it has served the country well for 20 years.\n  A title I provision of that is the free and reduced lunch provision, \nwhich is the main title of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nand it is the main title that delivers educational entitlements, \nrequirements, and regulations under No Child Left Behind.\n  The reason I am the principal sponsor of the removal--not the removal \nbut the reform--of title I is because No Child Left Behind requirements \nunder title 1 have worked and it is time to go to the next step. I wish \nto be very specific about saying it has worked.\n  As everyone knows, adequate yearly progress, or AYP, is the goal of \ntitle I, to see to it that every child every year is making adequate \nyearly progress toward improvements in reading comprehension and \nmathematics. When we started AYP, we knew when we wrote it that if the \nbill worked, it would become harder and harder and harder to reach AYP \nbecause the baseline was being built every single year.\n  The reason Senator Alexander talked about so many schools falling \ninto ``needs improvement'' is because we pushed the achievement level \nso high that meeting AYP on a continuing and improving basis is \ndifficult. So it is time to terminate AYP as a requirement of the bill, \nbut it is not time to throw out the system that made it work.\n  Disaggregation of students, first of all, was critically important. \nPublic education in the United States prior to the No Child Left Behind \nlaw exhibited school systems and schools that basically hid behind mean \naverage scores or an ITBS mean average score. This comparison of ITBS \ntest scores to other States in the Nation is an aggregation of all \nstudents' performance and an averaging of that performance. It took the \neye off the ball and the individual student.\n  So what No Child Left Behind says is, test every student and \ndisaggregate them by sex, race, disability, by non-English-speaking, \nand rate each disaggregated group by AYP. If only one school fails to \nmake adequate progress, then the whole school goes to ``needs \nimprovement.'' So we have a lot of schools labeled ``needs \nimprovement'' while making the best improvement they have ever made. So \nit is time to end AYP, but it is not time to end disaggregation or the \ntest scores.\n  The greatest accountability measure--and all of us as politicians \nknow it--is transparency. This bill will require the transparency of \nall the test scores of each individual child and the transparency of \neach individual in each individual disaggregated group to ensure we \ncontinue to know how our kids are doing and compare them on a year-to-\nyear basis. But we do away with ``needs improvement'' because it has \nserved its purpose.\n  Now, on disaggregated groups there is one other thing the title I \nchange does that I want to particularly emphasize on the Senate floor \ntoday. The biggest disaggregated group in terms of causing schools or \nsystems to fall under ``needs improvement'' is those special needs \nchildren considered under IDEA or the Individuals With Disabilities \nAct. They are all individuals who have an individual disability that \naffects their academic achievement or their ability to learn.\n  When we passed IDEA in 1978, if I remember correctly, through Public \nLaw 94-192, we dictated that we would give special emphasis and \ntraining to those special needs kids and try and identify their special \nneeds and meet them within the public education system. When No Child \nLeft Behind disaggregated them into a single group and tested them, we \ntested 98 percent of them with the same paper and pencil test. These \nare kids with a plethora of disabilities that one single test could not \npossibly meet. We gave a 2 percent cognitive waiver, disability waiver, \nso they could have an alternative assessment for up to 2 percent of the \nstudents, but 98 percent had to take the same test.\n  This reform of the IDEA portion of title I of No Child Left Behind \nsimply says this: Every year, at the beginning of the school year, when \nthe parent and the teacher and the school meet to put out the \nindividual education plan, the IAP for that student, the parent, the \nteacher, and the school will determine what the assessment vehicle is \nthat best measures the assessment of that child--not a single, one-\nsize-fits-all, paper-and-pencil test. That is going to ensure that IDEA \nstudents get the individual attention they deserve and the measurement \nagainst the individual disabilities they have that is appropriate as \napproved by their parents, their teacher, and their school, and it will \nmake a remarkable difference for IDEA kids.\n  I am very proud of that provision and the flexibility it gives to the \nsystem to assess appropriately rather than force a one-size-fits-all \ntest against 98 percent of our children with disabilities.\n  So to repeat what I said at the beginning----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is a good time for me to repeat what I said at the \nbeginning. I am proud to be building on the success of No Child Left \nBehind, and I am proud that Senator Alexander has taken leadership on \nthis committee to move forward on this reauthorization of IDEA and No \nChild Left Behind.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Isakson for his \nleadership in education in the State of Georgia and on this bill.\n  Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina has focused on elementary and \nsecondary education for many years, especially on making it easier for \nlocal school districts to use the Federal dollars that are made \navailable and on finding ways to encourage student and teacher \nevaluation. He is introducing a bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, \namending titles II and IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from a State once owned \nby North Carolina, and a distinguished Member of this August body.\n  What are we doing here today? We are responding to what every CEO has \nsaid and every local leader has said and every parent has said: If you \nwant a future in this country, you have to fix K-12 education. We have \nto make sure every child in this country has the foundational knowledge \nto meet whatever challenge they are faced with in a lifetime.\n  Washington is good at coming up with new programs and, to be honest, \nwhen we look back over the history of the last couple decades, every \nyear we come up with a new program to fix K-12. What is obvious? We \nnever fix it. But what we hear loudly and clearly from people who are \non the front lines--those elected and those nonelected and those who \nare charged with educating our children--is give them flexibility. We \ncan't design one program in Washington that works in Raleigh, NC, and \nworks in Knoxville, TN, much less in rural North Carolina or rural \nTennessee.\n  What I propose is very simple: that 59 pots of money, 59 different \nprograms, be merged into two pots, and that\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nthose local school systems have the flexibility and the capability to \nchoose what they are going to use that money for to educate our kids. \nWhat a novel thought, that we would take the people on the front line--\nfor the first time, I am suggesting that Washington give up the power \nwe have to say: You do it our way or you will not get the money.\n  We are faced in the future with some degree of austerity. We are not \ngoing to have the money to throw it out and see what works. But that is \nWashington's typical response. Now it is time to begin to focus not on \nthat we think works but what the teachers and the principals and the \nelected officials locally, but more importantly, the community decides \nworks.\n  Senator Isakson alluded to a number of factors we use as to how we \ngauge success or failure. I will tell my colleagues the gauge we ought \nto have: What does a parent think? The likelihood is that by the time \nwe get those standard tests, it is probably too late to fix it for \ntheir kids, but it may fix it for somebody else's.\n  What we are attempting to do today as we reform K-12 education \nthrough these bills is to lay the gauntlet down and say that no child \nwill be exposed to an inferior education in the future because we are \ngoing to empower--not Washington--we are going to empower the \nlocal community.\n\n  Again, what I am simply doing in the Empowering Local Education \nDecision Making Act of 2011 is to take 59 programs under elementary and \nsecondary education and put them into flexible foundational block \ngrants. Some might say the State is going to steal money off it. No. We \nlimit it to 1.5 percent to administer the program. It has a formula \nthat satisfies exactly how this money is going to be distributed so it \nis done fairly.\n  Where we don't exercise Washington authority is we don't tell the \nlocal school system: Here is the only way you can use it. We say to the \nlocal school system: Here are 59 programs. You pick the ones that best \nfit what your needs are in your community. In addition to that, those \ntwo pots of money we have created are 100 percent transferable. If you \nfeel that one pot doesn't meet the need which might be in your area, \nthen you can shift all of that money over to the other pot. So if you \nbelieve that focusing on teacher quality is better versus students, you \nhave the flexibility to do it without asking us for a waiver. In \naddition to that, if title I is where you need additional funds, both \npots of money are transitional to title I for additional support for \nat-risk kids.\n  That is something we have never done. Just this week I received a \nletter from the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition, by the way, \nof our Nation's largest central school districts. In their letter they \nwrote this:\n\n       Both Title II and Title IV of the Elementary Secondary \n     Education Act have become unwieldy and unfocused over the \n     past authorizations, and are in substantial need of \n     rewriting. Your effort to simplify and clarify the purposes \n     and flexibilities within these key programs is noteworthy.\n       With budgetary constraints faced at all levels of \n     government, streamlining federal requirements, providing \n     predictable and consolidated formula-based funding streams to \n     local school districts, and ensuring local district decision \n     making in the use of funds under your bill is particularly \n     welcome.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURR. I urge my colleagues to read these bills. Look at your \nschool systems. Make a decision that is right for the future of every \nchild in this country and support our reauthorization efforts.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr, for his insight and leadership on how we help \ncreate an environment in which teachers, parents, principals, and \ncommunity leaders can make schools better, rather than through orders \nsent from Washington telling them how to do that.\n  Senator Kirk from Illinois will be here in a few minutes to introduce \nthe charter school bill, which is the same bill that passed the House \nof Representatives yesterday with 365 votes in a bipartisan way.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, our purpose is to get things moving. We \nthink there ought to be a law before the end of the year that fixes No \nChild Left Behind. Toward that end, the senior member of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Enzi of \nWyoming, began to meet quietly more than a year ago with the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Harkin, and with Secretary Duncan and, on \nsome occasions, with the President. They were able to come to a good \ndeal of agreement about fixing No Child Left Behind, and then, on the \nnine areas we would focus on, which I put into the Record a few minutes \nago.\n  Senator Enzi is here now, and I thought he might want to speak about \nthat effort. While all of us who are introducing these bills today are \nRepublicans, we are only doing this as a way of moving the process \nforward and are hoping to attract Democratic support so we can end up \nwith a bipartisan result. I believe, at the same time, that Senator \nEnzi is continuing to meet with Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \ncommittee, with the hope that we will achieve that bipartisan result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senators who have spoken \nfor all of their efforts and thought. A lot of times people think that \nwhat is being discussed on the floor is the only thing that is \nhappening in the Congress. There are things happening in the background \nthat are probably achieving more than the debates that happen here. A \nlot of times what people get to see here is the blood on the floor that \nresults in nothing. But everyone recognizes the importance of education \nand recognizes that there has been a significant effort made since 1965 \nwith K-12 education. It has been renewed several times. In every single \ninstance, it has been renewed in a very bipartisan way. We want that to \ncontinue to happen. The value of the Senate and the House is to have a \nlot of different opinions on how something can be done and then to \nbring those together to form something usable in whatever area we are \nworking on.\n\n  I cannot thank Senators Alexander, Isakson, Burr, and Kirk enough for \nthe work they have done in this area. It does help us to focus, and I \nam working with Senator Harkin to try to come up with a bipartisan \nbill. I think we have been making good progress. I have used the nine \ncore components of these bills that Senator Alexander mentioned as \nreasons for stepping back and taking a look at what we are doing to \nmake sure the States can have as much of a role as possible, but the \nlocal people have an even greater role in what is happening in \neducation. That is where we are trying to keep the focus, and this has \nbeen very helpful in my discussions with Senator Harkin, to make sure \nwe stay on track with those things.\n  Senator Alexander mentioned the nine things. Secretary Duncan \ntraveled through most of the United States holding listening sessions \nto find out what kind of problems people had. He agreed that the nine \nthings we had on this list were the problems with No Child Left Behind \nthat needed to be fixed. Senator Harkin looked at that list and agreed \nin the same way.\n  We have come up with some solutions, and those need to be put in a \nbill, and that bill needs to be passed this year. Next year we get into \nPresidential elections. I cannot see where that is going to make things \nmore bipartisan or help education. There are a number of things that No \nChild Left Behind did. One is the disaggregation, which did show some \nproblems across the country, where kids were being left behind. A lot \nof times when we focus on education, we focus on the State and on the \nschool district. Once in a while we focus on the school. But what we \nhave been trying to do is get the focus on the kid to make sure our \nchildren are learning what they need to know to be able to survive. \nThat is one of the places we will be able to greatly improve as we move \non in this effort.\n  One of the surprises to everybody will probably be to find out that \nthe Federal Government only requires one Federal test. You always hear \nabout all the testing the kids have to take across the Nation. A lot of \nthat is locally imposed, but they are tests they think are necessary. \nBut the Federal Government says you need to have one at the end of the \nyear, and that is what we have concentrated on with the disaggregation.\n  There have been a lot of surprises for people as they actually take a \nlook at\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\nwhat that rather voluminous bill has in it. I think we are moving to a \npoint where we should be able to get something done and get something \ndone relatively quickly. Again, it will be because of the work of these \npeople who have put together some bills to bring attention to some very \nspecific parts that need improvement. I thank them for doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi and I thank him \nfor his leadership and the constructive way he and Senator Harkin are \nworking together.\n  I should emphasize, as I said in my remarks, the respect all of us \nhave for Secretary Duncan. He has done a terrific job staying in touch \nwith us without regard to political party, and the President and he \nhave stuck their necks out on some issues that are not entirely popular \nwith their Democratic constituency. We respect that as well.\n  As I said, our effort is to take these ideas and recognize we are in \nthe ninth year of a bill that was supposed to be fixed after 5 years, \nand to get it done before the end of the year.\n  One example of what we could do the Senator from Illinois will talk \nabout. He has been the leader on expanding opportunities for parents \nand communities to use charter schools. The House of Representatives \nacted on that bill yesterday.\n  Senator Kirk.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, joining as part of this effort, I think we \nneed to reform No Child Left Behind and that we should focus on making \nsure we preserve disclosure and the right of parents to know how their \nschools are doing, without destroying the school, without having an AYP \nmeasurement that somehow says most, if not all, schools are failing.\n  As part of this effort, I am introducing the Empowering Parents \nThrough Quality Charter Schools Act to emphasize charter schools and to \nmake sure their opportunities are more widely available to parents and \nchildren, especially in inner cities.\n  This is a chart I have in the Chamber that shows the top 10 \nnonselective--meaning they take everyone--public high schools in \nChicago. They are ranked in order of ACT scores. You can see from the \nchart, Lincoln Park High School is No. 1, not a charter school. But in \nthe top 10, 8 of them are charter schools, and these are in some of the \ntoughest neighborhoods in Chicago. That is why this is one of the No. 1 \nissues being discussed right now in Chicago. Mayor Emanuel is doing an \noutstanding job of leading a reform effort to make charter schools more \navailable, to expand the day of instruction, and to expand the number \nof days in the school year because right now Chicagoland suffers from \nsome of the lowest numbers of days of instruction in the country. Right \nnow, for example, in Chicagoland, only about 10 percent of kids have \nthe opportunity to go to a charter school. I think we should set a goal \nof at least 50 percent having that opportunity.\n  Recently, I was able to visit the Noble Street School, also another \nschool which was represented about 99 percent African American, with \noverwhelmingly free and reduced-lunch kids. This school is \noutperforming all of its peers, despite not having any selection \ncriteria, and being able to take kids from all walks of life, including \nspecial-needs kids.\n  We are seeing something working here. Mayor Emanuel sees it. I see \nit. That is why in the House of Representatives, when the companion \nlegislation was considered, 365 Representatives, including well over \n100 Democratic representatives, supported our charter school bill. We \nare introducing the companion bill over here. I am hoping for equal \namounts of bipartisan support because what we see is working in Chicago \ncan work elsewhere.\n  The charter school movement has generally focused on inner cities. \nBut I want to make sure charter schools are offered to kids in Peoria, \nin Springfield, in Rockford, and in Metro East. So the kind of success \nwe are seeing here--8 out of 10 top performers being charter schools \nfor nonselective public high schools--is something I think we should \nhave offered here. That is why I applaud our ranking member and \nespecially Senator Alexander for putting together this group of bills \nto offer higher education performance for America's kids, especially in \nthe tough global political environment they will be in.\n  With that, I yield back to our leader on this joint effort and the \nranking minority member and thank them for the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. Every American knows that \nevery American's job is on the line. Every American knows that better \nschools mean better jobs. We are ready to work with the President and \nwith our Democratic colleagues to create an environment for better \nschools in this country by fixing No Child Left Behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Elementary and Secondary Education: How Has the Environment Changed \n                        Over the Past 10 Years?\n\n       1. Standards: All states have content standards in place \n     for reading/language arts and mathematics. 44 States are \n     working together in a Common Core state-led effort to improve \n     their standards.\n       2. Assessments: All states are conducting annual \n     assessments in reading/language arts and mathematics that are \n     aligned to state standards and are publicly reporting their \n     results. Two groups of states are working together to develop \n     common assessments aligned to the Common Core standards.\n       3. Data: Disaggregation of data by states and districts \n     provides greater information on how schools and students are \n     performing by race, income, English proficiency and \n     disability. This makes it easier to identify the achievement \n     gaps and target efforts to address problems.\n       4. Auditing: All states are participating in the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP/Nation's Report \n     Card, which serves as an audit of the quality of state \n     standards and assessments.\n       5. Robust Awareness: Because of data, parents, teachers, \n     principals, legislators, and Governors are paying more \n     attention to education issues, and thus holding their \n     districts, schools, and teachers accountable.\n       6. Charter School Growth: The number of students enrolled \n     in public charter schools has more than tripled to 1.4 \n     million and the percentage of all public schools that were \n     charter schools has increased from 2% to 5%, comprising 4,700 \n     schools nationwide.\n       7. School Choice: Not much, but some growth in school \n     choice (i.e. Milwaukee, Florida).\n\nWhat the Nation Has Learned From No Child Left Behind: The Good and the \n                                  Bad\n\n\n                                The Good\n\n       Disaggregated Reporting: The disaggregation of data by \n     subgroups has allowed us to see how all students are \n     performing.\n       Annual Assessments: Provides basic information on the \n     performance of students in mathematics, English/Language \n     Arts, and Science.\n       Public Reporting: Increased public reporting of state, \n     district, and school performance has provided the public with \n     better information on the quality of local schools.\n       Parental Involvement: Provides greater information to \n     improve parental involvement in school-level decisions.\n\n\n                                The Bad\n\n       Goal of 100% Proficiency by 2014: Sets unrealistic and \n     unproductive mandate that all students are proficient by \n     2014.\n       Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP): Rigid federal mandates of \n     how to achieve proficiency and tells states from Washington \n     which schools are succeeding and which are failing.\n       Highly-Qualified Teachers (HQT): Onerous federal definition \n     of what constitutes a qualified teacher.\n       Unfunded Mandates: Federal mandates far exceed the 9-10% \n     federal investment in education.\n       Ineffective spending: Dedicates billions in limited federal \n     dollars to small and ineffective programs that don't have a \n     record of success.\n\n                Why We Need To Fix No Child Left Behind\n\n       100% proficiency by 2014 will not happen.\n       Adequate Yearly Progress with its prescriptive 64-part \n     formula will result in every school getting a failing grade.\n       Teachers focus too much on testing and no one understands \n     what the results mean.\n       Sanctions impact rural schools more.\n       Highly Qualified Teacher requirements create unusual \n     restrictions particularly with respect to rural, special \n     education, and English as a second language teachers.\n       State and local flexibility is limited and there are \n     duplicative and overlapping programs.\n       Allowable uses of federal funds are too limited and \n     restrictive.\n       One size fits all mentality of Washington's ``good'' ideas. \n     We need local solutions.\n       Parents are too often left out of the equation.\n\n                  How To Fix ``No Child Left Behind''\n\n       1. Set a new, realistic but challenging goal to help all \n     students succeed.\n       2. Free 95% of schools (91,000 schools) from the federal \n     requirement of conforming to a\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\n     federally-defined adequate yearly progress mandate.\n       3. The federal government will help states fix the bottom \n     5% of their schools (4,500 schools).\n       4. Require states to have high standards that promote \n     college and career readiness for all students.\n       5. Encourage the creation of state and school district \n     teacher and principal evaluation systems to replace federal \n     highly qualified teacher requirements.\n       6. Continue necessary reporting so that parents, teachers, \n     schools, legislators, and communities receive good \n     information on schools.\n       7. Provide school districts with the ability to transfer \n     funds more efficiently among the five largest federal \n     education programs.\n       8. Consolidate and streamline more than 80 programs within \n     NCLB and eliminate those that are duplicative and \n     unnecessary.\n       9. Empower parents.\n\n                  How To Fix ``No Child Left Behind''\n\n       1. Set a new, realistic but challenging goal to help all \n     students succeed. Establish a national goal that all students \n     will be `college and career ready' by high school graduation. \n     States will use annual reading and mathematics assessments, \n     including student growth, to measure progress toward the \n     goal.\n       2. Free 95% of schools (91,000 schools) from the federal \n     requirement of conforming to a federally-defined adequate \n     yearly progress mandate. 95% of schools will no longer face \n     federal sanctions. These schools will continue annual reading \n     and mathematics assessments and public reporting \n     requirements. The emphasis will be on helping states to catch \n     these successful schools and struggling schools doing things \n     right, instead of announcing their failure.\n       3. The federal government will help states fix the bottom \n     5% of their schools (4,500 schools). States will identify, \n     for federal accountability purposes, the bottom 5% of schools \n     that receive Title I funding. These schools will be required \n     to choose an intervention model from a defined list of \n     options. The models will be broad and include options for \n     rural schools and provide flexibility for state innovation.\n       4. Require states to have high standards that promote \n     college and career readiness for all students. Require states \n     to adopt `college and career ready' standards that are \n     aligned with higher education, career and technical education \n     standards, and workforce skills within the state. There will \n     be no preference or prohibition for states to adopt a \n     specific set of standards, including the Common Core \n     standards.\n       5. Encourage the creation of state and school district \n     teacher and principal evaluation systems to replace federal \n     highly qualified teacher requirements. Encourage states and \n     school districts to develop teacher and principal evaluation \n     systems to identify high performing teachers and principals \n     and eliminate the federal ``highly qualified teacher'' \n     definition. Innovative teacher and principal pay programs \n     will continue to be supported through the Teacher Incentive \n     Fund program.\n       6. Continue necessary reporting so that parents, teachers, \n     schools, legislators, and communities receive good \n     information on schools. States, school districts and schools \n     will continue to report information regarding student \n     achievement on annual reading, mathematics and science \n     assessments. Other reported information will include high \n     school graduation rates and teacher certification. All of \n     this information will continue to be disaggregated by race \n     and ethnicity, socio-economic status, disability status, \n     English proficiency, gender, and migrant status to maintain \n     public accountability for all student subgroups. Unnecessary \n     and irrelevant federal reporting requirements will be \n     eliminated.\n       7. Provide school districts with the ability to transfer \n     funds more efficiently among the five largest federal \n     education programs. School districts will have more \n     flexibility to meet their local needs by transferring funds \n     among the 5 major federal education programs. This will allow \n     school districts to better target federal resources to \n     improve student academic achievement.\n       8. Consolidate and streamline almost 60 programs within \n     NCLB to allow State and local leaders to meet student needs \n     in their states and districts. Consolidate the programs \n     authorized in NCLB into flexible funding streams that allow \n     States and local school districts to fund locally-determined \n     programs that meet the unique and specific needs of the \n     students in their States and districts.\n       9. Empower parents. Parents will receive meaningful \n     information on the performance of their children's schools so \n     they can be more effectively involved in their children's \n     education. The law will continue to support the expansion of \n     high-quality charter schools. For those parents whose \n     children attend the state-identified bottom 5% of schools, \n     they will have the option of public school choice to transfer \n     to another public school.\n\n     The Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments Act of 2011\n\n\n Empowering State and local education leaders to improve public schools\n\n       Establishes College & Career Readiness Goal: States are \n     asked to develop and maintain academic content standards and \n     assessments that will prepare students for college- and \n     career-readiness without interference by the Federal \n     government about whether to work alone or in partnership with \n     other states.\n       Empowers State and local leaders to develop their own \n     accountability systems: Instead of a ``One Size Fits All'' \n     Washington-approach, states will develop their own systems \n     designed to ensure that all students graduate from high \n     school college- and career-ready, without Federal \n     interference or regulations on state standards, assessments, \n     growth models for accountability, or how to develop teacher \n     and principal evaluation systems that are based on improving \n     student achievement.\n       Eliminates Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP): The Federal \n     government is taken out of the business of determining if \n     local schools and districts are succeeding or failing in \n     educating their students by ending the Washington-based AYP \n     system of how to identify schools.\n       Asks States to Identify the Bottom 5% of Lowest Performing \n     Schools: States will be required to identify the bottom 5% of \n     Title I receiving elementary and secondary schools, using \n     their state-developed accountability system, and local school \n     districts will be required to implement a school improvement \n     strategy for their lowest performing schools. School \n     districts will continue to be required to provide public \n     school choice to students in these lowest performing schools.\n       Eliminates ``Highly Qualified Teacher'' Requirement: States \n     will be freed from the onerous ``Highly Qualified Teacher'' \n     requirements and empowered to maintain and improve their own \n     teacher and principal licensure and certification \n     requirements.\n       Maintains Public Reporting Requirements: States and local \n     school districts will continue to report disaggregated data \n     on student achievement, while requiring annual report cards \n     at the school, school district and State level.\n       Reduces Paperwork & Federal Intrusion: The bill \n     dramatically simplifies the Title I State plans that are \n     submitted to the Secretary to reduce unnecessary paperwork \n     and frees states from Washington interference.\n\n           The Teacher and Principal Improvement Act of 2011\n\n\n Preparing, training, and recruiting effective teachers and principals \n                     to improve student achievement\n\n       Addressing State and local needs for teacher and principal \n     training: States and local school districts will conduct a \n     needs assessment to determine what professional development \n     teachers and principals need to improve student achievement \n     and then target resources to meet those needs.\n       Supports the State-led Development of Teacher/Principal \n     Evaluation Systems: States and local school districts are \n     empowered to develop their own teacher and principal \n     evaluation systems that are based significantly on student \n     academic achievement. The Federal Government would be \n     prohibited from regulating or controlling those state and \n     local evaluation systems, allowing local innovation and \n     leadership to flourish.\n       Maintains Strong Reporting Requirements: States and local \n     school districts will provide important data on the quality \n     and effectiveness of teachers and principals, as well as the \n     results of teacher and principal evaluation systems if \n     developed, to inform parents and the community about who is \n     teaching in the classroom and leading our schools.\n       Teacher Incentive Fund: Authorizes the Teacher Incentive \n     Fund to provide competitive grants for states, districts, and \n     partnerships with private-sector organizations to implement, \n     improve, or expand comprehensive performance-based \n     compensation systems for teachers and principals, while \n     leaving broad latitude in how states develop such systems, as \n     well as prioritizing high-need schools.\n       Encourages Innovative Private-Sector Involvement: \n     Authorizes competitive grants for national non-profit \n     organizations, such as Teach for America and New Leaders for \n     New Schools, to help states and local school districts that \n     have a demonstrated record with teacher or principal \n     preparation, professional development activities, and \n     programs.\n       Reduces Paperwork and Federal Intrusion: The bill \n     dramatically simplifies the Title II State plans that are \n     submitted to the Secretary to reduce unnecessary paperwork \n     and frees states from Washington interference.\n\n\n        Empowering Local Educational Decision Making Act of 2011\n\n       State and local school districts, not Washington, D.C., are \n     the best makers of educational decisions. Unfortunately, in \n     the last few decades, the federal government, believing it \n     knew best, has exploded the number of small, categorical \n     education programs in K-12. Almost every year, yet another \n     new program has been created in pursuit of the newest \n     educational rave. And with each of these new programs, States \n     and local school districts have lost flexible federal funding \n     sources that allow them and not the latest fad to determine \n     how best to allocate federal resources to meet the unique and \n     specific needs of the individual students in their States and \n     districts.\n       The Empowering Local Educational Decision Making Act of \n     2011 streamlines 59 programs into 2 flexible foundational \n     block grants. Rather than Washington and the federal \n     government determining funding priorities for States and \n     local school districts, the Empowering Local Educational \n     Decision Making Act puts locals in charge by allowing them \n     the flexibility to fund locally-determined programs and \n     initiatives that meet\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n     the varied and unique needs of individual States and \n     localities.\n\n\n           Fund for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning\n\n       Consolidates 34 programs into ONE flexible, formula-driven \n     Fund for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning to fund \n     locally-determined needs and initiatives related to--\n       Increasing the capacity of local school districts, schools, \n     teachers, and principals to provide a well-rounded and \n     complete education for all students.\n       Increasing the number of teachers and principals who are \n     effective in increasing student academic achievement.\n       Ensuring that low-income students are served by effective \n     teachers and principals and have access to a high-quality \n     instructional program in the core academic subjects.\n\n\n                 Safe and Healthy Students Block Grant\n\n       Consolidates 25 programs into ONE flexible, formula-driven \n     Safe and Healthy Students Block Grant to fund locally-\n     determined needs and initiatives for improving students' \n     safety, health, and well-being during and after the school \n     day by--\n       Increasing the capacity of local school districts, schools, \n     and local communities to create safe, healthy, supportive, \n     and drug-free environments.\n       Carrying out programs designed to improve school safety and \n     promote students' physical and mental health well-being, \n     healthy eating and nutrition, and physical fitness.\n       Preventing and reducing substance abuse, school violence, \n     and bullying.\n       Strengthening parent and community engagement to ensure a \n     healthy, safe, and supportive school environment.\n\n\n          Enhanced Flexibility through Funding Transferability\n\n       To provide additional funding flexibility to State and \n     local school districts, under the Empowering Local \n     Educational Decision Making Act of 2011 districts will be \n     able to transfer up to 100% of their allocations under the \n     Fund for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning and the \n     Safe and Healthy Students Block Grant between the two \n     programs or into Title I, Part A.\n\n      Empowering Parents Through Quality Charter Schools Act 2011\n\n\n                    Senator Kirk Charter School Bill\n\n       This bill will modernize the charter school program by \n     encouraging the expansion of high-quality charter schools and \n     allowing charter school management organizations to receive \n     assistance directly from the federal government.\n       Modernizes the Charter School Program to address present \n     realities for public school choice, by incentivizing \n     expansion and replication of successful charter models, \n     providing support for authorizers, and enhanced opportunities \n     for facilities financing.\n       Encourages states to support the development and expansion \n     of charter schools.\n       Streamlines federal Charter School Program funding to \n     reduce administrative burdens and improves funding \n     opportunities for the replication of successful charter \n     models and facilities assistance.\n       Allows proven, high-quality charter school management \n     organizations to apply directly to the federal government, as \n     well as local education agencies, deleting a layer of \n     bureaucracy with the State government.\n       Facilitates the establishment of high-quality charter \n     schools and further encourage choice, innovation and \n     excellence in education.\n       Supports an evaluation of schools' impact on students, \n     families, and communities, while also encouraging sharing \n     best practices between charters and traditional public \n     schools.\n\n                 The State Innovation Pilot Act of 2011\n\n       The bill clarifies waiver authority that is currently in \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

Mr. President, earlier this week, I gave a talk based on my \nservice in Afghanistan as a reservist, about the growing threat of a \nnew group to our forces in Afghanistan, ISAF, and the Afghan \nGovernment. It is not al-Qaida, which is armed and dangerous, but a \nshadow of its former shadow. It is not the Taliban, which is still \nextremely armed and dangerous. It is a new group called the Haqqani \nNetwork.\n  Recently, there was a high-profile attack on the Afghan Government \nand ISAF headquarters in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The U.S. \nAmbassador 2 days ago then announced this was the work of the Haqqani \nNetwork. That is a very important factoid. Then yesterday, the \nSecretary of Defense also highlighted the Haqqani and pointed a direct \nfinger at the Government of Pakistan and its intelligence service, the \nISI.\n  It is all well known that while there are terrorists operating \nloosely in Pakistan who attack Afghans and Americans, it is the Haqqani \nNetwork that enjoys the official support and backing of the \nintelligence service of Pakistan.\n  Given this new information, and especially given the statement by the \nU.S. Ambassador in Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, and now our Secretary of \nDefense, Leon Panetta, the Senate should engage in an agonizing \nreappraisal of military assistance to Pakistan. We should base our \nreappraisal on the statements of our own Ambassador in Kabul and the \nSecretary of Defense himself.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about the disaster funding \ndebate that is going on this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate the Presiding Officer's recognition.\n  Mr. President, this is a debate that has become the debate as part of \nthe Burma Sanctions Act, which if we were debating the Burma Sanctions \nAct I would also be for Burma sanctions. But in the debate on \ndisasters, Missouri has played an unfortunate leading role this year of \nall kinds.\n  We have had floods along the Mississippi River. We have had floods \nalong the Missouri River. Joplin, MO--one of the bigger cities in our \nState--was hit by a tornado. We have evacuated a place in southeast \nMissouri, a floodway called Birds Point, where, for the first time \nsince 1937, the Corps of Engineers decided that 130,000 or so acres had \nto be used as a floodway. All the crops that were already planted and \nup were, obviously, destroyed as part of that.\n  I was in that floodway for a couple of different days in August, and \nI will say, the resilience of Missouri farmers to get about 80 percent \nof that floodway back in soybeans means the economic loss, the crop \nloss, will not be what it was. But the recovery loss is substantial, as \nis the cost of rebuilding that levee back to the level it was before \nthe Corps exercised the long plan that had not been used to take it \ndown.\n  Tornadoes struck St. Louis at the airport and around Lambert Field, \nin communities around Lambert Field. Tornadoes in Joplin were \nsignificant. I mentioned on the floor of the Senate before that I live \nclose to Joplin. It was\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\nin my congressional district for 14 years. I had an office there. I am \nprobably as familiar with Joplin as anybody who does not live there or \nhas not lived there.\n  As I went to the scene of this tornado, the devastation made a city \nthat I was very familiar with--at least a half-mile path, 6 miles \nacross that city--virtually unrecognizable by me or the local police \nofficer who was driving me around. There were no street signs left. \nEvery block looked like the block on either side of it--an incredible \namount of devastation.\n  There were 162 people killed either at the time of the tornado or who \nwithin a few days of the tornado died as a result of injuries; 900 \npeople were injured. A hospital was destroyed that will cost about $500 \nmillion to replace. The high school was destroyed. The vo-tech school \nwas destroyed, lots of elementary schools destroyed, 500 commercial \nproperties, 8,000 apartments and homes, and I think ``destroyed'' in \nvirtually all those cases would be the right word; some of them \nsalvageable, most of them not. Homes, churches, elementary schools, the \nCatholic school--all destroyed by that tornado.\n  While we make headway every day, finding housing for people in that \ncommunity who were affected by the loss of those 8,000 homes, and while \nthe schools were up and running by the day schools were scheduled to \nstart 90 days later, in an incredible way, looking for whatever space \nwas available and turning that into schools for this year, there is \nclearly a lot to be done.\n  This exceeds the capacity of an individual community or even a State \nto do what needs to be done. I am in the process, and have been for \nsome time now, of discussing with GAO the exact right request, to be \nsure we are not declaring disasters as national disasters that are not \nnational in scope, that we have not gotten into a habit of saying: That \nis a disaster, the Governor ought to send a request to the President \nand the President ought to grant it. We do not want to be doing that \nwhen a State or a community could handle the problem. But we do always \nwant to be sure we have the resources necessary when States and \ncommunities cannot possibly handle this kind of problem by themselves.\n  The tornado I talked about was one; the flooding in the entire \nMississippi Valley watershed, which is I think the fourth largest \nwatershed in the world. And whether it was the Missouri River or the \nOhio River or the Mississippi River itself, or the Arkansas River, all \nof this flooding that occurred this year has set a recovery number that \ndoes require national involvement. If we do not recover from these \nfloods, the right kinds of things do not happen.\n  I had a county commissioner tell me over August that the factory does \nnot open until the highway opens. And the highway does not open until \nflood protection is guaranteed. And flood protection is not guaranteed \nuntil we appropriate the money.\n  You know we should be and appropriately are focused on jobs as the \nNo. 1 priority in the country today, private sector jobs. But there are \na lot of private sector jobs in my State and others that have not been \nthere for months now because the factory is closed or the business is \nclosed. That factory is not going to open again until people can get to \nwork. And people are not going to be on the highway to get to work \nuntil the levee is rebuilt. And the levee is not going to be rebuilt \nuntil the Corps of Engineers has the money to do the job they are \nsupposed to do and meet their obligations. The Corps is responsible for \ntaking care of some of our most pressing needs, whether it is restoring \nthe levee at Bird's Point or levees in northwest Missouri in Holt \nCounty, which has 165,000 acres--more than half the county--underwater. \nA lot of that has been underwater now for 3 or 4 months.\n  I talked to a farmer in my office yesterday who went to his own home \nfor the first time in 3 months, by driving a tractor over some fairly \nhigh water areas but passable areas. His home had not been flooded, but \neverything around it was. So he had not been there for 3 months when we \ntalked yesterday until he went this week.\n  Whether it is water along the entire Missouri River, which has been \nin flood stage through the month of August, recovering from what has \nhappened on the Mississippi River, we need to do our job. In our case, \nthe Missouri River, this has not been a-1 week flood; this is a 3- and \n4-month flood.\n  I do not remember a time ever--in fact, I am not aware of a time \never--when the entire Missouri River from the Missouri border in the \nnorthwest corner of the State to St. Louis was in flood stage the \nentire month of August, and in some cases has been in flood stage now \nfor what is 4 months. Community development block grants that help with \ndisasters provide communities a short-term and long-term way to meet \ndisaster recovery. Disaster community development block grant funds can \npick up where FEMA leaves off. I hope that is part of our plan as we \nlook for this disaster bill, which I am intending to support--or the \nfinal, or another disaster bill that we can agree to with the House--to \nbe sure that we make it possible for these communities to do what they \ncould not do on their own or could not even do with State assistance.\n  In Joplin, it is things such as underground utilities and storm \nsewers and sanitary systems of all kinds, owner-occupancy programs to \nget people who owned a house but may never own one again because the \nhouse they owned, through frankly their own inability or their \noversight or their decision not to have insurance--you know, if you own \na house and you do not have a loan, there is no banker to tell you that \nyou have to get insurance. We will have some people who are negatively \naffected by that. But that was a decision they made. However, getting \nthem into a house that they do not own is something that there are \ngovernment programs for that are designed to help.\n  Community development block grants allow qualifying communities to \nmeet local matches and local needs without a whole lot of redtape, less \nredtape than a lot of other things that the government does. And, of \ncourse, with the most recent hurricane, Hurricane Irene, suddenly FEMA \nsays: Well, I know we made a lot of commitments to other communities \nthat are already in progress, but we now have to turn to the new \ndisaster. I appreciate turning to the new disaster. But you cannot \nforget that a community has problems they cannot deal with that we said \nwe were going to help with, just because the TV satellite truck has \ngone somewhere else. I think it is important that FEMA meets its \nobligations.\n  As I said before, I think it is important in an ongoing way we are \nsure that we have a standard for natural and national disasters that \ntruly are national in scope. With thousands of acres of Missouri \nfarmland still underwater, with communities trying to recover from \ntornados, with commitments that FEMA has told them to move forward on \nand now suddenly does not have the money that they had already \ncommitted, we need to be concerned about that.\n  Programs such as watershed emergency protection and conservation \nemergency protection that are in this bill that were in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill that the committee voted out earlier this week will \nhave a big impact on meeting these obligations.\n  Despite the unprecedented year, my State and Americans everywhere are \nresponding to these disasters, this is a time when the Federal \nGovernment needs to do what the Federal Government has said it is there \nto do. Hopefully we will do this with this bill or some other bill that \ncomes quickly that allows these communities to meet their needs, these \nfarm families to get back to work, these factory workers to see the \nfactory doors open again. I am supportive of this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nwithout objection in the majority's time. Only 4 minutes is remaining.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, am I incorrect that the other side has a \nspeaker coming at 11 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does not have information about \nthat.\n  Mr. BURR. I will take whatever time the Chair gives me. I will yield, \nwhen I need to, to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Let me add to what my good friend from Missouri talked \nabout. That is about the Federal commitment to disaster. North Carolina \nhappens to be one of those States that is probably the most recent. We \nwelcome the attention of FEMA, but we\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nalso have the last disaster before. And just like he expects the \npromises to be fulfilled, even though we are first in line now, we \nexpect the promises to be fulfilled to those who are already out there. \nOur country is great enough to do it. It is the greatest country in the \nworld. But it means we have got to do it in a responsible way. Part of \nthat means we need to pay for it. I hope my colleagues will join what I \nthink will be a House effort to expedite the funding needed for \ndisaster relief but to do it in a way that we do not charge future \ngenerations because of our fiscal irresponsibility.\n  I had the opportunity to participate in a colloquy earlier on reforms \nto K-12 education. I wish to take the few remaining minutes I have to \ntalk a little bit more about that, because I think to some degree we \nhear about education and the failures of K-12.\n  Senator Kirk alluded to some charter schools in Chicago. I want to \nmention a school nobody hears about. It is called the KIPP Academy. \nTechnically, it is a charter school. It started in Houston, TX. Then it \nexpanded. Its second location was in New York City. Its third location \nwas targeted to be Atlanta, but halfway between Atlanta and New York \nthey found a little county in rural North Carolina. It is called \nNorthampton County, and a little community there called Gaston, NC, the \nlast place you would expect a Texas innovative charter school to say, \nlet's put a facility here. Predominantly minority; clearly below the \naverage income level of every county in North Carolina; challenged for \neconomic development. They do not have the infrastructure. But KIPP \nlooked at it and said: You know, no child should go without what we are \nout there to offer. Today the success rate of that school is off the \nchart. But it also is in every KIPP location that has opened.\n  When you have successes such as that, whether they are in Houston, \nTX, or New York City, or Gaston, NC, the responsible thing is to stop \nand take a breath and ask yourself: What have they figured out that \neither we have not in Washington or what flexibility do they have that \nwe do not give everybody else?\n  When you walk into a KIPP school, it is markedly different as soon as \nyou walk in the door. Most kids are in uniforms. The school day is \nlonger. The teachers are partners in education, which begs me to talk a \nlittle bit about Teach for America, the program that many Members of \nCongress support.\n  Teach for America challenged the next generation of kids who want to \nbe educators to commit a certain portion of their life in these at-risk \nlocations. It is a program we ought to support because its standards \nfor its teachers exceed the definition we have for ``highly \nqualified.'' As a matter of fact, not only do their credentials make \nthem one of the best individuals to put into a classroom, you match \nthat with their passion for their students to succeed, and all of a \nsudden you have got a formula for success regardless of the \nsocioeconomic conditions of the child who came.\n  Well, I fear Teach for America is not going to get the attention of \nCongress that it should. Yet across this country, when you find \nsuccessful, qualified teachers, they have come out of this program. The \ncommitment to be there for 2 years or 3 years or 5 years is no longer a \ncontract that they are waiting for the end of; they are looking for the \nopportunity to make this a career.\n  It is those teachers, those Teach for America graduates, who are \nfinding their way to being the principals of schools, to being elected \non the school board, to being involved in areas that, for once, now \nthese Teach for America graduates are challenging traditional education \nto live up to what this obligation is they have got. That is to make \nsure that every child has the foundational education they need to \ncompete.\n  It does not matter whether the example I talk about is the KIPP \nAcademy charter model that was started in Houston or whether it is the \nNoble Street charter that was created in Chicago. All of these examples \nwere not created here. They were not created in Congress or in \nWashington. Yet what typically we do is we try to import the solution \nfrom here.\n  I will be the first to tell you, a principal is much closer to your \nchildren than the Congress of the United States. They are much closer \nto the school. They are much closer to the school system. They have \ngreater influence on the outcome. Where have we been influencing \neducation? We influence it on the input side, not the output side, \nbecause we say: Here is some money. We have got some money. But you can \nonly use it for this because we have determined this is the solution to \nthe problem. KIPP sort of broke the mold. They said: Our mission is to \neducate every child. We want to see them succeed.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example. In Charlotte, NC, they opened a \nKIPP Academy, K-8, next door to a traditional K-6 school. There is no \nway anybody can look at it and say, this drew kids who were in a \ndifferent neighborhood. No, it drew kids from exactly the same \nneighborhood. But if you look at the performance side by side \nphysically, the performance of the kids in the KIPP far exceeds the \nperformance of the kids in the traditional public school system.\n  (Mr. BROWN of Ohio assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BURR. Why? Because KIPP officials have the flexibility to design \nhow they educate those children. The goal at the end is the same--to \nmeet a standard of performance, to meet an educational level that is \nset nationally.\n  To me, it only makes common sense for us to see the ones that exceed \nthe goals we set and ask how do we import what they do into the rest of \nour K-12 system? Part of it is recognizing the fact that up here we \ndon't have the solutions; we are merely a financial partner. That is \none of the reasons this morning I introduced a bill. What that bill \ndoes is it takes 59 pots of money--59 separate programs that were \nfunded last year. In one area, we call it the fund for improvement of \nteaching and learning, to say we can take 59 programs and combine them \ninto two pots of money; one is teaching and learning and the second one \nis safe and healthy students.\n  In the teaching and learning area, we have consolidated about 24 \nfunding programs into one. We have said to local educators that they \ncan use this money however they want, if their focus is teaching and \nlearning, and they can pull out of the other pot any moneys they need \nfor programs that address safe and healthy students.\n  We went a step further and said, if one of these pots of money \ndoesn't work for them, then we will give them 100 percent \ntransferability from one pot to the other. So if their objective and \ntheir need is greater in teaching and learning, we will give them the \nability to take the safe and healthy student money and throw it over \ninto the teaching and learning pot so they can access more funds.\n  In addition, some communities across the country might need \nadditional help in title I, at-risk students. We allow 100 percent \ntransferability of both of those into title I. For those concerned with \ntitle I, not only do we not touch it, we make it available to receive \nadditional funding if a school system decides to do it, not a \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC.\n  Under the fund of improving teaching and learning, States and local \nschool districts may use funds for activities and programs that meet \nthe purposes of the fund for the improvement of teaching and learning \nand their unique and individual needs. These may include evaluation \nsystems for teachers and principals that take into account data on \nstudent academic achievement and growth as a significant factor.\n  That is exactly what Senator Isakson was talking about, the need for \naccountability. But we are trying to take a majority of the \nresponsibility for accountability and send it to the local school \nsystems. All we can see are numbers up here in comparison to what our \ngoal is for people to hit. I am concerned that a community takes \nownership in the performance of their school system because that \ncommunity is reliant on their success for their future.\n  My hope is, school systems and communities around the country will \nsee this as a tremendous opportunity to once again not only take \ncontrol of local education but to be empowered to make decisions on the \nway they teach our kids.\n  It reforms teacher and principal certifications, recertifications, \nlicensing, and tenure; alternative routes for State certification of \nteachers and\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nprincipals, including mid-career professionals from other occupations, \nformer military personnel, and recent college or university graduates \nwith records of academic distinction who demonstrate the potential to \nbecome highly effective teachers and principals.\n  There is this whole pool of people we exclude because they didn't go \nthrough a traditional method of being classified a teacher. Yet their \nbase of knowledge, their expertise and, I suggest, their passion, in \nmany cases, exceeds those who might be in the classroom today.\n  Is it reasonable to believe that a pharmacist has the institutional \nknowledge to teach chemistry? I hope so because we trust him every day \nwhen we go into a pharmacy. If a pharmacist feels impassioned enough \nthat he or she wants to go into a high school and teach chemistry, what \nthey might lack in the educational process of becoming a teacher they \ncertainly have in knowledge; but more important, they may have the \npassion to want to be in there and, more important, they have an \nunderstanding of why the success of that student is absolutely vital.\n  It includes performance pay systems; differential, incentive, and \nbonus pay for teachers in high-need academic subjects and specialty \nareas and teachers in high-poverty schools and districts; teacher \nachievement initiatives that promote professional growth, multiple \ncareer paths, and pay differentiation.\n  Everywhere else in the world we pay bonuses for performance. In the \ngovernment, we pay bonuses even when people don't perform. I haven't \nquite figured that out. When we introduce bonuses, it is not based upon \nwhether somebody--an agency or a department--succeeded; it becomes part \nof their annual stipend. We have to revisit that. Why would we \ninstitute it in government and then suggest that when we import this \ninto K-12 education, somehow it is wrong?\n  The only reason it is wrong is because the teachers union doesn't \nlike it because they don't negotiate. That has to change. The teachers \nunion doesn't know our children. The truth is, the only reason the \nmajority of the teachers actually join the union is because they are \nthe only source of liability coverage, liability insurance that \nteachers can get. The fact is, you and I would not teach in a classroom \nwithout liability insurance, based upon the accusations and charges \nsome families come up with against teachers. Ask them, if you don't \nbelieve me. Maybe we ought to look at the Federal umbrella and allow \nteachers to access liability from us and maybe contract with a third-\nparty insurer and give them the opportunity to go into that classroom \nand only be concerned with educating children. I have never had anybody \nfrom Teach for America talk to me about liability coverage. They only \ncome and talk to me about the success of their students or the need to \nexpand programs at work and about the need for flexibility at the local \nlevel because they have gone to multiple school districts and they do \nthings differently, because that is where the administration told them \nthey had to go to get their Federal money.\n  I am suggesting a radical change: Taking 59 programs, put them into \ntwo pots, shake them up, and say: You pick what is best for the school \nsystem you are in.\n  With safe and healthy student block grants, the local districts could \nuse the funds for activity and programs to meet the purposes of safe \nand healthy students and their individual needs, which are not limited \nto drug and violence prevention activities and programs, before and \nafterschool programs, including during summer recess periods, and \nprograms that extend the schoolday, week, and school year calendar.\n  It includes school-based mental health services. Some of these sound \neerily familiar because we have heard people in our community saying we \nare not doing enough in mental health. That may not be the issue in the \ncommunity next to us. This now allows the flexibility for the school \nsystems that need to access it to access it. I think every Member here \nwants to make sure there are afterschool opportunities for the many \nfamilies in which both the husband and wife work.\n  Up to this point, we said: Here is the program; you have to use this \nprogram. Now what I am saying is: Here is the money; you decide what \nprogram best fits your school system. It may not be at the local rec \ncenter; it may actually be in the school. Think about it. It is already \na facility we own. We are going to have to heat it and cool it. Why not \nutilize it other than just during the meat of the education day?\n  It includes emergency intervention services following traumatic \ncrises. It seems every year we have these events that happen, and \nsometimes we forget the effect it has on these students. I talked \nearlier about eastern North Carolina and the effect of Hurricane Irene. \nI have communities right now where people have not been able to return \nto their homes. The road is gone, the power is not back on, and the \nonly access is by ferry. Don't for a minute believe this doesn't have \nan effect on a fifth grader. Maybe school had only been in effect about \na week, but they are traumatized from it. If it is identified by a \nschool system, now they have the flexibility to treat that, because I \ncan assure you that if they are traumatized, the ability to learn is \nprobably minimized.\n  There are programs that train school personnel to identify warning \nsigns of youth suicide. I would like to suggest that doesn't exist, but \nthe truth is, we know it does. In many cases, it is identified by the \npeople who spend the most time with them, which are the teachers, \ncoaches, and administrators. They don't have the capacity to intervene \nin any way, shape or form. Now the flexibility is at least there.\n  I am not suggesting that any of these areas are things school systems \nhave to do. But I think, for once, we have laid out a buffet and said \nthey can pick and choose what works. If I could best summarize where I \nthink our focus should be in Washington on K-12, it is on the outcome. \nAre our kids learning?\n  Last year, about 66 percent of our Nation's high schoolers graduated \non time. In North Carolina, it was barely over 70 percent graduating on \ntime. Let me assure the pages who are here and young folks who might be \nlistening to this, there is a Federal law that says every company has \nto accept an application from somebody who is looking for a job. There \nis no Federal law that says they have to interview that applicant. If \nyou are an employer today and you have 100 applications and 98 have a \nhigh school diploma and two of them don't, I can assure you the two who \ndon't have a high school diploma will not be invited back for an \ninterview. They are out of the pool of selection because that has \nbecome the base minimum for consideration of a job that might have any \nupward mobility. It doesn't mean every child has to have a 4-year \ndegree. But it does mean, from a standpoint of the business world, \nbusiness has sort of cut it off and said our threshold is a high school \ndiploma. A high percentage of our kids are not graduating from high \nschool on time. If I was on the floor talking about health care today, \nwe would call this an epidemic and we would fix it. No, this is \neducation. This is somebody else's children. I have raised mine and \neducated mine.\n  This is the future fabric of America. We can either fix education or \nthe rest of the world will clean our clock economically in the future. \nThe secret to long-term success is making sure we field a team of \nhighly gifted, knowledgeable Americans. If we plan to do that with a \nhigh of 60 percent of our kids with barely a high school diploma, I \nassure you the rest of the world will see that as an opportunity to \nsurpass us and bury us. We have an opportunity to fix it now.\n  We talked earlier about No Child Left Behind--the right direction of \nlegislation that was severely implemented incorrectly. It could have \nbeen a real winner if people embraced it, but they didn't. Now, 9 years \nlater, 4 years after we were supposed to assess its success, make \nchanges, and reauthorize it, we are in the ninth year, struggling to \nput together a reauthorization bill--in large measure because up until \nnow everybody wanted to try to create a Washington bill to initiate \nsolutions to elementary and secondary education versus a local approach \nthat Washington is a partner in that provides flexibility and \nimagination.\n  We are going to spend a lot of time between now and the end of the \nyear because it is vital we get reauthorization in 2011. I don't think \nwe can let another class of students suffer through the lack of \nflexibility in the school systems they live in.\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\n  Senator Kirk talked about the need to expand charter school \nopportunities. I am for it. I cosponsored the bill. But just because \nthere has been a private alternative that works, let's also face the \nreality that we are not going to put every child in America in a \ncharter school. We might ought to, but we are not. And unless we want \nto say up front that everybody who is not in a charter school is going \nto suffer and they are not going to have the educational foundation \nkids over here have, then we better do both at the same time--provide \nthat new avenue of education, which is an expansion of charter school \nopportunities; challenge the private sector, like KIPP stepped up; and \ndesign a school that works and at the same time look at the public side \nof it and say: What do we need to do as a country?\n  I would suggest, when we honestly look at that and we focus on \noutcome versus input, what we will find is we have to empower more of \nthe local community. We have to challenge business leaders in that \ncommunity to hold the school system accountable. We have to challenge \nparents to actually look at the performance of their children and to \nhold those principals and administrators and teachers accountable for \nthe performance of their kids. We have to make sure a community sees \nthe success of education as the ability for that community to grow in \nthe future.\n  When you go into a community, the worst thing you can hear, as a \nMember of Congress, is that when the kids graduate from high school, \nthey never return. They never return because the business opportunities \naren't there. Usually that is rooted in the fact that K-12 in that \ncommunity doesn't work because wherever you have an educated workforce, \nyou have a company looking to make investments.\n  I have heard my colleagues say that North Carolina has unfair \nadvantages in economic development; that we have 58 community colleges, \nand that gives us something to sell that everybody else doesn't have; \nthat we have the mountains and the beach, and that is not something \neverybody has. It is all a good thing to sell, but let me tell you what \nNorth Carolina really has. Let me tell you why companies around the \nworld are investing in North Carolina. It is because we produce the \nsecond largest pool of graduates of higher education annually than any \nState in the country other than California. When a company invests $1 \nbillion in North Carolina, they know every year they can reach into the \ngraduate pool and have a shot at getting the cream of the crop of those \nstudents. Why would it be any different for a company looking at \nlocating in any community? If they look at a community that has a \npitiful performance in K-12, why would they ever think of making the \ninvestment there? They will make the investment where the future \nworkforce is available. If they believe the kids graduate and leave and \nnever come back, they will look for where those kids moved to and make \ntheir investment there.\n  If we want to keep communities alive, whether they are in Ohio or \nNorth Carolina, we have to find a way to make K-12 a success in every \ncommunity, big and small, urban and rural, and it starts by legislation \nthat empowers those local school systems and, more importantly, shifts \naccountability from Washington and puts it back into the community, \nmakes it the responsibility of the officials, the business leaders, \nand, most important, the parents.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for accommodating me this morning. I \nnoticed the other speaker didn't come in, so I am thrilled I was given \nthe extra time.\n  I urge my colleagues over the months to come to pay attention to the \nK-12 reauthorization. There are many proposals out there. Not all will \nwork, and we are not assured any are certain to succeed. But if you \nlook for guidance, talk to the people who are closest to the problem. \nWhat they are screaming for today is the flexibility to put the money \nwhere it can have the greatest effect on the outcome of education, and \nthat is this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5650-S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATION ON HOLD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come to the floor frustrated, angry, and \ndisturbed that our Republican colleagues are holding up three crucial \nbills. And America needs to hear this. They are stopping us from \ncompleting our work on our emergency FEMA bill, which contains the \nmonies needed throughout this country to rebuild and repair storm \ndamage, a lot of it infrastructure--sewer plants, waterplants, roads, \nbridges, and highways.\n  We see pictures of what is happening in places such as Vermont, \nwhere, as Senator Leahy told us yesterday, a woman he talked to has to \ndrive 1-hour-plus for her chemotherapy because the road is gone, and it \nused to take her 5 minutes. We need to fix that road. We need to fix \nthe roads, the bridges, the highways, the sewer systems, the water \nsystems, the schools that get harmed in these natural disasters, and \nthe Republicans are holding up the bill to let us do that.\n  We have holds--more than one--on the highway bill, known as the \nTransportation bill, and the FAA, our Nation's aviation bill. And here \nis the real shocker: The FAA and the Transportation bill, which have \nbeen merged into one bill, have come over from the House of \nRepresentatives, and the House relented on the numbers. They are at \ncurrent levels of spending. They are clean extensions, which we wanted, \nbut the Republicans over here will not let us get to those bills.\n  Tomorrow, the FAA authorization to fix up the airports, rebuild the \nairports, expires. So there will be no fee as of tomorrow, and we have \nto stop, midstream, our airport improvements that are going on. It is \ncalled the airport improvement fund. They already shut that down once. \nI went around my State and saw safety projects stopped midstream. Now \nthey are doing it again right over here--the Republicans right over \nhere--holding up the FAA bill again. It means 70,000 jobs lost on \nFriday night.\n  They are holding up the highway bill, the Transportation bill, \nwhich--I am so proud--in our committee, we got the extension. Everybody \nagreed to it, Republicans and Democrats, in the committee. Republicans \nare holding it up now on this floor. It is a clean extension. It is 1.8 \nmillion jobs, everybody. There are 1.8 million jobs relying on that \nextension. It has come over here from the House. Take it up and pass \nit. Oh, no. Oh, no. There they go again, stopping progress in this \ncountry.\n  I will tell you why I am so particularly frustrated. It has to do \nwith the rebuilding that is going on and that has gone on in Iraq and \nAfghanistan with American dollars. Not one Republican ever objected. \nLet me show you the pictures. Let me show you the pictures.\n  This is a picture of a new water treatment plant that has been built \nin Nassiriya, Iraq, at a cost of 277 million American dollars. Not one \nRepublican said: Stop this. Not one Republican said: Pay for it by \ncutting some other program. What is going on?\n  Let me show you the picture of a water treatment plant near the \nborder of Mexico in my State of California. It is old. I visited this \ntreatment plant. It got hurt in an earthquake, and FEMA--the bill they \nare holding up--will pay to finish this water treatment plant, which \nhas to be fixed before another earthquake hits us. And we know that is \nwhat is happening.\n  So they were fine with building a water treatment plant in Iraq--not \na complaint, not a murmur, not a word, not an amendment--but we have to \nfix our water treatment plants here with the FEMA bill, and they are \nholding up the bill, and everybody knows that because we could have \ntaken care of that yesterday. So that is an example.\n  Here is another example. This is a picture of road construction in--\nand I want to say this right--Kapisa Province, Afghanistan. Everyone is \nvery proud that America has built a road there. We have spent a lot of \ntax dollars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\nhappy for the people there that they have a road, and, God, we pray \nthat nobody blows it up. But I have to tell you, if you are going to \nbuild roads in Afghanistan, you had better build roads here in America \nor the American people are going to rise up and say: Who are you \nfighting for?\n  I have never heard one Republican say: Oh, they are building a road \nin Afghanistan. That is an earmark. That is an earmark. Let's stop it. \nThat is a problem. Let's stop it. We are spending X number of dollars. \nLet's cut another program. Never a word. But now we have our highway \nbill right now coming over from the House. They changed their mind over \nthere. They did not cut it. It is current levels of funding. It is a \ngood bill. It will last for 6 months' funding. It will preserve 1.8 \nmillion jobs. And the Republicans are holding it up right now.\n  Why do you think this Chamber is empty? Why do you think I am here \nletting off steam? Because we are not voting. Let us vote. If you don't \nlike the highway bill, vote against it. If you don't like it, that is \nfine, vote against it. Let us vote. Ninety people will vote for it, \nprobably. Let us vote.\n  So here you have a picture of the excitement around a new road. Let's \ntake a look at another picture of a road in my home State.\n  In January and February of 2010, California was hit by terrible \nwinter storms and flooding and mudslides. This picture shows a road \nthat was blocked after these storms. These storms hit us in many \ncounties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Riverside, Calavaras, San Bernardino, \nSiskiyou--all of these counties declared emergencies. They are all \nwaiting for the funds to rebuild a road that looks like this. It is \nimpassible, shutting people down--a lot like the roads in Vermont now \nand other places.\n  They are holding up the FEMA bill, they are holding up the highway \nbill, they are holding up the Federal Aviation bill, and it is wrong. I \nhave never heard them say: Strike that road we are building in \nAfghanistan; it is an earmark. But they are holding up, they are \nholding up the three bills we need to do.\n  So now I am going to show you another program. This is a brandnew air \ntraffic control tower being built in Mosul, Iraq, at a cost of $10 \nmillion. You can see it is almost ready. The scaffolding is on it. It \nhas been built. I never heard one Republican say: Oh, wait a minute, \nlet's strike some other money somewhere else to pay for this air \ntraffic control tower. I never heard one Republican object to building \nthis air traffic control tower in Iraq--not a word--but when it comes \nto our air traffic control towers, you hear plenty.\n  They stopped us from moving ahead with the FAA reauthorization before \nwe left for the summer break. It resulted in 70,000 people being laid \noff. And here is one of my towers in Palm Springs, stopped in the \nmiddle, shut down in the middle. The workers had to leave. They lost \nmoney, the contractor did. The workers--some of them went off to other \njobs, and they had to hire new workers. I stood in front of this tower. \nI stood in front of the tower in Oakland. I went to Los Angeles and saw \nthe work stoppages that occurred on the new Tom Bradley terminal \nbecause the Republicans shut us down.\n  Now, today, we come back. We all think we have a new attitude around \nthis place, but we are shut down again. And we have 24 hours to get \nthis FAA bill done or 70,000 workers will be out again. And we have \nuntil September 30 to pass the Transportation bill or 1.8 million \nworkers will be out of work.\n  Now, we have heard complaints from the other side as to why they are \nholding it up, so let me give you some of that argument.\n  One of our Senators from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, says he wants to \nhold up the Transportation bill, which includes Transportation and FAA, \nbecause he doesn't like one part of the program. Two percent of the \nfunds go to things he doesn't like. Well, he has every right to that \nopinion and every right to work with us on an amendment and get it \ndone, but he is holding it up. We could have had that amendment \nyesterday.\n  He doesn't like the transportation enhancements program. For the \nrecord, there are a number of things in that portion--which is a \nrelatively small amount of the bill, 2 percent of the bill--and we are \nreforming that section next year when we get to the new bill, but he is \nholding it up. Now, he is wrong to hold it up because of what I told \nyou. He is putting at risk all of these safety improvements at our \nairports, he is putting at risk 1.8 million jobs on the Transportation \nbill, and he is putting at risk 70,000 jobs at FAA because he doesn't \nlike this program.\n  He also misled people. He said we spend 10 percent of our \ntransportation money on this transportation enhancements program. We do \nnot. We spend 2 percent. Ten percent is not 2 percent.\n  He went on to say that safety should be a top priority. And we agree. \nBut he doesn't understand what the transportation enhancements program \nis. It is about safety. It is about safety. The transportation \nenhancements program is mainly about saving lives by preventing \nbicycle-and-pedestrian fatalities. That is what it does. It says to the \nStates: We have a pot of money here. If you want it, you need to make \nsure you make safety improvements for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n  Pedestrians and bicyclists account for 13 percent of traffic \nfatalities nationwide, with more than 47,000 pedestrians killed in the \n9-year period 2000 to 2009. That is the equivalent of a jumbo jet \ncrashing every month. So the safety enhancements supported by the \nprogram Senator Coburn wants to eliminate are needed to prevent these \ndeaths.\n  Bike paths and pedestrian walkways are important. Fifty percent of \ntrips are 3 miles or less, 12 percent of all trips are made by \nbicycling and walking, and bicycle commuting has increased by more than \n40 percent between 2000 and 2008.\n  So why on Earth does he want to hold up this critical bill and the \nFAA bill--because they are married together--to say he is for safety \nwhen he wants to eliminate this whole program, which is dedicated to \nsafety for our pedestrians and our bicyclists, 47,000 of whom perished \nbecause we don't have these safety enhancements in place? All Americans \nbenefit from the program he wants to eliminate.\n  We strengthen local economies, we improve the quality of life, we \nprotect the environment, and he is willing still--because that is what \nhe is doing by holding this up--to risk shutting down our Nation's \nentire surface transportation system as well as critical FAA programs \nand more than 1 million jobs because he doesn't like this program.\n  Well, do you know something, every one of us here has a pretty big \nego. You get here and, yeah, it is important. Set it aside. You don't \nlike something? Offer an amendment. Don't hold up all of these bills. \nIt is wrong because if we do what they did--shut down the FAA--it makes \na rough economy rougher, and it stalls us from doing the work we have \nto do. No one stalled the airport improvements in Iraq. No one stalled \nover there, on the Republican side, the road improvements in Iraq. No \none stopped improvements in Afghanistan. No one stopped water system \nimprovements in the war zones. But somehow, when it comes to America, \nwell, we had better cut this and cut that and offset this and offset \nthat.\n  We have a budget. We are going to live by it. We have an emergency. \nIf we look at the explanation in Webster's dictionary of an emergency--\nhere it is, an emergency:\n\n       No. 1, an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the \n     resulting state that calls for immediate action\n\n  Webster's dictionary has it right. This ought to be put on the desk \nof every one of my Republican colleagues. Another definition:\n\n       No. 2, an urgent need for assistance or relief.\n\n  When there is an emergency, one steps to the plate and solves the \nproblem. Just ask Senator Landrieu, who has been leading the battle on \nthis FEMA bill. We cannot tell people out there that they only have 30 \ndays' of funding because they have to enter into a contract. It may \ntake 3 or 4 months to rebuild a bridge. It may take 6 or 7 months to \nrebuild a water treatment system. But that is the way they approach it \nover there--when it comes to America.\n  When it comes to funding wars and rebuilding the war zones, I don't \nhear a peep out of them, not a peep. I say it is time for America. We \nhave a choice.\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nWe can stand up for America right now, today. We can pass these three \nbills.\n  The FEMA bill gives our Governors and our people in the States the \nassurances that FEMA will team up with them and do what it takes to \nrebuild after these horrifying emergencies--which, by the way, are \nbecoming more and more frequent because of climate change. But that is \nanother matter for another day. That is another battle for another day.\n  Unfortunately, in this body science takes a back seat to politics and \nthe special interests that want to say: Oh, climate change; no big \ndeal. We need to protect our turf. That is what they say. And we have \ndone nothing.\n  The President has done what he can, and bless him for it--fuel \neconomy, all these things. But it gets worse and worse. We have done \nnothing. I have four grandkids, and I am so hoping in the rest of the \ntime I have to be in this body and on this Earth that I can get us \nmoving on this climate change. But, oh, no. So I guess we sit back \nwhile we see more and more extreme weather emergencies, while we see \nextreme weather emergencies.\n  If the other side doesn't want to do anything about the cause of it, \nfine. That is their choice. They have to live with themselves. They can \nat least help us adapt to these problems, and that means paying to fix \nour roads, bridges, highways, our water systems, our sewer systems, all \nthese things that get exposed to these weather emergencies.\n  Do you know 70 percent of our bridges are deficient? I thank my \nranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nInhofe. He and I don't see eye to eye on the environment. That is an \nunderstatement. But when it comes to the infrastructure, we agree. He \ntalks about the tragic death of a young woman who was walking and a \nbridge literally fell apart. It fell and killed her.\n  This is America. Seventy percent of our bridges are deficient, and we \nhave colleagues holding up this bill? I say shame on them. Shame on \nthem for doing that. It is outrageous. We finally got the House to come \nto us, to come to our number to freeze spending. I thank them for that. \nThey came to their senses. They realized we need to build our highways. \nWe need to maintain our airports. They sent us a bill that is good.\n  On FEMA, they are not so good. On FEMA, they are doing a bad thing \nover there. They are trying to cut programs that create jobs to pay for \nthese emergencies. That is a whole other deal. But today we have a bill \nfor FEMA that would do the job.\n  I said in my last talk about FEMA and the emergencies that we face: \nIf your neighbor's house is on fire, don't waste time and fight about \nthe cost of the garden hose. You will get that later. Your garden hose \nhelps them, and you feel they are a part owner. You can discuss it \nlater. Get out the garden hose, put out the fire, and everybody is \ngoing to be OK.\n  Playing games with these things is not right. It is beneath the \ndignity of the people of America who think we are a bunch--let me \nrephrase that--who do not rate us very highly. That is an \nunderstatement too. How much lower can you go than 13 percent?\n  I would say this: If we cannot do these bills we do not deserve to be \n13 percent popular. We do not. We have certain basic responsibilities, \nand I am sick and tired of paying for roads and bridges and embassies \nand buildings and everything else in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have \ngiven those people our finest. They have bled, they are still bleeding, \nand they have to take responsibility for their own nation. We have to \ntake responsibility now for our Nation.\n  Time is short. If the Senate does not pass that highway bill, 1.8 \nmillion highway and transit jobs are at risk. If the Senate does not \npass the FAA bill by tomorrow, 70,000 jobs are at stake.\n  We saw what happened. I visited the airports. It was tragic to see \npeople saying: I had no job--because these are all private sector jobs \nmostly. There are some government jobs. For example, the FAA \ninspectors--some of whom paid on their own dime to fly across the \ncountry and inspect some of the projects. God bless them, and we better \npay them for what we did.\n  My understanding is this bill does not do that, but Congressman Mica \nclaims he is going to take care of that. But we are about to do it \nagain over here if Republicans do not come to their senses.\n  In summing up, this is a day for us to make a clear point that \nAmerica has to start taking care of its people. We all read the papers. \nWe know what is happening to the middle class. We know what is \nhappening to the poor. We know what is happening to our roads. We know \nwhat is happening to our bridges. We know our airport system is from \nthe last century. We have to have NextGen. We need to move to a GPS \nsystem, away from a radar system. They say: No, no, no.\n  The message has to go out to the American people. They blame \neverybody, and I don't blame them. But right now it is clear: The \nDemocrats in the Senate want to pass three bills right now. They are \nall very important. One of them is the emergency FEMA bill to pay for \nthese terrible disasters that have been hitting us. Those are \nemergencies, and we need to go ahead and respond.\n  No. 2, a highway bill to fix our deficient bridges, to fix our \nhighways and our roads that are 50 percent deficient. In other words, \nhalf of them are not up to standard. We are living off our \ngrandparents' investments at this point. We have to invest in our \ninfrastructure and all the jobs that come with it.\n  So we have those three bills. FAA and highway have been merged, and \nthen we have the FEMA bill. We are sitting around not voting. \nEverybody, look at this Chamber. No one is here. No voting is taking \nplace because we are the subject of a filibuster, which means a big \nstall.\n  Again, I ask my friends on the other side: Where was your outrage \nwhen we were building roads and highways and bridges and airports in \nIraq and Afghanistan?\n  Where was your outrage about the money?\n  Where was your outrage about cutting something else to pay for that?\n  Where was your outrage?\n  I tell you I never saw it. I never felt it. I never heard it. It is, \nin a way, humiliating for the American people that somehow they are \njust not as important.\n  I am here to tell them they are important. Their jobs are important. \nTheir work is important. America, as an economic leader, is important. \nSo I will be back on the floor to debate any one of my colleagues on \nthe other side who disagree with anything I said--and that is fine.\n  They may disagree. They may defend why they allowed projects to go \nthrough abroad but not here. They may say why they want to cut safety \nprograms from the highway bill that will save lives. By the way, that \ntransportation enhancements program they want to do away with was a \nbipartisan idea that came from Republican John Chafee and Democrat \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan in 1991. That sounds like 20 years to me. \nTwenty years we have had that program.\n  Can we look at it? Can we reform it? Can we make it work better? Of \ncourse.

Every minute this Chamber sits \nidle, let me tell you what happens outside in the real world. This is \nthe fake world out there. In the real world people are calling one \nanother: What are they doing over there? We have a chance to get these \nbills done fast.

Let's get on with the business of taking \ncare of this country: its highways, its bridges, its roads, its \nairports, its emergencies. If they do that maybe we will see the \nAmerican people have a little more faith in us because right now\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nthey have lost faith.

I was listening to the Senator from California \ndescribe how the American taxpayers pay for all kinds of public \nfacilities from utilities to schools to water systems to energy \nproduction in other countries around the world, and according to \nSenator Boxer there is never objection to that from the other side of \nthe aisle. But when the President of the United States wants to do that \nsame kind of construction in the United States of America, there seems \nto be objection. I was taken by that, one, because it is true; second, \nbecause it is pretty unbelievable that when the President decides that \nworking with the Congress--causing the Congress to pass legislation so \nwe can build schools and renovate schools in Michigan or California or \nCleveland or Toledo--that some conservative Members of Congress in both \nHouses say, well, we can't do that even though we want to pay for it by \nclosing the Wall Street tax loopholes, by taking away oil company \nsubsidies, by closing the tax incentives that are in Federal law now \nthat encourage companies to leave Hamtramck or leave Youngstown and go \nto Wuhan or Shanghai.\n  I was on a conference call yesterday with some school principals in \nOhio, a principal from Zanesville, a moderate-sized community in \neastern Ohio, who had been a principal in a nearby rural school \ndistrict some years before, who was talking to me about how important \nschool renovation is. The average school building in the United States \nis 40 years old. We would put so much effort in infrastructure in the \n1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, from Dwight Eisenhower with the \ninterstate system to school superintendents and local taxpayers \nbuilding schools and new water and sewer systems--including all the \ninfrastructure we built in this country after World War II--in a \nbipartisan way to help our country grow. We put people to work doing \nthe construction. We put people to work doing the manufacturing for \nmaterials used in the construction, and putting people to work because \nwe built this infrastructure that the Kroger Company in Cincinnati \nneeds to move its produce and other things for their stores all over \nthe Midwest. It is the kind of infrastructure rebuilding that helps us \nwith economic development.\n  The President was in Columbus 2 days ago talking at Fort Hayes High \nSchool about school construction and how important that is. I was \ntalking to the school principal, who used to work in Maineville, and he \ntold me how several years ago his school building was old and decrepit \nand needed fixing. He also said the test scores were not very good for \nthese students. He said after they built a new school building and put \nthese students in a place that they could learn better, it sent a \nmessage to these students that, yes, we care about education. He said \nthe test scores went up markedly. I said, because of the new building? \nHe said, yes. Uncategorically, he said yes.\n  We tell our young people in this country that education is most \nimportant, and then we send them to schools that don't look good. I \nwonder what students think when we put this premium on education, but \nthen we don't act on it. He and the other principals talked about \nleaking roofs and mold on the walls. They talked about dark and dank \nhallways in auditoriums. They talked about the lack of technology.\n  What the President is trying to do--and what Senator Boxer was \ntalking about, more with aviation and highways, but schools also--when \nhe talks about investing in school renovation, one, it means jobs \nimmediately for carpenters and electricians and plumbers and laborers \nand all kinds of people. It also means jobs immediately for the people \nproducing the steel, the manufacturers, the cement, and the insulation. \nThe biggest insulation plant in the United States of America is in \nNewark, OH. It creates jobs right now but it also means better schools \nfor our kids, and it means long-range economic growth, long-range \nprosperity, and a better environment for us as a country.\n  What troubles me so much, as Senator Boxer said, is we are putting \nmoney into schools and water facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan--and I \nam okay with that if it serves our national interest. I am not okay \nwhen there are no objections to that from conservative politicians, but \nthey object to doing that at home with schools in Chillicothe and \nMansfield and Springfield and Lima and Youngstown and Akron.\n  It is so important to move forward on the school construction and \njobs bill. Mr. President, $1 billion in investment in school \nconstruction and renovation creates about 10,000 jobs. Those 10,000 \njobs are mostly middle-class jobs in manufacturing and the trades \nactually doing the construction and the building. It makes so much \nsense, and I am hopeful as the President goes around the country \nexplaining it--he was in Columbus 2 days ago--that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle decide, yes, maybe we ought to actually focus \non jobs and do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Levin).

Mr. President, the bill we have before us today is a bill \nto fund emergency relief through FEMA for a lot of the emergency \ndisasters our country has experienced over the past 6 months.\n  I don't think there is a large disagreement that we ought to take \ncare of the areas that are the Federal responsibility in the respective \nStates for the extreme weather as well as fire-related tragedies that \nhave been experienced by a multitude of States. However, the question \nis, given where we stand as a country, do we just borrow the money to \ndo that and add it to the debt or is the government running so \nefficiently that we can't cut something else and make a choice about \nhow we pay for it? The bill as brought forward has no pay-for at all. \nIn other words, the assumption is that if we pass this bill, we will go \nand borrow approximately $7 billion more in the international markets.\n  What I would put forward is that we know we have plenty of areas we \ncan cut now that are not effective, not efficient, that are wasteful, \nthat are duplicative, and we would not have to borrow that additional \nmoney. The easiest thing in the world is to spend somebody else's \nmoney. And what we are doing with this bill by not paying for it is \nactually asking our grandchildren to pay for an obligation we have \ntoday.\n  The amendment I have asked to be called up is nearly identical to an \namendment this body passed by a vote of 64 to 36 in April of this year.\n  The Government Accountability Office brought forth a report on \nduplication that showed hundreds of millions of dollars in wasteful \nduplication. This is not the only area we could go, but this is an area \nwe have already agreed as a body is an effective way to pay and save \nmoney. We could easily find $7 billion by eliminating multiple programs \nthat accomplish the same thing. Let me give some examples of what the \nGAO showed.\n\n  The Department of Defense and the VA are both creating new medical \nrecord systems as we speak, both paying for independent contractors \ndoing the same thing. They are going to have intertwined medical \nrecords ultimately. We do not need to set up two different programs. By \ndoing that, we could save a couple of billion dollars, just by having \none program for both VA and DOD.\n  We have multiple contracts, according to the GAO, in terms of \ninteragency and areawide contracts that actually increase our \nprocurement costs, where we could consolidate those and have one \ncontract and actually save money. But we have not done that. That is \nsomething that can be done by the OMB at our direction.\n  The other area which is extremely interesting--and the President has \nalready agreed to this. They are already starting to do it. But we \ncould do it much faster and save a significant amount of money. We \ncould save $150 billion to $200 billion over the next 10 years just by \nconsolidating data centers. We initially had some 500 of those. I think \nwe are up to around 2,000. We had 434 in 1998 and 2,000 Federal data \ncenters in 2010. What everybody knows is we could cut that by about \nhalf, not have any change in the effectiveness, and save about $150 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  This amendment identifies the areas listed in the GAO report and \ninstructs the OMB to find those that are most likely to be achievable \nto come to $7 billion. We have agreed to do this in the past on a \nprevious bill when Senator Warner and I offered this amendment jointly \nto pay for the spending.\n  I can go on with a lot of other areas in terms of wasteful spending. \nI will not. But I make this one plea: In August we left after passing a \ndebt limit increase, the largest debt limit increase we have ever \nincurred in segments, and said we were going to start living within our \nmeans. We have created a supercommittee to find $1.5 trillion over the \nnext 10 years in savings. While they are doing that, if we decide to \npass an emergency supplemental bill for FEMA and do not pay for it, we \nare going to be working in exactly the opposite direction of what we \nsaid we needed to do.\n  The facts are, we are almost schizophrenic. We say we need to cut \nspending. Yet we are going to spend $7 billion more. Yet we do not want \nto find some spending to cut to pay for it; we just want to borrow it. \nYou can understand why very few Americans have confidence in us. On the \none hand we are addressing the problem, and on the other hand we are \nignoring the problem.\n  I think it would behoove the confidence level in this institution if, \nin fact, we tried to pay and found the courage and the willpower to say \nif we are going to spend additional money, we are going to create \npriorities, and we are actually going to eliminate spending somewhere \nelse to be able to pay for this, to be able to do this more important \nthing.\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\n  I have trouble understanding, even when I talk to our colleagues \nprivately, why we would not do this; why we would not pay for this $7 \nbillion by reducing wasteful spending elsewhere.\n  As we go to the vote at 4 o'clock, the question that people ask is, \nWhy was it OK to cut the spending from these departments back in April, \nbut it is not OK to cut the spending now? Sixty-four of our colleagues \nvoted to cut this spending in April. I know several are opposed to \npaying for this, but we are in a new day. We live in a new world.\n  The Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce was here this week. The title of \ntheir meeting was ``New Realities.'' The new reality is that we are \ngoing to run to the end of the time at which we can borrow money or \nafford to pay the interest rate on the money that we can borrow, and \nthe discipline we need is to live within our means.\n  This is one step that will be the right thing to do for future \ngenerations. It is the right thing to do to build confidence in our \ninstitution, and it is the right thing to do to eliminate waste and \nduplication in the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and make a point \nI will talk again on this prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 613\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment \nNo. 613.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 613 to amendment No. 602.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To offset the disaster relief appropriations by rescinding \n                amounts for foreign assistance programs)\n\n       On page 12, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE VI\n\n                                 OFFSET\n\n       Sec. 601. (a) All unobligated balances made available to \n     the United States Agency for International Development for \n     foreign assistance programs for fiscal year 2011 are \n     rescinded.\n       (b) There is rescinded on a pro rata base from the \n     unobligated balances made available to the Department of \n     State for fiscal 2011 an amount equal to the difference \n     obtained by subtracting--\n       (1) the amount rescinded under subsection (a); from\n       (2) the amount appropriated under this division.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this is an amendment to pay for the \nemergency funds. I think for too long in this body we have just simply \nadded on funds, often for good causes, but we keep spending money we do \nnot have. I think the mark of a good legislator is making priorities. \nIf we choose to spend some money on an emergency, we should take the \nmoney from somewhere else in the budget.\n  In this amendment we have proposed to take the money from foreign \naid. When the American people are asked if they think we should be \nsending welfare to other countries or building bridges in other \ncountries when our bridges are falling down in this country, 77 percent \nof them think we should not be sending money overseas when we have \nproblems at home. This amendment would take unspent foreign aid money \nfrom this year and apply it toward the disaster funding. It would also \ntake some unspent money from the State Department.\n  I think it is responsible budgeting. It is essentially taking money \nfrom another area, spending it, and not adding to our debt. There are \nrepercussions to the debt we have. I tell people the debt has a face. \nEvery time we drive to the store our gas prices are rising or our food \nprices are rising. The reason our prices are rising is because we have \nto pay for the debt by printing new money. As we print new money at the \nFederal Reserve to pay for our debt, we diminish the value of the \ndollar so our gas prices rise and our food prices rise.\n  Also, economists have said up to 1 million jobs a year are being lost \nto pay for our debt. What I ask for is, as we pay for these natural \ndisasters we take the money from elsewhere in our budget.\n  I also rise in support of the plea of Senator Coburn not to target \nthe transportation funds. Right now we are asking that highway funds, \n10 percent of them, go to beautification projects--turtle tunnels, \nmovie theaters. In our State of Kentucky, we have a bridge that was \nclosed this week, the Sherman Minton Bridge. Of three bridges in \nLouisville, one of them is closed. Traffic is stacked up for hours and \nyou are telling me we need to have turtle tunnels? Something is \nseriously wrong with government when we are forcing State governments \nto spend 10 percent of their transportation money on turtle tunnels, \nwhite squirrel parks, and movie theaters.\n  Another bridge is needed in the northern part of our State, Brent \nSpense Bridge, where debris from the bridge is falling. Four years ago \nwe had a bridge in Minneapolis that fell into the river and killed 13 \npeople. We, as a nation, need to set our priorities, but I think it is \nincorrect and a real problem that we are telling people they have to \ntake 10 percent of the transportation funds and put them into bike \npaths.\n  I am a bicyclist and I like bike paths as much as anybody. But when \nbridges are falling into a river and a major metropolitan area such as \nLouisville, KY, has one-third of it's bridge capacity closed because \nthe bridge is dangerous to travel on, these are emergency problems.\n  It also buys into what I am talking about with foreign aid. We cannot \nsend welfare to other countries that we do not have. We are not sending \nthem money that is from our savings. We are sending money that we are \nborrowing from China or that we are printing. There are ramifications \nto this debt. We are borrowing money at $40,000 a second. There are \nramifications to this borrowing. It has a face. It is just not an empty \nnumber.\n  When we say our national debt is $14 trillion or that we are adding \n$1.5 trillion to the debt every year, there are ramifications to that, \nand there is a face. The face is unemployment. The face is people \nlosing jobs. We see it in the grocery store with our prices rising. The \ndebt has ramifications.\n  In Europe, we are seeing the end stages of this in some cases. We are \nseeing chaos and rioting in the streets. We had rioting in London \nrecently. We had rioting in Greece, Portugal, Spain. All of these \ncountries are tumbling under a burden of debt, and it has been \npredicted that this is coming to the United States. It is coming soon. \nIt is a contagion of debt that is sweeping the world, and it is all \npyramided upon the U.S. dollar.\n  Once upon a time, banks in Europe held gold as their reserve. They \nnow hold the dollar as reserve. When the dollar tumbles or when we have \ntrouble paying for our debt, there will be massive worldwide problems. \nWe are in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression, \nand there are no signs that any of the policies coming from the White \nHouse are working. In fact, the first stimulus package did not work. \nTwo million more people are out of work since the President came into \noffice. The price of gasoline has doubled. Our debt has been \ndowngraded. We are set to accumulate, under this administration, more \ndebt than all 43 previous Presidents combined. It is not working.\n  Recently, the President came over to a joint session of Congress and \npresented to us the ``son of stimulus''--the son of a stimulus that did \nnot work in the first place. He said we are just going to tax those \nrich people.\n  Rich people hire poor people. Most of us have jobs because rich \npeople hired us. They are talking about adding $400 billion in new \ntaxes on those who make $200,000 a year or more.\n  You say the rich ought to pay their fair share. The rich are paying \nfor the income tax--47 percent of Americans pay no income tax. So half \nof Americans are already paying for all of the income tax. The Bush tax \ncuts actually made the Tax Code more progressive because they dropped \noff more people from the lower end. If we look at those who make more \nthan $200,000 a year, it is 3 percent of the public. They earn 30\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\npercent of the income and pay 50 percent of the income tax.\n  If you are saying the Tax Code needs to be made more fair, it would \nprobably be that we would have to make the Tax Code less progressive.\n  The bottom line is, if I thought it would help people, we could do \nit. It is going to hurt people. The head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice is an objective spokesman who analyzes government. He testified \nbefore the supercommittee yesterday that it would be a mistake to raise \ntaxes. The preponderance of economists say it would be a mistake to \nraise taxes in the middle of a recession. It will lead to more \njoblessness.\n  Pitting one group--class envy--pitting one group against another gets \nus nowhere. Years ago we tried this. We said we will have a special tax \non those who own yachts. Guess who lost their jobs. The men and women \nmaking $40,000 and $50,000 a year lost their jobs. It does not work. It \nis unhealthy. It is not good for America to blame one class of people \nversus the other. We want to lift everyone in America. We want a \nthriving economy. When we lowered tax rates in the 1980s, we had 6 \npercent and 7 percent growth in a year. We are at 1 percent growth and \nwe look like we are headed in the wrong direction. They say the \ndefinition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting a different result.\n\n  This new jobs plan by the President is the ``son of stimulus.'' It is \nthe son of a stimulus that did not work the first time. When we \ncalculate it, it cost $400,000 per job. It did not work. We should not \nbe doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different \nresult.\n  I would say in conclusion that my amendment is the responsible \nbudgetary amendment, and it pays for the new disaster funding. If we \nwish to help people and we think our Federal Government should be \ninvolved with disaster funding, it should be paid for. It should not be \nborrowed from China, and it should not be simply printed up at the \nprinting press. We should pay for it.\n  I urge other Senators to support my amendment which would offset the \ndisaster funding by reducing a corresponding amount from foreign aid, \nthe welfare we give to other nations, many of them rich nations. I \nwould ask serious consideration of it.\n  I would also ask serious consideration of Senator Coburn's proposal \nthat when we have bridges crumbling in our country, we not force States \nto build turtle tunnels, squirrel sanctuaries, and movie theaters. We \nhave crumbling bridges and we need to get this through and we need to \nsay we are not going to force the States to decide to have these \nbeautification projects.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 2887\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to say Senator Reid and I \nhave had several discussions today and we are working to try to resolve \nan impasse we have, but we are not there yet. I wanted to be clear with \nmy colleagues what my intent was, and if we can work the problems out, \nI am happy to try to do that.\n  I have three separate unanimous consent requests I am going to be \nasking for. One will separate the FAA bill, pass it, and send it to the \nHouse. Another will separate the Transportation bill, eliminating the \ntransportation enhancement component of it and send it to the House, \nand another one eliminates the transportation component of the combined \nbill and sends it back to the House. I understand the leader is \nconcerned with those but felt I would exercise my right to offer those \nunanimous consent requests.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2887, the House-passed FAA surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill, and my amendment at the desk \nrelated to a 4-month extension shall be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2887, the House-passed FAA surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill, that the Coburn amendment at the \ndesk related to repealing the 10-percent transportation enhancement \nmandate be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2887, the House-passed \nFAA surface transportation reauthorization bill, that my amendment at \nthe desk related to a 6-month surface transportation extension that \nrepeals the 10-percent transportation enhancement mandate be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by me after consultation with Senator McConnell, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 167, H.R. 2887, the \nSurface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act; that the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the bill be the following: Coburn \namendment regarding transportation enhancements, Paul amendment \nregarding limitation on highway trust funds, and the Paul amendment \nregarding FAA funding levels; that there be up to 2 hours of debate on \nthe amendments, equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, prior to a vote in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted; that there be no amendment in order to any of the amendments \nprior to the votes; that the amendments be subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold; that upon disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended; that there be \nno other amendments, points of order or motions in order to the bill \nother than budget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; \nand the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable.\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time until 4 o'clock be equally divided \nbetween the majority and minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are looking at a FEMA emergency \nsupplemental. There is no doubt this country has sustained a series of \ndisasters that will require Federal support and funding. We have seen \nthem in Alabama, my home State, where we had the worst series of \ntornadoes in history, and some of the most powerful, that completely \ndemolished two-story brick homes with nothing but foundations left. \nLives were lost to an extraordinary degree, and people were injured.\n  We have had floods. We have had fires and droughts around the \ncountry. We have some of that every year, and some of this is unusual. \nSo it is incumbent upon us in Congress to wrestle with that and to try \nto figure out what should be done and how we can best supplement the \ninsurance and State actions and local people's abilities to respond and \nshare a bit of the pain throughout the country.\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n  Since I have been interested in the emergency bill and I have some \nideas, I was surprised we were told it was going to be added to the \nBurma sanctions bill, and it was going to be $6.9 billion. I hadn't had \na chance to know and review and see what those numbers were and whether \nthey were justified. But Majority Leader Reid said we want to move to \nthat. That is what we want to do.\n  Some said--and surely it is not true--that Senator Reid was setting a \ntrap for the Republicans; that he would offer this bill, throw it out \nthere, and he would have extra money in it and we would complain. Then \nhe would say: The Republicans don't love people who have suffered with \na disaster as I love people who have suffered with a disaster. You \ndon't care. You don't want to help people who are hurting. You are not \ngood people. I am a good person. I love them more than you do.\n\n  I hope that is not true. I do not believe it is true. Surely, it is \nnot true. But I will just point this out: that President Obama's \nfunding request for this supplemental that we have seen was for $500 \nmillion in 2011, $4.6 billion for next year, totaling $5.1 billion. \nThat is what the President proposed. But the Senate Democrats' proposal \nthat Senator Reid has moved forward has $804 million in 2011, $6.1 \nbillion in 2012, for a total of $6.9 billion. That is about almost a $2 \nbillion difference.\n  You know they say: That is not much money, just $2 billion. We spend \na lot more money than that around here on all kinds of things, and we \nshouldn't worry about it, Sessions. You are just slowing down the \nemergency bill. It has to go through right now.\n  I just pointed out previously that $2 billion is a lot of money. We \nhave an education budget in my State that is pretty sizable, but the \nbasic general fund budget of Alabama is about $2 billion. We are an \naverage-sized State. We are about one-fiftieth--4 million people--of \nthe United States. So $2 billion is $2 billion. A billion here and a \nbillion there, you are talking about real money. I am just raising a \nquestion. I suggest that this kind of rapid spending, emotional, \npolitical movement of money through this body is why this country has \ngotten into financial trouble. We just increase the pricetag for a bill \nby $2 billion and rush it through and attack anybody who has the \ngumption to stand, such as Senator Tom Coburn, and raise some real \nquestions about it. How much of this can we pay for? Can we pay for it \nall--we probably could and probably should--or pay for part of it so it \nis not borrowed? You see, an emergency in general is debt. When we \ndeclare something an emergency, we are adding to the debt. It means it \nis not under the budget. We have a budget limit, and all spending is \nsupposed to be under our budgetary limit, although we have not had a \nbudget in 2 years. But when we do a supplemental, it does not count \nthat way.\n  I have seen the Presiding Officer be pretty sophisticated in these \nthings. I remember, I was talking to a senior Congressman about an \nemergency bill years ago that was not truly an emergency, and he said: \nWell, Jeff, we need to put it on the emergency supplemental.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: It doesn't count against the deficit.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: I don't know. It just doesn't count.\n  What he meant was it was not part of the budgetary numbers. It was on \ntop of it. It added to the debt in general.\n  We have to be careful about that. We are borrowing now 40 cents of \nevery $1 we spend. That is not a misprint. I am not speaking \nerroneously. Forty cents of every $1 that is spent this year is \nborrowed.\n  Responsible senatorial management requires us to examine the \nlegislation. When we have a bill that is about 40 percent more than the \nPresident asked for, maybe that ought to throw up a red flag around \nhere. Maybe we ought to examine it more closely because every single \npenny that is spent should be spent wisely. There are two areas: Are we \nspending money that is not needed at all--and we have had some of that \nunder emergency spending--or are we spending money that could be spent \nbetter on other problems that arose from the emergency than the \nproblems we are spending it on?\n  I have been to hurricane damages, I have been to flood damages, I \nhave been to tornado damages, drought damages. It is hard to get the \nmoney to the people who truly need it and whom you can justify. This is \nnot just throwing money at something.\n  So we can do a better job of that. Congress needs to be more \ninvolved. I think $2 billion is a lot. We ought to be careful before we \ndo that. Most of the money is not going to get spent until next year, \nby far. Overwhelmingly, 80 percent of it is to be spent next year. I \nbelieve we ought to be taking time to do this right.\n  I would also like to take the opportunity, while I have the floor, to \naddress this morning's hearing in the Budget Committee, on which I am \nthe ranking member. At today's hearing, I emphasized the economic \ndanger our country is facing as a result of the increasing deficit. We \nhad three economists testify. Two of them were selected by our \nDemocratic majority colleagues. We asked whether they agreed that it \nwould be wise to pursue policies that create jobs without creating \ndebt. They all acknowledge that increasing debt is a dangerous thing.\n  We discussed whether we should seek ways to create jobs and growth in \nAmerica without adding to the debt. Wouldn't that be smart? They all \nagreed it would--things such as producing more American energy, \nreducing costly bureaucratic regulations, and instituting growth-\noriented tax reform. All three witnesses said those are good things to \ndo for America.\n  I would say, if we are going to spend $7 billion or $5 billion on an \nemergency, it helps Americans' growth, productivity, and \ncompetitiveness if that money is spent the best possible way, every \npenny of it to help people truly in need and to help increase our \nnational productivity.\n  Those are some of the concerns I have. I just wanted to share those \nthoughts because I think we would have been better off had this bill \ncome through the regular process, we had full testimony from the \nadministration witnesses, from FEMA, which will be handling the money, \nsetting forth in detail where they expect to spend the money, how it is \nneeded, and how they are going to do it in a way that is fair and helps \nthe people in the right way. I do not believe the way this bill is \nmoving is careful enough, and I believe it places at risk the treasury \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a few minutes we are going to be voting \non a bill that has been put on the floor that would address many of the \nemergency disaster needs that have come our way this last year.\n  In my State of South Dakota, it has been a year for the record books. \nWe have had historically cold winters the last couple of winters. We \nhad a historically wet spring and, if you look at the Missouri River \nbasin, unprecedented amounts of runoff, to the point where we had \nflooding on the Missouri River throughout the entire basin, up and \ndown. My State of South Dakota, of course, was impacted dramatically by \nthat, as were many of the States in the basin, and I think, like a lot \nof parts of the country this year that have experienced weather-related \ndisasters, there are a lot of people who have been hurt by that. In my \nState of South Dakota, we have a lot of homeowners in the Pierre and \nFort Pierre area and the Dakota Dunes area and the Yankton area. We \nhave had tremendous wet weather in northeastern South Dakota, and there \nare a lot of people who have been flooded up there.\n  We have people in these areas of my State who literally have lost \neverything--their homes. It was not one of those situations where you \nget an event that comes through, it is gone quickly, and you can go in \nand clean up and recover. In this case, they were floods that persisted \nover long periods of time--in this case months. I remember touring some \nof those areas in my State and in some cases having to go out there \nliterally in a boat to see homes and having to walk into a home in \nwaders because the water in the living room was literally up to my \nwaist.\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nAnd the water was there literally for weeks. There were a lot of black \nmold problems, of course, just a tremendous amount of damage.\n  As I said, in many cases these are people who for various reasons did \nnot have flood insurance, in most cases because they were told they \ndidn't need it, they were not in the flood plain. These were homeowners \nwho, when the Missouri River dams were built, thought, at least, that \nthey were protected by those dams and as a consequence, perhaps, did \nnot purchase flood insurance, with rare exceptions. Of course, in all \nof these cases too there are homeowners who, if they did not have flood \ninsurance, have in some cases lost everything. I am not talking about \njust homeowners who have resources and means, I am talking about \npeople--I met with retired schoolteachers who put everything they had \ninto these homes along the Missouri River, and now they have literally \nlost everything. So I can appreciate how important it is that we do \neverything we can to respond to this enormous weather-related disaster \nthat has come our way.\n  I have great sympathy for those other areas of the country that have \nbeen impacted this year as well. I know that on the east coast, we had \nflooding from the hurricane, and we have had tornadoes this summer that \nhave wiped out parts of entire communities.\n  It has been a very difficult weather year, and as we approach this \nissue of how to deal with that, I think it is important that we bear in \nmind--that we do everything possible to address the needs these \nhomeowners have and try to help them rebuild their lives and put things \nback together.\n  So as we get into this debate, certainly I recognize the importance \nof us having a response. I think that one way or the other, Congress \nwill respond, whether it happens today or in the form of some relief \nthat may be coming over from the House of Representatives. But I \nbelieve it is important that we do that. It is also important, given \nthe budgetary circumstances in which we find ourselves, that we pay for \nit. I think there are a couple of amendments we are going to vote on \nthis afternoon that would accomplish just that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has proposed an amendment which many of us \nhave voted for in the past. I think it got 64 votes here in the Senate, \nboth Republicans and Democrats supporting it. It would do away with \nsome of the duplication we have in our Federal Government.\n  The Government Accountability Office has identified lots of areas of \nduplication. In fact, I think the Senator from Oklahoma has already \ngone through some of those, but I have been here on the floor and \naddressed some of these as well: 56, or thereabouts, programs spread \nacross 10 or so agencies that deal with financial literacy; 82 programs \nthat deal with the issue of teacher training. I think you have to argue \nthat there is plenty of waste and duplication and redundancy in our \nFederal Government, and we ought to be doing everything we can to \neliminate that, particularly if we are looking at prioritizing where we \nspend our tax dollars.\n  In a case such as this, we have people across our country who have \nbeen hurt by these natural disasters who need our assistance. It \nstrikes me, at least, that if we are serious about priorities--and I \nthink all budgets are about priorities--we ought to be able to find \nsome savings in these programs and agencies that have been identified \nby the GAO that would enable us to find the funds that are necessary to \ncover the disaster effort.\n  So I would come down here and speak in support of the Coburn \namendment.\n  I think the Paul amendment as well seeks to use unobligated balances \nfrom USAID, the State Department. Of course, we are getting to the end \nof the year, and if there are funds that have not been obligated, that \nhave not been used, that strikes me as well as a way in which we can \nfind some resources that would help us prioritize and put them where \nthey are really needed right now; that is, to deal with these impacted \ncommunities, these impacted families, these impacted homeowners, and \nhelping them rebuild their lives.\n  But fundamentally, when you have a $1.3, $1.4 trillion annual deficit \nand when you are already at $14 trillion in debt and it is growing at \nthe rate it is, when you have a debt-to-GDP which is literally about 1 \nto 1, about 100 percent--you have to go back to the end of World War II \nto find a time in our Nation's history when we have seen that kind of \ndebt. These deficits to GDP, debt to GDP, spending to GDP are at \nhistoric highs. It strikes me that even for important matters such as \ndisaster relief, we have to be as responsible as we possibly can and \nmake sure we are doing justice to the American taxpayer and not \nspending money we do not have.\n  I think the House of Representatives--and what they intend to do is \naddress this through the continuing resolution which will be coming our \nway sometime next week. Their approach is to put some additional money, \nsupplemental money, into FEMA, into the Corps of Engineers--those \nagencies that are kind of on the front lines in responding to many of \nthese disasters. I hope we have an opportunity to vote on that \nlegislation. That will be paid for. That will be within the budget. \nThat will not be deficit spending or borrowing from our children and \ngrandchildren, adding more to the debt. So I think it is a responsible \nand reasonable way to deal with this, and maybe in the end that is \nwhere this ends up.\n  But the debate we are having today is whether we are going to \nappropriate $6.9 billion, around $7 billion for disaster relief. I \ndon't think we have a full grasp yet of what some of these damages are. \nThe assessments are still coming in. But I think it is important that \nwe be responsible in how we distribute disaster relief, that we know as \nmuch as possible about the full scale and the dimensions of the problem \nand what those damages are and then, secondly, that we do everything we \ncan to find areas in the budget in which we can offset that disaster \nrelief.\n  So I hope we can support the amendments that are before us today. As \nI said before, the Coburn amendment is not something new to the Senate. \nThe Coburn amendment is an amendment many of us have supported in the \npast. Sixty-four Senators--that is a very large bipartisan majority \nhere in the Senate--have supported this amendment to do away with these \nduplicative programs and to try to gain some efficiency and some \nsavings in our Federal Government.\n  It strikes me, at least, that when we are dealing with an issue as \nimportant as disaster relief is to so many Americans, we certainly \nought to be able to prioritize and take some of those duplicative \nprograms and some of those redundant programs we have in the Federal \nGovernment that have been identified by the Government Accountability \nOffice--ask the OMB to identify $7 billion in savings in order to \noffset the costs of what we are doing here with regard to disaster \nrelief.\n  So I am certainly going to support these amendments--and I hope my \ncolleagues will--for a lot of reasons. Again, we need to respond when \nwe have a natural disaster such as this, but we need to do it in a \nresponsible way. And when we are running these massive annual deficits \nwe are running today, we need to do everything we possibly can to see \nthat we are paying the Nation's bills, that we are not adding it to the \ncredit card, not handing the bill to our children and grandchildren, \nnot spending money we do not have, but doing everything we can to live \nwithin our means. It is the responsible way to go about this. In my \nview, it is a reasonable way to go about this. I think it is the right \nway to deal with the Nation's business; that is, to pay your bills. The \nCoburn amendment does that. His amendment, I guess of the two, \nspecifically directs the $7 billion. I am not sure whether the Paul \namendment has a specific score on it. But either would be an important, \nin my view, message to the American people that we are serious about \ngetting our fiscal house in order. So I hope we will have both \nRepublicans and Democrats here in the Senate that would support both of \nthose amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n                          Farm Dust Regulation\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I rise today to actually extend an invitation. The \ninvitation I extend is to our EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson. The \nreason for the invitation is very straightforward. There is a lot of \nconfusion about EPA's position on regulating farm dust. It is \nremarkable. The Administrator says one thing, but then the agency takes \na different position--back and forth, back and forth it has gone.\n  Administrator Jackson said, and I am using her words, ``It is a myth \nthat EPA is proposing to regulate farm dust.'' That seems pretty clear, \nbut then her agency says: Well, no, we cannot distinguish between farm \ndust and other dust subject to regulation, so rural America is not off \nthe hook, it is out of luck.\n  Well, I was very pleased recently to offer a solution to this EPA \ndilemma. My solution was offered in partnership with my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Chuck Grassley, and others actually from \nboth sides of the aisle. We proposed a simple solution to this \nconfusion. We proposed legislation that--very straightforward--says: \nEPA cannot regulate farm dust unless there is scientific proof that it \ncauses harm.\n  That proof does not exist today. Meanwhile, Ms. Jackson and her \nagency continue to have problems getting this story straight. You see, \nshe scoffs at the idea of regulating farm dust, and then her agency \nturns around and says: Well, it is really a possibility.\n  I understand that sometimes the direction from the top can get \nmuddled as it works its way down. After all, EPA is a very large \norganization.\n  Surely, Administrator Jackson does not intend to be saying one thing \nwhile her agency is saying and potentially doing something quite \ndifferent. So I am hopeful I have come up with yet another solution.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to Administrator Jackson. \nWe have invited her to publicly support our bill blocking the \nregulation of farm dust. After all, using her own word, this was a \n``myth'' in the first place. I think it is a perfect solution. She says \nEPA has no intention of regulating farm dust, so there is absolutely no \nreason why she would not support this legislation that makes it \nofficial. My letter invites her to put her words into action by issuing \na straightforward supportive statement. I look forward to hearing back \nfrom her or simply seeing her statement of support in print. Either \nwill be acceptable.\n  I will tell you this: I believe if Administrator Jackson stands up in \nresponse to this and says, yes, I was serious, we are not going to \nregulate farm dust, that is a myth, and Senator Johanns has it all \nwrong, I believe rural America will cheer.\n  Supporting my bill that puts an end to this crazy, ridiculous notion \nof regulating farm dust would do more to improve Administrator \nJackson's image than the charm offensive EPA has recently undertaken.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Deficit Reduction\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I understand that a couple of our \ncolleagues are on their way, and I will yield to them if they get here \nas expected.\n  In the meantime, I wish to share some thoughts with the Senate about \nthe very complex and difficult duty we all now face, which is to agree \nto legislation that will reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 billion \nover the next decade. And, if we fail to do that, by the end of the \nyear, huge automatic budgets in vital national programs, including in \nsecurity, will take effect to meet the deficit reduction goal. Those \nautomatic cuts would take an unacceptable toll on vital programs. I \nbelieve every Member of Congress must do their best to avoid that \noutcome, and that begins with the 12 members of the Joint Select \nCommittee who have been given the assignment of crafting a plan for us \nto consider.\n  Despite the difficulty, the task is achievable. We can reach our \ndeficit reduction targets and help ensure fiscal stability while \navoiding not only the damaging automatic cuts but also avoiding \ndevastating cuts to defense, health, education, and other programs \nvital to America and to its families. Achieving this goal will require \nsacrifices. Everyone is going to have to contribute. But if all of us, \nevery American, will make the sacrifices necessary, we can get this \ndone.\n  How can we do it? Well, we could pretend we can resolve this problem \nby ignoring why we got here to try to balance the budget by simply \ncutting more spending or we can take a realistic look at both spending \nand revenues. We need to take a realistic look at both spending and \nrevenue. A little historical perspective might be helpful.\n  Federal revenues today are at the lowest share of gross domestic \nproduct in generations, just 14.9 percent. For the past 60 years, that \nnumber has averaged about 18 percent, and during that period we have \nbalanced the budget five times, and each time revenues totaled 19 \npercent of gross domestic product or higher.\n  Past efforts to reduce high deficits have made new revenue a \nsignificant part of the equation. President Reagan presided over three \ndeficit reduction plans that achieved more than three-quarters of their \ndeficit reduction through revenue increases. That was President Reagan. \nRevenue increases were a major part of his deficit reduction plan. The \ndeficit reduction legislation that we passed in 1990 under the first \nPresident Bush achieved about one-third of its deficit cuts through \nadded revenue. President Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction plan was \nroughly 55 percent new revenue and 45 percent spending cuts and yielded \nour most recent balanced budgets.\n  Apart from history, the mathematical reality simply is that we must \ngenerate additional revenues. If we are going to reduce the deficit and \ndo so while avoiding unacceptable cuts to programs that provide for the \ncommon defense and general welfare, revenue must be part of the \ndiscussion.\n  Many of our Republican colleagues have focused solely on nondefense \ndiscretionary programs for deficit reduction. The simple fact is those \nprograms are not big enough to allow real deficit reduction. They make \nup only about 12 percent of the Federal budget. If we eliminated all \nthose programs, zeroed them out, we would have done grave harm to \nmillions of American families, but we still would have huge deficits as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  So as the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group, said: For a grand \nbargain on deficit reduction, finding a way to bring in some revenue is \na crucial piece of the puzzle.\n  The nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget said that \nputting the deficit on a downward path requires looking at ways to \ngenerate additional revenues.\n  In the balance of my remarks I set out seven different loopholes \nwhich need to be closed. It is only fair that these loopholes be \nclosed. They are loopholes which cannot be justified. They are \nloopholes which I think almost every American would say should not be \nin our Tax Code. If we simply will change our Tax Code and reform it \nand close these loopholes, we can raise about $1 trillion over 10 \nyears. That is a huge part of what this Joint Select Committee is \nrequired to do.\n  We have to protect middle-class families from tax increases. We have \nto protect them from losing critically important programs, such as \neducation. We can do that. I have sent a letter to the members--\nincluding my dear friend from Massachusetts--of our select committee \nlaying out the seven loopholes which can, and should, be closed which \nwill have an equitable impact. It is only fair these loopholes be \nclosed, and I have laid out including the use of offshore tax havens to \navoid paying taxes. In this letter that went to all the members of this \nJoint Select Committee, I have set forth what these loopholes are.\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\n  So revenue needs to be part of the joint select committee's agenda. \nOur deficit reduction plans will require sacrifice not just from \nmiddle-class families but from the corporations and upper income \nAmericans who have done very well in recent years even as middle-class \nincomes have stagnated. In fact, from 1980 to 2008, the share of all \nU.S. income going to the top 1 percent of Americans more than doubled, \nfrom 10 percent to 24 percent. I make my proposals with that troubling \nfact in mind. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to \nthe members of the Joint Special Committee be included in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n  The letter identifies seven possible steps to eliminate wasteful tax \nexpenditures and loopholes so as to share the burden of deficit \nreduction more broadly. As I say in the letter, ``Those measures would \nnot only reduce the deficit, but also render the federal tax system \nmore fair to the millions of honest Americans who pay their taxes.'' \nEach is practical and doable, each achieves real deficit reduction, and \neach protects the programs that defend our nation and support middle-\nclass families without increasing the tax burden on the investments \nthat help our economy grow.\n  I plan in the coming days to lay out these ideas in more detail, but \nto explain them briefly.\n  The first two proposals would close two kinds of unjustified \nloopholes that benefit corporations and wealthy individuals at the \nexpense of working families: offshore tax shelter abuses that cost \nAmerican taxpayers billions of dollars a year and a loophole that \nforces American taxpayers to subsidize the stock options that \ncorporations grant to their executives.\n  The third and fourth would close two Wall Street tax loopholes, the \n``carried interest'' loophole that forces Americans to subsidize the \npaychecks of hedge fund managers, and a derivatives blended tax rate \nloophole that promotes speculation in futures and options, favoring \nderivatives over long-term investments that boost economic growth.\n  The fifth and six would promote tax fairness and ensure shared \nsacrifice in reducing the deficit by restoring upper bracket income tax \nrates and capital gains tax rates to rates closer to historic norms.\n  The seventh is an administrative change, eliminating the use of paper \ntax liens and creating an electronic database of those liens.\n  I will discuss these changes in more detail in the days ahead, but \nlet me emphasize today the role they can play in deficit reduction. \nCombined, these common-sense changes could reduce our deficits by $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years--a sum that would make the committee's \ndifficult goal, one the Congress and the entire government share, much \nmore achievable.\n  For Republicans, adopting some of these ideas will be difficult. I \nwould say, in empathy and not in anger: Welcome to the club. The \nspending cuts that will be necessary for significant deficit reduction \nwill be difficult as well. They will hurt real American families, in \nreal ways, and they will damage programs that are at the core of my own \nparty's philosophy about the important role of government in helping to \ncreate shared prosperity. Democrats will have to compromise on these \ncuts. Republicans will also have to compromise, and accept the reality \nthat revenue must be part of the equation, if we are to do our duty.\n  The ideas I have proposed, and will discuss in more detail in the \ndays ahead, outline a path toward such a compromise. It is a fair path. \nIf Republicans are willing to embrace compromise, we can reduce our \ndeficit while helping to protect middle-class families from further \neconomic harm. If Republicans are not willing to compromise, the \nautomatic cuts involved in sequestration that would be forced upon the \nAmerican people will make our country less safe and the livelihoods of \nour families less secure. I hope my proposals will help us work \ntogether to avoid that tragic outcome.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of the letter which I sent to the members of that Joint \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 15, 2011.\n     Hon. Patty Murray\n     Hon. Max Baucus\n     Hon. John Kerry\n     Hon. Jon Kyl\n     Hon. Rob Portman\n     Hon. Pat Toomey\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling\n     Hon. Xavier Becerra\n     Hon. David Camp\n     Hon. James Clyburn\n     Hon. Fred Upton\n     Hon. Chris Van Hollen\n       Dear Members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \n     Reduction: As you work to construct a proposal to reduce the \n     federal budget deficit and ensure long-term fiscal stability \n     for our government, I urge you to eliminate wasteful tax \n     expenditures and loopholes and restore more balance to the \n     tax code. These measures would not only reduce the deficit, \n     but also render the federal tax system more fair to the \n     millions of honest Americans who pay their taxes.\n       Here are seven tax reforms that could together raise over \n     one trillion dollars to reduce our federal deficits.\n       (1) Target Offshore Tax Abuses. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse \n     Act (S. 1346) would combat offshore tax abuses. It contains \n     more than a dozen provisions to shut down offshore tax \n     loopholes and expose offshore tax cheats, including measures \n     to penalize offshore financial institutions and jurisdictions \n     that impede U.S. tax enforcement; stiffen penalties on aiders \n     and abettors of tax evasion; shift the burden of proof \n     establishing who controls an offshore entity; stop companies \n     managed and controlled in the United States from claiming \n     foreign status; treat U.S. deposits and investments by \n     offshore subsidiaries of U.S. parent corporations as taxable \n     repatriated income; and treat credit default swap payments \n     made from the United States to offshore recipients as taxable \n     U.S. source income.\n       (2) End the Corporate Stock Option Loophole. The Ending \n     Excessive Corporate Deductions for Stock Options Act (S. \n     1375) would eliminate a corporate loophole that currently \n     gives special tax treatment to corporations that pay their \n     executives with stock options. Stock options are the only \n     type of compensation which, due to a special method for \n     calculating the tax deduction, often allows corporations to \n     deduct more than the compensation expense shown in their \n     books. The latest data available shows that, over a five-year \n     period, from 2005 to 2009, corporate stock option tax \n     deductions as a whole exceeded corporate stock option book \n     expenses by $12 to $61 billion each year, forcing ordinary \n     taxpayers to subsidize tens of billions of dollars in \n     excessive executive pay tax deductions. Closing this loophole \n     would end this unfair tax subsidy of corporate executive \n     compensation.\n       (3) End the Carried Interest Loophole. Under current law, \n     hedge fund and private equity fund managers treat certain \n     income received from managing investments as ``carried \n     interest'' taxable at the lower, long-term capital gains \n     rate, instead of ordinary income tax rates. That income is \n     not, however, a return on a capital investment made by the \n     fund managers with their own money, but is instead \n     compensation for work performed for other investors. Closing \n     this loophole and treating carried interest as ordinary \n     income would end an unfair taxpayer subsidy of this Wall \n     Street income.\n       (4) End the Derivatives Blended Rate Loophole. Under \n     current law, profits from some derivative trades are taxed at \n     a ``blended rate'' comprised of part capital gains and part \n     ordinary income, even in the case of derivatives held for \n     minutes. This special tax treatment, enacted in 1981, favors \n     derivatives like futures over stocks, and encourages bets on \n     derivatives over direct capital investments that are key to \n     economic growth. Closing this tax loophole would put a stop \n     to that market distortion.\n       (5) Restore Reagan-Era Capital Gains Rates. In recent \n     years, tax rates have been repeatedly lowered for capital \n     gains derived from stock, bonds, and derivative transactions \n     compared to income derived from the salaried work performed \n     by most Americans. Despite the fact that capital gains rates \n     currently range between 0% and 15%, our economy has little to \n     show for it in the way of increased investment or other \n     economic benefits. At the same time, these lower rates have \n     greatly increased the deficit. While long-term investments \n     should receive some degree of favorable treatment, restoring \n     capital gains rates to Reagan-era levels in line with \n     ordinary income rates--as several bipartisan deficit \n     reduction proposals have suggested--would not only make the \n     federal tax system more fair, but also end a tax expenditure \n     costing hundreds of billions of dollars over ten years.\n       (6) Restore Upper Income Tax Brackets. Today, the \n     wealthiest one percent of Americans take home 24 percent of \n     all U.S. income, the highest percentage since the Great \n     Depression. Yet, just a few decades ago, that number was \n     below 10 percent. Rather than have their share of the tax \n     burden go up accordingly, the wealthiest few have had their \n     tax rates lowered several times. Our economy has not grown as \n     a result of this special treatment, but our deficit has. \n     Restoring ordinary income rates on those earning over \n     $250,000 would reduce our deficit by hundreds of billions of \n     dollars over the next 10 years while restoring balance to the \n     tax code.\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\n       (7) Eliminate Paper Tax Liens. The Tax Lien Simplification \n     Act (S. 1390) would create an electronic federal tax lien \n     registry, available to the public at no cost, in place of the \n     current antiquated system requiring federal tax liens to be \n     filed on paper in 4,000 locations across the country. This \n     simple, good government bill would save administrative costs, \n     while expediting the removal of tax liens and freeing up an \n     entire IRS division to tackle the collection of unpaid taxes \n     that pose an unfair burden on honest taxpayers.\n       These common sense proposals, if enacted, would \n     significantly reduce the federal deficit, while removing \n     economic distortions from the marketplace and ending unfair \n     tax expenditures and loopholes that disadvantage average \n     taxpayers. Thank you for your consideration of these \n     proposals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I use.\n  Let me, first of all, thank the Senator from Michigan, the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, for his comments and particularly for \nthe recommendations that he is going to make to the supercommittee, to \neach of us. I think all of us in the Senate know Senator Levin is one \nof the most creative and thoughtful Senators. I am confident that the \nsuggestions he makes are going to be important ones that are going to \nbe worthy of consideration.\n  I know also, because it is something I began to focus on back in the \n1980s, this issue of offshore havens is absolutely staggering. I look \nforward to this. I know the Senator has led the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations on that. They have done outstanding work. I am \nconfident that a lot of that work can be certainly put on the table, \nand it ought to be seriously considered. My hope is we can do something \nabout it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 613\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, one of the amendments we will vote on \nshortly is an amendment by Senator Rand Paul with respect to cutting--\nor an offset, if you will--of $6.9 billion from the State Department \nand USAID in order to fund FEMA disaster relief programs.\n  First of all, a number of colleagues have come to the Senate floor \nover the last couple of days and talked about the principle that has \ngoverned our efforts to provide disaster assistance through all of the \nyears of this institution. We do not know how to plan on the amounts. \nWe do not hold people accountable to other programs because of acts of \nGod, natural disasters that arise suddenly, and the Nation has always \nbeen rich enough and responsible enough to guarantee that we provide \nassistance to communities that have been hard hit by a flood, by a \ntornado, ravaged by fires--by some natural disaster.\n  I think the notion that suddenly we are going to start offsetting at \na time when we are engaged in a very delicate balance of offsets with \nrespect to the regular budgeting process is to try to put in place an \ninappropriate principle at an inappropriate time.\n  That argument has been made considerably. I want to talk for a minute \nabout the merits of this particular proposal on its face. Let me make \nas clear as I can that this amendment would be absolutely devastating \nto our foreign aid and development programs. It would decimate agencies \nthat have already taken huge funding cuts in fiscal year 2011, and it \nwould completely undermine core national security priorities and \nhumanitarian commitments.\n  Senator Paul argues that foreign aid is ``welfare we give to other \nnations, many of which are rich nations.'' I disagree with both parts \nof that sentence, and I disagree profoundly with the notion that \nforeign aid is somehow welfare.\n  Foreign aid is an investment in our national security; it is not a \ngift to other countries. It is a very small investment that provides an \nenormous return in so many different ways in terms of advancing the \ninterests of our country, of our citizens. Because of foreign aid in \nmany parts of the world we have relationships, and we have programs, we \nhave initiatives, joint ventures that make Americans safer every single \nday. We need to put politics aside and focus on concrete facts.\n  I know the easiest thing in the world is to walk into a big townhall \nmeeting and say we ought to be building in--whatever the community you \nare in--before we send money somewhere else, and everybody cheers. \nThere is an instant reaction--easy applause, easy politics, but not \nsmart politics in terms of the interests of our country.\n  The fact is all of our foreign aid programs, all of our foreign \npolicy initiatives, all in the State Department, everything we do in \nUSAID, all the things we do from sending a diplomat to Baghdad or \nPakistan or Afghanistan, every effort we make to help reverse the \nglobal HIV/AIDS epidemic, all of the things our State Department \nengages in make up barely 1 percent of the annual budget.\n  So often when we go out to those townhalls that are ready to applaud \nthe idea of just giving the money here, we ask people: How much do you \nthink we give in foreign aid? And people say: Oh, my God, it is 50 \npercent of our budget or 10 percent or 5 percent. It is none of those. \nIt is barely 1 percent.\n  We spend about $700 billion on our military. By contrast, the \ninternational affairs budget in its entirety is less than one-tenth of \nthe Pentagon's. A former Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, pointed out, \nI think only a year or so ago, that if we took the entire Foreign \nService roster we could barely crew one aircraft carrier in the U.S. \nNavy.\n  I understand we face a budget crisis in our own country. Obviously, I \nunderstand that. We are working hard to address this issue in the new \ncommittee that has been formed by the Congress. But if we cut these \nfunds now, I guarantee my colleagues we will pay a much stiffer price \nlater for increased threats to our national security, for loss of \nopportunity, for loss of business, for graver crises, all of which will \ncome as a result of America pulling back.\n  I remind Senators our foreign policy and development programs have \nalready been cut to the bone. The final fiscal year 2011 spending \nagreement cut $6.5 billion from the international affairs budget. That \nis a 10-percent cut. How many agencies took a 10-percent cut? It \nhappens to also be a 15-percent cut from the President's request.\n  At a time that we are fighting a war in Afghanistan, when we are \nmanaging turmoil in the Middle East, when we are trying to guarantee \nthat in Egypt, which we have encouraged to have an uprising, which we \nhave celebrated for its reach for democracy and for freedom, at a time \nwhen it is trying to do it, are we going to pull the rug out from under \nthem and say: Go ahead Muslim brotherhood, its pickings are all for \nyou?\n  It doesn't make any sense at a time when we are coping with \nunprecedented famine in the Horn of Africa, millions of people starving \nto death, a global tragedy that challenges the morality of our Nation--\nit would be unbelievably extreme and irresponsible to take the approach \nthat Senator Paul's amendment takes. It would jeopardize our national \nsecurity in several important ways. Let me just name a few \nspecifically.\n  First of all, it would threaten the State Department and USAID's \nability to serve as a critical partner to the military in postconflict \nsituations. For instance, in Afghanistan we are working hand in hand, \nState Department and Defense Department, in order to be able to \ntransition to the Afghan forces. This would put those troops at risk, \nput that effort at risk. I think it would raise serious questions about \nthe viability of what we are trying to accomplish.\n  We are at a critical juncture in those efforts to stabilize \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. Cutting our aid to those countries will \nimpact our military operations. For all of those Senators who want to \nget out of Afghanistan faster, we pull the aid out from underneath it, \nand we may be getting out in a way we do not want to, or we will make \nit longer before we get out in the way that we do want to.\n  I suggest respectfully Senator Paul said he would ``much rather send \n. . . professors around the world than . . . our soldiers.'' I don't \nknow an American who would not rather do that. We all hope that can \nhappen as soon as possible. But we cannot just ordain it by saying: \nHere it is, here is what we are doing, and change the situations on the \nground. The wish does not become the father to the fact in those \nsituations.\n  As we have seen in recent days with the attack on our embassy in \nKabul, there is a lot of work to be done in Afghanistan before our \ncollege deans can\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\ntake over from our district support teams.\n  This cut would set back progress in creating markets for U.S. goods \nand services. Here we are struggling to create jobs in the United \nStates. One of the best opportunities for jobs is export--export to the \nnew, emerging middle classes of India, Brazil, Korea, Mexico, China, \nother places. We want to sell them those products. But if all of a \nsudden we are pulling back our ability to marshal opportunities in \nthose markets, if we reduce the ability of the U.S. businesses to get \nthose opportunities, we diminish our own efforts to strengthen our \neconomy.\n\n  We don't just face a budget deficit crisis, we also face a jobs \ndeficit. In the face of global competition, our growth in our exports \nis directly tied to our ability to create new American markets. Money \nwe spend helping to stabilize emerging economies has an amazing impact \non our own economy, and that has been proven for all the years, \ncertainly, since the end of World War II.\n  The Paul amendment would also lead to a $1 billion cut in our battle \nagainst global AIDS. PEPFAR, the President's program on which George \nBush--President George Bush, Republican--worked with us on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, a program Senator Helms and Senator Frist and I \nand others originally developed, a program that currently supports 3.5 \nmillion people on lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, a reduction this size \nto 2011 funds would mean that around 1 million people would be thrown \noff of those treatments, dramatically reducing the numbers of lives \nsaved through this program.\n  We are a country that has prided ourselves on our willingness to live \nour values. The Judeo-Christian ethic is one of charity and one of \nconcern for the poor, the downtrodden, the sick, and so forth. It is \nhard for me to understand how we can take an ethic of our private lives \nthat everybody talks about so pronouncedly around here and look at the \nfact that there are some folks in America who tithe 10 percent of their \nincome, or others who give a fixed percentage of their income in order \nto help the world, and here we are, as a matter of national policy, \ngoing to put 1 million people at risk from a program we are currently \nsaving lives on? I don't understand that kind of value system.\n  It would derail our efforts to forestall famine in the Horn of \nAfrica, and that would trigger long-lasting suffering and destabilize \nthe neighboring countries such as Yemen, Kenya, and Somalia. In Somalia \nalone approximately 3.2 million people are in need of immediate \nlifesaving assistance, a half million children are acutely \nmalnourished, and more than 29,000 children under the age of 5 have \ntragically died.\n  This planet knows how to feed people. Rich countries have an \nobligation to try to do that. Our obligation is de minimis. We should \nnot come in here installing a new principle all of a sudden, for the \nfirst time ever, saying we have to offset money to pay for emergency \nassistance to our communities at the expense of young kids who are \nstarving in another part of the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize this amendment is not the right \nway to approach this. It would have a negligible impact on our budget \ndeficit, and its real impact on our security would be enormous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know the vote has been scheduled, but I ask unanimous \nconsent 2 minutes be provided prior to the amendment votes and 4 \nminutes prior to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, how much time before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to speak, if I could, before the time is out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, in a few minutes, because the two \namendments have been debated extensively this afternoon, I want to \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for his strong objection to one of \nthe amendments and the eloquent way he expressed the feelings of so \nmany of us who will be voting with Senator Kerry against the Paul \namendment.\n  Let me put this up, as I have been using this all week. The \nunderlying bill we will be voting on in a few minutes will give the \nSenate the opportunity to vote for disaster relief now. It is the only \nvehicle available to us in the Senate to vote for relatively full \ndisaster relief for the year 2012 now. I want people to realize, as \nthey are considering how they are going to vote, we received 61 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand we are out of time. I will speak later. \nAgain, it gives us an opportunity to vote for disaster relief now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back the time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 133 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kohl\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are \n45. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                         Paul Amendment No. 613\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate on the Paul amendment No. 613. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nadditional 1 minute for Senator Lindsey Graham to speak on his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my State was devastated by Hurricane \nIrene, and I am going to do everything possible to help Vermonters get \nthe aid they need. But I strongly oppose the amendment offered by the \njunior Senator from Kentucky.\n  First, it is a terrible idea to cut critical national security \nprograms to offset funding for emergency disasters. It would set a \nprecedent and make it infinitely harder to help our States cope with \nthese crises, whether it is Katrina or whether it is earthquakes or no \nmatter what it is.\n  Disasters strike unexpectedly. The funding to recover and rebuild is \nnot built into the budget. They strike Republican and Democratic States \nalike. To say in this: Well, why don't we cut out our State Department \nor our embassies, so we cut out the aid the United States gives to \nHaiti--we live in a global economy--this amendment makes no sense.\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  This is very important. We are broke at home, and there are a lot of \nthings we could and should be doing for our States. I want to try to \nget our fiscal house in order, but we have to defend this country. The \nforeign operations account is national security in another form. If you \njust do not always want to bomb people, you need to help people help \nthemselves, and the money in this account will allow people to stand up \nagainst terrorism and do things America has been doing for a long time; \nthat is, helping people who really would be better off for the \nexperience and have a kindness toward us.\n  If you think Israel needs a friend now, this would hurt our \nrelationship in terms of support to Israel. So all of those in this \nbody who want to make sure Israel gets the right message at a time of \nneed, please vote against this amendment because it will hurt our \nrelationship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I think we ought to make just one \nclarification of fact. Israel gets all their foreign aid in the \nbeginning of the year. They get it differently than any other country. \nThis amendment will not affect any funding to Israel. This funding will \ntake away a percentage. It is about 10 percent of foreign aid.\n  Foreign aid or welfare is opposed by 77 percent of Americans. Even if \nyou thought it was a good idea to give welfare to foreign countries, \nyou do not have it. So you are borrowing this money from China or you \nare printing it up and you are adding to the debt. Our country faces a \ndebt crisis. We are borrowing $40,000 a second. I think it is unwise, \nwhen bridges are falling down and being closed in Louisville, KY, to \nsend money to other countries, particularly money we are borrowing and \nprinting.\n  I urge the support of my amendment to eliminate the 10 percent of \nforeign aid. I think it is a very reasonable proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Paul amendment No. 613.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Heller).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 20, the nays are \n78. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before I recite the unanimous consent request that I hope \nwill be approved, what we intend to do is have a vote on final passage \nof the joint resolution now before us, 10 minutes of debate, there will \nbe votes on two amendments and then final passage. So we have four more \nvotes and we should be finished.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to everyone. You will note in my \nlast two speeches I made before the Senate yesterday and today, I said \na lot of nice things about Republicans, the reason being that is how we \nhave accomplished a lot. We got a decent bill from the House and we \nhave been able to move forward on this legislation.\n  The Republican leader and I had quite a long conversation here in the \nwell. We have a lot of work to do, but we want to do it together. So \nthe cooperation we have had this week by both Democrats and Republicans \nhas been extremely important.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2887\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by me, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 167; that the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the bill be the following, the text \nof which are at the desk: Paul regarding limitation of highway trust \nfund; Paul regarding FAA funding levels; that there be up to 10 minutes \nof debate on the amendments and the bill to be equally divided between \nSenators Paul and the majority leader or their designees, prior to \nvotes in relation to the amendments in the order listed; that there be \nno amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes; \nthat the amendments be subject to a 60-vote threshold; that upon \ndisposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the \npassage of the bill, as amended, if amended; that there be no other \namendments, points of order or motions in order to the bill other than \nthe budget points of order and the applicable motion to waive; that the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nurging the Senate to adopt this resolution and replenish the disaster \nrelief fund without further delay.\n  To so many people struck by disaster this year, this fund is a life \npreserver to help carry them over until they can get back on their feet \nand begin the long, hard road to recovery. Without assistance from this \nfund, many disaster survivors would have no place to live due to \ndamaged and exposed homes; critical commuting routes would remain \nimpassable; and debris would mar communities and morale for months on \nend.\n  We are not just talking about a few disaster areas. This year seems \nlike a record for major disasters, affecting all parts of our country. \nNearly every State has sought and received assistance, which is why the \nfund is now perilously low. It has dwindled to about $377 million. At \nthis rate, Senate appropriators say the fund may last for just days.\n  As I speak, wildfires are still blazing through drought stricken \ncentral Texas. The worst wildfire in Texas history closed area schools \ndown last week, 1,500 homes were destroyed in hundreds of fires, and \ntens of thousands of acres have been scorched.\n  My home State of Connecticut was among those affected when Hurricane \nIrene swept ashore at the end of August, bringing gale force winds and \ntidal surges that knocked out power for days in many areas, damaged \nmillions of dollars worth of property, and left whole communities under \nwater. And when Irene struck, it didn't just touch down in one State or \ntwo. It sideswiped practically the entire eastern seaboard from North \nCarolina to Maine.\n  In Connecticut alone, the early preliminary and therefore probably \nlow estimates of damage from this single disaster are around $300 \nmillion.\n  These major calamities only take us back to the last week of August.\n  In June and July, record flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers displaced thousands of people and ravaged land throughout the \nWest and Midwest.\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\n  A string of tornadoes ripped through the Southeast and Midwest in \nApril, killing hundreds of people, destroying countless homes and \nbusinesses and costing billions of dollars. A third of Joplin, MO, was \nwiped out, and that community continues to struggle to rebuild.\n  In February, the Midwest and Northeast were buried under 2 feet of \nsnow.\n  That is not an exhaustive list, but the point is that these disasters \nhave been equal opportunity ravagers, affecting almost every State in \nthe Union this year. In fact, the President has declared this year a \nstate of emergency in 47 States! Only Nevada, West Virginia, and \nMichigan have been spared.\n  So the replenishment of the disaster relief fund should not divide us \nalong partisan lines. Nor should it divide us among geographic lines, \nor city versus rural lines. This fund has been tapped by almost every \none of our States, and I know that the people of Connecticut were \nrelieved when they learned that the Federal Government would help them \nget their lives back on track. I suspect the citizens of every other \nState that received disaster relief funds were similarly grateful.\n  Frankly, it doesn't really matter if 2 States or 47 States have been \ndeclared disaster areas. Helping people in need is what our Government \ndoes. The whole point of a federal government is to handle challenges \nthat individual States, much less individual communities, cannot. The \ndefense of our Nation is first and foremost among these Federal \nresponsibilities, but so is providing aid to people and States \nfollowing a natural or man-made disaster that takes as heavy a toll as \nthis year's disasters have.\n  Congress has a long history of supplementing the disaster relief fund \nto cover those in need. From 2003 to 2010, $12.3 billion was \nappropriated through the regular appropriations process. But six times \nthat much--$73.4 billion--was appropriated through supplemental \nfunding.\n  It should be noted that only a small part of the administration's \nrequest seeks supplemental funding. The bulk of the request is for \nfiscal year 2012, and the aid requested constitutes disaster relief \nwithin the meaning of the Budget Control Act, which allows \ndiscretionary spending levels to be raised up to a certain limit--a \nlimit that is not breached by the administration's request.\n  Already FEMA has had to start prioritizing its relief activities so \nthat those in most immediate need can be assisted. In other words, \nlonger term recovery projects not yet in the FEMA pipeline have been \nput on hold. That is how low the reserves are in the disaster recovery \nfund.\n  Current and future survivors will continue to receive assistance to \nhelp replace or repair damages to property or cover other personal \nlosses. States will also continue to receive reimbursement for debris \nremoval, emergency response and protective measures, and other critical \nneeds. But FEMA has essentially had to begin rationing aid. That is \njust plain wrong. The people who suffer in one disaster are no more or \nless entitled to aid than those who suffer in another disaster. We are \na humane country, not a selectively humane country.\n  As I said when I toured flooded homes on the Connecticut shore 2 \nweeks ago, the Federal Government does not default on its obligations--\nwhether we are talking about debts to foreign nations or promised aid \nto its own citizens in need, through no fault of their own.\n  I have faith my colleagues will come together across party lines, as \nwe have done so many times in the past, to replenish FEMA's disaster \nrelief fund, which was designed to help make people whole again after \nmajor disasters.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we soon will vote on a measure that \nincludes two significant pieces of legislation. I support passage of \nboth--one that upholds our duty to assist Americans coping with natural \ndisasters, and one that upholds our duty as Americans to speak out \nagainst oppression and abuse around the world.\n  The first measure provides emergency supplemental funding for \ndisaster relief and recovery efforts. Congress must do its job to \nappropriate emergency funding for disaster response and recovery \nquickly and thoughtfully, as we have done numerous times in the past. I \nwill vote for this measure because the $6.9 billion in emergency \nsupplemental funding for disaster relief and recovery is necessary to \nhelp families and businesses bounce back from catastrophic loss, to \nrebuild damaged infrastructure, to respond to emergencies, to restore \nforests and watersheds damaged by disaster, and to improve flood \ncontrol structures. Importantly, this legislation does not set the bad \nprecedent of requiring an offset in order to help communities and \nfamilies when disaster strikes.\n  The second measure would renew sanctions against Burma by extending \nthe import restrictions put in place under the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003.\n  While the Burmese government has shown some recent signs of a \nwillingness to implement meaningful reforms, legitimate questions \nregarding its commitment to these reforms as well as continuing \nconcerns about the ongoing detention of political prisoners and about \nserious human rights violations justify the renewal of these sanctions.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this important measure as a \nreaffirmation of our concern for those here at home who are struck by \ndisaster, and for those abroad who suffer under oppression.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 602\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate on Reid amendment No. 602. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would like to speak for final \npassage. I would like to speak last.\n  Is there anyone who wants to speak in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there someone to speak in opposition?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If not, then I will take the time to close. I wanted to \nsay thanks to several Members, many Members on my side who have helped \nthis week to clarify this issue and to build support for disaster \nfunding for the 48 States that are currently experiencing devastation.\n  I wish to thank Members on the other side of the aisle, particularly \nSenators Blunt, Vitter, Rubio, others, Senator Snowe who have left \ntheir voice and their vote to help us get to this point. I particularly \nwish to thank Senator Blunt for spending 15 minutes on the floor today \nsaying how crucial this is not only to his State of Missouri but to the \nwhole country.\n  I wish to thank the Members on my side, Senators Leahy and Schumer \nand Hagan and others who have helped so much this week--Senator \nShaheen, who has been at all the press conferences, Senator Sanders.\n  Let me say this is the only vehicle--the only vehicle--we have before \nus to do long-term full funding for the disaster relief. This bill will \nprovide help to Nebraska, to Minot, ND, to New York, to the east coast, \nto Tuscaloosa, AL, Joplin, MO.\n  If we do not vote for this, the DRF funding will be empty. This money \ngives us not only additional funding for disaster relief, but it also \nprovides an additional $1.1 billion for the Corps of Engineers and \nfunding for a few other programs that are essential to rebuilding.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Since there is no opposition that is going to speak, I \nwould like to take those 2 minutes as well.\n  This is a very important vote. I know there are some people who think \nwe should have gone through a regular process. The last time we went \nthrough a regular process, with individual votes coming to the floor by \nOctober 1, was 1994. It is 2011. As the appropriator, the chair of this \ncommittee, I knew that was not a way to go to bring quick relief to the \ndisaster victims who need help.\n  So the stand-alone approach, sending a strong vote from the Senate \ntoday, will help us negotiate with the House. They have a different \nidea. I happen not to agree with their idea. They are entitled to their \nown idea. We are entitled to our own idea, and our own idea is with \nDemocrats and Republicans voting yes on this Burma sanctions bill, we \ncan send reliable, long-term funding.\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\n  In closing, let me tell you what the alternative is if you vote no. \nIf you vote no on this and think you can go home and tell your people \nyou helped them, you are going to be faced next week with a vote to \ngive your people 6 weeks of disaster funding. That is how long the \ncontinuing resolution lasts.\n  Believe me, having had to rebuild a good part of our State, you \ncannot do it 6 weeks at a time. I strongly suggest you give a strong \nvote for disaster victims, long-term funding they can rely on, and we \nnegotiate with the House next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The question is on agreeing to \nthe Reid amendment No. 602.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FEDERAL \n                   AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AT FISCAL YEAR 2008 \n                   LEVELS.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of, or amendments made by, \n     this title, or any other provision of law, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for the period beginning on September 17, \n     2011, and ending on January 31, 2012, for all purposes (other \n     than for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under \n     section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) amounts \n     not to exceed the amounts authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Administration for the period beginning on September 17, \n     2007, and ending on January 31, 2008, for such purposes.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are considering today the highway bill \nand the\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\nFAA bill. The highway bill is a trust fund. When we hear the words \n``trust fund,'' we should have trust that money is only spent on \nhighways. Unfortunately, that money has been spent through the years on \nother items. The same applies to the Social Security trust fund and \nwith the Medicare trust fund. It is all sent to the General Treasury, \nand it is not protected.\n  What I am asking today through this amendment to the highway bill is \nthat we keep the trust fund separate and the trust fund spends only \nmoney that comes in from the gas tax. If we continue to spend money \nthat is not coming in from the gas tax, this will be money borrowed \nfrom China or simply printed, and there are ramifications to borrowing \n$40,000 a second.\n  So my amendment to the highway bill would say we only spend what \ncomes in through taxes. I consider this to be responsible budgeting and \nwhat we should be doing and likely what we were probably obligated \nunder the original trust agreement to do. So I urge passage of this \namendment which would limit the highway trust fund to that amount of \nfunds coming in through taxes.\n  My second amendment is to the FAA bill. This amendment says spending \nin the FAA bill go to 2008 levels. Since 2008, spending in our \ngovernment has gone up 25 percent. We are mounting a deficit of $1.5 \ntrillion. Our Nation's debt is $14 trillion. There are significant \nramifications to incurring so much debt.\n  The debt does have a face--it is the face of unemployment. Economists \nhave said our debt burden is leading to our losing 1 million jobs a \nyear; that 1 million people are out of work because of the debt we \ncarry. Economists have also said this debt burden, when it is paid for \nthrough the printing of money, leads to higher prices in the stores. \nOur gas prices have doubled not because gas is more precious but \nbecause our dollar is less precious. Our dollar is less precious \nbecause we are paying for a debt by inflating the currency.\n  What this amendment asks is that we go back to 2008 levels, which, \nbelieve it or not, if we did this through the entire government, will \nstill not balance the budget. This is a modest proposal. It is the very \nleast we can do if we believe in a responsible budget and that we must \nbalance our budget.\n  The second amendment would take spending to 2008 levels, and I \nencourage the Senate to pass these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked that Senator \nRockefeller have 2\\1/2\\ minutes of the time that remains on our side, \nwhich shall be divided, and I will have the 2\\1/2\\ minutes to speak \nabout the highway amendment, which I would share that, if he wants to, \nwith Senator Inhofe. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Reid has 5 minutes total under his \ncontrol.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is what I said, 2\\1/2\\ minutes and 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I can clarify, I think the Senator from California \nis saying the highway bill will get 2\\1/2\\ minutes, and we will agree \nto split our time with the ranking members.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition--very strong \nopposition--to the Paul amendment. The Senate voted on this earlier \nthis year and turned it down very emphatically. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, is taken for granted by some. They just assume \nthere will always be money and everything can go on constantly. The \nSenate has rejected this.\n  The FAA has raised very substantial concerns publicly--but more \nimportantly, from my point of view, to me privately--that at all levels \nthey will have to start compromising safety, although they will not \nintend to, and eventually we will put FAA at risk.\n  It is a very bad and dangerous amendment--a mischievous amendment--\nand it should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to support \nthe Paul amendment on FAA. Although I understand what he is trying to \ndo, to bring it down, this is a clean extension that has been passed by \nthe House. The House has gone out for the weekend, and the FAA \nauthorization lapses tomorrow. We have had a shutdown of the FAA in the \nlast 6 weeks and it disrupts airport expansions, and it disrupts the \nFAA itself.\n  We will work with Senator Paul to make sure we are doing everything \nwe can to cut the FAA budget, but this is a clean 2011 extension, with \nno additions, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill without the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you can tell me when I have finished \nwith 1\\1/2\\ minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Point of inquiry, Mr. President. At some point I want 30 \nseconds, if we can figure out how to do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will reserve the rest of the time for the Senator to \nclose. So tell me when I have used that 1\\1/2\\ minutes, and the Senator \nwill have 1 minute left.\n  Today, Mr. President, was a very rough day for us to get to this \nmoment. I thank everyone who came together to finally get this moving.\n  Let me tell you why we are at a critical moment. We clearly have to \nkeep the FAA going, and we are. I think we are going to win that \namendment. On transportation, Senator Paul has offered an amendment \nthat technically doesn't do anything, but it is his intent, as he said, \nto cut the funding by one-third.\n  If that amendment were to pass, and if his intent was carried out, it \nwould mean we would lose 608,000 jobs right away--608,000 jobs right \naway. We can't afford to do that.\n  The funding is in this bill. There is no need to cut this bill. It is \npaid for, and we are ready to go. Republicans and Democrats on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee are in agreement on a clean \nextension.\n  I thank my ranking member. As everyone knows, we do not see eye to \neye on the environment, and that is an understatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her allotted time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. On infrastructure, we are together. We want a clean \nextension. We fight for these jobs and these businesses.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the remainder of my time to the \nranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have two amendments we are talking about now in a \nshort period of time. First, I will support the FAA amendment. I think \nSenator Paul has a good idea.\n  I would only say this: I want my Republican conservatives to listen \ncarefully. This is totally different than any other bill because what \nthis is--there is adequate money right now in the highway trust fund to \ncarry out the existing spending until 2013. So I would only say that \nmoney is dedicated for that purpose, and it is going to be spent for \nthat purpose. Anything that came from a source other than a gas tax was \nmerely paid back from money borrowed out of the trust fund. So from a \nmoral standpoint, this should be spent on infrastructure on the highway \nbill--on the extension. Then we will be able to talk about something \nmore important, which is the bill coming up, and that will be the \npermanent one.\n  So I think it is not going to make any difference. I will oppose it \non concept because that money is dedicated for a purpose and paid for \nby people who believe we are going to improve our highways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am satisfied, and I would ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. 621.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 36, the nays are 61. \nUnder the previous order requiring 60 votes, the amendment is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for passage of H.R. 2887, a \ncombined FAA and surface transportation extension bill.\n  This legislation averts a damaging shutdown of either program. If we \nfail to extend these programs, it will mean layoffs and the loss of \nsignificant revenue to fund airport and road programs.\n  The current FAA extension expires tomorrow and the current surface \ntransportation extension expires at the end of the month, along with \nthe authority to collect the Federal gas taxes that fund the Highway \nTrust Fund. Passing this bill quickly and extending the FAA \nreauthorization for 4 months and the surface transportation bill for 6 \nmonths allows Congress more time to work out the issues that are \nholding up completing long-term reauthorizations.\n  Just as important, it keeps thousands of workers on the job, \nsupporting their families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to explain my vote of the FAA \nextension.\n  As I have said many times, I share House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee Chairman Mica's frustration, and the \nfrustration of Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate, \nthat favors to organized labor have overshadowed the prospects for \nlong-term FAA reauthorization.\n  Last year the National Mediation Board changed the rules under which \nemployees of airlines and railroads are able to unionize. For decades \nthe standard has been that a majority of employees would have to agree \nin an election to form a union. However, the new NMB rules changed that \nstandard so that all it takes to unionize is a majority of employees \nvoting. The NMB wants to permanently impose unionization with less than \nmajority support.\n  The House passed long-term FAA reauthorization bill includes language \nI strongly support that eliminates this favor for big labor.\n  The enactment of a long-term FAA reauthorization bill is very \nimportant and is something we need to accomplish. However, the NMB \nissue needs to be resolved for long-term FAA reauthorization to occur. \nI will work with my colleagues on a resolution, but they should be on \nnotice that avoiding the issue through 22 short-term extensions is no \nlonger an alternative. I hope my friends have a restful weekend, but \nthey shouldn't feel too relaxed even though we just extended the FAA \nfor 4 months. We need to get back to work on a long-term FAA \nreauthorization bill right away.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senators Sanders, Lautenberg, Conrad, \nGillibrand and I filed an amendment to provide an additional $2.5 \nbillion to the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Fund, \nwhich is woefully underfunded right now. In addition, our amendment \nwould waive the $100 million per State cap on emergency funding, which \nhas been done for previous disasters, and allow 100 percent Federal \nreimbursement for disaster repair work occurring more than 180 days \nafter the disaster.\n  Nearly 3 weeks ago, Vermont bore the full brunt of then-Tropical \nStorm Irene as it turned gentle mountain streams and valley rivers into \nraging torrents of destruction. Whole towns were cut off from the \noutside world. Homes, businesses, farms, water systems, and miles of \nroads and bridges were swept away. And some Vermonters lost their lives \nin these devastating floods.\n  Roads, bridges, and rail lines all over the State have been wiped \nout. Flooding closed more than 300 town and State roads and damaged \nmore than 30 bridges in Vermont, stranding people in more than a dozen \ntowns for days. It is going to take years and years for my small State \nto recover.\n  In the aftermath, it has been extremely difficult to move emergency \nsupplies and rebuilding materials around, as some of the washed-out \nroads have gaping gullies in the middle that are 30 feet or more deep, \nand some of the reopened roads and bridges are not yet recommended for \nheavy traffic.\n  The consequences have been harsh. Residents are forced to make 30-\nmile-plus detours to the nearest grocery store or doctor--on mountain \nroads, some of them unpaved. Businesses are struggling to reopen and \nfind customers. Schools have been forced to remain closed until repairs \nare made.\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nAnd tourists are worried about traveling to Vermont this fall to see \nthe foliage or this winter to do some skiing.\n  Our small State is stretched to the limit right now. Winter is fast \napproaching, which means the end of the construction season is near. By \nNovember it will be too cold to lay asphalt, and by December snow and \nice will cover the mountains, leaving many towns dangerously isolated. \nWe need to make more permanent repairs as soon as possible or future \nrains and the fall's freeze-thaw cycle will further deteriorate our \nroads and make them all but impassable this winter. With just weeks to \naccomplish so much, we need the full and immediate support of FEMA, the \nDepartment of Transportation, and many other Federal agencies.\n  Earlier natural disasters across the Nation have drawn down our \nemergency fund accounts, jeopardizing the ability to respond in those \nStates, as well as the newly stricken States such as Vermont. FEMA has \nless than $400 million in its disaster account for the rest of fiscal \nyear 2011, and the Federal Highway Administration's disaster account is \nunder $200 million. On top of that, the Federal highway account already \nhas over $1 billion in backlogged projects waiting for funding. Since \ndamage to Vermont's Federal-aid roads and bridges alone will exceed \nhalf a billion dollars, it is unclear whether the $2.5 billion we \npropose in this amendment will even cover all of the costs for declared \ndisasters including Irene. But it is a good start.\n  We must act quickly to replenish FEMA's disaster relief fund, Federal \nhighway's emergency road fund, and a variety of other disaster accounts \nthat are at dangerously low levels right now. Without additional \nfunding to these and other emergency accounts, Vermont and all of the \nother 49 States with ongoing Federal disasters will not have the \nresources they need to rebuild.\n  Thousands of American families and businesses have been devastated by \nan unprecedented series of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, \nand other natural disasters this year. The people hurting out there are \ndesperate for a helping hand from their fellow Americans. Given the \nbreadth and depth of Irene's destruction, on top of the ongoing \ndisasters already declared in all 50 States, we must ensure that FEMA, \nthe Department of Transportation, and all of the other Federal agencies \ninvolved in disaster-relief efforts have the resources they need to \nhelp our citizens in their desperate time of need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was with a mixture of sadness for his \nloss and gratitude for having known him that I received the news that \nMalcolm Wallop had passed away yesterday. He was a man of strong \nprinciples who served over the years with some truly remarkable people, \nsuch as Dick Cheney and Al Simpson, to make up some of the most \ninfluential and strongly united State delegations I have ever seen.\n  Those of us who served with him will remember him with a great deal \nof fondness as one of the greatest warriors from Wyoming and the West \nwho have ever served in the Senate. Whether a person agreed with him or \nnot, he earned the respect of those he served with because it was clear \nhe spoke from the heart with words that reflected his commitment to his \nhome State of Wyoming and our Western way of life.\n  Malcolm was born in New York and later attended and graduated from \nYale University. He immediately felt the call to serve his country, and \nhe joined the Army. Then, when his days in the military were over, he \nreturned to his life as a rancher in Wyoming. It was a vocation he took \nup with great passion as it reflected his love of the land and his \nenjoyment of the great outdoors. I think those long hours spent on his \nranch gave him the time he needed to think about that which really \nmattered to him and to his future. It must have been there that he \nbegan to get his thoughts together and speak his mind on a long list of \nissues that mattered to him and to all of those who shared his \npolitical philosophy. It led him on a path over the years that would \nsee him writing a long list of prestigious and popular publications \nthat got him noticed and quoted throughout his long and productive \ncareer.\n  Malcolm found his home on his ranch, but he really found his true \ncalling when he ran for and won a seat in the State legislature, first \nin the house and later on in the Senate. It was in the State \nlegislature that he developed a well-earned reputation for being a \nthoughtful legislator who became the voice of his constituents as he \nworked to ensure their concerns were heard and heard clearly on a \nnumber of issues that affected them and their daily lives.\n  Encouraged by what he had been able to do, Malcolm ran for Governor, \nbut God needed a legislator, so he lost the primary. Malcolm then set \nhis sites on serving in the U.S. Senate. He ran against a three-term \nincumbent. He knew running for the Senate would not be easy, but he was \nalways one willing to do whatever was needed to ensure he achieved his \nobjectives. The Senate race proved to be no exception.\n  OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, had come \ninto being and drafted its first regulations. Malcolm noted the \nrequirements for extensive port-a-potties and built an ad that made the \npoint. Of course, we can't show videos on the floor, but I have to \ndescribe this ad because it is still considered one of the classics of \nrunning for office.\n  The camera first shows a cowboy in a blue work shirt and a tattered \nstraw hat saddling and mounting his horse while the announcer says:\n\n       Everywhere you look these days, the Federal Government is \n     there, telling you what they think, telling you what they \n     think you ought to think, telling you how you ought to do \n     things, setting up rules you can't follow. I think the \n     Federal Government is going too far. Now they say if you \n     don't take that portable facility on a roundup, you can't go.\n\n  At that point, you see the cowboy shake his head in disgust, and then \ncut back to a donkey tied behind the cowboy's horse, and strapped on \nthe donkey's back is a portable toilet. The cowboy rides off.\n  That ad got him noticed and elected, along with his great ability to \nexplain things.\n  After a spirited campaign, Malcolm proudly took his oath of office \nand prepared for the challenges that would lie ahead as Wyoming's \nnewest Senator. Some may have thought it wise to start slowly and \neventually gain momentum but not Malcolm. He got here and started right \nto work on what he came here to do. Over the years, he served on a long \nlist of committees, and he had an impact on each and every one of them. \nThey included the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Finance \nCommittee, the Small Business Committee, the Armed Services Committee, \nand the Select Committee on Intelligence. He will also be remembered as \nthe first nonlawyer to serve on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Malcolm served for 18 years in the Senate, and the record reflects \nthat he used his time wisely and well. Although it would be impossible \nto list everything he was able to accomplish during his service, quite \na few milestones stand out that had a great impact not only on his \nconstituents but on people across the whole country.\n  His legislation to cut inheritance and gift taxes was passed by \nCongress, an achievement that was hailed as one of the major \nlegislative accomplishments at that time on tax reform. He also fought \nto stop the Federal Government's effort to control Wyoming's water \nresources and the taking of private property.\n  Although Malcolm's career had begun right in his own backyard, it \nwasn't long before he had expanded his sights and soon began to work on \nenergy and foreign trade issues which took him to conferences and \nmeetings all over the world. He had a great deal of success in those \nefforts as he worked to strengthen our relationships with our foreign \ntrade partners. Because of his concern about our national defense, \nMalcolm was heavily involved in the work that was being done \ninternationally on arms control. He was an active participant in a \nnumber of those talks. Ultimately, the human rights issues and Western \npressure on them helped to bring about deliberations on the Baltics and \nEastern Europe.\n  Still, no matter where he was or what he was doing, he never lost his \nfocus on his constituents back home and how they were being affected by \nwhat the Federal Government was doing or proposing. That is why so many \nin Wyoming will always remember him as a warrior who fought with all \nhis might to put an end to the battle that was going on back then to \nincrease Federal regulations and reduce State and local control over \nmany facets of life in Wyoming and the West. He knew it had to be \nstopped, and he did not rest until he made it happen.\n\n  Malcolm was a true conservative, and the principles and values that \nmeant so much to him helped to set his inner compass and guide and \ndirect him in everything he did. His commitment to conservative values \nwas so strong that it led him to create the Republican steering \ncommittee, which now includes just about all the Republicans in the \nSenate. He knew how important it was to create a working group that \nwould serve as a sounding board that would provide guidance and \ndirection for the ideas and proposals he and other conservatives wanted \nto offer to control spending, to limit the growth of government, and to \nensure freedoms we have all come to cherish as Americans, to see that \nthey would forever be protected and preserved.\n  His love of outdoor sports led him to champion a tax on hunting and \nfishing equipment that could only be used for habitat and facilities. \nSupported by the sportsmen, that provision is still in place, and we \nprotect its use, to be used for what it was intended.\n  These are just a few of the items you could find on a list of \nMalcolm's accomplishments in the Senate. There are many, many more that \nwould be part of the legacy of his service. But there is one more at \nthe top of the list which I know was closest to his heart and which I \nhave to mention before I close.\n  Throughout his life, Malcolm was a strong believer in the importance \nof the volunteer spirit. That is why he proposed the Congressional \nAwards program. First of all, it did not cost anything, which he \nappreciated as a fiscal conservative. Secondly, it was best described \nas a challenge issued to young people all across the Nation to get up, \nget active, and get involved down the street, down the block, or across \ntown. It helped young people to realize that no matter the problem, \nthere was something they could do to help solve it.\n  Malcolm proposed the idea, and Congress soon passed it. No other \naward program is quite like it, and no other award like it is issued by \nCongress. It is not an easy award to earn. I am certain that is how \nMalcolm intended for\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nit to be. Any young American who has a dream they wish to pursue can \nearn one of these important awards. Whether it is a bronze, silver, or \ngold award, each participant sets his own goal and works with an \nadviser to get there, step by step. They set their own standards in \nfour program areas: volunteer public service, personal development, \nphysical fitness, and exploration. How well they do in each of these \ncategories determines which award they will earn.\n  It may be because of Malcolm's status as the founder of the program \nthat it always seems to me that when the gold award winners come to \nWashington, DC, for the presentation ceremony, there are more Wyoming \nwinners than those from any other State. Just like Malcolm, I am very \nproud of the spirit of my State's young people and the way they answer \nthis and every challenge--with enthusiasm and determination to do \nwhatever it takes to succeed.\n  In the years to come, the Congressional Awards will continue to be \none of the best parts of Malcolm Wallop's legacy of service to the \nNation, and it will inspire and encourage countless more young people \nto do whatever they can to change the world around them, beginning like \nMalcolm did, right in their own backyard. It already has a great record \nof successes, and I cannot think of a better way to remember Malcolm \nWallop. In fact, it is probably how he would most want to be \nremembered.\n  After Malcolm had served three terms in the State senate and given 18 \nmore years of his life to the people of Wyoming, he took another long \nwalk on his ranch, gave it some thought, and decided it was time for \nhim not to retire--for someone like Malcolm never slowed down--he just \nfelt it was time for him to change direction. So he announced he was \nstepping down from the Senate to give someone else a chance to continue \nthe work that must be done to make Wyoming and our Nation a better \nplace to live for us all.\n  It was not long after leaving the Senate that Malcolm founded an \norganization called the Frontiers of Freedom to enable him to continue \nhis work to address the issues of personal freedom and the need to keep \nour government from growing too large and too powerful. I have always \nfelt, like Will Rogers said so many years before him, that he opened \nhis office just a short distance from Washington so he would be better \nable to keep an eye on us.\n  In the years he served at the helm of the Frontiers of Freedom, it \nwas clear that it reflected the true north of Malcolm Wallop's inner \ncompass. Just like he had done for so many years, the organization was \ncompletely focused on many of the issues he had worked on in the \nSenate, and, like him, it was a much valued and important presence in \nthe ongoing conversation and debate about the direction in which our \ncountry was headed and whether that needed to change.\n  Now Malcolm is taken from us all too soon. He will be greatly missed, \nand he will never be forgotten. When I learned of his passing, my \nthoughts turned to those Wyoming Senators we have lost over the last \nfew years: Craig Thomas, Cliff Hansen, and now Malcolm Wallop. They may \nbe gone, but their memories will live on and serve to remind us that \neach and every one of us--Americans all across this country of ours--\nhas something to offer to make a difference in the world. If we do not \ndo what God has sent us here to do, no one else will be able to do it \nfor us.\n  Diana and I join in sending our heartfelt sympathy to Malcolm's \nfamily and to everyone who knew him personally or politically or who \nfollowed his public life. He was a remarkable individual who fulfilled \nhis life's dream by working hard, always giving the best he had to \noffer, and constantly looking ahead to the problems that were looming \non the horizon so they could be addressed before they became too \ndifficult to handle.\n  At moments such as these, I have always believed there is no greater \ngift we can give to someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one \nthan to keep them in our thoughts and hold them gently in our prayers. \nI have found that God has a way of hearing and healing us in our \ndarkest hours. May His presence now be a source of peace and comfort to \nall those who mourn Malcolm's loss. The knowledge that there are so \nmany who will never forget him may, in time, help to soften the pain \nhis passing leaves behind for all who knew him, loved him, and called \nhim their friend.\n  To heal the empty spot in our hearts, I encourage all who knew \nMalcolm to write down their memories and share them. I know with full \nconfidence this will not be the last time Malcolm Wallop's name will be \nheard on the Senate floor. In the years to come, we will often think of \nhim and the example he provided at so many times. But for now, let us \nsay goodbye to our friend. He will be missed, but he will never be \nforgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor one \nof our former colleagues and a dear friend. U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop \ndied yesterday, September 14, 2011, at his Wyoming home overlooking the \nmajestic Big Horn Mountains.\n  Senator Wallop will be remembered as a unique and enduring figure in \nthe history of Wyoming and in the history of the United States. Malcolm \nwas a stalwart defender of freedom and democracy around the world and a \ndetermined advocate for limited government and opportunity for every \nperson. Like that iconic range in northern Wyoming that he loved, \nMalcolm stood very tall--as a citizen, as a State and Federal \nlegislator, and as a loyal guardian for Wyoming people and our way of \nlife.\n  I want to send my deepest condolences to Malcolm's family back in \nWyoming and around the country: to Isabel, his wife; to his beloved \nchildren, Malcolm, Matthew, Amy, and Paul; to his dear sisters, Jeannie \nand Carolyn.\n  I also want to offer my condolences to all of those folks who worked \nfor Senator Wallop during his years of extraordinary public service. I \nhave met most and have known many over the years. My wife Bobbi served \non his very first staff in Washington, and last night she shared with \nme again what we have all come to know: Malcolm was a kind, caring, and \nextraordinary gentleman. Malcolm's staff served him ably and honorably.\n  I know there are also some in this body today who served alongside \nMalcolm Wallop. You no doubt remember him well. It was just 4 years ago \nthat Senator Wallop returned here to this Chamber and attended my own \nswearing-in on June 25, 2007. On that day, as is tradition, Senator \nWallop walked with me up to the President's desk to take the oath. He \nstood with me during the ceremony and offered private words of \nencouragement and advice. I was honored that day to have him there next \nto me, and it saddens me greatly to join Senator Enzi to announce his \ndeath.\n\n  Malcolm Wallop was someone I followed throughout his career. I \nadmired him greatly. He was a man whom many of us looked up to, as he \ngrew into one of the most influential legislators of his time.\n  ``Hello, my friend''--that was his classic western rancher's drawl, \nand it was what you heard if Malcolm Wallop was on the other end of the \nphone line or came through the door. Malcolm was a real-life version of \nanyone's image of a western gentleman.\n  Today, I remember him as a brilliant servant-leader. He possessed a \nspecial western wisdom, which often found those around him racing just \nto catch up. He found great contentment in all of the many facets of \nhis life. Even during recent years, when numerous medical challenges \nconquered his physical body, his spirit and his intellect were never \ndiminished.\n  Public service was his heritage and his calling. His grandfather, \nOliver Henry ``Noll'' Wallop, founded the Canyon Ranch in the Big Horn \nMountains of Wyoming in 1888. That is before Wyoming even became a \nState. Noll had the distinction of serving first in the Wyoming State \nLegislature and then, later in life, in the House of Lords in Great \nBritain. Noll was the youngest son of Lord Isaac Newton Wallop, the \nfifth Earl of Portsmouth. When Noll's older brothers died, he \nreluctantly returned to England to fulfill the family duty. However, \nhis own son Oliver, who was Malcolm's father, had been grown up and he \nremained in Wyoming.\n  Malcolm was born in 1933, and Big Horn was always his home. His \nchildren and his grandchildren are the fourth and fifth generations of \nhis family to make their lives in the beautiful\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nBig Horn Mountain area of north central Wyoming. They ranch, they own \nbusinesses, they teach, they raise their children, they serve their \ncommunity--all those things we do to make this Nation strong.\n  Malcolm was a pilot. He served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy. He was a cattle rancher elected to the Wyoming State Legislature, \nserving both in the house as well as in the senate from 1969 through \n1976.\n  In 1974, Wallop ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Wyoming. But it \nwas during that summer campaign that Malcolm began to distinguish \nhimself as a principled and energetic future force in Republican \npolitics. He did not shy from the tough issues; instead, he seemed to \ngather strength from the challenges.\n  Only 2 years later, he unseated incumbent U.S. Senator Gale McGee and \nbecame Wyoming's 19th Senator, serving from 1977 to 1995.\n  When Malcolm was elected to this body in 1976, it was really \nsomething. You heard about the commercials from Senator Enzi. Well, a \ngroup of young people had gathered around to support his very unlikely \nbid to serve Wyoming in the U.S. Senate. The national press called it \nthe Children's Crusade. Many of those young people came to Washington \nwith him, and my wife Bobbi Brown was among those, who began her own \npublic service career as part of his first-term staff.\n  It is an indication of the affection and the loyalty felt by those \nwho were part of his team that more than 60 people gathered with \nMalcolm in Wyoming in 2006 for a 30-year reunion.\n  He served three terms in the Senate, and his work here was very broad \nin scope. His presence was lasting, and it touched on the mercurial \nissues of the late 1970s and 1980s, from energy policy to the \nenvironment, from national security to tax reform.\n  One of our own colleagues, Senator Carl Levin, said of Malcolm:\n\n       While we disagreed, again, probably as often as we agreed, \n     that did not stand in the way of my admiration for the \n     quality, the characteristic that he had of letting you know \n     precisely where he stood and why.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       And his patriotism is second to none in this body.\n\n  Malcolm Wallop was the first elected official to propose a space-\nbased missile system, which eventually became part of our Strategic \nDefense Initiative. He was highly regarded for his knowledge and \nunderstanding of defense issues and surely helped bring the Berlin Wall \ndown. Later in his Senate service, he was a member of the Helsinki \nCommission, and he traveled in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion as an arms control negotiator.\n  Speaking of their strategic partnership, President Reagan said: \n``Leadership, hard work, experience, loyalty to Wyoming--that's what \nMalcolm Wallop is all about.'' Malcolm was fiercely protective of \nStates rights, property rights, the rights to privacy, and he was a \nchampion of the rights of the individual.\n  He was remembered for the Wallop amendment to the Surface Mining \nControl Act, a property rights issue which forced the Federal \nGovernment to compensate property owners whose ability to mine was \nundercut by regulation. He worked successfully to protect State \ninterest in the Clean Water Act. He brought significant wilderness to \nWyoming through the 1984 Wilderness Act.\n  He was a key force behind the passage of the far-reaching 1982 Energy \nPolicy Act. Senator Wallop, on more than one occasion, commented that \nhe ``was not burdened with a law degree.'' Yet he was selected in his \nvery first term to serve on the Judiciary Committee, the first \nnonlawyer ever so chosen.\n  Perhaps his greatest contribution was his landmark legislation to \naddress the heartbreaking issue of parental kidnapping. He was one of a \nlong and distinguished line of Wyoming Senators who served with \ndistinction on the Senate Finance Committee. His 1981 bill to cut \ninheritance and gift taxes is remembered as one of the most substantive \nchanges to tax policy that decade.\n  He appreciated opportunities which allowed for private/public sector \npartnerships. Early in his Senate career, there was talk of \nestablishing a national service requirement for young people. But \nMalcolm felt that if we were going to require young people to serve the \nNation, the Nation should recognize them for the service so many were \nalready providing through their daily lives.\n  This resulted in his leadership to establish the Congressional Award. \nHe joined with colleagues in both Houses of Congress in a bipartisan \neffort and a unique program available to all interested young people in \nthe country was created.\n  It is a program of Congress which operates with private sector funds. \nIt is an earned honor and is the highest honor which we bestow on our \nNation's young people. The many young people in my State who \nparticipate in the Close Up program do so because Malcolm thought it \nwas an important opportunity for his young constituents. At the time, \nClose Up only offered their program in the cities. Malcolm worked to \nconvince the Close Up Foundation that a statewide program would work. I \nbelieve Close Up today counts their Wyoming program as one of its most \nsuccessful.\n  Malcolm Wallop reached across Capitol Hill. He reached across party \nlines in the creation of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, commonly \nknown as the Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund, which has resulted in billions \nof dollars generated by users for support of fisheries and wetlands \naround the country.\n  But it was not all serious. He was an enthusiastic supporter of his \nstaff's efforts to deal with their homesickness in July. In July of \n1977, he held the first Frontier East, an east coast celebration of \nCheyenne's Frontier Days, which is known simply as COWPIE. COWPIE \nstands for the Committee of Wyoming People in the East. It is still \ntoday one of the Washington area's most celebrated summer events.\n  My wife Bobbi reminds me how absolutely joyful Malcolm was each year \non his birthday. His birthday was February 27. As Bobbi reminds me, \nthat is when his staff organized the Wally Awards, making great fun of \nthemselves and their boss. I am told the best was the impersonation of \nhim by his chief of staff, Bill Hill. That is the same chief of staff \nwho then went on to serve as Chief Justice of the Wyoming Supreme \nCourt.\n  Malcolm remained forever steadfast against the growth and the power \nof centralized government. He warned: ``As we remain the sheep, the \ngovernment happily remains our shepherd.''\n  He talked often as a Senator of our shrinking freedom and the battle \nto lay claim to our fragile liberty. That was Malcolm Wallop. When he \nannounced his retirement in 1993, after 18 years in the Senate, Senator \nWallop told the Casper Star Tribune simply: ``I don't think the only \nplace to fight for freedom is in the halls of Congress.''\n  His life after the Senate was filled with his continuing work on \nissues focusing on constitutionally limited government, a strong \nnational defense, and the rights of the individual. To address these \nissues, he founded the Frontiers of Freedom.\n  He spoke with power and eloquence about the issues which he found to \nbe the core of our great country. In a 2003 interview with Peter Evans, \nhe said:\n\n       You'll find in the American people an enormous sense of \n     pride and self assurance that only comes from people living \n     free. It's unbelievably invigorating, and very reassuring, to \n     know the great experiment is in the hands of people who don't \n     even know it, and isn't in the hands of the people who think \n     they hold it.\n\n  Malcolm Wallop was so many things. But what Malcolm Wallop was not \nwas sentimental. The new phase of his life was the full phase of his \nlife. He did not dwell on past things. His energy was always spent \nlooking forward.\n  I wish to conclude by repeating Senator Wallop's own words. Speaking \nin 2005 before the Ronald Reagan Gala sponsored by the Frontiers of \nFreedom, Senator Wallop spoke about his own beliefs.\n\n       Government was not meant to possess us, rule us, encompass \n     us, judge for us, substitute for us. It was meant to serve \n     us. We were founded as a noble self-governing tribe of free \n     people respecting each other as Americans under God--not \n     under Washington. Americans know this even if their \n     government does not.\n       The biggest difference between the principle of government \n     in America, and anywhere else is that here the rulers must \n     stick to clearly defined tasks, while ordinary people may do \n     whatever they wish. We must make up our minds to put this \n     principle into practice again, lest we lose the spirit that \n     made us the envy of the world.\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\n       Most important, the American model is based on a certain \n     kind of people--defined not by race but by virtue and by the \n     willingness to take responsibility for our own lives. People \n     fit to be Americans ask for blessings only from God. Because \n     being Americans is not a matter of birth, we must practice it \n     every day--lest we become something else.\n       The size of our continent, its fabulous wealth, its \n     indescribable beauty, the ships, tanks and airplanes in our \n     arsenal, are no treasure compared to the moral character of \n     the American people. I pray to God that he will graciously \n     help us preserve and protect that splendid moral base.\n\n  To Isabel and his beloved children, Malcolm, Matthew, Amy, and Paul, \nto his dear sisters, Jeannie and Carolyn, we thank you for letting him \nshare so much of his life with us all. There is no question our world \nis better for the time he spent addressing the great issues of the day \nand we are grateful.\n  We can cherish our memories and stories of Malcolm knowing he would \ncast a wry glance and wonder why we were not spending our thoughts and \nour energy on a challenge that needed our attention. It is what he \nwould expect of all of us. It is the example he left for us. It is his \nlegacy.\n  So, today, godspeed, Malcolm. The Senate, Wyoming, the United States \nof America, has lost one of its most steadfast defenders.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5673-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5673-S5676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DISAPPEARING MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I went back to the office and I saw my \nsenior Senator sitting here at this late hour and I wanted to come down \nand keep him company. So I am glad to be here with you tonight, proud \nto be from the West tonight with two great Senators from Wyoming \nremembering Malcolm Wallop's service in this body. It was wonderful to \nhear their remembrances of him. I am glad we were here to share that \nbeing from the West.\n  Similar to the Presiding Officer, I spent most of August in our \nbeautiful State--the most beautiful State in the United States, if I do \nsay so myself--in townhall meetings, mostly in red parts of the State, \nbut in red and blue parts of the State. They do not actually think of \nthemselves that way, but that is how Washington would talk about it.\n  In the townhalls, I always start the same way. I say: Ask any \nquestion you have. Bring any criticism you have. I tell them I was an \nurban school superintendent for almost 4 years, it is impossible to \nhurt my feelings. It was beaten out of me a long time ago. Then we have \na conversation.\n  This time, every single meeting started with somebody saying: What is \nwrong with you guys? Why can't you work this out in Washington, DC? We \nare struggling in the worst economy we have had since the Great \nDepression, and what we see are a lot of political games being played \nback there.\n  That is the version of the conversation I have heard now for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears in our State.\n  Then, one of the things we get into at the very beginning is the fact \nthat this is not a garden-variety recession that we are just coming out \nof. This is the first time--this last decade, not just this recession, \nthe last decade--the first time in this country's history when median \nfamily income actually declined instead of going up.\n  Generation after generation after generation of Americans saw their \nincome rise. Median family income is sort of shorthand for middle-class \nfamily income in this country. It is the backbone of this country, and \nit has fallen for the first time in a decade, as the cost of health \ninsurance doubled on the people who live in Colorado, and the cost of \nhigher education went up by 60 percent.\n  People are saying: Michael, I have been at my job for this whole \ndecade and I am earning less at the end of the decade than I was at the \nbeginning of the decade. My costs of not ``nice to haves,'' my costs of \ncritical things to move my family ahead to create stability for me and \nmy small business--such as health care, such as higher education--have \ndone nothing but skyrocket.\n  I am going to show you some numbers that are pretty scary that came \nout this week from the Census Bureau that reflect, in numbers, what I \nam talking about and reflect how profound the structural issues are \nthat we face in our economy, structural that do not fit on the back of \na bumper sticker or a political slogan or during a debate at night on \nthe television set.\n  This week's Wall Street Journal, on Monday, had an article on the \nfront page with the headline that reads as follows: ``As Middle Class \nShrinks, P Aims High and Low.'' P is Procter & Gamble. There is not \na more iconic brand in our country's history when it comes to the \nmiddle class than Procter & Gamble.\n  Here are some of the things they make: Crest toothpaste; Head & \nShoulders shampoo; Tide detergent; Pamper's diapers--I am glad to be \nout of those in my house, by the way--Bounty paper towels; Downy fabric \nsoftener, Scope mouthwash; Duracell batteries; Charmin toilet paper; \nBounce fabric softener--nobody needed fabric softener before there was \na middle class in this country, but they make it--Mr. Clean; Pepto \nBismol; Pringles; Swiffer brooms and dusters--we have that in our \ncloset--Old Spice deodorant; Nyquil cough syrup; Puffs tissues; Ivory \nsoap; Covergirl makeup.\n  That is what Procter & Gamble makes. That is what they sold to the \ngreat middle class in this country for decades. Here is this article \nthat says Procter & Gamble aims high and low.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 12, 2011]\n\n             As Middle Class Shrinks P Aims High and Low\n\n                            (By Ellen Byron)\n\n       For generations, Procter & Gamble Co.'s growth strategy was \n     focused on developing household staples for the vast American \n     middle class.\n       Now, P executives say many of its former middle-market \n     shoppers are trading down to lower-priced goods--widening the \n     pools of have and have-not consumers at the expense of the \n     middle.\n       That's forced P, which estimates it has at least one \n     product in 98% of American households, to fundamentally \n     change the way it develops and sells its goods. For the first \n     time in 38 years, for example, the company launched a new \n     dish soap in the U.S. at a bargain price.\n       P's roll out of Gain dish soap says a lot about the \n     health of the American middle class: The world's largest \n     maker of consumer products is now betting that the squeeze on \n     middle America will be long lasting.\n       ``It's required us to think differently about our product \n     portfolio and how to please the high-end and lower-end \n     markets,'' says Melanie Healey, group president of P's \n     North America business. ``That's frankly where a lot of the \n     growth is happening.''\n       In the wake of the worst recession in 50 years, there's \n     little doubt that the American middle class--the 40% of \n     households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $140,000 a \n     year--is in distress. Even before the recession, incomes of \n     American middle-class families weren't keeping up with \n     inflation, especially with the rising costs of what are \n     considered the essential ingredients of middle-class life--\n     college education, health care and housing. In 2009, the \n     income of the median family, the one smack in the middle of \n     the middle, was lower, adjusted for inflation, than in 1998, \n     the Census Bureau says.\n       The slumping stock market and collapse in housing prices \n     have also hit middle-class Americans. At the end of March, \n     Americans had $6.1 trillion in equity in their houses--the \n     value of the house minus mortgages--half the 2006 level, \n     according to the Federal Reserve. Economist Edward Wolff of \n     New York University estimates that the net worth--household \n     assets minus debts--of the middle fifth of American \n     households grew by 2.4% a year between 2001 and 2007 and \n     plunged by 26.2% in the following two years.\n       P isn't the only company adjusting its business. A wide \n     swath of American companies is convinced that the consumer \n     market is bifurcating into high and low ends and eroding in \n     the middle. They have begun to alter the way they research, \n     develop and market their products.\n       Food giant H.J. Heinz Co., for example, is developing more \n     products at lower price ranges. Luxury retailer Saks Inc. is \n     bolstering its high-end apparel and accessories because its \n     wealthiest customers--not those drawn to entry-level items--\n     are driving the chain's growth.\n       Citigroup calls the phenomenon the ``Consumer Hourglass \n     Theory'' and since 2009 has urged investors to focus on \n     companies best positioned to cater to the highest-income and \n     lowest-income consumers. It created an index of 25 companies, \n     including Estee Lauder Cos. and Saks at the top of the \n     hourglass and Family Dollar Stores Inc. and Kellogg Co. at \n     the bottom. The index posted a\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n     56.5% return for investors from its inception on Dec. 10, \n     2009, through Sept. 1, 2011. Over the same period, the Dow \n     Jones Industrial Average returned 11%.\n       ``Companies have thought that if you're in the middle, \n     you're safe,'' says Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig. ``But \n     that's not where the consumer is any more--the consumer \n     hourglass is more pronounced now than ever.''\n       Companies like Tiffany & Co., Coach Inc. and Neiman Marcus \n     Group Inc., which cater to the wealthy, racked up outsize \n     sales last Christmas and continue to post strong sales.\n       Tiffany says its lower-priced silver baubles, once a \n     favorite of middle-class shoppers craving a small token from \n     the storied jeweler, are now its weakest sellers in the U.S. \n     ``I think that there's probably more separation of affluence \n     in the U.S.,'' Tiffany Chief Operating Officer James \n     Fernandez said in June.\n       Firms catering to low-income consumers, such as Dollar \n     General Corp., also are posting gains, boosted by formerly \n     middle-class families facing shrunken budgets. Dollar stores \n     garnered steady sales increases in recent years, easily \n     outpacing mainstream counterparts like Target Corp. and Wal-\n     Mart Stores Inc., which typically are more expensive.\n       P's profits boomed with the increasing affluence of \n     middle-class households in the post-World War II economy. As \n     masses of housewives set up their new suburban homes, P \n     marketers pledged that Tide detergent delivered cleaner \n     clothes, Mr. Clean made floors shinier and Crest toothpaste \n     fought off more cavities. In the decades since, new features \n     like fragrances or ingredient and packaging enhancements kept \n     P's growth robust.\n       Despite its aggressive expansion around the world, P \n     still needs to win over a healthy percentage of the American \n     population, because the U.S. market remains its biggest and \n     most profitable. In the fiscal year ended June 30, the U.S. \n     delivered about 37% of P's $82.6 billion in annual sales \n     and an estimated 60% of its $11.8 billion in profit. P says \n     that Americans per capita spend about $96 a year on its \n     products, compared with around $4 in China.\n       During the early stages of the recession, P executives \n     defended its long-time approach of making best-in-class \n     products and charging a premium, expecting middle-class \n     Americans to pay up.\n       But cash-strapped shoppers, P learned, aren't as willing \n     to splurge on household staples with extra features. Droves \n     of consumers started switching to cheaper brands, slowing \n     P's sales and profit gains and denting its dominant market \n     share positions.\n       In late 2008, unit sales gains of P's cheaper brands \n     began outpacing its more expensive lines despite receiving \n     far less advertising. As the recession wore on, U.S. market-\n     share gains for P's cheaper Luvs diapers and Gain detergent \n     increased faster than its premium-priced Pampers and Tide \n     brands.\n       At the same time, lower-priced competitors nabbed market \n     share from some of P's biggest brands. P's dominant \n     fabric-softener sheets business, including its Bounce brand, \n     fell five percentage points to 60.2% of the market as lower-\n     priced options from Sun Products Corp. and private-label \n     brands picked up sales from the second quarter of 2008 \n     through May 2011, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis of \n     data from market-research firm SymphonyIRI.\n       P's grasp of the liquid laundry detergent category, led \n     by its iconic Tide brand, also posted a rare slip over the \n     same period as bargain-priced options from Sun and Church & \n     Dwight Co. gained momentum. Even the company's huge Gillette \n     refill razor market suffered, declining to 80.1% by May from \n     82.3% in the second-quarter of 2008, as Energizer Holdings \n     Inc.'s less-expensive Schick brand gained nearly three \n     points.\n       P began changing course in May 2009. After issuing a \n     sharply lower-than-expected earnings forecast for the \n     company's 2010 fiscal year, then-CEO A.G. Lafley said the \n     company would take a ``surgical'' approach to cutting prices \n     on some products and develop more lower-priced goods. ``You \n     have to see reality as it is,'' Mr. Lafley said.\n       When the company's 2009 fiscal year ended a month later, \n     P's sales had posted a rare drop, falling 3% to $76.7 \n     billion.\n       In August that year, P's newly appointed CEO, company \n     veteran Robert McDonald, accelerated the new approach of \n     developing products for high- and low-income consumers.\n       ``We're going to do this both by tiering our portfolio up \n     in terms of value as well as tiering our portfolio down,'' \n     Mr. McDonald said in September 2009.\n       To monitor the evolving American consumer market, P \n     executives study the Gini index, a widely accepted measure of \n     income inequality that ranges from zero, when everyone earns \n     the same amount, to one, when all income goes to only one \n     person. In 2009, the most recent calculation available, the \n     Gini coefficient totaled 0.468, a 20% rise in income \n     disparity over the past 40 years, according to the U.S. \n     Census Bureau.\n       ``We now have a Gini index similar to the Philippines and \n     Mexico--you'd never have imagined that,'' says Phyllis \n     Jackson, P's vice president of consumer market knowledge \n     for North America. ``I don't think we've typically thought \n     about America as a country with big income gaps to this \n     extent.''\n       Over the past two years, P has accelerated its research, \n     product-development and marketing approach to target the \n     newly divided American market.\n       Globally, P divides consumers into three income groups. \n     The highest-earning ``ones'' historically have been the \n     primary bracket P chased in the U.S. as they are the least \n     price sensitive and most swayed by claims of superior product \n     performance. But as the ``twos,'' or lower-income American \n     consumers, grew in size during the recession, P decided to \n     target them aggressively, too. P doesn't specifically \n     target the lowest-income ``threes'' in the U.S., since they \n     comprise a small percentage of the population and such \n     consumers are typically heavily subsidized by government aid.\n       At the high end, it launched its most-expensive skin-care \n     regimen, Olay Pro-X in 2009, which includes a starter kit \n     costing around $60. Previously, the Olay line had topped out \n     around $25. Last year, the company launched Gillette Fusion \n     ProGlide razors at a price of $10 to $12, a premium to \n     Gillette Fusion razors, which sell for $8 to $10, and \n     Gillette Mach3, priced at $8 to $9.\n       At the lower end, its new Gain dish soap, launched last \n     year, can sell for about half per ounce of the company's \n     premium Dawn Hand Renewal dish soap, which hit stores in late \n     2008.\n       Developing products that squarely target the high and low \n     is proving difficult for a company long accustomed to aiming \n     for a giant, mainstream group.\n       Conquering the high end is difficult because it usually \n     involves a smaller quantity of products.\n       ``We do big volumes of things really well,'' said Bruce \n     Brown, P's chief technology officer. ``Things that are \n     smaller quantities, with high appeal, we're learning how to \n     do that.''\n       Likewise, the cost challenges at the bottom of the pyramid \n     are also proving difficult, Mr. Brown said. Over the past two \n     years, P has increased its research of the growing ranks of \n     low-income American households.\n       ``This has been the most humbling aspect of our jobs,'' \n     says Ms. Jackson. ``The numbers of Middle America have been \n     shrinking because people have been getting hurt so badly \n     economically that they've been falling into lower income.''\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I wanted to read a few excerpts from it because I think \nit is instructive about what we are doing.\n\n       P's profits boomed with the increasing affluence of \n     middle-class households in the post-World War II economy. As \n     masses of housewives set up their new suburban homes, P \n     marketers pledged that Tide detergent delivered cleaner \n     clothes, Mr. Clean made floors shinier and Crest toothpaste \n     fought off more cavities. In the decades since, new features \n     like fragrances or ingredient and packaging enhancements kept \n     P's growth robust.\n\n  What is happening now? For generations Proctor & Gamble's growth \nstrategy was focused on developing household staples for the vast \nAmerican middle class. Now, P executives say many of its former \nmiddle-market shoppers are trading down to lower priced goods--widening \nthe pools of have and have-not consumers at the expense of the middle. \nThat has forced P, which estimates it has at least one product--and \nyou heard the list, so this won't be surprising in 98 percent of \nAmerican households--to fundamentally change the way it develops and \nsells its goods.\n  For the first time in 38 years, for example, the company launched a \nnew dish soap in the United States at a bargain price. P's rollout of \nGain Dish Soap says a lot about the health of the middle class. The \nworld's largest maker of consumer products is now betting that the \nsqueeze on middle America will be long lasting.\n  If you needed any example of what our families are struggling with in \nColorado every single day, here is a business plan that is modeled on a \nperpetually shrinking middle class by a company whose whole business \nmodel in their history was based on a rising middle class.\n  I will skip the next one in the interest of time. I will go right to \nthe end. I want to show some numbers. This was the conclusion of the \narticle:\n\n       To monitor the evolving American consumer market, P \n     executives study the Gini index, a widely accepted measure of \n     income inequality that ranges from zero, when everyone earns \n     the same amount, to one when all income goes to only one \n     person. In 2009, the most recent calculation available, the \n     Gini coefficient totaled 0.468, a 20 percent rise in income \n     disparity over the past 40 years, according to the U.S. \n     Census Bureau. ``We now have a Gini index similar to the \n     Philippines and Mexico--you'd never have imagined that,'' \n     says Phyllis Jackson, P's Vice President of consumer market \n     knowledge for North America. ``I don't think we typically \n     thought about America as a country with big income gaps to \n     this extent.''\n\n  I don't think we typically thought about America that way either. It \nis not who we purport to be or who we are\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\ngoing to be. In order to put us on a path that will actually produce a \nrising middle class again, instead of a division among the very wealthy \nat the top and the poorest of the citizens at the bottom, we are going \nto have to come together on some pretty serious choices.\n  I know there have been some who argue that this is all a problem that \nis caused by too many regulations, and I am the first to say we should \nonly have the regulations that we need. Some say the threat of any \nrevenue--even at a time when we are collecting less revenue as a \npercent of our economy than we have over the last 30 years--some are \nsaying any revenue is choking off this recovery.\n  Let me show you something very surprising. This is high-tech Senate \nstuff. Here are some lines on a chart. I know people probably cannot \nsee the detail at home. They can get it on the Web site. This blue \nline, from 1992 to 2010, which is about 20 years, represents what is \ncalled the productivity index. It shows that we have become far more \nproductive as an economy over the last 20 years. It is not surprising \nthat we have, and we have because we have had a technological \nrevolution that has made us more productive.\n  See at the very end where the recession is, look what happened to the \nproductivity index during our recession--because with every single \nmonth that went by we were losing jobs; American business was doing \nwhat they had to do, which was figure out how to get through the \nrecession and get to the other end; how to ring out every efficiency \nthey could, how to make themselves as productive as they could. They \ndid and they have. We are much more productive today than we were here.\n  The green line is our gross domestic product, our Nation's economy \nper capita, the amount of money per person that our economy is \ngenerating. Here is an amazing fact. This is where we were before the \nrecession. This is where we are today. Our economy is the same size \ntoday as it was before we went into the recession. We are producing \nabout the same economic output as a nation that we were producing \nbefore we went into this downturn. I was shocked when I learned this \nnumber.\n  But look at this. Here is our employment level. Here is our \nemployment level today. We have 14 million people unemployed, but we \nare producing about the same as we were before we went into this \nhorrible recession.\n  That is a structural unemployment problem. That is not a problem that \nwill be solved by slogans, and it is not going to be a problem that is \nsolved by companies that have become much more efficient at what they \ndo. It is going to be solved by companies that will be started tomorrow \nand the day after tomorrow--small businesses, venture-backed firms, \npeople who are inventing the technology of the 21st century, the \nproducts and services of the 21st century, not the products and \nservices of the 20th century. That is the only way we are going to put \nthese people back to work. We could be investing in infrastructure too; \nthat would help.\n  This line is median family income, which is what I started this \nconversation with. This is a terrible story. It is not just a sad \nstory, it is a terrible story. That is that line for median family \nincome. It was over $53,000 in 1999. It is $49,000 today. It is almost \n$4,000 less in real dollars in a decade.\n  I could have brought in another slide which shows that this trend has \nactually been going on a little longer than that. Think about that. It \nmeans half of the families in 1999 were earning less than $53,000, and \nhalf were earning more than $53,000. Today half are earning less than \n$49,000 and half are earning more than that.\n  These are folks who have done absolutely everything that anybody ever \nasked them to do. But I don't care whether you are a family or a \nbusiness, it makes it very hard for you to make ends meet if that is \nthe slope that you are on. I argue that we cannot consume one more \ndecade of this new century, with economic policies that are leading us \nhere, and expect to have a vibrant middle class. I want to be in an \neconomy where Procter & Gamble has to change their business model to \ncatch up with a rising middle class, not be in a position that they are \nin today where they believe they have to bet on a falling middle class.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNET. Sure.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I compliment him on this outstanding speech. The hour is \nlate and many colleagues have gone home, so I hope he will send this to \nevery one of our colleagues. It has been a joy for me to stay and \nlisten.\n  The only question I wanted to ask--and we talked about this last \nnight at dinner--here is another interesting fact amid so many that my \ncolleague brought up in this great speech.\n  If we look at that chart, from 1999 to 2007, before the recession \nhit, median income didn't go up.\n  Mr. BENNET. Exactly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is a question we have to ponder. We need great \nminds like the Senator's to figure out the answer. If we just blame the \nrecession and think it will come back up, it won't. The kinds of \nstructural changes my colleague talks about are so needed if we are not \ngoing to have a continually declining middle class, even in a period of \ngrowth. Am I right about that assumption?\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from New York. He is right about \nthat. What he will see on another slide--not tonight--is that we were \nalready on this decline. This is not news to people living in our \nStates. It is not news to people trying to figure out how to make ends \nmeet week by week. This is not news to them. It is not news to the \npeople who came to my townhalls and said they cannot afford to send \ntheir kids to the best schools. They sent their first kid to the fancy \nschool, but they cannot send their second kid there. They are upset \nthat we are not getting done what we ought to be getting done.\n  What we see on this other chart is that this decline was happening \nalready because the economy wasn't lifting all boats, and it was \nwidening in equality terribly. I have things tonight that talk about \nthat. Then the recession accelerated that decline. They lost 2.3 \npercent of median family income in the recession, which is more than \nany of the previous recessions, going back to the Great Depression. So \nthat is how tough this is.\n  The Senator is right. If we keep doing what we have done for the \ndecade that led us into this recession, if we go back to those policies \nand readopt those policies, and that is where we end up, we will \ncontinue to see this slide.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from New York. This gives a sense of \nthe widening inequality that has happened. This is average income, \nwhich is different from median income. The amazing thing is, while \nmiddle-class income has been falling, and it fell throughout this 10 \nyears, average income actually went up because a few people at the very \ntop of the economy did incredibly well over this period of time. They \nhave done incredibly well. This is the very top 1 percent of our \nearners who went from here to up here.\n  The top 1 percent saw that, and here is everybody else. This red line \nis 90 percent of the people in America. Their average income was flat \nfrom 1967 to 2006. That is 90 percent of the people who live in the \nUnited States. It is hard to see how people can get ahead under \ncircumstances like that.\n  It is no wonder that we have these alarming numbers this week from \nthe Census Bureau which show there are 46.2 million Americans now \nliving in poverty. That is a 46-percent increase since 2000. I had to \nlook to make sure I was reading that right. Since 2000, when 31 million \npeople were in poverty, it has gone up to 46 million people in poverty \ntoday, and 22 percent of the children in the United States of America \ntonight are living in poverty. Over one-fifth of the children living in \nthe United States tonight are living in poverty. And, by the way, as a \nformer superintendent of the Denver public schools, I can tell you we \nare not doing ourselves any favors when the chances of a child living \nin poverty in this country graduating from college are roughly 9 in \n100, which is what their chances are today. Ninety-one out of one \nhundred poor kids in the country can't expect to get a college degree; \ncan't expect to be anywhere but on the margin of our democracy or our \neconomy. I wonder what effect that will have on our median family \nincome going forward.\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\n  This is the last slide, because I know the hour is late, and it is \none that was in the Washington Post. I am not going to bother to \ndescribe the details, but you can find it on the Web site and it is \nworth looking at. It is worth looking at.\n  This red line--and it is the only thing I will talk about from this \nslide--shows what the bottom 90 percent--and it seems ridiculous to \ntalk about the bottom 90 percent--what the 90 percent of earners in \nthis country earned as a percentage of the income that everybody earned \nin the United States from before the 1920s to today, essentially. For \nthe vast majority of time or some majority of time in the period from \nWorld War II--the end of World War II--until the present, the bottom 90 \npercent of earners earned roughly 70 percent of the income in the \nUnited States--a majority of the income, 70 percent of the income--for \na long time. Now they are earning roughly 50 percent. The bottom 90 \npercent is earning roughly 50 percent of the income. That means, by the \nway, the other 10 percent are earning roughly 50 percent of the income. \nThat is how it is distributed. It is a unique moment in the country's \nhistory, actually, uniquely unbalanced. In fact, we have to go back to \n1928--the year before the market crashed, the year before Black Friday, \nthe year before our financial markets collapsed and put us into the \nGreat Depression--to find income disparity that looks like the income \ndisparity we face today.\n  In my view, the 20th century represented a period in this country's \nhistory of limitless opportunity, limitless economic growth, limitless \neducational attainment. Our democracy succeeded in generating an \neconomy that gave everybody a fighting chance. Maybe a definition of \nwhether we are giving people a fighting chance is whether middle-class \nincome is rising or falling. Now we are in a period where it is falling \nand we find ourselves in the position of producing the same domestic \nproduct we were producing before this recession with 14 million more \npeople unemployed.\n  The economists tell us we have recovered, that we are in a recovery. \nThe technical definition is that we are in a recovery because the \ntechnical definition is based on whether GDP is growing. That is a very \ncruel definition of recovery for the 14 million people who are \nunemployed. It is a very cruel definition of recovery for a middle \nclass that is getting wiped out because median family income is \nfalling.\n  Look, the people who live in Colorado, notwithstanding all of this, \nare optimistic. They are optimistic about their communities and they \nare optimistic about their families. It gets tougher and tougher, but \nthey rise to the occasion. And you know what. That is what they are \nasking us to do. They are asking us to knock off the political games \nthat seem to be only about Washington and seem to have nothing to do \nwith the challenges they face.\n  Today was a good day here. I was pleased. It has been a long time. I \nwas pleased to join my senior Senator and about 30 other Democrats and \nRepublicans at an event to say it is time for us to think big about \nsolving this country's fiscal challenges and that we are anxious to \nwork together to do it. We are anxious to create a comprehensive plan \nto deal with it. We should be taking exactly the same approach on jobs.\n  Getting our fiscal house in order is incredibly important to \nencourage and inspire confidence in our markets and confidence in our \nbusinesses and confidence in our local economies. But our work won't \nstop there. We need to reinvent our Tax Code so it is driving \ninnovation and driving a rising middle class. We need to reimagine our \nregulatory code so it is doing the same. We need to educate the \nchildren in this country so they can take on the jobs of the 21st \ncentury, because the jobs of the 20th century are not coming back. We \nwill be waiting in vain for those jobs to come back.\n  The people in my meetings back in Colorado are demanding--that is the \nright way to say it, they are demanding--we work together. Our State is \na third Republican, a third Independent, and a third Democrat, but they \nare Coloradans before any of that, and they are Americans maybe even \nbefore that, and it is time for us to meet their standard.\n  Tonight we had votes on the reauthorization of FEMA--our emergency \nagency--to respond to the incredible tragedies that have happened \naround the country. It got 62 votes and we were able to pass it. We had \na vote on the transportation extension, the FAA reauthorization, and I \nthink the vote was 92 to 6, with Democrats and Republicans moving this \ncountry forward. That is what we have to do in order to get this \neconomy going again. The people in Colorado today are saying: We want \nmore of that and less of the bickering, more problem solving and less \nfinger pointing. My hope is that on an occasion such as today, when we \nactually have made some progress, no matter how limited, it may give us \nthe chance to move forward together.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Chair's endurance and allowing me to \nspeak on the floor tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5676-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMBATING AUTISM\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to address a very important issue \nthat is currently before the Senate. This past Tuesday I submitted a \nbill to the Senate--the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act, S. 1094--\nfor a unanimous consent agreement. Since then, the Republicans have \nblocked this bi-partisan bill from passing. The Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee reported this legislation unanimously on \nSeptember 7, 2011.\n  My legislation is a simple 3-year extension of the Combating Autism \nAct, CAA, of 2006. This original legislation was passed out of the \nSenate by unanimous consent on December 7, 2006, and signed into law \nshortly thereafter. This landmark legislation included provisions \nrelating to the diagnosis and treatment of persons with autism spectrum \ndisorders, ASD, and expanded and intensified biomedical research on \nautism, including a focus on possible environmental causes. \nAdditionally, it provides for detailed surveillance by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, of the increasing prevalence of \nautism spectrum disorders, ASD. The Act also reconstitutes the \nInteragency Autism Coordinating Committee to advise the Secretary, \ncoordinate the federal response to autism and develop the annual \nstrategic plan for autism research.\n  I am greatly disappointed that my colleagues on the other side are \nplaying politics with this bill. On September 30, just a couple of \nshort weeks from now, the programs authorized under the CAA sunset, and \nwith them the myriad programs which have helped families better \nunderstand, treat and live with ASD. Now is not the time for politics. \nNow is the time to reauthorize the Combating Autism Act so families \nliving with ASD can continue receiving the care and support they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5676-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5676-S5679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr LUGAR. Mr. President, September 16 is National POW/MIA Recognition \nDay.\n  Throughout history, American men and women have stood up to defend \nfreedom by courageous and selfless service across the world. Today, \n46,010 American men and women are actively engaged in uniform in Iraq \nwith a total of 84,310 deployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on \nbases, and air stations in the region supporting Iraq operations. Mr. \nPresident, 98,900 military personnel are deployed in Afghanistan, with \na total of 131,900 deployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on \nbases, and air stations in the region supporting Afghanistan \noperations. Others are engaged in Libya operations. All are fighting to \nensure our security here at home, to protect the life and liberty of \nour friends and allies, and to promote American values.\n  Amidst the current economic crisis and countless other challenges, \none thing is clear, members of Congress and the executive branch cannot \nbecome distracted from a commitment to ensure the return of POWs and \nMIAs at the end of hostilities. This commitment must continue through \npainstaking on-site investigations, diplomatic negotiations and \ncomplete examinations of records following a conflict.\n  As we look forward with resolve, I would like to recognize the work \nthat the many POW/MIA organizations have done, led by the Department of \nDefense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, DPMO. The painstaking \nwork of\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nrecovery operations has, since January, seen the return of 32 Americans \nfrom World War II and the war in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, 1,683 \nremain unaccounted for at this time from SEA, 1,292 from Vietnam alone. \nLast year, those numbers stood at 1,703 and 1,305 respectively.\n  This June, in an effort to recover nine American servicemembers from \ncrash sites in Laos, 25 Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, JPAC, \nrecovery members deployed, marking the 119th Joint Field Activity \nconducted. As a member of U.S. Pacific Command, JPAC is an organization \nof over 400 military and civilian specialists whose mission is to \nreturn America's heroes home and achieve the fullest possible \naccountability of Americans lost in our Nation's past conflicts.\n  In Korea, where the fighting ended in 1953, progress continues. This \nyear, Joint Recovery Operations have been conducted in North Korea \nresulting in the recovery of seven Americans to their families and \nfinal resting places. Two have been identified from World War II \nrecoveries. Teams from the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory \nin Hawaii continue to implement cutting-edge DNA technology, and as \nrenowned experts in the field, have contributed their know-how and \ndirect assistance to the operations in New York and the Pentagon.\n  JPAC announced on August 12 that teams had been recently deployed to \nVietnam, Canada, Vanuatu, Germany and Papua New Guinea to search for \nAmericans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War and World War II.\n  The deployment to Vietnam, the 104th joint field activity to that \ncountry, has approximately 35 team members who will search for five \nAmericans at burial and aircraft crash sites in three provinces. They \nexpect to spend 35 days on the mission.\n  Separately, JPAC team members and Navy divers from Virginia Beach, \nVa. have deployed to Newfoundland province in Canada to search for \nthree Americans that remain unaccounted-for from a World War II \naircraft crash. The team will conduct underwater excavations for 30 \ndays at the crash site.\n  We must also be vigilant on the topic of American POWs and North \nKorea, and I have encouraged the Obama administration to include this \nimportant issue in any talks with North Korea.\n  As we all know, this is a team effort requiring the commitment and \ndedication of the Congress, the administration, the Departments of \nDefense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the NSA. I am hopeful \nthat all of us, through continued humanitarian support and dedicated \ndiplomatic endeavors will gain further information about the servicemen \nstill missing to honor their sacrifice and provide peace and solace to \ntheir loved ones. You are not forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of Indiana's missing and unaccounted for from the Korea and \nVietnam wars.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                 VIETNAM/SOUTHEAST ASIA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Date of\n              Name                 incident        Status             Rank             Branch               Country                 Home of record\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBancroft, William W.

Today, five remarkable women are being accepted \ninto this fellowship where they will join the 35 postdoctoral women \nscientists from across the United States who came before them.\n  I would like to recognize each of these five women: Dr. Trisha \nAndrew, for research in organic electronics with the possibility of \nimproving the performance of polymer-based solar cells; Dr. Karlin \nBark, for work in haptic feedback that aims to help retrain the motor \npathways of stroke survivors; Dr. Sasha Devore, a neuroscientist \nstudying sensory processing which could lead to understanding numerous \nneurological diseases and disorders; Dr. Regan Blythe Towal, a \nbiomedical engineer working to understand information processing of the \nnervous system thus leading to improved robotic technologies; and, Dr. \nTijana Ivanovic, a virologist working on how viruses, such as \ninfluenza, enter into cells. These women are truly an inspiration to us \nall.\n  Please join me in honoring these five extraordinary women and the \nL'Oreal USA for Women in Science Fellowship Program for striving to \nraise awareness of women's contributions in the field of scientific \nresearch and serving as strong female role models for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5679-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5679-S5680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WOLFGANG MATTES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, I honor a son of Michigan, Mr. \nWolfgang ``Wolf'' Mattes, a loving husband, dedicated father, caring \nfriend, and stalwart patriot. Mr. Mattes will celebrate his 80th \nbirthday on Sunday, September 18.\n  Mr. Mattes is a dedicated public servant who has selflessly served \nhis country, State and community in various capacities for nearly six \ndecades. Known as an honest, warm, and generous man, Mr. Mattes chose a \ncareer as a public servant and worked for the city of Detroit for many \nyears, where he retired as the supervising naturalist at the Belle Isle \nNature Center. Wolf is a wildlife conservationist at heart and spent \ncountless hours rehabilitating wild animals and protecting their \nhabitat. Additionally, when his country called, he did not hesitate to \nrespond and proudly served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war.\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\n  An avid sports fan and athlete, Wolf worked as an usher at Tiger and \nOlympia Stadiums. At Olympia Stadium, he was the guard for the Red \nWing's locker room and bench and was known as ``Wolfie on the bench'' \nby the players. After Olympia Stadium closed, the Detroit Red Wings \nbrought him with them to Joe Louis Arena, where he worked in the press \nbox.\n  Mr. Mattes understands the value and importance of community service, \nand his many efforts have been fittingly honored through his selection \nas a volunteer and firefighter of the year, Kiwanis volunteer of the \nyear, and Elk volunteer of the year.\n  On Sunday, we will all look back and see the hallmarks of a life well \nlived. He is beloved not for a litany of accomplishments, but simply \nfor who he is. Beneath a humble exterior lies a generous and kind soul. \nHis quiet determination, unfailing kindness, and unyielding spirit have \nmade him a pillar not only of a proud and loving family, but of all who \nhave come to know him.\n  He remains the dedicated husband to his lovely bride Barb, whom he \nmet at Michigan State on a blind date over 52 years ago, and he has \nbeen a wonderful father to his adoring daughters Erika Lynn Mattes \nRebbe, Heidi Leigh Mattes Mason, Brigitte Beth Mattes Cooper, and Inger \nAnn Mattes Griffin.\n  Today, we offer heartfelt congratulations to Wolf as he celebrates \nhis 80th birthday. This is truly a joyous occasion. His unending love \nof family, friends, and country, as well as his devotion to those who \nhave had the privilege of knowing him serve as inspiration to all.\n  Happy birthday, Wolf. May you enjoy happiness, good fortune, and good \nhealth for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5680-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ADMIRAL ERNEST JOSEPH KING\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to speak today as citizens \nof Lorain County, OH soon gather to honor one of their favorite sons, \nADM Ernest Joseph King, an American hero, who served as commander in \nchief of the U.S. Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations during World War \nII.\n  This Sunday, September 18, 2011, Admiral King's memory will be \nhonored with a Lorain elementary school named in his honor. An open \ngreen space, in the shape of an anchor, will be dedicated directly \nacross the street from the admiral's birthplace, a home at 113 Hamilton \nAvenue that still stands today. Both the elementary school and the \ngreen space will remind future generations of the admiral's \ncontributions to our country and the personal traits that made him an \nAmerican hero: tenacity, love of country, fearlessness.\n  Ernest Joseph King was born in Lorain on November 23, 1878, to \nElizabeth and James Clydesdale King. He was the older brother to two \nsisters and two brothers. Admiral King attended Lorain High School and \ngraduated fourth in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1901. \nStill enrolled at the Naval Academy, he served in the Spanish American \nWar. In 1905, he married Martha Lankin Edgerton in Baltimore, with whom \nhe raised six daughters and a son. King was known to return to Lorain \nthroughout his life to visit his childhood friends.\n  After his distinguished service in World War I, in 1927, he became a \nnaval aviator, and only 6 years later, he was made chief of the Bureau \nof Aeronautics of the U.S. Navy, where he made patrol bombers an \nessential naval arm. He was appointed by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt in World War II as chief of the U.S. Fleet and Chief of Naval \nOperations, taking the post only 2 weeks after the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. He earned his nickname, Eagle Eye Ernie, by possessing \nboundless energy, and being a strict disciplinarian.\n  He retired from the Navy as a decorated officer, having been awarded \n10 medals and 14 Foreign Awards, including the Navy Distinguished \nService Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. Upon Admiral \nKing's passing, on June 25, 1956, President Eisenhower remarked: \n``Admiral King carried his heavy responsibility with courage, \nbrilliance and continued devotion to duty.''\n  This weekend, the city of Lorain, the Black River Historical Society, \nCharleston Village Society, Lorain City Schools, along with several \nmembers of Admiral King's family will join together to honor the legacy \nof an American hero. For school children who will attend Admiral King \nElementary School, and for all Lorain residents who will pass by his \nhome on Hamilton Avenue, let us remember the lessons of Admiral Ernest \nJoseph King, that patriotism and service forever anchors the greatness \nof our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5680-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SHELLY FAGENSTROM\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I recognize Shelly \nFagenstrom, an outstanding educator from my home State of Montana. \nShelly is the principal of East Middle School in Great Falls and has \nbeen recognized by the Montana Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals as the Montana Principal of the Year for 2011.\n  Shelly has taught and served as an administrator in the Great Falls \nschool system for 38 years; all but 2 of those have been at the middle \nschool level. She has been the principal at East Middle School since \n2005 and prior to that served for 6 years as the principal at Paris \nGibson Middle School. This isn't the first time Shelly has been honored \nfor her dedication to her students--in 2010 she was named Educator of \nthe Year by the Montana Parent Teacher Association.\n  In nominating her for these awards, teachers, staff, students, and \nparents have praised Shelly's work to build a respectful environment at \nEast Middle School while creating a personalized learning environment \nfor each student, her ability to collaborate and seek innovative \nsolutions to complex problems. Shelly has also worked to integrate more \ntechnology into the curriculum to help prepare students for the \nchallenges of the 21st century economy. Shelly says she loves being in \neducation, ``because of the relationships you build with kids and their \nfamilies. I love the energy of middle-schoolers, you can't take \nyourself too seriously with them.''\n  Shelly is also involved in the Great Falls community volunteering for \nthe United Way and serving in leadership positions at Central Christian \nChurch. This month Shelly will be visiting Washington, DC, with other \naward-winning principals when they will be recognized for their hard \nwork and achievement in educating and preparing our children for the \nfuture, and have the opportunity to share ideas on how to strengthen \nour education system.\n  I congratulate Shelly on being named the 2011 Montana Principal of \nthe Year and thank her for her decades of service to the Great Falls \nschool system. Montana has some of the best teachers, principals, and \nschool administrators in the country. I would like to commend all of \nthem for their hard work and dedication in providing young Montanans \nwith a world class education that prepares them for a bright \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5680-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5680-S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 65th \nwedding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Virgil Poe, the parents of my good \nfriend serving the 2nd District of Texas, Congressman Ted Poe.\n  In the summer of 1945, following his service in Germany in the Second \nWorld War, TSgt Virgil Poe was stationed at the US Army Post in Fort \nHood, TX, re-equipping and preparing for a possible land invasion of \nJapan. At the same time, Miss Dorrace Hill was serving the local Army \nhospital as a volunteer for the Red Cross. On a Wednesday night during \nthat summer of 1945, Virgil met Dorrace at a prayer meeting church \nservice. The next year, the couple was married on October 16, 1946.\n  Virgil and Dorrace began their wedded life operating a DX service \nstation where Virgil pumped gas, sold tires, and fixed cars. Soon \nthereafter, they moved to Abilene, TX, where Virgil enrolled at Abilene \nChristian University. While there, he supported his family and paid his \ntuition by working nights for Southwestern Bell and KRBC Radio.\n  After college, the Poes moved to Houston, where Virgil and Dorrace\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nraised Ted and Jayne. Virgil worked for more than 40 years as an \nengineer at the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, and the Poes were \nactive members of the Memorial Church of Christ.\n  Virgil and Dorrace's marriage is rooted in faith and love. The Poes \nare celebrating 65 years of marriage surrounded by their beloved \nfamily, including their son Ted and his wife Carol and their daughter \nJayne, their 8 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren. Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to honor the 65th wedding anniversary of Virgil \nand Dorrace Poe, and join with their family and friends in recognizing \nthem on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5681-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING HENRY TAUB\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I speak today in commemoration \nof the life of Henry Taub, founder of ADP in 1949 at 21 years of age. \nHe was 19 years old when he received his degree in accounting from NYU.\n  The company then called Automatic Payrolls was started with a loan of \n$5,000.\n  Henry Taub and I became acquainted in 1952 when we both worked in a \nbuilding in Paterson, NJ where Henry's payroll service company was \nbased. Our occasional contact served to familiarize me with a vital \nservice to businesses large and small.\n  It was in 1952 that I joined this fledgling organization to become \nits first salesman and early on a senior member of management. Henry, \nhis brother Joseph Taub, and I worked well together, and the business \nbegan the growth that would lead ultimately to a status few companies \nachieve.\n  Today ADP employs over 45,000 people in 23 countries and holds the \nrecord for at least 10 percent growth in profits each year for 42 years \nin a row. It is a record unmatched by any other publicly held company. \nIt is now also only one of four companies in our country to qualify as \na AAA rated company.\n  Thirty years at ADP in various assignments as head of marketing, \npresident, chairman, and CEO of ADP brought me to think my experience \nmight be of value for service in the public interest. In that \nconnection I decided to try to win a seat in the U.S. Senate. Good \nfortune came my way, and in 1982 I won a first term as a Senator.\n  My business experience and background credentials were principal \nissues in a tough campaign. I learned a great deal over the three \ndecades at ADP, but a major factor in that success was my good luck to \nhave worked side by side with Henry Taub.\n  Henry was an unusually talented individual. He had superb instincts \nbuoyed by extraordinary intelligence. His modesty was widely known, and \na subtle demeanor was included. He was a strategic thinker and \nresponded calmly and directly with problem solving.\n  Additionally, he had an outstanding ability to bring people to his \nviews, earning enormous respect and allegiance. He was highly moral and \nhonest and encouraged trust in all who knew him. He was without \ntrappings, and with Henry Taub his word was his bond. He shared \naffection and deep love with family and friends and could always be \ncounted upon for straight answers when questions arose.\n  Henry Taub was my junior by a few years, but through more than 50 \nyears of friendship, his high personal standards set a target for \ndecency and quality in life. He will long be remembered as an example \nfor others to follow and I remain extremely grateful for his \ncontributions to my life.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record, a copy of the obituary that \nappeared in the New York Times at the time of his passing.\n  The information follows.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2011]\n\n  Henry Taub, a Founder of a Payroll Firm That Became a Global Giant, \n                               Dies at 83\n\n                            (By Duff Wilson)\n\n       Henry Taub, a founder of the payroll company that grew into \n     the global giant Automatic Data Processing, died on Thursday \n     in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Tenafly, N.J.\n       The cause was complications of leukemia, his son Steven \n     said.\n       For many years Mr. Taub was also a co-owner of the New \n     Jersey Nets.\n       Starting in 1949 in an office above a Paterson, N.J., ice \n     cream parlor and then in a hotel basement, Mr. Taub and his \n     brother, Joseph, built the company on a reputation for \n     precision and timeliness. They were joined in the early years \n     by an aspiring salesman who had been their childhood friend--\n     Frank R. Lautenberg, now a Democratic senator from New \n     Jersey.\n       ``The idea was not a brilliant idea, it was a good idea, \n     but what we did in terms of hard work made it,'' Senator \n     Lautenberg said in an interview on Sunday. ``Lots of seven-\n     day workweeks, lots of 12-hour days.''\n       Today, A.D.P, based in Roseland, N.J., has annual sales of \n     more than $9 billion and about 550,000 clients and is one of \n     the world's largest providers of business services. Back \n     then, however, it was a shoestring operation: the Taubs often \n     delivered payrolls by bus and cleaned their own offices at \n     night.\n       ``Each of us had a function,'' Senator Lautenberg said. \n     ``Henry was the strategic one in the firm and designed the \n     system, and Joe managed the operation, and I was the \n     marketer, the salesman.''\n       The company, initially called Automatic Payrolls, changed \n     its name to Automatic Data Processing in 1958 and went public \n     in 1961. The timing was perfect because I.B.M. had recently \n     begun marketing an attractively priced business computer \n     system that increased A.D.P.'s capabilities.\n       Mr. Taub was president of the company from 1949 to 1970, \n     chairman and chief executive from 1970 to 1977 and chairman \n     from 1977 to 1985. He was an honorary board chairman since \n     then. Senator Lautenberg left the company in 1983 after \n     winning election to the United States Senate. He is now the \n     longest-serving senator in New Jersey history.\n       Mr. Taub and his brother were among seven local businessmen \n     who were co-owners of the struggling Nets franchise in the \n     National Basketball Association for almost 20 years. The Nets \n     suffered injuries, coaching changes, many losses and \n     bickering among the owners, who were known as the Secaucus \n     Seven. When the owners tried to turn things around in 1996, \n     they selected the well-liked Mr. Taub as chairman. Two years \n     later, they sold the team to another group of New Jersey \n     businessmen.\n       Henry Taub was born in Paterson on Sept. 20, 1927, the son \n     of a junk dealer, and was raised in a working-class \n     neighborhood there. ``The streets were just filled with \n     people and kids and debate and excitement and, from my point \n     of view, intellectual fervor,'' he said in a 1996 interview \n     with The New York Times.\n       After skipping two grades in public school, Mr. Taub \n     graduated from New York University with a degree in \n     accounting in three years at 19 and joined an accounting \n     practice. When a client, a clothing business, did not issue \n     paychecks one week because of an illness, causing an employee \n     walkout, Mr. Taub had the idea for a new business: payroll \n     processing.\n       Mr. Taub retired from A.D.P. in the mid-1980s, when the \n     company said it was processing paychecks for a 10th of the \n     nation's work force. Afterward he became involved in an array \n     of community, philanthropic and other business endeavors. \n     With his wife he created the Henry and Marilyn Taub \n     Foundation, with assets estimated at $150 million.\n       He financed the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's \n     Disease and the Aging Brain at Columbia University, the Taub \n     Center for Israel Studies at New York University and the Taub \n     Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel in Jerusalem.\n       Among other activities, he was president of the American \n     Technion Society, the United States affiliate of an Israeli \n     institute of technology, and was chairman of the institute's \n     international board of governors. He was chairman of the \n     United Israel Appeal from 1986 to 1990.\n       He was also a trustee of New York University and served on \n     the boards of Rite-Aid, Hasbro, Bank Leumi and Trust Company \n     of New York, Interfaith Hunger Appeal and the New York \n     Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater.\n       Mr. Taub is survived by his brother, Joseph; his wife of 53 \n     years, Marilyn; their three children, Judith Gold, Steven and \n     Ira; and 10 grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5681-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5681-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5682-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT TO CONGRESS RELATIVE TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE'S \n  CERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 8 OF THE FISHERMAN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF \n   1967, AS AMENDED (THE ``PELLY AMENDMENT'') (22 U.S.C. 1978) THAT \n NATIONALS OF ICELAND HAVE CONDUCTED WHALING ACTIVITIES THAT DIMINISH \n    THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) \n                      CONSERVATION PROGRAM--PM 21\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On July 19, 2011, Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke certified under \nsection 8 of the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967, as amended (the \n``Pelly Amendment'') (22 U.S.C. 1978), that nationals of Iceland are \nconducting whaling activities that diminish the effectiveness of the \nInternational Whaling Commission (IWC) conservation program. This \nmessage constitutes my report to the Congress consistent with \nsubsection (b) of the Pelly Amendment.\n  In 1982, the IWC set catch limits for all commercial whaling at zero. \nThis decision, known as the commercial whaling moratorium, is in effect \ntoday. Iceland abided by the moratorium until 1992, when it withdrew \nfrom the IWC. In 2002, Iceland rejoined the IWC with a reservation to \nthe moratorium on commercial whaling. In 2003, Iceland began a lethal \nscientific research whaling program. In 2004, Secretary of Commerce \nDonald L. Evans certified Iceland under the Pelly Amendment for lethal \nscientific research whaling. When Iceland resumed commercial whaling in \n2006, Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez retained Iceland's certification, \nwhich remains in effect today.\n  Iceland's commercial harvest of fin whales escalated dramatically \nover the past few years. In addition, Iceland recently resumed \nexporting whale products. Of particular concern to the United States, \nIceland harvested 125 endangered fin whales in 2009 and 148 in 2010, a \nsignificant increase from the total of 7 fin whales it commercially \nharvested between 1987 and 2007.\n  Iceland's sole fin whaling company, Hvalur hf, suspended its fin \nwhaling due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, where it exports \nits whale meat. Despite this suspension, Iceland continues to permit \nwhaling and has a government issued fin whale quota in effect for the \n2011 season that continues to exceed catch levels that the IWC's \nscientific body advised would be sustainable if the moratorium was \nremoved. This continues to present a threat to the conservation of fin \nwhales. Further, Icelandic nationals continue to hunt minke whales \ncommercially and Iceland's exports of whale meat to Japan reportedly \nincreased significantly in both March and April 2011.\n  Iceland's actions threaten the conservation status of an endangered \nspecies and undermine multilateral efforts to ensure greater worldwide \nprotection for whales. Iceland's increased commercial whaling and \nrecent trade in whale products diminish the effectiveness of the IWC's \nconservation program because: (1) Iceland's commercial harvest of \nwhales undermines the moratorium on commercial whaling put in place by \nthe IWC to protect plummeting whale stocks; (2) the fin whale harvest \ngreatly exceeds catch levels that the IWC's scientific body advised \nwould be sustainable if the moratorium were removed; and (3) Iceland's \nharvests are not likely to be brought under IWC management and control \nat sustainable levels through multilateral efforts at the IWC.\n  In his letter of July 19, 2011, Secretary Locke expressed his concern \nfor these actions, and I share these concerns. To ensure that this \nissue continues to receive the highest level of attention, I direct: \n(1) relevant U.S. delegations attending meetings with Icelandic \nofficials and senior Administration officials visiting Iceland to raise \nU.S. concerns regarding commercial whaling by Icelandic companies and \nseek ways to halt such action; (2) Cabinet secretaries to evaluate the \nappropriateness of visits to Iceland depending on continuation of the \ncurrent suspension of fin whaling; (3) the Department of State to \nexamine Arctic cooperation projects, and where appropriate, link U.S. \ncooperation to the Icelandic government changing its whaling policy and \nabiding by the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling; (4) the \nDepartments of Commerce and State to consult with other international \nactors on efforts to end Icelandic commercial whaling and have Iceland \nabide by the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling; (5) the Department \nof State to inform the Government of Iceland that the United States \nwill continue to monitor the activities of Icelandic companies that \nengage in commercial whaling; and (6) relevant U.S. agencies to \ncontinue to examine other options for responding to continued whaling \nby Iceland.\n  I concur with the Secretary of Commerce's recommendation to pursue \nthe use of non-trade measures and that the actions outlined above are \nthe appropriate course of action to address this issue. Accordingly, I \nam not directing the Secretary of the Treasury to impose trade measures \non Icelandic products for the whaling activities that led to the \ncertification by the Secretary of Commerce. However, to ensure that \nthis issue continues to receive the highest level of attention, I am \ndirecting the Departments of State and Commerce to continue to keep the \nsituation under review and continue to urge Iceland to cease its \ncommercial whaling activities. Further, within 6 months, or immediately \nupon the resumption of fin whaling by Icelandic nationals, I have \ndirected relevant departments and agencies to report to me through the \nDepartments of State and Commerce on their actions. I believe these \nactions hold the most promise of effecting a reduction in Iceland's \ncommercial whaling activities.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 15, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5682-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the deductibility of charitable contributions to agricultural \nresearch organizations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Agriculture is one of the key forces \ndriving Oklahoma's economy. In 2008 alone, Oklahoma's agriculture \nindustry directly supported 188,000 jobs and contributed more than $8.5 \nbillion to the States's economy. The importance of agriculture to the \nNation's economy is also difficult to understate, and the industry's \nproducts rank among the top exports each year. This year, USDA \nestimates that U.S. farmers and livestock producers will export nearly \n$140 billion in goods to nearly every country on Earth.\n  Knowing that strength, it is not surprising that the industry is a \nhotbed of innovation. The agriculture community has long been involved \nin the research and development of better crops and farming methods. \nThis work has produced crops that are resistant to drought and certain \nfarming chemicals, are packed with more and better nutrients, and \nultimately provide higher yields for every acre farmed. This research \nwill only grow in importance as the global population continues to grow \nand demand more food. Fortunately, the United States is leading the \nworld in this effort.\n  Oklahoma is also a key agriculture R player in the United States. \nThis is in large part due to the work of the Samuel R. Noble \nFoundation. Headquartered in Ardmore, OK, the Noble Foundation is one \nof the top 50 private foundations in the United States, and the \nfoundation employs hundreds of scientists, agriculture consultants, and \nresearch personnel who are actively researching better agriculture \nproducts and practices. Between 2009 and 2010, the foundation spent \nnearly $80 million on agriculture research activities, and this work \nhas recently resulted in development of Texoma MaxQ II, a cool-weather \nfescue grass that will reduce the reliance of livestock producers upon \ncostly hay and feed for their livestock during the winter months. I \ncongratulate the Noble Foundation on this breakthrough and look forward \nto hearing about the future benefits of this research.\n  The Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that food \nproductivity will need to expand by 70 percent over the next 40 years \nto meet rising global demand. This underscores the need for continued \nfunding for agriculture research and development so that more \nbreakthroughs like those at the Noble Foundation occur. Today, a \nsubstantial amount of agriculture research funding is provided by the \nFederal Government; however, the government's share is declining. Since \nfiscal year 2010, Federal funding for agriculture research has \ndecreased by nearly $200 million, and further cuts are likely as we try \nto tackle the national debt. Because government is scaling down its \nrole, Congress should do what it can to encourage the private sector to \nfill the gap.\n  One way that we can do this is with the Charitable Agriculture \nResearch Act, of which I am a cosponsor. This bill, introduced today by \nSenators Stabenow and Thune, will allow the creation of Agricultural \nResearch Organization, ARO, which would extend public charity tax \nstatus to entities conducting continuous agriculture R in \ncollaboration with land-grant universities and agriculture colleges.\n  Currently, several organizations conducting research focused on \nagriculture are structured as private foundations. This is one of the \ntwo main types of charities that are provided with beneficial tax \ntreatment under U.S. law. Public charities--the other type--are given \nfull tax exempt status, but because private foundations are often very \nlarge and supported by a small group of donors, they are not completely \ntax free and must pay taxes on the investment income earned by their \nendowments. Donors are also prevented from collecting their full \ndeduction on gifts relative to those made to public charities. Because \nof these restrictions, the United States is not reaching its full \npotential when it comes to attracting private dollars for agriculture \nresearch.\n  The Charitable Agriculture Research Act seeks to encourage \nindividuals and families of wealth to contribute more of their assets \nto public agricultural research by working in conjunction with the \nNation's land-grant universities and non land-grant colleges of \nagriculture. This legislation will provide donors with an additional \noption\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nof where to direct their agriculture research and development \ndonations.\n  This beneficial tax treatment does not come without restrictions. To \nmaintain its tax exempt status, an ARO must conduct research and \ndevelopment on agriculture issues in conjunction with a land-grant \nuniversity or an agriculture college. An ARO must either commit more \nthan 50 percent of its assets to the continuous active conduct of \nagriculture research or it must expend at least 3.5 percent of its \nendowment for the same in each calendar year. These restrictions are \nput in place to ensure that the ARO structure is not being abused as a \ntax shelter for the accumulated personal wealth of an ARO's \nbenefactors.\n  Over the past decade many families with a passion for agricultural \nresearch have expressed their desire to do for their geographies and \ntheir crops of interest what the Noble Foundation has done for \nOklahoma, forages, and beef cattle operations. However, the tax code is \nnot conducive to such efforts and discourages them from maximizing \ntheir contributions to agricultural research.\n  The ARO tax structure is modeled after the extremely successful \nMedical Research Organization model. Similar to AROs, these charities \nmust do their medical research in conjunction with a non-profit or \ngovernment hospital. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the \nStowers Institute for Medical Research are prime examples of MROs. The \nMRO structure has made these organizations more effective and \nproductive, and I expect no less from the ARO tax structure.\n  This bill will directly benefit Oklahoma by building on its legacy as \na leader in agriculture R As better agricultural methods and crop \nyields are produced in Oklahoma, the State will continue to serve as a \nglobal leader in agriculture. Oklahoma is home to 86,000 farms that \noccupy 80 percent of the State's land area. The State has the land, the \nnatural resources, and the facilities necessary to enhance agricultural \nresearch. The creation of AROs will help attract the necessary private \ncapital to build on this success and boost research at our Nation's \nland-grant universities and non land-grant colleges of agriculture.\n  AROs will not be provided with a new tax incentive or a benefit \ngreater than existing charitable organizations. They will, however, \noffer individuals an additional choice of where to send their \ncharitable dollars. When individuals donate to AROs they will have \ncertainty that their money will contribute directly to agriculture \nresearch rather than to other causes, which are guarantees not provided \nby most other charitable organizations. As we face deeper budget cuts \non everything from education to agriculture research, we need to take \nthe steps to encourage the private sector to step into the void left by \nWashington. AROs will help do this in the agriculture R community, so \nI urge its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts):\n  S. 1563. A bill to require the President's budget to include, at a \nminimum, a request for disaster funding based on the 10 year average; \nto the Committee on the Budget.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Safeguarding \nDisaster Funding Act of 2011, which I am introducing along with Senator \nBrown from Massachusetts. This legislation would amend the \nCongressional Budget Act and the Budget Control Act to require the \nPresident to provide a more comprehensive view of disaster funding in \nhis annual budget request.\n  Our bill would ensure that the true cost of disaster assistance is \nreflected in the President's budget, by requiring that Presidents' \nannual budget requests for disaster programs include funding levels \nequal to the average amount provided annually over the previous ten \nyears, excluding the highest and lowest years, to account for years \nwith unusually high or low disaster activity.\n  As disaster funding is already considered ``no-year'' money, unused \nmonies would carry over to support years where additional funds are \nrequired. The status quo of Congress providing emergency appropriations \nto support these efforts, rather than including reasonable estimates, \nbased on past disaster activity trends, is fiscally irresponsible. We \nshould be working with the Administration to fund the necessary and \nappropriate activities of the Federal government, including disaster \nassistance. Responsible budgeting for disasters is the right thing to \ndo for the victims of devastation, as the vivid images of the damage \nfrom Hurricane Irene have reminded us.\n  Hurricane Irene caused more than 4.5 million homes and businesses \nalong the East Coast to lose power, including nearly 185,000 in my home \nState of Maine, which suffered flooding and washed out bridges in the \nWestern portion of the state. But now that the winds and rain have \nsubsided, our cities and towns must rebuild from the devastation.\n  With the Federal Emergency Management Agency's funding currently \nrunning unnecessarily low, they now must work on an ``immediate needs \nfunding'' basis, meaning that non-emergency recovery projects are put \non hold. Support of natural disaster recovery should not be stalled by \nthe need for Emergency Supplemental Appropriations. While we cannot \ncompletely predict the number or nature of natural disasters, we do \nknow that these events occur and cause massive damage. Policymakers \ncannot continue to play with the livelihoods of recovering Americans; \nassurances must be made that their recovery is facilitated through \ncurrent Federal disaster recovery programs.\n  The Safeguarding Disaster Funding Act of 2011 will ensure that the \nPresident properly accounts for disaster spending. By basing the \nPresident's budget request for disaster funding on a ten-year average, \nand excluding the highs and the lows, we are assuring that funds are \nneither overextended nor falsely underestimated. In these hard economic \ntimes, Congress must promote fiscal responsibility while ensuring that \nthose areas struck by disasters are able to access the funds needed to \nquickly rebuild.\n  I hope that my fellow colleagues will support this bill. In the wake \nof recent disasters it is readily apparent that we must plan better for \nthese events.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 1565. A bill to establish the National Competition for Community \nRenewal to encourage communities to adopt innovative strategies and \ndesign principles to programs related to poverty prevention, recovery \nand response, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today over 15 percent of Americans live in \npoverty including 22 percent of our children. 46.2 million Americans \nand 16.4 million children struggle every day to survive in a system \nthat is demoralizing and unfortunately does more to maintain people who \nlive in poverty than to help them escape. Last year, 2.6 million \nAmericans were added to the poverty rolls and 8.9 million have been \nadded since 2007.\n  This must change. That is why I am today reintroducing the National \nOpportunity and Community Renewal Act. This legislation puts forth some \nnew ideas and will grant waivers to ten communities so they can test \ndifferent approaches to combatting poverty. I am not saying this is the \nonly path forward or the most suitable path forward. But we must begin \nsomewhere and we must take a comprehensive approach. As Robert Kennedy \nonce said when talking about tackling the poverty problem in our \ncountry, we must ``grab the web whole.'' Piecemeal approaches won't \nwork.\n  I know there are other Senators and Congressmen along with policy \nprofessionals and academics who share my concern and commitment to \nreducing poverty. I invite people to review this proposal. Let me know \nwhat you think and if you have other ideas to bring them to the table. \nIt is long past time to reinstill our national commitment to the least \nfortunate.\n  We must also acknowledge that there is not one answer to helping \npeople out of poverty. That is why this legislation is important. It \nwill allow communities to pursue innovative approaches to problems \narising from poverty and avoids a ``one size fits all'' method. This \nlegislation also targets individuals and mandates the creation of an \nindividual opportunity plan for every household. It also helps address \nthe root causes of poverty by giving local communities to design \nprograms that fit their community and they would not be restricted by \nthe current law.\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\nThese pilots will help us test new ideas and understand how new \napproaches can help lift people out of poverty.\n  In closing, I should note it has been almost fifty years since \nMichael Harrington published The Other America and opened Americans \neyes to the pernicious impact of poverty. While there have been \nimprovements made in the ensuing years we still have a long way to go. \nLet us begin anew today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1570. A bill to provide for high-quality academic tutoring for \nlow-income students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when poor children in low performing \nschools need help, what options are available to their parents to give \nthem a chance to improve their learning achievement? Sadly, very few \noptions exist to give children in low performing schools a chance.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation that will protect and enhance \nthe right of parents to have final say in their children's education. \nIn order to create better outcomes for our nation's youth, we must \nrestore power to parents. We must ensure that parents have real choices \nto raise their child's achievement level when schools fail to do so. \nThe Tutoring for Students Act, furthers this critical goal by \nestablishing a state-level grant program to give low-income parents the \nability to provide their children high quality academic tutoring.\n  Low-income parents should have the same opportunities to help their \nchildren achieve as families with greater economic means.\n  Tutoring is as much a part of education in America as the yellow \nschool bus or the neighborhood school building. If your child is \nstruggling academically, and you have the financial means to do so, you \nget your child a tutor. Tutoring is time proven and common sense. \nEqually, while there are many ideas about how to improve education in \nAmerica, one thing upon which everyone agrees plays a critical role in \nany child's education: the active involvement of their parents.\n  The Tutoring for Students Act encourages the active engagement of \nparents by giving them a say in helping their child's education. \nParents can drive schools to apply for tutoring grants. Parents choose \nto enroll their children. Parents pick which tutoring provider they \nsend their child to. Parents receive progress updates on their child.\n  For too long in this country the debate about education has been more \nabout the institutions--the institution of powerful unions, the \ninstitution of the school bureaucracies. Make no mistake about it, \nstrong leadership in the classroom and in school administration is \nimportant. However, education is not about protecting and preserving \nunion contracts and the jobs of bureaucrats. Education is about our \nchildren. If they aren't getting what they need in the classroom, we \nneed to work with schools to help them improve. At the same time, we \nmust provide students in struggling schools with the help they need to \nensure they receive a quality education.\n  The foundation for success in education is setting high expectations \nfor our schools and holding them accountable to develop our most \nprecious resource--our children. Every child, no matter what their \neconomics, deserves not only a chance, but has an absolute right, to a \ngood education. If students can't get what they deserve in the \nclassroom, then we must empower parents with educational support tools \nand the ability to make meaningful choices about what is best for their \nchildren.\n  When Congress passed No Child Left Behind, embedded in that landmark \nlegislation were certain programs specifically designed to recognize \nthe importance of parental empowerment and parental participation. \nSupplemental Education Services is a program specifically designed to \ngive low-income families the ability to access educational support \nopportunities just like families with more financial freedom, to shop \nfor the best tutoring services for their child.\n  Thoughtful education reform means building upon successes and lessons \nlearned. We have learned a great deal since passage of No Child Left \nBehind. That includes our experience in providing tutoring services to \nlow-income children. One of the most important lessons we learned is \nthat tutoring works. In March, the U.S. Department of Education \nreleased a study stating that the tutoring program led to significant \ngains in math and reading student achievement. Studies by respected \norganizations like the Rand Corporation and school districts like the \nChicago Public schools have come to similar conclusions.\n  Another important lesson from NCLB is the cynical lengths to which \nsome low performing schools districts are willing to go in order to \navoid accountability and deny parents the opportunity to access \ntutoring services for their children. Far too often these districts \ngamed the enrollment process for tutoring services, making it \ndifficult, if not impossible for parents to exercise their right to \ntake advantage of the SES program and get their children the \neducational support services--tutoring--they desperately needed. \nSimilarly, due to poor oversight, there have been cases where tutors \nfailed to meet their responsibility to provide high quality tutoring.\n  These problems are addressed in this legislation by establishing a \nstate-administered grant program. Any school can elect to participate, \nallowing low-income parents with children attending participating \nschools to take advantage of high quality tutoring services. The \nTutoring for Students Act requires strict oversight of tutoring service \nproviders, from certification to evaluation, in order to ensure that \nparents can rely upon qualified tutoring service providers to help \ntheir children.\n  I do not favor more Federal control over education. That is why the \nTutoring for Students Act is not a Federal mandate. Rather, it is a \nguarantee that parents will have the right to stand up for their \nchildren and give them the opportunity for a better education and a \nbetter life. Empowering parents with the ability to positively impact \ntheir child's education is not a mandate. It is common sense. Freedom \nis not a Federal mandate. It is an individual right. The best use of \nFederal dollars in education is to make them more accessible to \nparents, empowering them to look out for the needs of their children. \nHigh quality tutoring is a commonsense, academic lifeline.\n  In my home State of Arizona, organizations like the Education \nBreakthrough Network to Literacy Volunteers of Tucson and the Arizona \nChapter of Campfire USA have voiced their strong support. Nationwide, \norganizations such as the United Farm Workers of America, the National \nUrban League, the Commonwealth Foundation and the John Locke Institute \ncontinue to stand up for the rights of parents to have more tools and \nchoices to help their children achieve. There is strong support for \nthis program among communities across America, particularly among the \nparents who so often do not have a voice representing their needs and \ninterests here in Washington.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Enzi, Senator Harkin, and the \nrest of my colleagues to secure passage of meaningful education reform \nthat includes protecting and strengthening the ability of parents to \nmake educational choices for their children, choices that include high \nquality tutoring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5688-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5688-S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 268--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE MALCOLM \n            WALLOP, FORMER SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF WYOMING\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid of \nNevada, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Begich, \nMr. Bennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Burr, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coats, \nMr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coons, Mr. \nCorker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heller,\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nMr. Hoeven, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \nJohanns, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Manchin, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \nReed of Rhode Island, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nRubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \nShelby, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. \nUdall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nWebb, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to inform the Chamber that I \nsupport the nomination of Wendy Sherman to be Under Secretary of State \nfor Political Affairs. I had previously voted against her nomination \nearlier this week when it was brought before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, but I have received information since that leads \nme to change my vote.\n  My good friend Senator Isakson of Georgia spoke to me about his 30-\nplus-year relationship with the Sherman family. Ms. Sherman's mother, \nMiriam ``Mimi'' Sherman, started working for Northside Realty, Senator \nIsakson's business based in Marietta, GA, in the late seventies and \neighties. Mimi Sherman, who passed away in 2005, was a terrific person, \nand Senator Isakson was very happy to call her a close friend and \nfellow coworker. He also has known Wendy during this entire time and \nknows that she embodies the same qualities that her mother did. He is \nconfident that she is qualified for the position and will do a great \njob at the State Department as Under Secretary of State for Political \nAffairs.\n  I have great respect for the wisdom and good judgment of my friend \nfrom Georgia. We both serve on the Africa Subcommittee, and as its \nranking member, Senator Isakson always ensures that the views of his \nfellow Republican members are fully represented, even to the point of \nsharing his own speaking time at hearings with members like me who are \npassionate about bringing relief to the people on the African \nContinent. And when he expresses confidence in a particular person like \nWendy Sherman, whom he has known personally for over three decades, \nthat is good enough for me.\n  I support Ms. Sherman's nomination to be Under Secretary of State for \nPolitical Affairs.\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5693-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we all traveled over to the House \nChamber a few days ago to hear President Obama present his jobs plan, a \njobs plan for which I intend to support and fight. But during the \ncourse of that speech, we also heard the President indicate that he was \ngoing to come and make some recommendations to the Senate and to the \nHouse regarding our debt and deficit strategy.\n  I come to the floor today to urge the White House, in dealing with \nour debt and our deficit issues, to pursue a strategy for cost \nreduction in our health care system that does not rely on harmful cuts \nto our seniors' Medicare benefits. I cannot tell you how important this \nis in Rhode Island where we have a significant senior population. Many \nof our seniors are low income. The average Social Security benefit is \naround $13,000 to $14,000.\n  Some of the ideas that have been floated in this body--more than just \nfloated; they have actually passed the Congress, the House of \nRepresentatives--would be devastating to Rhode Island seniors: an end \nto Medicare in 10 years; $6,000 in increased costs to each senior, on \naverage, per year, hidden in what the Republicans like to call their \ncut, cap and balance plan, with an even worse attack on Medicare and on \nMedicare beneficiaries than was in the House budget that passed, which \nwas a bad enough attack on its own. That simply is more than seniors in \nRhode Island can manage. It is not fair; it is not right. And, most \nimportantly it is not necessary.\n  I do concede that rising health care spending has placed a lot of \nstress on our national budget. In the joint session of Congress in \nSeptember 2009, President Obama himself said: Put simply, our health \ncare problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.\n  If you go to the other side of the political spectrum and to the \nother Chamber of Congress, Congressman Ryan said: Our debt and deficit \nproblem is, at its core, a health care problem. I agree with that. We \nneed to address it. The question is how.\n  The fundamental fact that so many of our colleagues overlook in their \nurgency to attack Medicare--a program that Republicans have been \nagainst from its very founding and that the renewed tea party assault \non Medicare has revived--has misled the debate, because the cost \nproblem in Medicare is not a problem that is unique to Medicare. \nWherever you look in the American health care system, costs are \nexploding. They are going up in Medicare probably at a lower rate than \nother quadrants of the health care sector, but they are going up. They \nare going up in Medicaid. States are having trouble dealing with that \nburden. They are going up in TRICARE and in veterans' care. Indeed, \nSecretary Gates said: Health care costs are eating the Defense \nDepartment alive. Eating the Defense Department alive, health care \ncosts are. And if you are in private insurance, whether it is Kaiser or \nUnited or Blue Cross, pick your insurer, the costs are going up \ndramatically. Our own hospitals in Rhode Island, which provide health \ncare, are watching their health care costs accelerate at significant \nrates far above a multiple of our rate of inflation.\n  This problem of rising health care costs is creating real strain. It \nis not just creating strain on the Federal budget--granted, it is \ncreating strain in the Federal budget--but it is also creating \nincredible stress on seniors, on small business owners who can't afford \nhealth insurance for themselves, or have to whittle away at the health \ninsurance their employees have in order to keep it affordable, or have \nto give it up entirely as they face the stresses of this economic \ndownturn.\n  As the Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from Colorado, knows \nbecause\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nhis, like Rhode Island, is a small business State. When you are a small \nbusiness, your employees are pretty darned close to family. When you \nhave to whittle away at their health care benefits, when you have to \nwhittle away at what they get, when you have to raise their costs, that \nis a hard decision for that small business owner/manager to make.\n  It is tough on American families. It is tough on big businesses. It \nis tough on American big export companies. Our automobile industry, the \ntractor manufacturers, the road building equipment manufacturers, the \nfolks who build big American products that we export overseas, we build \nenormous amounts of health care costs into those products. It has been \nestimated that nearly $2,000 in health care costs goes into an American \ncar. Well, the foreign car that competes in the international market \nwith that American car comes out of a national health care system. So \nthat health care cost isn't in the cost structure of the company that \nmakes the car. And because they collected most of their taxes through a \nvalue-added tax, it doesn't even come in through the tax system, \nbecause the export products get out of those companies and into the \ninternational market without a tax burden. So there are our products, \ntrying to compete overseas, with this weight of our health care system \ncost on them and it helps make America uncompetitive. So it is not just \nMedicare. It is everywhere in the American health care system. It is \nsystemwide.\n  A couple of years back, when we were first discussing this issue and \nthe White House held a couple of health care conferences, I was \nfortunate to be invited to those conferences. The President used a \nmetaphor in discussing where we were in health care in those \ndiscussions. He used the discussion of us being headed for a cliff. If \nwe didn't do something about our health care costs as a country, we \nwere headed for a cliff.\n  Well, nothing has changed. We are still headed for that cliff, and \nthe solution we have to find is to take the bus that we are all on and \nturn it before we get to the cliff.\n  It is not an adequate solution to simply throw seniors off the bus in \norder to lighten the Medicare cost load without doing what we need to \ndo to change the direction of the American health care system to \nalleviate this cross-system, this economywide burden.\n  Fortunately, we gave President Obama tools to do this in the \nAffordable Care Act. We fought about all sorts of elements in the \nAffordable Care Act. We fought about the public option. We fought about \nuniversal coverage. There were imaginary claims raised that there were \ndeath panels in the health care bill. It was considered to be \nsocialized medicine, the same phrase that was trotted out years ago to \noppose Medicare. They brought that old stalwart phrase out again--\ntotally false.\n  The only socialized medicine we have in this country is the kind we \ngive our veterans, which is the very best quality care they are \nentitled to--what Bob Dole has said is the place we should look toward \nfor health care reform. But that is a separate argument. But my point \nis there was a whole lot of phony controversy about that health care \nbill.\n  What was completely not discussed was that a huge chunk of that bill \nwas dedicated to delivery system reform of the health care system, to \nturning the bus before we hit the cliff. There is a lot in there for \nthe President to work with. There are literally dozens of programs and \npilots to turn us in this new direction. I urge very strongly, as we \naddress the government health care cost problem that we face, we look \nat it as a systemic problem, and we address it as a health care cost \ndelivery system problem rather than pick out seniors, throw them off \nthe bus, and keep it careening toward the cliff without changing its \nunderlying direction. That would be, in medical parlance, a \nmisdiagnosis of the illness and a mistreatment of it as a result, and \nfundamentally malpractice. But that is the direction we are being led, \nand I am here to urge us that we go in a different direction.\n  There is a lot to be gained. America's health care system is \nprovably, wildly inefficient. We burn more than 18 percent of America's \ngross domestic product on our health care system every year--18 \npercent. To put that into context, the next most inefficient \nindustrialized competitor that we deal with internationally runs at \naround 12 percent of gross domestic product. So here we are, the United \nStates of America--the most innovative, the most technologically \ndeveloped country in the world, a country that prides itself on \nefficiency, on common sense, on making smart decisions--and what are we \ndoing? We are 50 percent more inefficient than the most inefficient \nother industrialized country in the world.\n  One would think that we would not be the most inefficient. One would \ncertainly think we would not be the most inefficient by a margin of 50 \npercent over the second most inefficient country in the world. It just \ndoes not make any sense, but that is how bad it is. That is a pretty \nstrong measure of how laden with excess costs our national health care \nsystem is.\n  For all of that, we do not get better outcomes. I wouldn't mind \nspending 50 percent more than Switzerland or France or any other \ncountry if we got 50 percent better outcomes, if we lived 50 percent \nlonger, if we were 50 percent healthier, if we had 50 percent better \ncare, if we had 50 percent better maternal mortality in childbirth--but \nwe do not. When we look at the measures of how we do for our people in \nthe American health care system, we compare with countries such as \nGreece and Croatia. We are down in the thirties in the ranking if you \nlook at most of the quality measures.\n  Incredibly overbloated expenditure and at best moderate performance \nare the two prevailing characteristics of our health care system. That \nmeans there is a lot of ground to be gained.\n  It has been quantified by President Obama's own Council of Economic \nAdvisers who estimated $700 billion every year could be saved if we \ncleaned up the health care system and made it moderately efficient. We \ncould save that $700 billion without harming the quality of care for \nAmericans.\n  That seems like a big number, but actually the New England Healthcare \nInstitute says that number is $850 billion a year. George Bush's \nTreasury Secretary, Secretary O'Neill, who knows a lot about this from \nhis time as CEO of Alcoa and as the person leading the Pittsburgh \nRegional Health Initiative, combined with the Lewin Group, which is a \nvery well regarded Washington institution that looks at health care \nissues and evaluates them, they both agree that the number is $1 \ntrillion a year that we could save without harming the experience or \nquality of care for the American consumer.\n  We tried to throw pretty much everything we could at this problem in \nthe Affordable Care Act. A consultant to the administration, MIT \nProfessor Jonathan Gruber, said about the Affordable Care Act and its \ndelivery system reform component:\n\n       Everything is in here. I can't think of anything I would do \n     that they are not doing in that bill.\n\n  We gave the administration literally everything they could want, \neverything they asked for. I had a group that met with me as we were \ndesigning the Affordable Care Act, people from unions, people from NGOs \nthat work on health care issues, people from the business sector, \npeople who are experts in this area--to say, What are we missing? What \nmore could we put in to help get at this problem of excessive costs for \nmoderate results?\n  By the time the bill came to the floor, this was the answer from my \ngroup: Nothing. We can't think of anything else. We tried. It is all in \nthere. So I agreed with Professor Gruber's assessment.\n  What is the nature of what we did? It boils down to what I contend \nare five basic strategies. One is quality improvement. The quality of \nAmerican medicine is not anywhere near as good as it should be. Anybody \nwho was listening to me talk, who has had a loved one in their family \nseriously ill, ill for any length of time, or who has been seriously \nill themselves, they know that from their own experience. They know of \nthe lost records. They know of the confusion between multiple doctors \nwho are treating them and not talking to them, maybe both prescribing \nmedications that are contra-indicated with each other, but they don't \nknow the other one is doing it. They know the experience of having to \nbe your own navigator through this complex system. They know what a \nnightmare that\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nis. They know it. It is not a debatable proposition.\n  It also works out in some pretty identifiable data. Nearly one in \nevery 20 hospitalized patients in the United States gets a hospital-\nacquired infection. A hospital-acquired infection should be a ``never'' \nevent. If we apply the Pronovost principles and do things started in \nMichigan and are carried out around the country now, we can knock that \ndown by about 90 percent, but still it is endemic.\n  Everybody knows somebody who has gone to a hospital for a procedure \nand came out with a hospital-acquired infection, often a life-\nthreatening one. Just treating those infections costs about $2.5 \nbillion a year. They are completely avoidable.\n  That is just one element of the health care system. If we got after \nthe quality gaps in our health care system, the savings would be far \ngreater. So there is a lot to be gained in quality. That is one of the \nfive.\n  The second is prevention. We do not analyze and evaluate and \nimplement prevention strategies very well as a country. We don't even \nevaluate effectively what prevention methods save enough money in the \nlong run that we should just pay for them for everybody because it \nsaves money to have people do this. We don't differentiate between what \nis probably a good idea for an individual to pay for and what is such a \ngood idea and saves so much money that it should be part of the \nbaseline of medical treatment that every American gets. It doesn't \nmatter how sick they are, doesn't matter how old they are, doesn't \nmatter how wealthy they are, doesn't matter where they live, they \nshould be getting this prevention treatment because it saves all of us \nmoney.\n  We should be analyzing those things, proving them and putting that \nprevention strategy to work because the cheapest way to treat an \nillness is to prevent it in the first instance. The third is payment \nreform. We pay doctors more--the more they prescribe, the more tests \nthey order, the more medications they order, the more procedures they \ndirect, the more they get paid. It should come as no surprise that when \nyou send that incentive out there into that particular marketplace, you \nget dramatic overuse, which has been quantified in study after study.\n\n  This bill, the Affordable Care Act, has pilots to start directing the \npayment for medical procedures and for medical care based on the \noutcomes so that its value is how well you get that dictates payment, \nnot how much the doctor does to you. That will be a paradigm shift in \nhealth care. You have to get it right. It is not easy to do. It is \ngoing to take some doing, but it is vitally important. That is the \nthird part.\n  The fourth is administrative simplification, in particular, \nadministrative simplification in the area of the warfare that currently \nexists between health insurance companies and hospitals and doctors. \nAsk any hospital, ask any doctor what it is like dealing with the \ninsurance companies, trying to get paid for the services they deliver. \nThey will tell you it is torture.\n  The last time I was at the Cranston Community Health Center in Rhode \nIsland, they told me half of their personnel are dedicated to trying to \nget paid. The other half do the health care work. Half of their \npersonnel are dedicated to trying get paid. And they have a $200,000 a \nyear contract with experts to try to help train the 50 percent of their \npersonnel who are dedicated to trying to get paid in what the latest \ntricks are from the insurance industry so they can keep ahead of the \ngame. Because it is an arm's race. Well, my guess is that about 10 \npercent of the health care dollar that goes through the insurance \ncompanies goes to delay and denial of payment. There is 10 cents right \noff the top, leaving only 90 cents for the rest of the health care \nequation.\n  The doctors and the hospitals have to fight back. They have to hire \ntheir own consultants and their own experts and their own billing \ncompanies. They are not as efficient. There are more of them. They are \nmore spread out. It is not what they are expert at. It is harder for \nthem to fight back. I think they pay more than 10 cents out of every \ndollar. You put the 2 together, that is 20 cents out of the health care \ndollar on the private insurance side that does not go to health care at \nall. It goes to fund the arms race between insurers and doctors over \ngetting paid.\n  This year Health Affairs: Journal of Health Care Policy published a \nstudy that compared the administrative costs of physician practices in \nOntario, Canada, and physician practices in the United States. It found \nif doctors in the United States could lower their administrative costs \nto match those of the Ontario physicians, the total savings would be \napproximately $27.6 billion a year. The Ontario doctors have \nadministrative costs, but they have a single-payer system and it is \npretty easy to deal with. The $27.6 billion is primarily fighting with \nthe different insurance companies that all have different systems about \nclaims and billing. There are big savings to be had by eliminating that \nunnecessary and expensive warfare that produces zero health care \nbenefit to anybody.\n  The last piece, which is the structure for most of the rest of it, is \na solid, strong health information technology infrastructure for this \ncountry. I can go to a bank anywhere in this country and I can take out \nmy ATM card and access my checking account. I can find out what is in \nmy savings account. I can do transactions. I can make deposits. \nHowever, if I step out of that ATM booth and get whacked by a taxicab \nand rushed to the emergency room, they have no idea what my health \nhistory is or what my health records are. We do not have a modern \nelectronic health record in this country. We do not have modern \nelectronic infrastructure in this country.\n  When I started arguing about this a few years ago, I can remember The \nEconomist magazine publishing an article that said the health care \nindustry in America was the worst industry for the deployment of \ninformation technology of all of the American industries except one. \nThe only industry that was behind the health care industry and the \ndeployment of information technology was the mining industry. We have \nimproved, thanks to President Obama and this administration putting a \nbig investment in this area, but we have a long way to go because we \nwere way behind the curve.\n  Those five things--quality improvement, serious investment and \nprevention where it saves money, payment reform so that the system has \nincentive to provide value rather than volume, knocking down the \nadministrative overhead that drapes over this system and weighs it \ndown, and a robust health information technology infrastructure, those \nare the five keys and almost every single one of the programs I \nreferred to that is in the Affordable Care Act fits one of those \nprinciples.\n  Why are we not doing this? Why is this not a bigger part of the \ndebate if it is $700 billion to $1 trillion a year, if the result is \nbetter care for Americans, fewer medical errors, more prevented \nillness, less nonsense and unnecessary care from their doctors in \nchasing the payment model of volume, less fighting with the insurance \ncompany over trying to get paid and a health information record that is \nyours, that is private, that is secure, that goes with you wherever you \nare?\n  There was a fellow in Rhode Island whose daughter was taken ill. She \nhad a pretty serious condition. She was taken to the emergency room in \nRhode Island, and they realized that this was bad. They needed \nspecialty care, specialty machinery and treatment, and they had to rush \nto the specialty hospital in Massachusetts that could do the work on \nher she needed to save her life. So off they went. When they got there, \nthey discovered that they had not brought her paper health records with \nher. They had to redo all the testing. They had to start from scratch. \nSeconds counted as they fought for this woman's life. Thankfully it all \nturned out fine, but it put her life at risk and it cost a fortune to \nredo all the tests. It made her recovery harder because a lot of time \nwas wasted. Are you kidding me, a paper health record? But that is \nwhere we are.\n  All of this is win-win. Where is the pressure to do it? Well, there \nis a problem, and the problem is that it is not the kind of change that \nCBO--the people who guide our budget decisions around here--can score. \nI asked Alan Simpson from the Simpson-Bowles budget group during one of \nour Budget Committee hearings if he believed that reducing health care \ncosts through delivery system reform is an important\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\npart of addressing our debt and deficit problem. And he answered: What \nyou are saying is exactly right. It is not, unfortunately, scoreable. \nThat is why it is not in our report.\n  I get it. It is not scoreable. It is not in the report. We should not \noverlook these factors as we make these decisions on behalf of the \nAmerican people because even if you cannot score how you get to that \n$700 billion in savings or if the New England Health Care Institute is \nright, that $850 billion, or if Bush Secretary O'Neill is right, that \n$1 trillion a year in savings using methods that improve both our \nexperience and quality of care needs to be a priority even if it is not \nscoreable.\n  Tomorrow I will send a letter to the President, which the Presiding \nOfficer has been good enough to sign, along with a broad array of my \ncolleagues who have agreed to cosign, which reiterates the case I make \nhere tonight. The letter urges the President's attention to the \npotential of delivery system reform rather than Medicare benefit cuts \nfor seniors. It should be our first priority to fix that overloaded 50 \npercent more inefficient than the most inefficient country in the world \nsystem, the one with $700 billion or $850 billion or $1 trillion in \nannual savings that are possible. Fix that before you go to a senior \nwho had no part in this, who cannot help but try to do their best, and \nsay to them, we are taking away your benefit. That is not the way to \nproceed. That is the wrong way to proceed. It is morally wrong and it \nis wrong as a matter of policy.\n  Where I contend we are--and I will say this in closing--there is a \nmovement and an industry emerging in the area of health care delivery \nsystem reform. It is strong in the private sector, whether we look at \nplaces such as Palmetto down the Carolina Coast; Geisinger in the \nPennsylvania area; up in the Wisconsin area, Gundersen Lutheran; out \ntoward Utah, the west, Inner Mountain; Mayo in Minnesota and Florida; \nor Kaiser, based in California. These are all major American health \ncare delivery companies that have seen the potential delivery system \nreform. They are working hard to make it happen. They are committed to \nit, and they are getting results. We need to have their back. We need \nto support them as they do this.\n  But it is never going to be scorable because this is not a \nmathematical equation where we say: You are not getting this benefit. \nWe are going to take away 20 percent of what you get. We are going to \nrun it through the same nonsensical system that causes most of our cost \nproblems and at the end we are going to say it is going to be 20 \npercent cheaper. It is easy to do the math that way, but it is a pretty \ncruel way, and it is lazy because we need to be in the middle fixing \nthat piece.\n  But it is not arithmetically easy because where we are is like the \nearly stages, I contend, of the airline industry--I should say of the \nflight industry. What did we know when the Wright Brothers first put \ntheir flying machine into the air at Kitty Hawk? We knew a curved \nsurface sped through the air, generated lift. We knew a whirling air \nscrew generated propulsion, and we knew that if you twisted the ends of \nthe wings, you could control the direction. Those principles haven't \nchanged.\n  I just got back from Afghanistan and Pakistan. We flew for 14 hours \nfrom the Arabian Peninsula back to Dulles Airport. That plane had \nmovies on it. It had food on it. Everybody was comfortable. It had air-\nconditioning. We landed a plane that was the size of probably the \naverage small town in America at the time the Wright Brothers were \nflying and everybody on it felt perfectly safe and comfortable. It came \ndown a tube of electronic decision support for those pilots so they \nknew exactly what was going on every moment. If you went back to the \nWright Brothers, you could not score in the actuarial sense the \nprogress that would lead us in less than a century from a rickety \nwooden canvas, manned kite, puffing down the beach at Kitty Hawk, to \nthese sleek, computer-guided, miraculous aircraft that fly us in \ncomfort around the world today. You could not do it. But that didn't \nmean we shouldn't bet on it. That didn't mean we shouldn't pursue it. \nThat didn't mean it wouldn't make a huge difference in the quality of \nmankind's life to be able to have that technological lead.\n  So that is where we are. These five principles are a little bit \nbeyond the Kitty Hawk stage perhaps but not by much. If we invest and \nif we get behind this, the day will come, and it will come soon, when \nthe quality of health care each one of us receives--we will look back \nand we will think, what we are getting now, that was canvas and wood \nsticks. That was primitive. We will have personalized electronic health \ncare. Companies will emerge to create applications so whatever illness \nyou have, the very best treatment will be downloaded so you know what \nyou should be doing, when, and it will be adjusted for your blood type \nand family history and gender, if it is a factor that makes a \ndifference, and for your body mass. Whatever it is that is relevant to \nyou getting the best treatment as an individual, that is the kind of \nstuff that will be available. We will aggregate the data about what is \neffective, and people who have far more brilliance than I will plow \nthrough all the data about America's health care experience and they \nwill start learning things about what works and what doesn't, what two \nthings we didn't notice are connected. We will start to find those \nanomalies or those associations, and that will open a whole new era of \ndiscovery and treatment. Between those new applications that will guide \nin a personalized way health care for Americans, based on their own \ndata and based on the best available information so your doctor is a \nlittle bit like that pilot landing the plane out of Dulles, making \ntheir own decisions, flying the plane directly but surrounded by that \ndecision support that makes plane landings so safe--if your wheels \naren't down, the alarms go off. If you get out of the glide slope, the \nalarms go off. If there are wind gusts on the field, the alarms go off. \nAll that information and more is captured so the pilots can focus on \nflying the plane. That is the kind of support our doctors can have. \nThat is the kind of support we can have. Those are American industries \nthat will grow and emerge.\n  So we need to get behind this. I feel very strongly about this, as my \ncolleagues can tell and as the four pages have had to wait and listen \nto me at this late hour can tell. But I say now it would be a shameful \nact on the part of the Congress of the United States if, with an \nopportunity like that in front of us, if with a compelling cost target, \nas we have from delivery system reform in front of us, and with the \nproven thesis that by getting there we actually improve the quality of \ncare for people--we are not taking anything away; we are making their \nquality and experience of care better, which is a win-win-win. If we \nturn away from that win-win-win and instead take the easy, lazy way of \nthrowing seniors off the bus and putting Medicare benefit cuts on them \nand let that bus just keep rocketing toward that cliff, that will be a \nmoment that will merit the scorn of the American people and the shame \nof our own conscience because we will have done the wrong thing and we \nwill have done it because it was the easy way out.\n  I urge the White House not to take that road and to instead redouble \ntheir efforts on delivery system reform, back Secretary Sebelius in \nwhat she is doing and Don Berwick in what he is doing and, most \nsignificantly, put a hard date and dollar metric out there so the world \ncan evaluate how well the administration did. If this is as important \nas I think it is, if this is as important as the administration thinks \nit is by the work they have already dedicated to it, then they should \nbe willing to set for themselves a date and dollar savings target to \ntell the country: By this date, we will save this many hundreds of \nbillions of dollars a year through delivery system reform. If we don't, \nthen it is murk, it is mush. There is no accountability to it. It is \ngenerally going in the right direction.\n  A young President many years ago had a similar opportunity. We were \nlosing the space race to the Soviet Union. He could have said in his \nspeech: I think it is time that we bent the curve of America's space \nprogram. I think it is time we bent the curve of America's space \nexploration. But he didn't. He said something much more specific. He \nsaid: Within a decade, the United States of America is going to put a \nman on the Moon and bring him home safely. If President John Fitzgerald\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\nKennedy had given that first speech, we would never have put a man on \nthe Moon. The reason we put a man on the Moon is because when a \nPresident of the United States sets a hard target for the Government of \nthe United States, that vast bureaucracy moves to achieve that purpose. \nIf the President of the United States denies that vast bureaucracy, the \nclarity of that purpose does not give a specific measurable goal, and \nit makes that goal far less likely to achieve.\n  So not only do I ask the White House to turn away from Medicare \nbenefit cuts and redouble their efforts on delivery system reform, I \nask them to decide how much they are going to save, and by when, and \nlet us know so we can evaluate their success in meeting that goal. I \npromise them every support in reaching that goal.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/15/senate-section/article/S5697-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
