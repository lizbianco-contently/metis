Mr. President, this is a new year, and thankfully it has \nbrought new signs of economic recovery--not as vibrant as we would like \nbut some recovery--but it will never be good enough while we have \nmillions of Americans unemployed in this country. As we say in the \nSenate, those on this side of the aisle, Democrats, we are not going to \ntake our eye off the target; that is, a healthy economy. The bipartisan \nTransportation bill before the Senate is an important step in that \ndirection. This bill will save or create almost 3 million jobs. Yet my \nRepublican colleagues have caused the waste of about a month of \nprecious time here on the Senate floor in obstructing this very \nimportant piece of legislation. So it is with disappointment that I am \ngoing to file cloture on this Transportation bill.\n  It seems 85 votes to begin debate on a measure no longer indicates a \nsmooth legislative path forward. We would think that with 85 votes, we \nwould have timely approval of the bill, but that has not taken place. \nThat is because my Republican colleagues want to waste time on \nunrelated, ideological, nongermane, nonrelevant amendments instead of \ntalking about the Nation's failing infrastructure.\n  There is no one, no one thinks--and I say that--no one believes that \nour roads, our highways, our bridges are up to snuff. They are not. We \nneed significant work to bring them to a better condition. Tens of \nthousands of bridges are in a state of disrepair. So Republicans, \ninstead of working on this valuable infrastructure bill, have been \ncausing us to waste time on unrelated issues.\n  We have spent the last several weeks on women's access to health \ncare, and,\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nof course, amendments they are talking about doing in addition to that \nwould weaken our environmental protection, make our water less pure, \nour air dirtier--this instead of rebuilding, as I indicated we need to \ndo, our roads and our bridges, even against their better judgment. One \nRepublican leader said yesterday: We have spent enough time this year \non trying to repeal the health care bill. But they have had to retract \nthat because the tea party rose and said: Oh, we have to have more \nvotes.\n  They are meaningless votes. Everyone knows there is going to be no \nrepeal of the health care bill this year. So the Republican leader, who \ntalked about this yesterday, was talking about maybe doing what Senator \nAlexander and Senator Pryor think we should do: spend our time on \nthings that are constructive, such as getting our appropriations bills \ndone. But, no, the tea party stepped in, and now there are going to be \nefforts made to repeal the health care bill. In fact, I read in the \npaper today a complete flip-flop from yesterday. Instead of not dealing \nwith trying to repeal the health care bill the rest of this legislative \nyear, now the word is that the entire month of March is going to be \nspent dealing with health care.\n  It is time to move forward on this bill. Hopefully, seven--that is \nall we need. There are 47 Republicans, and we need 7 of them to invoke \ncloture on this bill. That vote will occur Tuesday morning. All the \nnongermane, nonrelevant amendments, let them do them on a piece of \nlegislation that is not so vital to the economy of this country. We are \ngoing to move forward on this bill. I certainly hope we can get seven \nRepublicans to join with us. There are 53 of us, seven of them.\n\n  I have always said I would be happy to come up with an agreement. If \nthey want to offer amendments that are relevant to what we are doing, \nthat is fine. But that hasn't been forthcoming. I hope the weekend will \ngive my Republican colleagues a chance to reflect on whether they are \nwilling to put ideology ahead of the economy. Three million jobs and \nwhat do we spend our time on? An ideological issue to take health care \naway from women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/02/senate-section/article/S1372-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1813, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1761, of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1762 (to amendment No. 1761), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 1763, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1764 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 1763), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1765 (to amendment No. 1764), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure the record is very clear \nwhat the vote will be on Tuesday morning.\n  Before the day is out, I am going to file cloture on a work product. \nIt is a bill that has the approval of Barbara Boxer, a progressive \nSenator from California, and Jim Inhofe, a conservative Senator from \nOklahoma. We have now added to that something that came out of the \nFinance Committee, something that came out of the Banking Committee, \nand something that came out of the Commerce Committee. All these \nmeasures have been relatively without any challenge. I can't understand \nwhy people wouldn't approve this. And what we added to this is 37 \napproved amendments. The staffs, with their respective Senators, have \nbeen working for days to come up with agreement on amendments that have \nbeen filed but not offered, and these amendments have been approved by \nthe respective chair and ranking members of the committees, 37 of them. \nSo we will be voting on Tuesday on that product--all of it bipartisan, \nall of it noncontroversial--so that we can complete work on this bill.\n  If we did nothing else, nothing else on this highway bill, then what \nwe are going to vote cloture on, on Tuesday, would be really a good, \nstrong legislative day for this body. Then we could have conference \nwith the House. The House has already announced they can't do their \nsenseless piece of legislation. Even tea party-driven Republicans in \nthe House recognized that was something that was a figment of someone's \nimagination that they could get done. Now they are going to do a 2-year \nbill, like us. It will be easy to conference something like that. They \nmay have some difference in some of the policy efforts, but that is why \nwe have conferences.\n  This legislation is critical. At the end of this month, the end of \nMarch, the highway bill is no more. Projects that are being worked on \nin Hawaii and Nevada and around the other 48 States will come to a \nstop. There will be no money. New projects won't be able to go forward. \nThis is a very important bill involving billions of dollars of badly \nneeded construction.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Senior Members Presiding\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated to the Acting President pro \ntempore this morning, the junior Senator from Hawaii, how fortunate I \nwas to have one of the senior Members of the Senate preside, that \ndoesn't happen often, and here it is again with the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I was commenting to my friends on the staff who don't know the \nSenator from West Virginia very well--and they don't know a lot of us \nbecause we just whip through here. In a brief synopsis I was telling \nthem what a wonderful man the Senator is and what he has done to \ncontribute to a better society. I have such gratitude to know the \nPresiding Officer, to know his background and the sacrifices he has \nmade for his country. He has done so much for his State. When the \nhistory books are written, there will be a big chapter on what has \ntaken place in West Virginia during the Presiding Officer's service \nthere.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and \npolicies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other \npersons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions is \nto continue in effect beyond March 6, 2012.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of certain members \nof the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's \ndemocratic processes or institutions has not been resolved. These \nactions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to continue this national \nemergency and to maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this \nthreat.\n  The United States welcomes the opportunity to modify the targeted \nsanctions regime when blocked persons demonstrate a clear commitment to \nrespect the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The United States \nhas committed to continue its review of the targeted sanctions list for \nZimbabwe to ensure it remains current and addresses the concerns for \nwhich it was created. We hope that events on the ground will allow us \nto take additional action to recognize progress in Zimbabwe in the \nfuture. The goal of a peaceful, democratic Zimbabwe remains foremost in \nour consideration of any action.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 2, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/02/senate-section/article/S1373-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 1837.
