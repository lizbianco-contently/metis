Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 504.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 504, S. 3525, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next hour will be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees. The majority will control \nthe first half and the Republicans the final half.\n  As I think we should know, and I am happy to restate it, the next \nrollcall vote will occur about 1 a.m. this morning, an hour after we \ncome in. I am, of course, hopeful we can work something out in order to \ncomplete our work. We can either do it all tonight, tomorrow, or, if \nthat doesn't work out, as the Presiding Officer knows, under the rules \nof the Senate we will have that vote at 1 a.m., and then we would have \nanother vote on the CR. Final passage of that would be around 7:30, 8 \no'clock in the morning on Sunday. Then we would immediately follow to \nthe motion to proceed on the sportsmen's package.\n  We continue to have discussions. We are working to see if we can \nschedule these votes at a more convenient time for Senators. Everyone \nshould know we would finish by Sunday morning. We are not going to go \ninto next week.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 3607\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 3607 is at the desk and due for a second \nreading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3607) to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings with regard to this \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the past week I have listened to my \nRepublican colleagues come to the floor and lament how little the \nSenate has accomplished during the 112th Congress. I, above all, share \nthat concern. In fact, it is a wonder we have gotten anything done at \nall, considering the lack of cooperation Democrats have gotten from \nRepublican colleagues.\n  I have said before, and it bears repeating: In my time as the \nmajority leader, I have faced 382 Republican filibusters. That is 381 \nmore filibusters than Lyndon Johnson faced during his 6 years as \nmajority leader.\n  Time and time again my Republican colleagues have stalled or blocked \nperfectly good pieces of legislation to score points with the tea \nparty, and they have done nothing but hurt the middle class in this \nprocess. Even the most noncontroversial, consensus matters--items that \nwould have passed by unanimous consent in the past--have been \nobstructed or stalled.\n  Take, for example, the bipartisan sportsmen's bill. The junior \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Tester, has assembled a broad package to \nsupport the needs of sportsmen across the country. Just so everyone \nunderstands I am not making this up, there are more than 50 groups--50 \norganizations in this country--who support this legislation. It is\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\na wide range of organizations, including the National Rifle \nAssociation, Ducks Unlimited, American Sports Fishing Association \nwhich, by the way, has more than 2 million members, Boone and Crockett \nClub, National Shooting Sports Foundation, Theodore Roosevelt \nConservation Partnership, The Nature Conservancy, the National Wildlife \nFederation, Trout Unlimited. If we put labels on just these 10 \norganizations I have mentioned, it goes from the more conservative, \nmany would say, National Rifle Association, to the more progressive \nTrout Unlimited.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these organizations I have \nreferred to, as well as others, be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       American Fisheries Society\n       American Fly Fishing Trade Association\n       American Sportfishing Association\n       Archery Trade Association\n       Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies\n       B.A.S.S., LLC\n       Berkley Conservation Institute\n       Boone and Crockett Club\n       Bowhunting Preservation Alliance\n       Campfire Club of America\n       Catch-A-Dream Foundation\n       Center for Costal Conservation\n       Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation\n       Conservation Force\n       Costal Conservation Association\n       Dallas Safari Club\n       Delta Waterfowl Foundation\n       Ducks Unlimited\n       Houston Safari Club\n       Isaac Walton League\n       International Game Fish Association\n       Mule Deer Foundation\n       National Marine Manufacturers Association\n       National Rifle Association\n       National Wildlife Refuge Association\n       National Wildlife Federation\n       National Shooting Sports Foundation\n       National Trappers Association\n       National Wild Turkey Federation\n       North American Bear Foundation\n       North American Grouse Partnership\n       Orion--the Hunter's Institute\n       Pheasants Forever\n       Pope and Young Club\n       Public Lands Foundation\n       Quail Forever\n       Quality Deer Management Association\n       Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation\n       Ruffed Grouse Society\n       Shimano Sport Fisheries Initiative\n       Texas Wildlife Association\n       The Conservation Fund\n       The Nature Conservancy\n       Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership\n       TreadLightly!\n       Trout Unlimited\n       Trust for Public Lands\n       U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance\n       Wild Sheep Foundation\n       The Wilderness Society\n       Wildlife Forever\n       Wildlife Management Institute\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this measure combines about 20 bills \nimportant to the sportsmen's community--bills that promote hunting, \nfishing, and recreation. They would foster habitat conservation through \nvoluntary programs and, as I have indicated, more than 50 national \nsportsmen and conservation groups support this bill unequivocally.\n  This legislation should be passed like that. As I indicated \nyesterday, I have read Capitol Hill newspapers where Republican \nSenators said: What a great piece of legislation; I will vote for it.\n  We should pass this in a matter of seconds. We shouldn't be spending \nall this time on it. It is one of those things where there shouldn't be \na fight and there has been a fight.\n  So I hope, as we try to get back to working on campaigns and doing \nthe work things we have to do at home, that we can move along and get \nthis done.\n  In the process, though, we are holding up a lot of other things. I am \nhopeful we can get something done on the Iran containment resolution, \nwhich is something Lindsey Graham, Senator Lieberman, Senator Menendez, \nand many others, have pushed very hard to get done. I hope we can \nconfirm our Ambassadors to Iraq and Pakistan, and the continuing \nresolution to fund the government for 6 months.\n  Republicans say this Congress has been unproductive, but if \nRepublicans want to know why it has been unproductive, they should take \na look in the mirror. Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Well done is \nbetter than well said.'' Well done is better than well said.\n  So it is time Republicans stop talking about how much they want to \nget things done and start working with us to actually get things done.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Addressing Challenges\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday dozens of Republican Senators \ncame to the Senate floor one after the other to register their complete \nfrustration with the way Democrats are running this place. Never \nbefore--never--has a President and a majority party in the Senate done \nso little to address challenges as great as the ones our Nation faces \nright now--never.\n  I mean, we have a $16 trillion debt and they haven't bothered to put \ntogether a budget in 3 years. They haven't passed a single \nappropriations bill. They haven't passed a Defense authorization bill \nfor the first time in a half a century. These things are usually about \nas standard as turning the lights on. They haven't done any of them. It \nis a disgrace.\n  Think about it: The Middle East is in turmoil, we are fighting a war \nin Afghanistan and against al-Qaida, and they can't even bother to pass \na Defense authorization bill.\n  We are fed up with the way this place is being run. No legislation, \nno amendments, no action on taxes, no action on Defense cuts. Nothing. \nNow we are at it again. All Republicans want to do is extend government \nfunding for a few months, and the majority leader won't even do that \nunless he can squeeze in yet another political vote.\n  Democrats have treated the Senate floor like an extension of the \nObama campaign for 2 years. Now they are holding the CR hostage for no \nother reason than to help one of their incumbents on the campaign \ntrail.\n  Well, we are ready to vote on three bills--the same ones the majority \nleader asked for votes on earlier this week.\n  We have responsibilities to meet. Let's meet them, and leave the \npolitics of the campaign trail where it belongs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first \nhalf.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                        Strategy of Obstruction\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the statement made on the \nfloor by the Republican leader. It was a statement similar to one that \nwas made yesterday. I responded to it yesterday and I wish to make a \nresponse today.\n  I am disappointed that this session of Congress has been so \nunproductive, but I know the reason why. It isn't for lack of effort. \nWe have tried to bring to the floor time and time again legislation to \nhelp create more jobs in America, create a more positive business \nclimate, create more consumer confidence in middle-income families, and \nwe have consistently run into the same problem over and over.\n  In the last 6 years, since Harry Reid of Nevada has been the majority \nleader on the Democratic side, the Republicans have created 382 \nfilibusters. How does this compare with previous years? There is no \ncomparison. We have never, ever, in the history of the U.S. Senate, run \ninto such a consistent strategy of obstruction by one party in the \nSenate.\n  It was no surprise, because the Senator from Kentucky who just spoke \nannounced 4 years ago exactly what his strategy would be. He said his \nNo. 1 goal was to make sure that Barack Obama was a one-term President.\n  I have served in the House and in the Senate with Republican \nPresidents, and certainly I supported their opponents whenever they ran \nfor election, but I felt a moral and civic obligation to do my best to \nwork with those Presidents to achieve some good for this country.\n  I would say that President George W. Bush is a classic example. He \nand I saw the world so differently, and yet when it came to specific \nissues I was prepared to stand and not only praise his work but join \nhim in trying to pass important legislation.\n  President George W. Bush may not be remembered for this, but he \nshould be: He spoke in favor of immigration reform. When is the last \ntime you heard\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\na Republican leader speak about immigration reform? But George W. Bush \nunderstood it, and I admired him for it and complimented him for it, as \nI do today.\n  He stood and said the United States should lead the world in \neradicating the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and he put his money and the money \nof the American taxpayers where his promises were, and I supported him \nfor it. He was right to do it.\n  President George W. Bush stood up after 9/11 and reminded America we \nare not at war with people of the Muslim religion. George W. Bush told \nus it is a good and peaceful religion. Those who would corrupt it, \nthose extremists in the name of Islam, are not a credit to that \nreligion and do not reflect it, and I admired him for that. At a time \nwhen America was so angry over 9/11 and the loss of all those innocent \nlives, he showed real leadership.\n  What a contrast with those who come to the floor of the House and \nSenate and say our No. 1 goal is to make sure this President fails no \nmatter what he tries. That is not good for America, and that is one of \nthe reasons we have been as unproductive as we have been. But there \nhave been exceptions. Let me tell you some of those exceptions.\n  We passed the Violence Against Women Act--an important piece of \nlegislation. Go to a domestic violence shelter. I am sure the Acting \nPresident pro tempore did as attorney general of the State of \nConnecticut and as U.S. Senator, as I did, and sit across the table \nfrom a victim of domestic violence--a poor woman with two black eyes \ncrying her heart out, saying: I just had to get out of that house.\n  Go to a domestic violence center in Little Village or in Pilsen in \nthe city of Chicago where immigrant women come in, holding their \nchildren close by, for fear that drunken husband is going to take \nanother swing at them or at her and tell me we could not agree, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to put the resources together to protect \nthose people.\n  Well, we passed it over here. We passed it in the Senate--a \nbipartisan bill--and it died in the House of Representatives.\n  The same thing happened on important legislation such as \ntransportation. That used to be the easiest bill to pass. Who in the \nworld, elected in the House and the Senate, does not want to see better \nhighways and bridges and runways and ports across America? We know it \nis key to our economic development. We passed it on a bipartisan basis. \nWhat happened? It died in the House of Representatives. They ended up \nsending us a shell of a bill so we could go to conference and finally \ncome up with something.\n  Then the farm bill. This one troubles me. I say to the Acting \nPresident pro tempore, I know Connecticut has some farmers. We have a \nfew more in Illinois. My farmers have been through a pretty tough time \nof it. This summer has been exceptional when it comes to weather. \nVirtually every county in my State has been declared a disaster area \nbecause of drought.\n  It used to be routine on the Fourth of July to have shoulder-high \ncorn, to watch in August as it just grew even more and was ready for \nharvest. It was a magnificent scene. I have seen it every year of my \nlife. This year it was a sad scene in too many places in Illinois. The \nfarmers--many of them will get through; 80 percent of them bought crop \ninsurance--but they want to know what the farm bill is going to be next \nyear so they can get ready.\n  Well, we told them in the Senate. We passed a bipartisan farm bill in \nthe Senate. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan--what a great example \nof leadership. She not only put a good farm bill together, she brought \nPat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas on her committee, with her to the \nSenate floor and passed it with 64 votes--a bipartisan bill. It not \nonly wrote the farm programs for the next 5 years, it saved $23 \nbillion, cut it off the deficit. Pretty good work. I am proud of her.\n  So what happened to that important bill we sent to the House of \nRepresentatives 3 months ago? It died. The House announced this week \nthey were unable to pass a farm bill. Do you know why? For the same \nreason they have been unable to pass major legislation through the \ncourse of the last 2 years. They insist it be passed only with \nRepublican votes.\n  Two of the bills I mentioned--transportation and the farm bill--have \ntraditionally been the most bipartisan bills to come to the Congress. \nWhy? Because we all share the concern about the infrastructure of \nAmerica and the agricultural sector of America, Democrats and \nRepublicans. But those bills have died in the House of Representatives.\n  When the Senate Republican leader comes to the floor and talks about \nhow unproductive we have been, he fails to mention 382 Republican \nfilibusters--an all-time record of obstruction. He fails to mention his \npromise to make sure his guiding principle would be the defeat of this \nincumbent President. And he fails to mention that graveyard of \nimportant legislation across the Rotunda in the House of \nRepresentatives. That is the reality, and the reality is a troubling \none.\n  Yesterday, I did satellite radio and television feeds back to \nIllinois, and a number of the reporters said: Well, what can we do \nabout it? I said: You get your chance November 6. Decide. Decide what \nyou want. Decide if you want to send Democrats and Republicans to this \nCapitol with an awesome responsibility and also with the spirit of \nconsensus and cooperation.\n  We have had one Senate candidate in the Midwest who announced: I am \nnot going to compromise with anybody when I get to Washington. I hope \nthe people of Indiana remember that on November 6. If that is what they \nwant, that is what they will get.\n  But I sense the American people want more from us. They want us to \nwork together. There have been instances, examples where that has \nhappened. President Obama created a deficit commission called the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission. Eighteen people were appointed to it. \nSenator Harry Reid asked me to join the commission, and I did. I did \nnot think much would come of it, to be honest with you. There have been \na lot of commissions around here. They spend taxpayers' dollars and a \nlot of time and generate reports that are quickly forgotten. This was \nan exception simply because Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson came \ntogether and did an extraordinarily good job.\n  We spent a year looking at this budget and realizing that this \ndeficit is unsustainable and unacceptable. We borrow 40 cents for every \n$1 we spend in this town. Whether we are spending it on food stamps, on \nmissiles, on foreign aid, or on agricultural programs, we borrow 40 \ncents of it. And who is our No. 1 creditor in the world? The same \nnation that is our No. 1 competitor in the world, China. How about \nthat? We are borrowing money from China. Borrowing that money, of \ncourse, is at the expense of interest payments which continue to grow \nbecause of the costs we are faced with across the board.\n  So we talked in the Simpson-Bowles Commission about coming up with a \nway to reduce the deficit in a responsible fashion. I was certain, when \nI walked in the door, that we were not going to get much done there, \nand I was even certain that I was not going to vote for it because I \nthought there were some issues I just could not see my way through. But \nI came to a different conclusion. I voted yes on the Simpson-Bowles \nbipartisan deficit commission, and out of the six Senators who sat on \nthe commission--three Democrats and three Republicans--five of us voted \nyes. We believe it showed the path to a responsible reduction of the \ndeficit.\n  Well, it did not go any further, unfortunately, because the \ncommission did not have 14 votes, which it needed, and it did not have \nthe power of law, which it needed. It turns out that the original \nlegislation creating the commission had failed on the floor of the \nSenate when seven Republicans switched their votes and voted against \nit. After cosponsoring it, they voted against it.\n  Thank goodness the ideas behind Simpson-Bowles are still alive and \ncontinue to be alive. We have continued to meet. We have had Democratic \nand Republican Senators meeting almost nonstop for a long time trying \nto push forward this concept of reducing the deficit in a responsible \nway while still growing our economy and creating jobs.\n  We are going to have our chance soon to put on the table whatever we \ncan come up with. Right after the election, on December 31, we face \nwhat is known as the cliff. At that point, many important pieces of \nlegislation and laws will\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\nexpire and automatic spending cuts will go into place. It is a pretty \nserious outcome. This is our chance to come up with a bipartisan answer \nto it. We cannot get to it until after the election, which I think is \nunderstandable. It is such a highly charged political atmosphere until \nNovember 6. But after the election, it is a test--a test of the House \nand Senate as to whether the Democrats and Republicans can put the \ncampaign behind them and work together to solve some of this Nation's \nproblems.\n  The path that Simpson-Bowles laid out is a pretty direct one and a \npretty obvious one. We need to do two things to reduce our deficit. We \nneed more revenue and we need to reduce spending. Those are the two \nthings that reduce the deficit. I think we can do that. I think we can \nachieve that in a fair way. I have tried to work and continue to work \ntoward that goal.\n  I would say despite the statement of the Republican leader just a few \nminutes ago, I am more hopeful, even for the rest of this session. If \nwe can put these filibusters behind us for a moment, if we can come to \nthe floor and work together, I think we can achieve something. We did \nwith the farm bill, we did with the Transportation bill, we did with \nthe Violence Against Women Act, and we did with postal reform--\nbipartisan bills, important bills that passed the Senate and died in \nthe House. I hope if we show some leadership over here the House will \nfollow in a bipartisan fashion to deal with these same issues. We know \nwe have major problems facing us in this country, problems that will \nnot be resolved unless we work together.\n\n\n                               Super PACs\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a statement about another issue, \nwhich I think relates directly to the performance of Congress and what \nis going on in American politics today.\n  Across the street, the U.S. Supreme Court reached a decision known as \nCitizens United. It was a decision which has had a dramatic impact on \nthe way campaigns are waged in America. We have seen unprecedented--\nunprecedented--influence buying by corporations and wealthy individuals \nin a way we have never seen in the history of the United States.\n  There are about 16 or 17 multimillionaires who are investing millions \nand millions of dollars--hundreds of millions of dollars--into our \nelection process. The same thing holds true for major corporations.\n  Let me tell you some of the numbers to compare.\n  In the 2006 congressional midterm elections, outside groups spent $70 \nmillion to influence the result, Mr. President. 2006, $70 million.\n  Four years later, in 2010, outside groups raised the $70 million \nfigure to $294 million--four times the amount they spent in 2006.\n  In the current Presidential election cycle outside special interest \ngroups and wealthy individuals have already broken the record of 2010. \nThese outside groups--and these are not the campaigns of any candidates \nor even political parties--have already spent, with 7 weeks to go, $350 \nmillion, breaking all records for outside money.\n  How is this money being spent? Turn on your television in a \nbattleground State and try to get around the television ads. They have \nspent $50 million more than they did in 2008--and we are just entering \nthe end of this campaign when the expenditures will skyrocket.\n  If there was ever any doubt that the Citizens United decision would \nlead to a flood of campaign cash from wealthy individuals and \ncorporations, we have our answer.\n  At the end of 2010, there were 84 active super PACs. Two years later, \nthere are now 657 super PACs prepared to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars to persuade voters.\n  The only thing worse than this unprecedented amount of money from \nspecial interest groups and wealthy individuals flooding our airwaves \nis the fact that ordinary Americans often have no idea where this money \nis coming from.\n  In 2006, only 1 percent of all outside spending came from secret \ndonors. In 2010, after Citizens United and the rise of super PACs, \nsecret donors rocketed to 46 percent of the outside spending in \ncampaigns, which means when we see the ads on television, we have no \nidea, generally--in half the cases at least--who is paying for it.\n  As I have said before, these are not just super PACs, these are \noutside groups pouring money into elections. They are super secret PACs \nin many instances because the public has shockingly little information \nabout the sources of the money. These super secret PACs and the wealthy \nindividuals and corporations behind them are drowning out the voices of \naverage citizens, and many times the voices of the candidates \nthemselves.\n  Our representative democracy values transparency, participation, and \nopen debates. Unfortunately, nonpartisan reports indicate that as the \namount of money flooding into campaigns increases, core democratic \nprinciples are diminished.\n  The little that we have been able to learn about the major donors to \nthese super PACs is very disturbing. Mr. President, 17 percent of all \nfunds raised by super PACs came from for-profit businesses. It is safe \nto say that their primary goal is generally not advancing the public \ninterest but, rather, enhancing their corporate bottom line.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of funds given to super PACs during this \nPresidential election--80 percent of all the $350 million that I \nmentioned--came from 196 people--196 people who want to control our \ncampaign process.\n  Moreover, there is an ultra-elite club of 22 millionaires and \nbillionaires who provided half of all super-PAC money being spent in \nthis Presidential election--22 Americans. I do not begrudge anyone \ntheir success in life or in business. I applaud it. The voices of \nbusiness leaders, wealthy individuals, and special interests should be \nheard as part of the public debate. They are an important part of our \ncountry, and they need a seat at the policymaking table. Their voices, \nhowever, are not the only voices and opinions that matter. They should \nnot occupy every seat at the policymaking table or buy control of what \nis served on that table.\n  A Las Vegas casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson; billionaire oil tycoons, \ntwo brothers, Charles and David Koch; and the multimillionaire head of \na retail empire, Art Pope, may have achieved laudable business success, \nbut their economic success does not entitle them to secretly use their \nvirtually unlimited resources and impose their political will and their \npolitical agenda on America. Unfortunately, after the Citizens United \ncase, that is exactly what they are trying to do.\n  The Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is reportedly the most \ngenerous super-PAC donor. He has contributed $36 million and threatens \nto spend even more. His first spend was on a candidate named Newt \nGingrich. When he did not make it to the finish line, Mr. Adelson said \nthat he is now going to give it to the Republican nominee for \nPresident. That is a lot of money and a lot of influence and probably \nmore, but for this particular super-PAC donor, that $36 million \ncontribution, when you look at his wealth, is equivalent to $168 from \nthe average American.\n  The terms of the political debate and, I fear, the outcome of many \nelections are not being set by 314 million Americans whose lives, jobs, \nsafety, and health are impacted by the decisions of the people they \nelect; instead, it is the 22, 22 wealthy individuals pouring money into \nsuper PACs that have outsized influence on the terms of our political \ndebate and the outcome of our elections.\n  Our fellow Americans may not know the intricate details of campaign \nfinance laws, but they know their voices are being drowned out by these \ncorporations, special interests, and wealthy individuals. Many people \nare losing confidence in this democracy as a result. According to a \nrecent survey, three out of four Americans believe corruption has \nincreased over the last 3 years. Well, in some part, we can thank the \nCitizens United decision for that.\n  The time to fix our broken campaign finance system is now. I am a \nrealist. I understand that most Americans view this flood of spending \nby special interest groups and wealthy individuals on political \ncampaigns the same way they view gangland slayings: Let them shoot one \nanother as much as they want. As long as the bullets do not hit us, as \nlong as we do not have to watch, let them have their fun.\n  But it is more serious than that. If our political process is stolen \naway\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\nfrom the average American, even the average candidate, by these special \ninterest groups and wealthy individuals, it will diminish our \ndemocracy, there is no question. So here is an idea, one I have been \npushing for a long time. I introduced the Fair Elections Now Act, which \nwould create a public financing system that would free candidates from \nthe dangerous reliance on super PACs once and for all. Under Fair \nElections, viable candidates who qualify for Fair Elections programs \nwould raise campaign funds in small amounts from individual donors--\nsmall amounts. Once they have raised a certain threshold number of \nsmall donations, they could receive matching funds and grants \nsufficient to run a competitive campaign. Fair Elections would \nfundamentally reform our broken system and put the average citizens \nback in control of their elections and their country.\n  I wonder what the American people would think of shorter campaigns \ndirected to the issues, actual debates between the candidates? Would \nthey miss us if they did not see all of those ads on television? I do \nnot think they would miss us.\n  I also support the DISCLOSE Act. The Supreme Court got it wrong in \nCitizens United, but this bill we have tried to pass would require \nsuper PACs and other big spenders to disclose all donors who give \n$10,000 or more to influence an election. What is wrong with \ntransparency and disclosure when it comes to our democratic political \nprocess?\n  I chair the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Human Rights.\n  I will tell you that when it comes to constitutional amendments, I \nhave been pretty picky as a Member of the House and Senate. I think the \nConstitution which I have sworn to uphold and defend as a Member of the \nSenate and the House is an extraordinary document. I am not so bold or \nbigheaded to think I have a great idea that ought to be parked right in \nthe middle of that fantastic and sacred document. I have been skeptical \nof those who have offered amendments over the years. As I have said, I \ndo not believe we should take a roller brush to a Rembrandt. It is an \namazing work of political art, and we should take care not to amend it \nexcept in the most extraordinary situations.\n  During the most recent hearing I chaired on the impact of Citizens \nUnited, our subcommittee received 1,959,063 petition signatures from \nAmericans representing every State in the Union, almost 2 million \nAmericans. These Americans support the constitutional amendment that \nwould stop the pernicious influence of secret corporate and special \ninterest money.\n  I see on the floor Senator Udall of New Mexico, who has been a leader \non this issue on this constitutional amendment. As I have said, I am \nvery selective in the constitutional amendments to which I will add my \nname. I have joined him because I think he is right.\n  Citizens United has corrupted this political process. The likelihood \nthat Congress can change it is a long shot. If it is going to be \nchanged, it needs to be changed in a meaningful way so that we can \nreclaim our political process for the people of this country and take \nit away from the 22 multimillionaires and billionaires who are trying \nto take control of this political process.\n  I stand with these 2 million Americans, and I stand with Senator \nUdall and so many others because the way we finance our campaigns in \nthis country is in urgent need of reform.\n  This will be the last day or two the Senate meets before the \nelections. I wanted to come to the floor and speak to this issue before \nthe election, whatever the outcome may be. America is not a better and \nstronger nation when we give up our political process to the wealthy \nand politically articulate. The strength of America is when every \nperson has a voice and a vote and they are not going to be overshadowed \nor outdistanced because of someone who happens to be very wealthy and \nvery successful and wants to buy their way into our political system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, before my colleague, Senator \nDurbin, leaves the floor, let me just say that this whole issue, as he \nhas pointed out, of campaign finance is a pressing issue. It is one \nthat is before us now. We are seeing it play out in the campaign. I am \nsure that at the end of this campaign, citizens across this country are \ngoing to demand reform, they are going to demand change. The Senator \nhas outlined several pieces of legislation that I believe really do \nthat. This constitutional amendment is one. The DISCLOSE Act, a piece \nof legislation the Senator has offered and fought for, I think both in \nthe House and the Senate, really brings transparency to the process. \nThey bring disclosure to the process, and we need to do it. So I really \nappreciate the Senator's leadership and look forward to working with \nthe Senator very closely on this issue as we get into the next \nCongress.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Russell Train\n\n  I rise today to pay tribute to a gentleman by the name of Russell \nTrain. On Monday of this week, our Nation lost a great friend of the \nenvironment. I was saddened to learn of the passing of Russell Train. \nRuss was a true pioneer in the history of environmental protection. He \nwas a part of that great generation of bipartisan leaders, that \nremarkable group of men and women, Democrats and Republicans, who put \nthe environment center stage, who championed conservation. My father, \nwho knew and admired Russ, was also a part of that generation. They \nleave very big shoes to fill. Their legacy is monumental.\n  Russ Train's life parallels so much of the history of the \nenvironmental movement in this country because he was part of that \nhistory because he did so much to make it happen. In 1965, when he was \n45, Russ left his position as U.S. Tax Court judge. He decided to \ndevote himself full time to conservation and became president of the \nConservation Foundation. His midlife career change may have been a loss \nfor the Tax Court, but it was a huge gain for the environment.\n  Brilliant, tenacious, committed, he dedicated the rest of his life to \nthe environment. Along with Rachel Carson, the celebrated author of \n``Silent Spring,'' Russ helped raise environmental issues to the \nnational level. He served as Under Secretary of Interior from in 1969 \nto 1970. He was the first Chairman of the White House Council on \nEnvironmental Quality from 1970 to 1973. He was instrumental in the \ncreation of the Environmental Protection Agency and headed it from 1973 \nto 1977. During those years, he oversaw landmark legislation: the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Toxic \nSubstance Control Act. All bore the imprint of Russell Train.\n  Perhaps his most lasting achievement was the National Environmental \nPolicy Act of 1970. He helped see that groundbreaking legislation \nthrough the Nixon White House and through Congress. For over 40 years \nnow, NEPA has required Federal agencies to prepare environmental impact \nstatements for any major projects. NEPA is justly regarded as the \nfoundation for U.S. environmental protections.\n  But what began as a bipartisan triumph was later subject to partisan \ndivide. While in the House in 2005, I served as the ranking member of a \ntask force whose stated purpose was to review and improve NEPA. But \nthere were those who wanted to destroy it--with 1 swift blow or by \n1,000 cuts but destroy it all the same. Many of us fought very hard not \nto let that happen. As I said at that time, where critics of NEPA saw \nonly delay, we saw deliberation. Where they saw postponed profits, we \nsaw public input. NEPA was then and is now an antidote to the potential \narrogance of government power. It listens to the community, it \naddresses opposition early on, and in the long run it minimizes \nconflict and protects the environment. It trusts the American people to \ntake part in managing their public resources. And it remains one of \nRussell Train's greatest legacies.\n  Russ himself stated it best at the 40th anniversary of NEPA. He said:\n\n       NEPA is America's most-imitated environmental legislation \n     around the globe. What we launched in 1970 has become a \n     contribution to the planet not less than to our citizenry . . \n     . NEPA's legacy is that what the people know has great value \n     to a government that seeks their knowledge and takes it \n     seriously.\n\n  After leaving the government, Russell led the U.S. branch of the \nWorld\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nWildlife Fund for many years. He did so with his usual passion and \ncommitment, always engaged, always pragmatic and reasonable but ever \nthe visionary for a better world.\n  In 1991 President Bush awarded Russ the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom.\n  Russell Train was a remarkable man. Jill and I have been honored to \ncall him and his wonderful wife Aileen our friends. We extend our \nsincere condolences to Aileen and their children and hope they will \ntake comfort in knowing the world is a better place for Russell's life \nand work.\n\n\n                        New Mexico's Centennial\n\n  On January 16, 1912, President Taft signed the proclamation making \nNew Mexico the 47th State. So it is with great pride that I join \nSenator Bingaman in submitting a resolution recognizing the centennial \nanniversary of our State.\n  For those of us who are blessed to call New Mexico home, we are \nimprinted by its remarkable history and its awesome beauty. We are part \nof the rich diversity of its people.\n  One hundred years ago, the population of New Mexico was 327,000 \npeople. Now it is over 2 million. But the mix of Native American, \nHispanic, and European tradition has long been a part of our State. New \nMexico is a land of deep roots. We are enriched by this mosaic of \nculture. It has informed our history, our art, and our sense of who we \nare as a people. Our State is rightly called the Land of Enchantment. \nIt is also a land of courage. From the Civil War to Teddy Roosevelt's \nRough Riders, from the Navajo Code Talkers to Bataan and Corregidor, \nand from Korea and Vietnam to the brave men and women who have served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, when our Nation has called, New Mexico has \nalways stood ready to answer that call.\n\n  The story of New Mexico is a long and proud one. It goes back well \nover 10,000 years to the Clovis people. It goes back to Santa Fe, \nfounded in 1610, the oldest capital city in the United States. In 1920, \nRoute 66 connected New Mexico to California and to the Midwest. This \nand other interstate projects that followed brought jobs and more \npeople to our State, and today we need a new commitment to investing in \nthe infrastructure that is essential to renewed prosperity.\n  In the 1920s and 1930s, New Mexico was part of an oil boom that \nfueled the rest of the Nation, and today we are on the cutting edge of \nclean energy technology, helping to reduce our Nation's dependence on \nforeign oil. In the 1940s and 1950s Sandia and Los Alamos National Labs \nbecame legendary centers of scientific innovation and research. Today \nthey continue to play a vital role in our Nation's security. Our State \nis also promoting STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and \nmath--so that our graduates can get good jobs, so they can compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  How we address these issues will shape the next 100 years in our \nState, but I am sure of one thing: We have a blend of cultures and \nbackgrounds like nowhere else. It has helped bring us where we are \ntoday. It will help take us where we need to go tomorrow. The vitality \nand creativity of our people is as strong as ever. Working together, we \nwill continue to meet the challenges of our State and our Nation. In \nthis year of our centennial, we look back to our unique history and we \nlook forward to a bright future.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, for allowing me to \nfinish my statement. I appreciate very much his courtesy. With that, I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am going to tell you the story today of a \nlove affair. It is a story that is a steamy one. It is a story of \nillicit behavior, of treachery, and of gluttony. It is a story that \ninvolves intrigue and deception. It is a story of unintended \nconsequences, and it is a story of anger and violence. It is the story \nof American foreign aid.\n  Joseph Sambayi Mukendie never sleeps at home anymore. Mukendie's \nsleep is interrupted by dreams. He feels unsafe even a continent away \nfrom his attackers. Mukendie was arrested at home one night. He was \ntaken to an underground cell at Camp Kongolo--a military base in \nKinshasha, Zaire. The secret police of Mobutu stripped him naked, \nstretched him out on the floor, and then he was beaten with a large \nstick with nails protruding from the end.\n  Mobutu received billions of dollars in foreign aid from our country. \nOver his 30-year bloody dictatorship, he received billions of our \ntaxpayer dollars. As his people starved, his wife went to Europe, spent \nmillions of dollars on spending sprees. Zaire has very little running \nwater and sporadic electricity. It rotted under Mobutu's rule, and yet \nhe received billions of American dollars. Mobutu stole the lion's share \nof this. He became one of the richest men in the world. Enough was \nstolen that his wealth was estimated to be in the billions. They called \nhis wife Gucci Mobutu. Her shoe collection rivaled Imelda Marcos'. She \nwas capable of spending $1 million in one day in Europe.\n  Jean Nguza Karl-i-Bond was an ally of Mobutu who fell out of his \nfavor. Mobutu accused him of trying to seduce the First Lady. Many \nbelieved his only crime was that he was mentioned in the foreign press \nas a possible successor to Mobutu. Nguza was subjected to physical and \nelectric torture to the genitals--too horrific to even repeat. The \nadministration of Jimmy Carter, who ostensibly were champions of human \nrights, nevertheless continued the steady flow of foreign aid, for \nforeign aid is a bipartisan project. There is a consensus in the United \nStates and in the Senate. We must send it no matter what the behavior \nof the recipients.\n  Not only did our leaders turn a blind eye to Mobutu's graft and human \nrights abuses, they bestowed upon him inexplicable and personal \nfriendship. Mobutu was known as a personal friend of the first \nPresident Bush and vacationed at his personal residence. When Mobutu \ntraveled to Europe, he would stop by the Central Bank of Zaire. Early \nin his reign, he would come by with a Louie Vuitton bag and would get \nabout $50,000 in cash. Toward the end of his career, he was getting \n$500,000 in cash for these trips to Europe. One of his many foreign \nresidences was in Switzerland. He apparently had the time and money to \nvacation there, and even had his own brandy being made at our \ntaxpayers' expense.\n  It is sad to contemplate what despots and dictators have done and are \ndoing to their people. It is sadder still to realize they are being \nsubsidized in this horrific behavior by taxpayer money. And it \ncontinues. We are having a debate now over foreign aid because they \nstill want to send more. Many people think the answer is to send more; \nmaybe they will behave better if they get more of our money.\n  Apologists for foreign aid don't deny foreign aid has often been \nstolen by corrupt leaders, and there is evidence the humanitarian \noutcomes are scant and don't occur. Nevertheless, the advocates of \nforeign aid justify the continuing aid with the argument we must often \nchoose the lesser of two evils. As many have pointed out, the lesser of \ntwo evils is still evil.\n  Throughout the Cold War, the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism, \nthough, clouded the minds of many leaders. American leaders would pick \none dictator over another if he or she were a pro-American dictator. We \ndidn't care what they were doing to their people. We turned a blind \neye.\n  We gave money to dictators from Saddam Hussein, who was once our \nally, receiving billions of our tax dollars, to the mujahedin, who were \nradical jihadists. But at the time, we didn't mind if they were a \nradical jihadist if they were our radical jihadist because they were \nopposing the Soviet Union. But the mujahedin actually, eventually, \nbecame the Taliban, who are now our enemies. We despise jihad now, and \nwe fight against radical Islamic jihad. But at one time we subsidized \njihad. In fact, there were several weapons left over from the time \nperiod when we were giving weapons to the mujahedin.\n  We subsidized Qadhafi before we fought Qadhafi. We gave Qadhafi \nforeign aid. He was our friend. In the year preceding his overthrow, \nthere were Senators from this body speaking with Qadhafi's family about \nsending more money to Qadhafi. Where does the insanity end?\n  U.S. foreign aid has continued to flow despite a long string of \nabuses well-known to most of those who are dispensing the aid. They \nsimply turn a blind eye. Except for Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia, where \nmany are saying let's\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\nsend the money to secularists; now there is a question as to whether \nsome of that money may be going to radical Islamists.\n  With the end of the Cold War, some were finally cut off. Mobutu, whom \nI mentioned, who committed these atrocious acts of torture, finally was \ncut off, but only after 30 years of receiving our taxpayer money, \ntorturing his own people, and stealing everyone blind.\n  Foreign aid from developed countries in 2006 totaled $100 billion a \nyear. Over the past 50 years, we have given $2 trillion to developing \ncountries in foreign aid. Over the past 42 years, Easterly states that \nalthough $568 billion has flowed into Africa, per-capita growth in \nincome in Africa has been flat. In fact, in some countries, such as \nZimbabwe, where Mugabe was in charge for several decades, the growth \nrate has actually been negative.\n  So for those who say: I just simply want to help people; I want to \nhelp poor people around the world by sending them money, it is stolen \nby their leaders. It doesn't get to the poor people, and, besides, some \nmay have heard we are $1 trillion short in our budget. How can we send \nmore money overseas?\n  Some academics have argued that with the Arab spring, the emerging \ndemocracies will require even more foreign aid. Hillary Clinton is on \nCapitol Hill today asking for more money to go to Egypt. As they burn \nour flag, as the hordes gather by the tens of thousands, she is asking \nto send Egypt more money. There were no Egyptian policemen or soldiers \nwho showed up when our Ambassador was attacked, and Hillary Clinton is \nasking for more money to go to Egypt.\n  According to Coyne and Ryan, the world's worst dictators have \nreceived $105 billion under the guise of official developmental \nassistance. Instead of helping the poor, the assistance is aiding the \nability of the dictators to remain in power. In fact, it keeps them in \npower long enough that it inflames the populace so that we end up \nhaving to go back in because of war because the populace is so inflamed \nagainst the dictator that we have propped up against popular rule.\n  Some academics argue emerging democracies will require more aid. \nProfessors Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith argue:\n\n       Democracy would make the price much higher. Democracy in \n     Egypt comes at a big price for U.S. voters. Good or bad--that \n     is up to the observer, but it will be costly, no doubt.\n\n  The professors' argument is that democracy is messy and costs more to \nsubsidize because the ballot box gives voice to the minorities that \ndictators would not hear, that they would silence or imprison.\n  I think the real question and the image we have to have in our mind \nis when we see 10,000 people outside the Embassy in Pakistan burning \nthe U.S. flag, imagine that we would send them more money. Imagine we \nwould not ask for restrictions on this money. I have been asking for 6 \nweeks to place restrictions on foreign aid. I am not even asking that \nit end, although I would, but I am asking to simply place restrictions \non it. Everyone should watch this vote. If I get this vote, just watch. \nThe vast majority of the Senate is going to vote for unlimited, \nunrestricted foreign aid. I will probably lose this vote, but when we \nask our friends, when we go home and ask our friends: Should we be \nsending money to countries that disrespect us, to countries that burn \nour flag, I think most will find that 80 to 90 percent of the American \npeople wouldn't send another penny. That may be why Congress has about \na 10-percent approval rating. They don't get it. Ninety percent of the \nfolks up here are going to vote to continue sending taxpayer money with \nno restrictions to countries that burn our flag and disrespect us. Is \nit any wonder that only 10 percent of America approves of Congress?\n  In fact, many people who claim to be conservatives are for foreign \naid. Big government conservative advocates, such as John Guardiano, try \nto couch their support in feigned opposition. He says:\n\n       Now, I don't like foreign aid any more than the next \n     conservative. Most foreign aid is probably economically \n     wasteful and counterproductive. But the point of foreign aid \n     is not economics. It is geopolitics.\n\n  That is what most of them will admit around here. Continuing his \nquote:\n\n       It is intended to shape a recipient country's behavior and, \n     quite literally, buy American influence.\n\n  To his mind he says it does that. But if foreign aid is meant to \nshape a country's behavior, advocates have a lot of explaining to do. \nFrom Mobutu to Mugabe, from Mubarak to Hussein to Qadhafi, from the \ncurrent Egypt to the current Pakistan that is holding a gentleman who \nhelped us get bin Laden, to the current Pakistan that seemed somehow to \nlet bin Laden live for 7 years in their midst with no knowledge he was \nthere--they have some explaining to do. For those who advocate foreign \naid, saying it is shaping the behavior of these countries, they have \nsome explaining to do because it doesn't appear as if these countries \nrespect America. It doesn't appear as if they even like us. And it also \ndoesn't appear that if they want to be our ally they are acting like \nit.\n  That is all I am asking. If a country wants to be an ally of our \ncountry, they should act like it. If they want to receive and cash an \nAmerican check, they need to act like our ally at the very least.\n  There is some question about whether the aid works when it is sent \nfor poverty or humanitarian purposes.\n  Doug Bandow asked this question and argues that foreign aid actually \nencourages poverty and starvation because African nations use displays \nof poverty and starvation to seek more aid. Why get rid of your \nproblem? Why cure your problem if that is what you are showing the \nworld you have so you can get more aid? We don't seem to care about \nresults because we continue to give it to some of these dictators for \ndecades, who produce no results and we know are stealing the money.\n  Brautigram and Knack illustrate the existence of a moral hazard \nproblem surrounding foreign aid. They contend that aid allocation may \nactually encourage impoverishing policy because as the damaging \npolicies create misery, the more likely the donors are to grant more \naid.\n  Herb Werlin maintains that American foreign aid is undermined by \ntariffs and subsidies, including a $3 billion-a-year subsidy lavished \non 25,000 cotton farmers. Because of high subsidies, America is able to \nexport corn at two-thirds the cost of production, making it impossible \nfor African farmers to compete. So our trade policy makes it harder for \nAfrican countries to become self-sufficient. Peanuts are protected by a \ntariff up to 164 percent, thereby making Africa's peanut-producing \nnations, such as Uganda, even more dependent on aid.\n  But it is not just rich people in poor countries getting foreign aid; \nwe also continue to shift our dollars to rich countries.\n  Michael Tennant reports:\n\n       According to a report from the Congressional Research \n     Service, in fiscal year 2010 the United States' top creditor \n     nations received millions of dollars in aid.\n\n  So the countries we are borrowing money from, we are sending them \nforeign aid. China, to whom we owe over $1 trillion, still gets $27 \nmillion in aid. Russia, to whom we owe $127 billion, still gets $71 \nmillion in aid. To add insult to injury, China gets economic \ndevelopment assistance from the U.S. taxpayer.\n  It just amazes me. But you mark my words, you listen to the debate, \nand you watch the vote today--the vast majority does not want any \nchange to foreign aid other than that they would increase it. If we are \nnot getting the behavior we want, they would increase it.\n  Hillary Clinton is on Capitol Hill today asking to increase aid to \nEgypt--not to put restrictions on the aid, to increase it. We currently \ndo have some restrictions on aid to Egypt. Hillary Clinton has waived \nthose and said they are doing fine.\n  When the marauders, when the horde came to the Embassy in Egypt last \nweek, there was a phone call made to our Embassy saying: The mob is \ncoming. But no soldiers came. No one came to protect our Embassy. In \nthe civilized world, the host nation protecting the guest nation's \nEmbassy is of primary concern. It is something every civilized nation \nis expected to do. In the case of Egypt, no one came. We were lucky \nthat we escaped death in Egypt. We weren't so lucky in Libya.\n  The report on China that found out we were borrowing money and then\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\ngiving foreign aid to countries we borrow from was commissioned by \nSenator Tom Coburn, who has been watching out for your money. He \ndemanded this report, and he said:\n\n       Borrowing money from countries who receive our aid is \n     dangerous for both the donor and the recipient. If countries \n     can afford to buy our debt, perhaps they can afford to fund \n     their own assistance programs without relying on the American \n     taxpayer.\n\n  Michael Tennant goes on to say this:\n\n       We give China 3.9 million to enforce the rule of law and \n     human rights, neither of which are thought to be China's \n     selling points.\n\n  The one that really burns, though, is that $700,000 in economic \ndevelopment assistance. It just boggles the mind that the U.S. taxpayer \nis asked to send money to China--which is outcompeting us in virtually \nevery sector--to send money to subsidize their economic development \nassistance.\n  One would think that with all this evidence that foreign aid doesn't \nreach the intended beneficiaries and often winds up in the hands of \ndictators, this information would make it easy to defeat foreign aid.\n  When you look at the polls of the American people, you find that \nnearly 80 percent of the American people think foreign aid in general \nis a bad idea. We have roads in our country that are crumbling and need \nrepair. We have bridges that are crumbling. In my State alone, we had a \nbridge out 6 months last year. We have two bridges in Kentucky that are \nolder than I am and need to be replaced. We don't have the money, but \nwe somehow have billions of dollars to send to people who disrespect us \nand burn our flag. I don't understand how we can send our money to \nthese countries that disdain us, disrespect us.\n  In Pakistan, they hold the doctor who helped us get bin Laden. We \nfought a 10-year war in Afghanistan to get bin Laden and his followers. \nWe finally got him--no help from Pakistan. He lived in Pakistan for \nmany years. Pakistan is now mad that we got him. In fact, they riot \nover there and burn the American flag because we killed bin Laden. What \ndo we do? Here is some more money. If we give you some more money, will \nyou behave. If we give you more money, will you let our supplies go \nacross your northern frontier.\n  But we don't ask them the real question: Are you our friend? If you \nare our friend, act like it. If you are our ally, act like it.\n  Anytime this question is broached over foreign aid, the vast majority \nof career politicians complain bitterly and quash any debate. I have \nbeen trying to have this vote for 6 weeks. I am still hopeful we will \nget it, but they don't want to vote on this because they know they are \nvoting against the popular will, they are voting against the wishes of \ntheir constituents.\n  There is not one Senator from any one of the 50 States up here who, \nwhen they vote against these limitations on foreign aid, won't be \nvoting against the will of their State--they won't be voting against \nthe will of their people. You can go to Massachusetts or Maine or to \nconservative Texas and ask the taxpayers, ask the voters: Are you in \nfavor of sending money to these countries where tens of thousands of \npeople are gathering and burning our flag? Are you in favor of sending \nhard-earned taxpayer money to countries that disrespect us? Are you in \nfavor of sending money to these countries when we have so many problems \nat home that we can't handle? And in every State in the Union, you will \nfind that a majority of voters--sometimes a vast majority of the \nvoters--think it is a mistake. So what is happening here is that the \nwill of the people is not being transmitted by this body because this \nbody, when it votes on this issue, will vote in direct defiance of the \nwill of the people.\n\n  It is often said that it is difficult to determine whether a \nrecipient is a friend or a foe. Libya is an example. One day Libya came \nin from the cold. A longtime pariah among nations, rivaling Iran as a \nmodel for extreme thuggishness, Libya came in from the cold. Libya and \nher Colonel Qadhafi phoned the West and said they would change their \nways, they would stop developing weapons of mass destruction and become \ngood neighbors to all. This is before the recent Libyan revolution. \nThis is the Qadhafi, whom we helped to overturn, who was by all \naccounts a horrible dictator, but about 2 or 3 years ago he came in \nfrom the cold and wanted to be a friend to America because he wanted \nour assistance.\n  With an alacrity sped by naivete, the West welcomed Qadhafi back into \nthe bosom of respected nations. Delegations of U.S. Senators--ones who \nare still in this body--went to meet with Qadhafi, to meet with \nQadhafi's family, to offer Qadhafi money. Prime Minister Tony Blair \ngushed with praise for his new friend Colonel Qadhafi. President Bush \nconcluded that Libya was no longer a sponsor of terror. Three Senators \nmet with Qadhafi's son and, according to leaked cables, offered him \naid. Fast-forward barely a year later into the Arab spring, and these \nsame Senators who were offering Qadhafi aid were back in Libya offering \nthe rebels aid.\n  We should scratch our heads and say: My goodness. Maybe we should \nquestion the judgment of these people who tell you foreign aid should \nbe given to everyone all the time, and if they misbehave, give them \nmore, because you have Senators from this body going and offering aid \nto Qadhafi and a year later offering it to the rebels to overthrow \nQadhafi and saying Qadhafi is a terrible dictator. He was. He always \nwas. But he played a game, and we accepted the game because we are \nalways willing to play the game with your money.\n  Egypt. Egypt is a pile of contradictions. In the words of former CIA \nAgent Robert Baer, ``If you want a serious interrogation, you send a \nprisoner to Jordan. If you want them tortured, you send them to Syria. \nBut if you want them to disappear--never to see them again--you send \nthem to Egypt.''\n  This was the Egypt under Mubarak, who--when we felt someone needed to \nbe tortured or disappeared and we didn't want there to be any \nrepercussions coming back on us, that is where they sent them--to \nEgypt.\n  Over the past 30 years, we bought this sort of regime there to do our \nbidding when we wished. It became very unpopular with the people. So \nyou wonder about the Arab spring and you wonder, why are these people \nso unhappy? Well, they hated Mubarak because he was a dictator, he was \nan autocrat, and they didn't have freedom of speech, they didn't have \nfreedom of association, and they were beaten with billy clubs if they \ntried to gather. Their political parties were outlawed. They hated \nMubarak because he was antidemocrat. He didn't allow voting. But he was \nour guy. We paid for him.\n  So you have to think this through. Why is there such widespread anti-\nAmericanism? Because we have propped up and given money to so many \ndespots, to so many dictators. Over the past 30 years, the United \nStates sent over $30 billion to Egypt to help finance a police state \nruled by an emergency decree that lasted several decades.\n  Khaled Said became the face of that foreign aid, as pictures of his \nbloody beating at the hands of the Egyptian police spurred the youth of \nEgypt to take to the streets in the Arab spring of 2011.\n  On June 6, 2010, Said had been sitting on the second floor of a cyber \ncafe. Two detectives from the Sidi Gaber police station entered the \npremises and arrested him. Multiple witnesses testified that Said was \nbeaten to death by the police, who reportedly hit him and smashed him \nagainst objects as he was led outside to their police car.\n  The owner of the Internet cafe in which Said was arrested stated that \nhe witnessed Said being beaten to death in the doorway of the building \nacross the street after the detectives took him out of the cafe at the \nowner's request.\n  Another young man, Wael Ghonim, a young Egyptian living in Dubai, \nfound the photos of Said after he was beaten to death by police, and he \nstarted a Facebook page. It is called ``We are all Khaled Said.'' It \nwas moderated by Wael Ghonim. It brought attention to his death, and it \nbecame a phenomenon and spread across the Middle East as people saw the \ndeath of this man, beaten to death by the police.\n  So we have to think, why are we seeing people burning the American \nflag? Why are we seeing such great unrest in 30 different countries? \nBecause our foreign aid and our military aid have propped up dictators \nwho become, over decades, despotic, autocratic, who torture their \npeople and prevent freedom from occurring, and then there is a\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nbacklash. What we are seeing is the backlash of 30 years of foreign aid \nand propping up military dictatorships simply because they were \npredisposed to like us as opposed to someone else.\n  ``We are all Khaled Said'' was the rallying cry that brought hundreds \nof thousands of people to the streets in Egypt. Ghonim's Facebook, \nwhere he posted ``We are all Khaled Said,'' spawned a revolution.\n  As hundreds of thousands of protesters filled Tahrir Square, the \npolice beat them back.\n  David Reiff of the New Republic reports:\n\n       U.S. military aid to Egypt, which averages $1.3 billion \n     annually, allowed the Egyptian police and paramilitaries to \n     bombard protestors with volley after volley of tear gas made \n     by a company in Pennsylvania.\n\n  Why are they angry? They know this. They know their protests are \nbeaten down by autocrats supported by the United States who are \nspraying tear gas on them that is made in the United States. We have to \nunderstand the dynamic if we are ever to try to improve the situation.\n  The protest in Egypt escalated day after day. An unemployed man by \nthe name of Salah Mahmoud, who had moved to Cairo in search of work to \nsave enough money to own a home and marry but instead had been living \non small day's wages, set himself on fire in the middle of the street \nbefore being put out by bystanders.\n  The U.S. military aid and tactical training given to Libya, Egypt, \nand Tunisia to fight terrorism was used to fight against free \nassociation and freedom of speech of their people.\n  When we hear about the Arab spring, we need to understand where the \nArab spring comes from. The Arab spring was a rising up for democracy. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. But why would a rising up for \ndemocracy take on anti-American tones? I am as offended as anybody else \nby people burning our flag. But we have to understand why did the Arab \nspring that seemed to be a search for freedom and democracy--why did it \nget transformed into an Arab winter? Why did it get transformed into an \nanti-American protest? Because the tear gas that rained down on them \nfor decades was made here, because the police batons were paid for with \nour money, because Mubarak, who stole millions of dollars and whose \nfamily lived with such wealth and abundance, with homes in London and \nParis and secret Swiss accounts, got that at our expense. So when they \nhated Mubarak, they hated us also. They hated us because we were \nMubarak. They hated us because we were Ben Ali in Tunisia. They hated \nus because we were at one time Saddam Hussein's friend.\n  If we do not understand this, we are never going to figure out a way \nto make things better. There are many and ample fiscal reasons to \noppose foreign aid, but Thomas Eddlem puts it succinctly when he \nwrites: ``Foreign aid has historically been used to suppress freedom \nand has reduced the moral influence of the example of the U.S. \nConstitution.''\n  It is hard for us to imagine, because we have such a great \nConstitution and such great freedom here, why they don't appreciate \nthat. Why don't they appreciate and look to the shining example we set? \nWe do set a great example in our country for freedom and tolerance and \nassociation. Why can't the folks in the Middle East see that? Because \nthey see the truncheon, they see the police baton, they see the jail \ncells, they see trial without jury from the autocrats we have \nsupported. We have to understand why this anti-Americanism comes. It \nhas come because, largely, our foreign aid for decade upon decade has \nbeen given to despots throughout the Middle East. Those despots have \nrun roughshod on their people and their people are unhappy.\n  It is not that they despise our Constitution. I think many of them \nwould like to have the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, but it \nis confusing to us because we think: Oh, they hate what America is all \nabout. They hate America for our wealth and freedom. They don't hate \nwealth and freedom. They probably don't hate us in the abstract, but \nthey hate us because when they see Mubarak, when they see the other end \nof a truncheon coming from the police of Mubarak or the police of \nSaddam Hussein or the chemical weaponry and the chemical gas Hussein \nsprayed on his people, they see where it came from and they see the \nmoney that came in to prop up these dictators.\n  From 1980 to 1988, there was a war. We have largely forgotten about \nit. It was between Iran and Iraq. In that war there were planes on both \nsides, American planes, because we had sold planes to both sides. At \nthe time, Iran was still flying many F-4s, a couple hundred F-4 \nPhantoms, and on the other side we had advisers on the ground advising \nHussein.\n  Hussein was our ally. We sent money to Hussein on a routine basis. \nThere are some reports that said Hussein directly got money from our \nCIA. So we can understand the confusion over there and we can \nunderstand that even though Iraq was been liberated and there is a \ndemocracy there, that some of them still seem to hate us for some \nreason. We wonder why they would hate us if we freed them. Because some \nstill remember Hussein and they fear there will be another Hussein.\n  One of the saddest stories that came up in the last week was a young \nsoldier who was killed in Afghanistan. He was killed by the policeman, \nthe Afghan policeman he was training. We have had over 50 deaths in \nAfghanistan this year from friendly fire, from our supposed allies. \nThis one was particularly sad. This boy was to come home within a week \nor two. His brother was having a football game. He was supposed to make \nhis brother's football game. This is a patriotic family, a military \nfamily. This boy proudly served, and he deserves nothing but our \nadmiration. But he called his dad a week before and he said to his dad: \nI think the guy I am training is going to kill me. The Afghan policeman \nhad been coming up to him for weeks saying, ``We don't want you here.''\n  These are the people we are sending our money to. We are sending our \nyoung men and women to die over there, but we are supporting people who \nit is not clear want to be our friends or want to be our allies. It is \nnot clear we can win their friendship. The President of Afghanistan, \nKarzai, we basically helped get in power. He stays in power probably \nbecause of our presence there. Yet he is disdainful of us. They have \nsaid if there is a war with Pakistan--Karzai said he would side with \nPakistan.\n  When there was a shooting recently where an Afghan policeman shot \nseveral of our officers in a government building where they should not \nhave been armed--or were not armed--Karzai's response was to talk about \nthe burning of the Koran, as if there was justification for these \ndeaths.\n  When the riots erupted in Egypt recently, what were the first words \nout of President Mursi's mouth, from Egypt? The first words out of his \nmouth were: How dare America produce this film?\n  America didn't produce the film, but those were the first words out \nof his mouth, not that ``we should protect the Embassy'' and that \n``there is no justification for attacking an embassy'' regardless of \nany kind of discussion over this movie.\n  We have to figure out how do we get and retain valid allies? We do \nhave allies around the world we do not give any money to. But too often \nthrough the years we have decided to choose one dictator over another, \nto choose the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, often we have had to go \nback in to fight against our own weapons. Hussein was our ally. We \nended up going back to fight against him. The mujahedin, who became the \nTaliban, they were our ally, too, against Russia. We were, in fact, in \nfavor of radical jihad when it was directed against the Soviet Union. \nSome of the weapons are left over. In fact, when we look at Taliban \nweapons captured now, many of them are American weapons because it is \nunclear whether we have a good handle on what we give to the Afghan \npolice. We are not positive they don't wind up in the hands of the \nTaliban.\n  It is a murky situation, but I don't think it is a situation that \nshould continue. I think it is time to come home from Afghanistan.\n\n  People on the other side say: You want to disengage. No; I want to \nhave relationships with countries around the world. I want to have \ndiplomatic relationships. I want to have trade. But I don't think \nhaving diplomatic relationships or engaging with other countries means \nwe have to bribe them.\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nThere are some people who hate us enough that bribing them will not \nwork and often is counterproductive.\n  Thomas Eddlem reports that even:\n\n       Rieff--[from the New Republic, who is] no opponent of \n     foreign aid in theory--concluded of [foreign] aid to Egypt \n     [that] ``this is not only a moral scandal, it is a \n     geo[political] strategic blunder of huge portions.''\n\n  Like so many authoritarian regimes, the prime beneficiary of the U.S. \nforeign aid of Egypt was the leader for life, Mubarak, and the end \nresult of 30 years of supporting an unpopular dictator is we are now \nseeing uprising in the streets. Why are they anti-American? Because \nthey see us as friends of Mubarak. Mubarak was not a friend of freedom.\n  Aladdin Elaasar, author of ``The Last Pharaoh: Mubarak and the \nUncertain Future of Egypt in the Obama Age,'' said the Mubaraks owned \nseveral residences in Egypt, some inherited from previous Presidents \nand the monarchy and others he has built. ``He had a very lavish \nlifestyle with many homes around the country.''\n  He estimates the family's wealth between $50 billion and $70 billion. \nThe gross national income is $2,000 per family in Egypt. Do you think \nthat might make people a little bit mad? The guy is worth $50 to $70 \nbillion and the average income is $2,000. The average income in Africa \nhas not improved in decades and they have dictators worth billions of \ndollars. Do you think that makes those people harbor anti-American \nsentiments because the leaders, these dictators, have gotten American \nmoney? About 20 percent of the population in Egypt lives below the \npoverty line, according to a 2010 report.\n  It is not just Hosni Mubarak himself, it is his whole family who has \nbeen enriched. In 2001, they estimated his wealth at $10 billion just \nin American banks, Swiss, British banks, Bank of Scotland, England, \nCredit Suisse of Switzerland. You wonder what it is worth today or if \nwe found it all. You also wonder how much of that money in those secret \nbank accounts is actually just your money.\n  Egypt's First Lady Suzanne Mubarak's wealth just by herself is \nestimated at $5 billion. How much of that is your money?\n  When we hear these numbers of billions of dollars the dictators have \nsecreted away in Swiss bank accounts, listen to that and remember when \nwe hear the plethora of Senators who will come to the floor and say \nthat not one penny of foreign aid should ever be cut--ever. Not one \npenny of aid, they argue, should have conditions placed on it.\n  The amendment I will offer today places conditions on foreign aid, \nbut it places conditions that have to pass the Senate, not that can be \nrubberstamped by Hillary Clinton. Hillary thinks human rights are going \nfine in Egypt. She rubberstamped and said: Give them 1 billion a couple \nmonths ago, no human rights abuses in Egypt.\n  She also approved an extra billion for Pakistan 1 month ago. We \ncannot rely on the purse strings to be transferred--particularly to \nthis administration but even any administration, Republican or \nDemocratic. The purse strings are to remain--were intended to remain \nand the Constitution says are to remain--in the legislature.\n  This is a real problem. My legislation makes it come back, and we \nhave to vote on it here, that they are in compliance, that there are no \nhuman rights violations, that Egypt is not stealing the money and that \nthey are willing and able--that they can and will protect our Embassy.\n  I think, at a very minimum, if they are going to cash our check, if \nthey are going to have our foreign aid--which I am not a big fan of--\nbut if they are going to get it, at the very least it should have \nstrings attached to say: You have to protect the American Embassy.\n  One of Mubarak's friends was Gamal Mubarak. He is the Assistant \nSecretary General of the ruling Democratic National Party in Egypt. His \nown wealth is estimated at $17 billion, supposedly spread through \nseveral banking institutions in Switzerland, Germany, the United \nStates, and Britain. You wonder how much of the $17 billion is actually \nyour money.\n  Alaa Mubarak, the daughter, her property has reached into nearly $8 \nbillion. She has properties on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles, real estate \nin Washington State, New York, owns two royal yachts with a value of 1 \nmillion pounds. These are the yachts one can land a helicopter on. \nThese are the yachts that have a swimming pool on them. How much of \nthat $8 billion, how much of the money that went to pay for these \nyachts for the Mubarak family is yours?\n  The thing is, you should be mad. I think Americans are mad. But it is \nthis confusing situation. We should be mad about the foreign aid and so \nare the populations who are burning the American flag, they are mad--\nbecause they did not receive the foreign aid. The foreign aid went to \nMubarak. So you should be mad that your Senators send this money to \ndictators and that the dictators live these lavish lifestyles in \nmansions throughout the world, throughout Switzerland, London, Paris. \nSome of the largest private homes in the world are owned by dictators, \npaid for with your money.\n  You should be angry. You should be frothing. You should be upset. You \nshould tell your Senators, you should tell your Congressman: No more \nmoney to these dictators.\n  But at the same time you become angry, think it through and \nunderstand why the Arab world is angry. They don't hate our freedom. \nThey don't hate our Constitution. They are angry at their own \ndictators, but they are angry we propped up their dictators for decade \nafter decade. But it all has to do with foreign aid.\n  I have been arguing primarily about Pakistan, but the thing is, this \nis bigger than Pakistan. Pakistan is just the most egregious and one of \nthe larger recipients of our aid--$3 billion worth a year, maybe \nmore. Right now they are holding Dr. Shakid Afridi, who is the doctor \nwho helped us get bin Laden. They tortured him for a year, and he will \nbe in prison for the rest of his life. That is not the way an ally \nacts.\n\n  I say no more money to Pakistan until they release this doctor. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask. We would find very few in this \nbody who agree. Ask the American people and 80 to 90 percent agree no \nmore money to Pakistan until the doctor is free. I will be lucky to get \n20 percent of them to agree to not just cut off aid, but have \nrestrictions on aid. That is how bad it is.\n  The Arab spring brought corruption and theft of U.S. aid to Libya and \nEgypt, but Africa is rife with stories of theft and dictator spoils.\n  Teodrin Obiang Nguema is the son of Equatorial Guinea's dictator. He \nrecently ran afoul of French customs who discovered that his chartered \njet had 26 supercars on it, including seven Ferraris, five Bentleys, \nfour Rolls Royces, and two Buggatis. Is anybody besides me mad that we \nare sending foreign aid to African dictators whose sons are importing \nRolls Royces, Bentleys, Ferraris, and Buggatis to Africa, countries \nthat have no electricity?\n  I don't care if you are the biggest humanitarian in the world and you \nwant to help people, it is not going to the people. The foreign aid is \nstolen by the leadership of these countries. This is not one example; \nthis is example after example, decade after decade.\n  The learning curve around here is so slow we will get 10, maybe 20 \nSenators to place any restrictions on foreign aid. Seventy percent of \nthe people living in Africa live under the poverty threshold of $2 a \nday, and the son of a leader is importing Buggatis, Bentleys, Rolls \nRoyces, and Ferraris on his own private charter jet. It has to be a \npretty big jet to have 26 supercars on it. The rest of Africa lives on \n$2 a day. It is our money given by our government to dictators in \nAfrica. We have to get the connection. We need to be mad. There needs \nto be an ``American spring'' where we tell our leaders we are sick and \ntired of our money going to fund dictators--an American spring where we \nunderstand what happened in the Arab spring.\n  The Arab spring is a direct consequence of us sending foreign aid and \nlavishing it on people who don't respect the freedom of their \nconstituents and don't allow constitutional freedoms. The Arab spring's \nanger, as much as it is directed against America, is not against our \nConstitution. It is not because they don't believe in freedom. It is \nbecause they are upset that we have been funding and subsidizing their \ndictators. The United States has given Guinea almost $300 million over\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nthe past 10 years despite Guinea having one of the worst human rights \nrecords on the planet. Torture is said to be commonplace.\n  The New York Times reported last spring: ``Any policeman can arrest \nany citizen at any time.''\n  Torture is a ``current thing,'' ``current,'' said Mr. Mico, a lawyer \nwho is with an opposition party. He was recalling his own beating in \nthe presence of high officials.\n  Gonzalo Ndong Sima, a pharmacist in the center of town, recounted his \nrecent encounter with the police over a simple traffic mishap saying, \n``They beat me like an animal.''\n  So what do we do? We give Guinea our money and people are beaten with \npolice truncheons at traffic accidents. Who are they mad at? We need to \nbegin to understand where the anger is coming from. When we prop up \ndictators in third-world countries who beat their subjects into \nsubmission, that is why they are angry. They don't care that we are \nwealthy or free. They are angry because we prop up dictators who beat \nthem with truncheons.\n  Despite widespread reports of abuse, corruption, and ineffectiveness, \nforeign aid continues unabated. Despite polls that show over 70 percent \nof the American voters are opposed to foreign aid, it continues \nunabated.\n  Even when advocates of foreign aid are beaten down with stories such \nas I have been telling today of human rights abuses, starvation, and \ndeath threats, hangings, shootings, executions, these advocates trot \nforward their last defense: ``Foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the \nwhole budget.'' It is only $30 billion.\n  Do you know how many times they use that argument? Every time I want \nto cut $30 billion, it is only $30 billion. They use it for $300 \nmillion too. It is only $300 million. If we don't get started \nsomewhere, how are we ever going to balance our budget? We can't live \non the $1 trillion deficits.\n  They argue eliminating foreign aid would not balance the budget. No, \nit won't, but it is a start. We have to start somewhere, and why not \nstart with something that is counterproductive? Why not start with \neliminating something from the budget that is counterproductive and \nseems to create some of the anger--at least it is some explanation for \nthe anger in the Arab world.\n  The final arguments for foreign aid are so flimsy one would not think \nthey would be worth much to even try to refute. Proponents of the \nstatus quo use this argument over and over for any budgetary item. If \nwe can't cut millions now or even billions, how will we ever get to \ntrillions?\n  When conservatives argued for cutting small subsidies to little \nairports that sometimes subsidize one airline ticket for $3,000, they \nargue it will only save $300 million. It is not a valid argument, it is \na weak argument, and we should not accept it.\n  Cutting $30 billion worth of foreign aid would not balance the \nbudget, but I am not even asking to cut the foreign aid. What I am \nasking for is that we place contingencies on it, rules of behavior. If \nthey want to be our ally, act like it. If they want to be America's \nally, act like it. If they want to cash our check, act like an ally and \nbehave. At the very least shouldn't there be rules and restrictions on \nwho gets it?\n  While there are reasons they are burning the American flag, I am an \nAmerican and it upsets me. I am bothered by the fact that the American \nflag is being burned, but I am also bothered by the fact that we are \nsending money to countries where this is occurring. We are faced daily \nwith tens of thousands of protesters in these Middle Eastern countries. \nWe are faced with the tragic assassination of Ambassador Stevens.\n  With all the aid and all the evidence that foreign aid is not \nworking, that it enables dictators and rarely buys the behavior we \nwant, Republicans and Democrats still clamor for more. They will fight \ntooth and nail against any restrictions on the aid.\n  So one wonders, where are we going? In fact, we will find in this \nargument--and if we will read the paper, we will find that Secretary of \nState Clinton is arguing for more aid to Egypt. Their argument is if a \ncountry doesn't like us, if they behave illy toward America, if we give \nthem more money, maybe they will act better.\n\n  I think the opposite. One, we are out of money. We are $1 trillion \nshort. I think if we give them less money, they would think more about \ntheir behavior. Perhaps if we gave less money or, in my mind, no money \nto Pakistan until Dr. Afridi is released, maybe he would be released.\n  It boggles the mind to think these Senators are in favor of no \nrestrictions and increasing aid despite decades of evidence that aid is \nnot working. Proponents of this aid continue to argue that these mobs \nwill be more inflamed if we don't give them money. I think it is quite \nthe opposite.\n  I think the other thing about it they don't quite get is that I don't \nthink the people writing are writing and saying give us more aid. What \nthey are writing for is they don't like what our aid did in the first \nplace. They are writing against autocratic authoritarian governments \nthat were propped up by our aid.\n  People arguing that taking away the aid will inflame the Arab world, \nturn on the television set. They are plenty inflamed. Taking it away \ndoesn't make it better, but at least we have some consultation that we \nare trying to do something about the deficit and maybe we have problems \nat home that are more pressing than this and maybe we won't reward bad \nbehavior.\n  To say that taking away the aid may inflame the Arab world, just turn \non the television set because they are plenty inflamed already. If we \ndon't understand why they are inflamed, if we don't understand the Arab \nspring, if we don't understand why they are mad, that they are mad that \nwe propped up dictators who kept them down and kept them from freedom, \nwe will never understand or come to a resolution to make things better.\n  I, for one, will not vote for one more penny of foreign aid to anyone \nunless it has restrictions on it. I will only vote for it if the \nrestrictions say they have to behave and it has to be approved by the \nSenate. We have tried it before. The other side may come to the floor \nand say foreign aid already has restrictions. Well, yes, they are not \nworking because we gave them to the executive branch. Like so much in \nthis body, we have been giving up power to the Presidency for 100 \nyears. This is not a Republican-Democrat thing. This is just a \nlegislative abdication of power, and we let the President do whatever \nhe wants.\n  I am not arguing Republican or Democrat. I am arguing any President. \nThe power should remain here with the purse strings. We should control \nthem tightly, and we should say foreign aid only goes out under strict \nconditions. We should not let the final decision be made by an \nadministration that doesn't seem to have the fortitude to make these \ntough decisions.\n  Enough is enough. We are running trillion-dollar deficits, and it is \ntime to make a stand. I have been making a stand for the last week by \nfilibustering this bill. It doesn't make me the most popular person \nhere in Washington. People's travel schedules have been disrupted \nbecause of my filibuster. People's campaigning has been disrupted \nbecause of my filibuster. But this is not a new problem, and it is not \na small problem.\n  We are talking about an aid program that has gone on decade after \ndecade. We are talking about an enormous uprising in 30 countries, the \nArab spring, and now maybe the Arab winter. We are talking about how we \nmake things better. Until we fully understand what the Arab spring is \nabout and also why the huge amount of anti-Americanism is running \nthroughout the Middle East, we can't make it better.\n  I say throwing good money after bad is not the answer. This evening I \nthink we will get to vote on my amendment. My amendment is to simply \nsay to Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan that there are restrictions. All \nthree will have to say that they will protect our embassy. There is a \nquestion of whether Egypt was forthcoming in protecting our embassy, \nand there is no question Libya was not.\n  In the case of Libya, I think there are elements there that like \nAmerica, and there are also still elements that don't like America, but \nthere is not really a government. I wonder if an embassy should be \nreopened in Libya. If we reopen the embassy in Libya and we put 50 \nmarines in there, we may have a catastrophe like we had in Lebanon\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\nwhen 200 marines were killed in the early 1980s. Without thousands of \nmarines, I don't think we can protect an embassy in a large city in \nLibya.\n  It doesn't mean we don't have relations. When I argue for not putting \nthe embassy back in, it is because I think long and hard about the \ndanger to another ambassador and what their family will have to suffer \nif another ambassador is killed. I also think we can have probably an \nembassy in a neighboring country, and that is what I will recommend \nuntil things stabilize.\n  If Libya wants to have aid, they should keep cooperating with us with \nregard to finding the assassins. They should try to work where they can \nbecome stable enough to have an embassy. The bottom line with Libya \nthat a lot of people forget--as I talk about foreign aid, so many \npeople say we can't cut off aid to Libya; they want to be pro-American. \nThey have oil.\n  When President Obama was bombing Libya, he kept saying: It will all \nbe free. They will pay us for it later. It will be a free war. We heard \nthat one before. Iraq was going to be a free war also. Iraqi oil was \ngoing to pay for it. It never ends up happening. That is what they told \nus about Libya.\n  With regard to Pakistan, I have one additional requirement. They have \nto prove to us they will protect our embassy, and they have to release \nDr. Afridi. I think this is very little to ask. He is under death \nthreats in prison. His family is under death threats in the \ncountryside. They are hiding and living in fear because they helped us.\n  The other reason why this administration should take it personally is \nsomebody leaked Dr. Afridi's name. His name should have never been \nknown. I doubt it was someone with the CIA, but somebody who knew his \nname leaked this story. There were some stories about a month or two \nago about how the President was doing a great job with terrorism. In \nthose stories they talked about a doctor with a vaccine program and his \nname was found out. Somebody leaked it. Somebody very close to the \nPresident leaked it. I think that needs to be investigated. It is a \ncrime and it should be punished. Not only is it a crime, but whomever \nin the administration leaked that information about Dr. Afridi, I hope \nthey lie awake at night and worry about their soul in the sense that \nthis man may well die. He is going to be in prison for the rest of his \nlife because his name was leaked. That kind of behavior from high-\nranking government officials is inexcusable.\n  This evening we will have this vote. I will encourage Senators to \nvote for this resolution. It doesn't end aid. I would prefer we end it. \nThis is a moderate step in the sense that it attaches conditions to it. \nI think the American people expect that of us, at the very least, and I \nencourage my fellow Senators to vote for my resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as in morning business, with a colloquy with the \nSenator from South Carolina, and perhaps other Senators who may wish to \nspeak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I get into the issue concerning the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky, I was just informed that the \nPresident of the United States, while speaking to Hispanic television, \nalleged that the reason why immigration reform was not enacted in the \nlast 4 years of his Presidency is because the Senator from Arizona \nwalked away. Incredible. An incredible statement. I am not often in the \nbusiness of accusing Presidents of the United States of not telling the \ntruth. But facts are stubborn things.\n  First of all, it was then-Senator Obama who joined with Senator \nKennedy and me when we were doing comprehensive immigration reform, and \nwe pledged that we would take tough votes so the whole fragile \ncoalition would not fall apart.\n  Instead of doing that, the then-Senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, \nproposed an amendment which would have destroyed the entire coalition \nwe had together, and did so without telling Senator Kennedy or me or \nanyone else, by sunsetting the provisions that called for temporary \nworkers.\n  But, more importantly, in 2009, I was invited over to the White \nHouse. I went over there. It was a conversation with others about \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and the President at that time stated \nthey would be proposing legislation. I told him I would be glad to \nexamine it and I would be glad to support any effort to comprehensive \nimmigration reform that I could agree with. Nothing came from the White \nHouse--zero, not one word. Not one piece of legislation was proposed by \nthe administration.\n  After the shooting and the tragedy in Tucson, the President gave a \ngreat speech. I wrote an article thanking him. I was invited over to \nthe White House again. And when we discussed comprehensive immigration \nreform, I said: I am ready to sit down with you and move forward on it. \nHe said: Of course. There was never a word. Was the President of the \nUnited States waiting for the Senator from Arizona to bring forward \ncomprehensive immigration reform? Is that how he thinks government \nworks? So again we find a President who wants to blame everybody else \nno matter what it is.\n  My friend from South Carolina was involved in this issue as well, and \nI would be interested in his observation of this entire issue. I still \nstand ready to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  It was very difficult politics. It was a very fragile but robust \ncoalition back in the day. President Bush sent over two Cabinet \nSecretaries every week and was personally involved in trying to get \ncomprehensive immigration reform passed in 2006 and 2007. I saw \nfirsthand the commitment by the White House, where Secretary Gutierrez \nand many others came over--the Homeland Security Secretary came over--\nand basically wrote the bill line by line--Senator Kennedy, myself, \nMcCain, Kyl--a bunch of people--Salazar. Senator Obama showed up on \noccasion.\n  But at the end of the day, the basic construct was that for a modern \nimmigration system--merit-based immigration, a new way of doing \nbusiness, better border security, better employer verification \nsystems--Republicans would allow the 12 million to earn their way into \nlawful standing--a long and arduous way back to citizenship they would \nhave to earn--and, in return, we would get a temporary worker program \nthat would help American businesses supplement the labor force when \nthey could not find an American worker, after paying a competitive \nwage.\n  The chamber, all businesses were for this because it gave the \nbusiness community the certainty they needed regarding immigration. \nPart of the grand bargain was that the chamber would be able to access \nlabor in a more modern, efficient way. The labor unions hated that part \nof the bill. A lot of people on the right hated the idea of an earned \npathway to citizenship--coming out of the shadows and living under the \nlaw, paying taxes, and all the other things in the bill.\n  Senator Obama, out of nowhere, came to the floor and said: I have a \ncommonsense amendment I would like to propose that we sunset the \ntemporary worker program--$400,000, I think it was, allocated to \nAmerican businesses--after 5 years.\n  Well, what would have happened if I came to the floor and said: Let's \nterminate the pathway to citizenship or sunset it after 5 years?\n  That was the heart and soul of the deal. Thank God his amendment went \ndown. But during the negotiations and during that critical time, I \nthink he gave in to the pressure from the unions. But he did promise, \nin 2008, when he ran against Senator McCain, that he would pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform in his first year.\n  I looked at the interview last night and got bits and pieces of it. \nAs I recall the first year of the Obama administration, it was all \nabout ObamaCare and\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\nthe stimulus. I do not remember any effort, bipartisan or otherwise, to \ndeal with comprehensive immigration reform because all the political \ncapital was spent on ObamaCare and the stimulus.\n  At the end of the day, the only time President Obama has talked about \nimmigration reform was when rallies were going to be held. And here, at \nthe late hour of the election, he tries to do something with a dream \nact modified in a unilateral fashion.\n  So at the end of the day, the Senator is right, I say to Senator \nMcCain. He can blame others, but I think the record speaks pretty \nloudly and clearly where his agenda lay in the first couple years of \nhis administration, and immigration reform was not even a blip on the \nradar screen.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on another subject, yesterday the Senate \nand, then later, the House were called together to get a briefing from \nkey members of the administration, led by the Secretary of State; a \nhigh-ranking member of the FBI; our Director of National Intelligence, \nGeneral Clapper; and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to \ntell us ostensibly what happened in the tragic deaths of Ambassador \nChristopher Stevens and three other brave Americans.\n  We gathered down in the secret room, where everybody turns in their \nphones and BlackBerries, and we went in and listened to basically a \ndescription of America's military disposition in that part of the \nworld--something which certainly does not warrant a supersecret \nbriefing.\n  But, more importantly than that, when the Secretary and the others \nwere asked exactly what happened--what happened here? What caused this \ntragedy? What was the sequence of events?--in fact, it was Senators and \nthe ranking member of the Intelligence Committee: What happened?--the \nanswer was: Well, that is still an ongoing investigation and we cannot \ntell you anything.\n  Now, we were supposed to be down there to hear what happened, to hear \nthe administration's version of the events of what happened. We were \ntold nothing. We were told absolutely nothing because there is an \ninvestigation going on.\n  This morning in the Wall Street Journal, entitled ``Misjudgments \nPreceded Deadly Libya Attack,'' there is a tick-tock starting at 8 p.m. \nall the way through of the events that took place. Now, if that is not \nan incredible disrespect to the Members of the Senate, I don't know \nwhat is. Again, it is an example of the disdain with which this body is \nheld by the administration, including, I am sorry to say, the Secretary \nof State. It is not that I am offended as a Senator, it is the \ndisrespect to the institution of the Senate when we are called together \nostensibly to receive information, that information they tell us they \ncan't give us, and then it appears on the front page of the Wall Street \nJournal and the New York Times. What does that mean about the attitude \nthis administration has to this body? Obviously, it is not one that I \nthink is of respect.\n  Does the Senator wish to say something?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Just briefly. I was very disappointed in the briefing \nyesterday too. The bottom line is that we asked questions like: How \nmany security people were at the Benghazi consulate?\n  We will have to get back with you.\n  And you pick up the New York Times and you get a blow-by-blow \ndescription of what supposedly went on. So it was very frustrating, \nlike pulling teeth to get information yesterday. A lot of Senators are \nfrustrated. You pick up major papers in the country and you find \ndetails not shared with you.\n  One of the things I am worried about is that we are trying to find \nout who committed these terrible acts of terrorism. They were acts of \nterrorism, not a spontaneous riot.\n  We said: What is the game plan? Will they be held as enemy \ncombatants? Are they going to be held as common criminals? Will they be \nprosecuted in Libya? Will they be brought back to the United States? Do \nyou have to read them Miranda rights?\n  There was absolutely not a whole lot of information. But at the end \nof the day, I think it was a lost opportunity to inform the Congress.\n  Can we now move to the Rand Paul amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take what remaining time \nwe have in order to discuss the Paul amendment. I would like to begin \nby asking unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter \nfrom retired military leaders urging opposition to the Paul amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Retired Military Leaders Urge Opposition to Paul Amendment\n\n                                               September 21, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: As co-chairs of the U.S. Global Leadership \n     Coalition's National Security Advisory Council, a group of \n     more than 110 retired three- and four-star generals and \n     admirals, we believe that the International Affairs Budget--\n     U.S. foreign assistance--is critical to America's national \n     security.\n       Like all Americans, we are concerned about the recent \n     events that have taken place in Cairo, Benghazi, and other \n     parts of the Arab world. However, a wholesale suspension of \n     U.S. assistance to nations in this region is not in America's \n     security interests.\n       U.S. assistance is not a gift to recipient nations. It is \n     not a tool to make other countries like us. It's a critical \n     component, along with a robust military, of America's \n     national security strategy. These programs pay dividends in \n     terms of our national security and preventing another 9/11.\n       America must remain strongly engaged in the world. We urge \n     opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Rand Paul to \n     suspend U.S. assistance to several nations in the most \n     volatile regions of the world.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Admiral James M.

Mr. President, I do not think that our military leaders, \nretired and Active Duty, are infallible, but I think their views are \nvery important given the vast experience so many of them on this list \nhave. These are 110 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals. \nI think we should at least pay close attention to their views. They \nhave earned it. They have earned our respect for their views.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from AIPAC \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              The American Israel,\n\n\n                                     Public Affairs Committee,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell: We are writing to express our opposition to the \n     Paul amendment cutting off U.S. foreign assistance to \n     countries which host a U.S. diplomatic facility that is \n     attacked any time after September 1, 2012. While we hope \n     every effort is made to find and prosecute the terrorists who \n     murdered the brave U.S. diplomats killed in the Embassy \n     attacks in Benghazi, Libya, we do not believe the approach \n     outlined in the Paul amendment is the way to respond to those \n     horrific attacks.\n       For one, the amendment is broadly drafted so it would \n     potentially affect aid to any American ally (including \n     Israel) should terrorists decide to ``attack, trespass or \n     breach'' U.S. diplomatic facilities there. Furthermore, at \n     this time of turmoil and uncertainty in the Middle East, the \n     United States government needs to be able to use all \n     available tools to influence events in the region. U.S. \n     foreign assistance programs are a critical part of that \n     toolbox, and essential to ensuring continued strong American \n     leadership in the world.\n       We urge you to oppose the Paul amendment.\n     Howard Kohr,\n       Executive Director.\n     Marvin Feuer,\n       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.\n     Brad Gordon,\n       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.\n\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This letter is from the American Israel Public Affairs \nCommittee, America's pro-Israel lobby. It is a letter addressed to \nmajority leader Harry Reid and minority leader Mitch McConnell.\n  All of us here are very familiar with AIPAC. It is a very well \nrespected and highly regarded organization that is really responsible \nfor informing us, for strengthening our ties between the United States \nand Israel, and I hope my colleagues will take this very strong letter \nof AIPAC into consideration.\n  There are so many things wrong with the Rand Paul amendment that it \nis hard to know where to begin. I would like to mention--because I know \nmy colleague who plays a role on the Appropriations Committee and the \nranking member of the Intelligence Committee wants to join in, I do not \nwant to take too much time. I wish to mention two countries--Libya to \nstart with.\n  Somehow to labor under the belief that the Libyan people are \nopponents of the United States of America is a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the Libyans and the Libyan people. They are \ngrateful. They are grateful to the United States of America. They have \ncondemned this attack and this heinous crime of the assassination of \nfour brave Americans. They have said they will do everything in their \npower to bring these people to justice.\n  I was there on July 7 in Tripoli. I saw thousands of Libyans saying: \nThank you, America. Thank you, United States. Thank you, Ambassador \nStevens. Thank you. Because they were under the yoke of one of the most \nbrutal dictators on the Earth, who, by the way, was responsible for the \ndeaths of Americans on Pan Am 103 and the bombing of the disco in \nBerlin.\n  But there is a problem in this country. They have porous borders. \nThey have militias running around. They have not had a government of \ntheir own in forever, literally. And they need our help. They need our \nhelp in providing border security, in bringing these militias under \ncontrol and these weapons that have proliferated everywhere.\n  So our message with the Paul amendment is this: Adios. See you \naround.\n  That is not America's role in Libya. That is not America's role in \nthe world. And nothing would be more welcomed in Libya today by the \nIslamists and al-Qaida who are there and other extremists--nothing \nwould make them happier than to hear that the United States had cut off \nall assistance to Libya. Nothing would encourage them more. Nothing \nwould allow them to gain more traction and support from the Libyan \npeople.\n  This is a fight for the hearts and souls of the people of the Middle \nEast. It is not a video--it is not a video that has caused this problem \nand these riots and demonstrations. It is the efforts of the Islamists \nwho magnify and spread an obscure video throughout the Arab world to \nstoke the fears and anger of the people of these countries when the \nfact is that it is a struggle for power. That is what is going on with \nthese videos--a struggle for power.\n  So we are going to send a message to the Libyan people who lost \nthousands of their citizens in this recent struggle to oust Qadhafi \nfrom their country.\n  The second country I wish to mention very quickly is Egypt. Many of \nus are disappointed at some of the actions the Egyptians have taken. I \nwill say that President Mursi condemned these attacks. He went to \nTehran and condemned Bashar al-Asad. But in my view, Egypt is pretty \nmuch up for grabs. I don't how the Egyptians are going to go. There is \na struggle internally between the Salafists and the extremists and \nthose who want a modern and democratic society, and that struggle will \ncontinue.\n  But I would also remind my colleagues that one of the signal \nagreements of our time was the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement that \nwas consummated at Camp David by President Carter, Anwar Sadat, and \nMenachem Begin. This was a major step forward--peace between Egypt and \nIsrael. Part of that deal was that the United States would provide aid \nto Egypt.\n  How are the Egyptians going to react if we cut off aid to them? I can \ntell you how they will react. They will react that we have breached an \nagreement that has gone on for a long time. And, believe me, Egypt and \nIsrael's relations are vital in the Middle East. And, again, what would \nprove a better message to the extremists than to be able to tell their \npeople: Not only do the American people dislike us, not only are they \nnot in support of us, but they will not assist us and other countries.\n  There are many other examples. I believe the role of the United \nStates in the world is important, and I believe also, as I mention as a \nfootnote, that this debate has been going on all of the 20th century, \nnow into the 21st century. Those who are isolationists, who want to \nfortress America--you can go back to post-World War I and the fight \nover the League of Nations and, prior to World War II, the \nisolationists, the Henry Fords, the Charles Lindberghs, the \nisolationists prior to World War II, past World War II, the Taft wing \nof the Republican Party and the Eisenhower wing, all the way up until \nthis fight that will probably continue, and history will show that the \ngreatest Nation in history was the United States of America, which, \nfollowing World War II, restored Europe, turned back the tide of \ncommunism, and has been able, all over the world, with no greed, no \nselfish interest except for democracy and freedom, to aid these \ncountries, which eventually redounds to the favor of the United States \nof America.\n  I urge, obviously, rejection of the Rand Paul amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do see Senator Chambliss here. I will \nask him a question and get his thoughts.\n  To kind of follow on what Senator McCain said and to begin with, Rand \nPaul is a recently elected Senator who has come to the body with a lot \nof enthusiasm, and he is willing to make hard choices. I have worked \nwith him on Medicare reform, on Social Security reform. I think he will \ntake on the spending situation in this country very aggressively. I \nthink he is very brave when it comes to entitlement reform. On that \nside of the ledger, I find myself very much in agreement with what he \nwants to do. But he does have a view of foreign policy that I think is \nill-suited to the times and historically has not worn very well.\n  As Senator McCain said, history is full of moments where America and \nother powers felt that now is the time to withdraw and let those people \nargue among themselves. The problem with letting ``those people''--and \nyou just fill in the blank who they might be--argue among themselves is \nthat it ignores the fact of what goes on in one place in the world can \naffect us, and there is no better example than 9/11. The entire \noperation to attack our Nation cost less than $1 million. The 20 or 21 \nterrorists who trained to attack us had about a $1 million budget. The \nauthor of this attack lived in a cave in a far-away place called \nAfghanistan. So it does matter what happens in places such as \nAfghanistan. Radical Islamists have no desire for democracy in the \nMideast or anywhere else, and they are a force within the Mideast and \nthroughout the world.\n\n  But the good news for us is they are a minority force. The Taliban, \nwhich is a cousin of al-Qaida, basically, are very much rejected by the \nAfghan people. When traveling to Kabul today, one sees a city with \nelectricity, with commerce, with cars, with movement, and with women in \nschool. The average Afghan doesn't want to go back to the Taliban way \nof doing business, where there is no music, there is no interaction \nwith each other except on terms set for them. So what we see on the \ntelevision at night is a political struggle for the heart and soul of \nthe Mideast. This has been going on for a long time and, finally, the \nlid blew.\n  Egypt was an authoritarian, corrupt dictatorship. Tunisia. Libya was \nruled by Qadhafi, Syria by Assad. What we see are people who have seen \nanother way of living and they are saying, enough already, I am not \ngoing to be part of that anymore. I am going to try to change my life \nand my children's lives.\n  Within that population there also are people who are dead set on \nmaking sure that nation in the Islamic world go backward, not forward. \nWe have to take sides. If we don't take sides, if we sit on the \nsidelines, we will pay a price.\n  I think it is better to help people fight the Taliban than it is to \nignore the Taliban. I think it is good to go\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nafter al-Qaida in every country on the planet so they never know a \nmoment of peace, but we can have a few moments of peace. I think it is \nbetter to fight these guys in their backyard than to stay home and let \nthem come to our backyard. There is a reason we haven't been attacked \nin over 11 years. We have been on the offensive, and there are more \nways to be on the offensive than just bombing people.\n  The biggest fear of the Taliban and al-Qaida, beyond having a bomb \ndropped on their head--and they do not mind dying; they really don't \nlike living. They will die in a heartbeat to make sure others can't \nlive their lives the way they like. It is absolutely of no consequence \nto them to sacrifice their own life and take someone with them. Their \ngoal is: If we are going to live, we are going to live their way, not \nour way. But their big fear is that people will have the capacity to \nsay no to them and the ability to fight back and win in the countries \nin question.\n  When we killed bin Laden, that was a moment of satisfaction and \njustice. But has that changed the war on terror? Have the terrorists \ngiven up? Have people said: Oh, the Americans killed bin Laden so we \nbetter not go over the wall in Egypt; we better not attack the \nconsulate? No. This is a struggle between the modern world and forces \nof darkness, and the way America wins this war is to empower those in \nother countries to fight and win in their own country, without us \nhaving to be there with 100,000 troops all the time.\n  The biggest nightmare of the Taliban and al-Qaida is to see built a \none-room schoolhouse where kids can get an education, for the people to \nhave clean drinking water that they own and control, where people can \ngo to a courtroom rather than a sharia court to have conflicts \nresolved, and to see commerce and interaction with the rest of the \nworld, to trade with the rest of the world. That is what they fear \nmost.\n  Our foreign assistance budget--foreign aid--is 1 percent of the \nentire Federal budget. If we took it off the table, we would be left \nwith the following way to affect the world: Do nothing or bomb people. \nYou know what, those men and women in uniform have been at war for 11 \nyears. How about having a tool in America's toolbox to fight the enemy \nwithout having to use military force? When we clear a village of the \nTaliban, how do we hold and build that village? We bring in a health \ncare clinic, something with the most rudimentary standards. It is not \nsomething we would even think about sending our kids to, but they \nwelcome it because they have never had anything. We build a basic one-\nroom schoolhouse, with a chalkboard and a few books. That lights up \npeople's lives like we cannot believe. That is how we hold and build, \nwith the State Department and the Department of Agriculture teaching \npeople to plant crops other than heroin. That is the al-Qaida and \nTaliban's worst nightmare--and Egypt and Libya and Pakistan and Yemen, \nand fill in the blank, Afghanistan.\n  Here is where I am going to challenge the judgment, quite frankly, of \nmy friend Rand Paul. He has offered an amendment at one of the most \ncritical times in the history of the Mideast that would break, that \nwould sever all aid, all assistance to Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan. Why \nare we so upset by this thought process? Trust me, I know we are \nbroke--$16 trillion in debt--and that America is struggling more now \nthan at any other time in my adult life and that we have to get our \nfiscal house in order. But how do we live in peace and prosperity with \nthe rest of the world in flames? If we want to pay $10 a gallon for \ngas, turn the Mideast over to these crazy nut jobs.\n  Here is my view of what we should do. We should stay in this fight \nand we should do more things than just bomb people. We should help them \nhelp themselves. The good news is most people appreciate our help. What \nwe see on TV is the result not of a film but of radical Islamists \ntaking advantage of a moment.\n  Yes, the cultures are different. It is hard for people in the Mideast \nto understand that a film could be made disrespecting Islam without the \ngovernment approving of it, because in their world nothing gets done \nwithout the government approving it. So it is important for us to say: \nThis has nothing to do with the United States Government or the \nAmerican people. This is the result of some crazy group of people who \nhave what we call freedom of speech. It is uncomfortable, but that is \nthe way we are.\n  I think it is important to let the Mideast know, and Muslims in \ngeneral, that this is the way we operate. We reject the disrespect \nshown to anyone's religion, and that is not who we are as a people, but \nfreedom of speech does exist here. The reason we need to explain that \nis because in their world they can't imagine something being done like \nthis without the government blessing it.\n  Having said that, there is no excuse in any society to do harm to \nanother human being because of the way somebody speaks or acts unless \nit is an act of violence.\n  Senator Paul is proposing disengagement in three of the most volatile \nareas of the Mideast at a time when it means the most. The way he has \nwritten this amendment should make everyone pause and evaluate how they \nwant to vote. AIPAC, which most of us are familiar with, has indicated \nthe way the amendment is written, if there is an act of violence \nagainst a U.S. interest in Israel, maybe we would have to withdraw our \naid to Israel. But they have said they oppose the Rand Paul amendment \nbecause they know what happens to Egypt if this were to ever pass and \nbecome law.\n\n  The treaty Senator McCain referred to was the Camp David Accords. \nIsrael and Egypt have been living under a peace treaty for decades now. \nPart of the deal was that America would provide aid to Egypt and \nIsrael, and if we broke the agreement with Egypt, that would break the \ntreaty with Israel.\n  So do not tell me or anybody else you support Israel if you vote for \nthis amendment, because one of two things is going on: Either you have \nno idea what it means to support Israel or you are trying to pull the \nwool over my eyes. It is impossible to support the security of the \nIsraeli nation and vote for this amendment because it will lead to the \nbreach of a treaty with one of their strongest neighbors--80 billion \npeople living in Egypt. It will unravel a delicate balance that has \nexisted for decades. And I will be recorded as having no part of that. \nImagine if this amendment passed what the chatter would be on every \nIslamic Web site in the world. And by the way, if these people had a \nPAC, they would be supporting this amendment.\n  I know Rand Paul is as patriotic as anyone in this body, but the fact \nof the matter is the crazy Islamic extremist terrorists who try to kill \nus all would love nothing more than this to pass. They know they cannot \nwin if we stay engaged helping people, so they are trying to drive us \nout because that is their best hope of winning the day. So if we want \nto empower the terrorists who exist in this world, we should pass this \namendment because they will go crazy with hope and excitement that \ntheir tactics are working. And if we want to destroy the hope of \neverybody in the Mideast who has been brave enough to stand up to these \nthugs and lose their family members, if we want to break their spirit, \nthen vote to pass this amendment. If this amendment passes, good luck \nfinding anybody anywhere in the world who will partner with us, who \nwould be brave enough to stand up to these thugs and say: You will not \nhave my children's future. If this amendment passed, America could \nnever look anyone in the eye again in the Mideast and say: Stand with \nme. You can count on me.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the United States, and my colleagues in the \nSenate, I wish the world were not as screwed up as it is. I wish it \nwould change. I hate the fact we have been at war and we have spent so \nmuch money. But I am telling you this right now: These are historic \ntimes in which we live. And every time in history when good people were \nconfronted with evil and they blinked, millions died, not thousands. \nThe only reason millions haven't died in the war on terror is the nut \njobs who want to kill us all can't get ahold of weapons to do it. If \nyou don't want Iran to get a nuclear weapon, if that bothers you--that \nthey may get a nuclear weapon and throw the whole region into a nuclear \narms race or share that technology with a terrorist organization to use \nit against us--then vote against this amendment. Because if this \npassed, what would the Iranians think about America's resolve to deal \nwith them?\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\n  The last thing I am going to talk about is the vision of the author \nof this amendment, who, honest to goodness, is a friend, but on this \nissue I think he is dead wrong. Senator Paul had the guts to write a \nbudget, and I give him credit for that, but look at the vision of this \namendment when it comes to our role in the world. In his budget, the \nAmerican military's budget was reduced by 16 percent in the first year. \nThis foreign assistance account I was talking about, which gives us a \ntool other than killing people--staying engaged and trying to build up \ntheir lives so they can live in peace with us, and is about $50 \nbillion, or about 1 percent of the budget--under his proposal it goes \ndown to $5 billion after 2014 and is frozen there forever.\n  It is important to note that the author of this amendment believes we \ncan gut the military--and that is exactly what he does with military \nspending--and then take all the assets we have to help people off the \ntable and we will be safe. I don't know how in the world anyone can \nbelieve, given the times in which we live, it is a good idea to take \nmilitary spending below historic levels, disengage from the world, and \nhave absolutely no influence on nations other than trying to use \nmilitary force.\n  I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and resist the temptation \nto do something that sounds good in a 30-second sound bite. I know \npeople are frustrated and war weary, and I know we are broke, and we \nwould like to leave everybody else alone, but they are not going to \nleave us alone.\n  Look how much money we have spent after 9/11. Look what 20 people can \ndo to this Nation if we disengage from the world.\n  So now I would like to ask the question of my colleague, Senator \nChambliss, who is the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee--and \nI have asked this of the author--when you wrote this amendment \ndisengaging from Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan, which is a nuclear-armed \nnation, did you ask anybody in the intelligence community? General \nDavid Petraeus? If there is ever an American hero of modern times, it \nis he. Have you ever asked him or Senator Chambliss or anybody else: \nOh, by the way, I am thinking about pulling the plug on our aid to \nPakistan, Egypt, and Libya. What is your view of that? Have you been \nasked that question?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank my friend from South Carolina, as well as my \nfriend from Arizona, with respect to the debate they have been engaged \nin, for bringing this issue to the forefront, and being willing to \nstand up and say: Hey, if you talk about foreign aid in a coffee shop \nin Seneca, SC, or Phoenix, AZ, or Moultrie, GA, it is not the most \npopular topic. Most people back home think we can balance the budget if \nwe eliminate foreign aid. But the fact is, as Senator Graham said, it \nis a fairly minuscule amount in the overall context.\n  Right now we are at a critical juncture in our country with respect \nto our fiscal house and with respect to any number of domestic and \nforeign policies. As we go into the election, the American people are \ngoing to have a choice to make, but we are also at a crossroads with \nour foreign policy in this country.\n  All people have to do is pick up this morning's paper or turn on the \nTV and they will see what is happening in countries that are the \nsubject of this particular amendment. There are tens of thousands of \npeople protesting in Pakistan today. There are folks in Egypt who are \nstill protesting. There are folks in Libya who are still protesting. We \nare 10 days away from the Ambassador to Libya from the United States of \nAmerica having been killed.\n  We know that part of the world is in turmoil. We know that part of \nthe world also has been very critical to our fight in the war on \nterror. When the President of the United States is asked if Egypt is an \nally, and he can't answer that question affirmatively, that tells us \nwhat kind of foreign policy this particular President has. He doesn't \nknow what his foreign policy is if he can't tell us whether Egypt is an \nally.\n  Well, in spite of all that has happened in the last 10 days--and all \nof us still grieve for the loss of four very brave Americans who put \ntheir lives in harm's way as civilians to advocate what is in the best \ninterests of our country. But I will assure you, if Ambassador Stevens \nwere here today, he would say, absolutely, the direction in which the \nPaul amendment takes us is the wrong direction to go.\n  I know what the intelligence community thinks about this particular \ndirection. I know the intelligence community thinks in spite of all of \nour problems with Pakistan--and we have had our very open and overt \nproblems with Pakistan over the last several months and couple of \nyears. But the fact is we have American soldiers in harm's way today in \nAfghanistan who are fighting to protect the freedoms of this country \nand who are fighting to make sure we remain the safest, most secure \ncountry in the world. We cannot decouple Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  It is very important that we maintain a strong relationship with \nPakistan. Even though it is difficult and even though it is fractured, \nit is of critical importance that we maintain that relationship. It is \nimportant because of what is happening in Afghanistan, but it is also \nvery important for another reason.\n  We had a debate in this body about a year ago on what is called the \nSTART treaty, which is a treaty that we have with Russia for the \nelimination of certain nuclear weapons over a period of time.\n  During the course of that debate, we talked about the elimination of \nRussian nuclear weapons versus weapons in the United States. And that \nis good to a certain extent. But none of us in this body who have any \nidea about intelligence around the world have a great fear of any \ncountry getting hold of an ICBM, a major intercontinental ballistic \nmissile, sticking it into a sleeve somewhere, and shooting it toward \nthe United States. What we do have a fear of is somebody getting hold \nof what we call tactical nuclear weapons, sticking them into a suitcase \nand bringing them to the United States or putting them in a position to \nkill and harm Americans.\n  Pakistan has tactical nuclear weapons. As long as we maintain a \nstrong relationship with them and as long as they are our ally--however \nyou characterize that--then we have the ability to at least dialogue \nwith the Pakistanis with respect to their nuclear program.\n  Even today, with all that has happened over the last 10 days and all \nthe condemnation around the world from democratic countries, and \nparticularly within the United States the condemnation of what has \nhappened and the consternation and appall at what is taking place from \nthe standpoint of demonstrations in Pakistan and in Libya, the Libyan \nGovernment and the Pakistani Government have given us all the help they \ncan possibly give us, particularly in Libya. That is a government in \ntransition. It is a temporary government, and we need to make sure the \npeople of Libya have the opportunity to, hopefully, have a democratic \nform of government one day.\n  If we sever ties with them today, folks, that is over. We can just \nmake certain of the fact that we have one more territory, one more \ncountry where terrorists have the opportunity to be trained to kill and \nharm Americans.\n  With respect to Pakistan, the PAC government has sent the Palace \nGuard to guard the Embassy of the United States. That is their most \nelite troops. Again, our relationship is frayed and it is fractured, \nbut they are doing their level best to try to make sure the Americans \nwho remain in Pakistan are protected. If we all of a sudden decide that \nwe are going to cut them off from financial aid, is that going to \nimprove the situation? Is it going to give us some sort of \nsatisfaction? It may from the standpoint of folks who don't like the \nidea of foreign aid period. But from a national security standpoint, it \nis simply the wrong thing to do.\n  There will be one country that will gain from this. The country that \nwill gain from this is the most notorious terrorist-sponsoring nation \nin the world, and that is Iran. Iran has a very powerful presence in \nPakistan today. They want to have a powerful presence in Libya. I \nassure you if we cut off the minimal amount of aid that is being talked \nabout with this amendment, then we are simply fostering the ability of \nIran to have a larger voice and a larger presence in countries that are \nvery fractious and very vulnerable today.\n  So while in spirit I agree with my good friend Senator Paul, this is \nnot\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nthe right time in the history of our country and not the right time in \nthe history of the world to take action that is simply not in the best \ninterest of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in the last few days several interesting \nthings have happened, and some of them tragic--of course, beginning \nwith the tragic loss of our brave four Americans and Ambassador Chris \nStevens, then the demonstrations that have taken place everywhere. But \nI also remind my colleagues there was a most sophisticated attack on \none of the most heavily fortified installations in Iraq. It was \nprofessional. It was carried out in a professional fashion. It resulted \nin $200 million worth of loss to the American taxpayer, the greatest \nsingle act of destruction since the Tet Offensive back during the \nVietnam war.\n  In Afghanistan, because of the attacks of Afghan soldiers on American \nsoldiers, we have had to suspend the operations between the military \nand police between the two countries. If there was ever an indicator of \nfailure of our policy in Afghanistan, it is our now inability to even \ntrain with them to be ready to take over the responsibilities that we \nnow hold.\n  There is no greater indication of the failure of the President of the \nUnited States to continue to tell the American people and the people of \nthe world not that we need to succeed, not that we need to win, but \nthat we need to withdraw. So countries in the region have taken the \nlesson and are making accommodations.\n  The fact is we are now facing a collapsed national security policy in \nthe region, beginning of course with the assertion by the ambassador of \nthe United Nations that what happened with Christopher Stevens and the \nthree others was ``spontaneous'' and the President's spokesperson \nsaying the same thing.\n  We knew it wasn't spontaneous. We know people don't bring heavy \nweapons and mortars and rocket-propelled grenades to demonstrations \nspontaneously. This was a well-orchestrated, well-planned, well-\nexecuted act of murder of four brave Americans. Now we blame it on the \nvideo; it is the video.\n  It is not the video. The video is the vehicle of radical Islamists \nthat they use. And don't think there will not be other vehicles. There \nare people now, I am sure, all over the world who are making videos \nthat Muslims may find offensive. I found it offensive when there was a \npicture--that I will not even describe now--back some years ago that \nwas sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts. And we believe in \nfreedom of speech. The first thing we should have said is Americans \ncherish and have fought for these freedoms, including freedom of \nspeech.\n  Very briefly, because I know my colleagues want to talk, we have \ntotally failed in Iraq. Today, as we speak, Iranian aircraft are \noverflying Iraq to Syria and delivering weapons to Bashar Assad. We \nwere supposed to leave a residual force there. We didn't because then-\nSenator Obama, who said the surge would fail--where he was completely \nwrong--now has said he is now celebrating that we are out of Iraq.\n  They just sentenced their Vice President to death. The tensions \nbetween Sunni, Shia, and Kurd have never been greater, and al-Qaida is \non the rise in Iraq. In the words of General Keane, the architect of \nthe surge, we won the war and we have lost the peace.\n  In Syria, 25,000 people have now been massacred. When is the last \ntime the President of the United States stood and spoke on behalf of \nthese people? It is impossible for me to understand why the President \nof the United States wouldn't at least speak out against the murder, \nrape, and torture that is going on, and continues to go on, and it is \nan unfair fight with Bashar Assad supplied with Russian weapons, \nIranians on the ground--which they have acknowledged. Of course, every \nday that goes by more and more al-Qaida infiltrate the country.\n  In Afghanistan, of course they know we are leaving. Of course they \nare accommodating. There is a famous story of the Taliban prisoner and \nthe American officer. The Taliban prisoner says: You have the watches; \nwe have the time.\n  America is believed to be on the decline and weakening. So Mitt \nRomney was right. The statement issued by the Embassy in Cairo was a \nsemi-apology, which later the administration itself repudiated.\n  This President does not believe in American exceptionalism, he does \nnot believe in American leadership, and we have just paid a very heavy \nprice for our lack of leadership. Leading from behind is not the role \nof America in the world, and appropriate lessons are being drawn from \nthat all over the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. I will be \nvery brief because I know others want to speak.\n  This last conversation is extremely important. Northern Africa and \nother Arab countries are in a state of flux, to say the least. The Arab \nspring has caused lots of questions and profound implications that we \ndon't begin to now fathom. Those countries don't have executive \ngovernments that have any experience. They have replaced tyrants who \npreceded them. These are Muslim countries.\n  Many of the people who live in these countries believe other parts of \nthe world are more wealthy and they have been put upon. Add to that, \nthese are countries which, in most respects, have very high \nunemployment. Add to that, most of the demographics of these countries \nare such that close to half of the population is under the age of 25 or \n30, maybe even younger than that. It is a powder keg, and these are \ncountries which don't have the history and culture of the first \namendment freedom of speech we have.\n  I say all this because I urge all of us on both sides of the aisle to \nwork together. It is an extremely complicated, complex situation.\n  It used to be not too many years ago that politics stopped at the \nwater's edge. It used to be not too many years ago that on foreign \npolicy issues, because they are nonpartisan, we as a country worked \ntogether. We addressed the world with one voice. So I strongly caution \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to not make this a partisan \nissue; that is, U.S. policy in the Middle East, especially in this \ncase, northern Africa--but, rather, we work together. It is so \nimportant.\n\n  There is probably a reason why politics used to stop at the water's \nedge not too many years ago. Because it made us a lot more effective \nworldwide. I urge my colleagues not to be too critical of the other \nside of the aisle. It gets us nowhere. It is dividing and conquering, \nand that puts us at a great point of weakness.\n\n\n                   Second Big Sky Honor Flight To DC\n\n  I rise on another matter and that is to recognize a very important \nevent that is occurring this Sunday and Monday. What is that? Eighty-\nnine World War II veterans from the State of Nevada will take part in \nthe Big Sky Honor Flight and come to Washington to visit their \nmonument, the World War II Memorial. Their trip is hosted by the Big \nSky Honor Flight Program. The mission is to recognize American veterans \nfor their sacrifices and achievements by flying them to Washington, DC, \nto see their memorials at no cost. They raised money from Montanans all \nacross the State to make this possible. I helped make this possible at \nsteak fries, et cetera, and in today's economy, Montanans' generosity \nin paying for these flights is something special. Don't forget it has \nto be two tickets, one for the vet and one for the person helping the \nvet, because these World War II vets have been around several years and \nthey often need a little bit of assistance.\n  One of the passengers on Sunday's flight is a 102-year-old. His name \nis Dr. McDonald W. Held of Billings, MT. Don has had a remarkable life. \nHe has been a U.S. Air Force intelligence worker, a professor, an \nauthor, a minister, and a college president. Don was born in 1909. What \nwas going on in 1909? That year President Taft was inaugurated as the \n27th President. The U.S. Army received its first delivery from the \nWright brothers. Congress passed the Homestead Act, which resulted in a \nlarge influx of settlers all across the West, including my State of \nMontana.\n  Don graduated from Baylor University in 1933 with a degree in speech. \nAlthough he earned his master's and doctoral degrees from Northwestern \nUniversity, Don's heart remained at\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nBaylor. He wears a Baylor workout suit every Monday, Wednesday, and \nFriday when he exercises at the Billings YMCA. Remember, Don is 102 \nyears old.\n  During World War II, Don served in the Air Force as an intelligence \nofficer in the Philippines. After the peace treaty was signed he was \nstationed in Tokyo. He worked just a couple of buildings down from GEN \nDouglas MacArthur.\n  After the war, Don embarked on his career in academics at Howard \nPayne University, as a professor there from 1955 to 1964. He presided \nover the speech and theater department and served as academic dean. Don \nthen worked for 7 years at Wayland Baptist University before moving to \nBillings, MT.\n  In Billings he became the first head of the speech and theater \ndepartment at the Eastern Montana College, which we now know as Montana \nState University-Billings.\n  At age 74, Don was ordained as a Baptist minister in the Baptist \nchurch. He has ministered in three churches in Montana and also served \nas a president of the Yellowstone Baptist Bible Institute, now \nYellowstone Baptist College.\n  Don and his wife Beverly have five children, five grandchildren, and \nseven great-grandchildren so far. His son Don, Jr., a veteran of the \nVietnam war, will escort him to Washington this Sunday.\n  This is a special weekend for this group of heroes. Believe me, I was \nhere when the last honor flight came in. I cannot remember a time when \nI have been so touched by people. You see these World War II vets. Most \nof the men and women are just talking about their experiences. They are \nthe ``greatest generation,'' as has been mentioned before, especially \nby Tom Brokaw.\n  It is time to give them thanks for their courage, time to give them \nthanks for their sacrifice. They have done so much. It is time to \nreflect on all the sacrifices they made. Think of it, battles of \nEurope, Korea, the jungles of Vietnam, deserts of Iraq, and those who \nare currently fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan. We must not \nforget them.\n  Please join me in welcoming our Montana heroes to Washington this \nweekend. I am going to be down there. I know many others will too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank again my good friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for the next hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Iran's Nuclear Program\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are going to have a nice discussion \nbetween Republicans and Democrats about an important issue. If you are \nlooking for bipartisanship, your ship has come in. S.J. Res. 41 has 82 \ncosponsors. I am not sure we could get 82 of us to agree that Sunday \nshould be a day off, but we have done it when it comes to the concept \nof not allowing the Iranian ayatollahs to possess a nuclear weapon and \ntrying to contain them. S.J. Res. 41 has 82 cosponsors. The Presiding \nOfficer is one of them. To my Democratic colleagues, Senators \nBlumenthal, Coons, Menendez, Casey--Senator Casey was the first one to \nstep up--Senator Lieberman--it has been a real joy to work in a \nbipartisan fashion over something that matters, that if there is a time \nfor the Senate to speak, it is now, regarding Iran's desire to get a \nnuclear weapon.\n  President Obama has rejected containing a nuclear-armed Iran as a \nnational strategy. Mr. President, you are dead right on that. I know \nGovernor Romney agrees.\n  What I wish to do is recognize my good friend from Georgia, Senator \nIsakson, and we have Senator Ayotte here, to share their thoughts. I \nwill be joining later, and certainly Senator Blumenthal, who has been \none of the leading voices on the Democratic side for this resolution.\n  At this time I wish to yield for Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before he leaves, I wish to acknowledge \nthat today may be one of the more important foreign policy debates that \never takes place in the Senate because whichever way the Paul amendment \ngoes and this resolution goes is going to determine the direction of \nwhere America goes in terms of foreign policy. Are we engaged? Are we \nfirm? Are we the greatest power on the face of this Earth? Or do we \nrecede as we did prior to World War II and put our Nation in jeopardy \nagain? I don't vote for receding. I think it is time to be strong. If \nthere were ever an issue to be strong about, it is nuclear \nproliferation and the possibility of Iran possessing nuclear \nfissionable material to make a weapon. I will commend Senator Graham \nfor his leadership in the Armed Forces, for his leadership on this \nissue, for his leadership on the floor of the Senate. He is a beacon of \nhope in a body that needs it right now.\n\n  I also commend him for getting 82 cosponsors--I agree with him, we \ncould not agree that Sunday is a day of rest if we had to have a vote \non it--to come together and join to send a clear message not just to \nthe Iranians but to the world that a nuclear-armed Iran is not \nacceptable. We need to have a policy of prevention. That is what this \nresolution does. It doesn't just say to Iran we want to prevent you \nfrom having nuclear fissionable material and weapons, it encourages the \nworld to join together to prevent it.\n  Ten days ago I was in Germany, meeting with the EU Minister of \nFinance, meeting the German Minister of Finance, and meeting with the \nDefense Minister of Germany. Do you know what the No. 1 question of all \nthree of them was? It was not the problems with the EU, although they \nhave them. It was Iran and what would happen if they ended up \npossessing fissionable nuclear materials and a weapon. So this \nresolution is an important statement of the United States of America, \nbut moreover the world, and I think it will be replicated in \nparliamentary bodies around the world to send that united signal. We \nare close to a time when we have to fish or cut bait. The Iranians have \ncontinued to work. We have pretty good knowledge but not total \nknowledge. One of the problems the Germans have, the IAEA thinks they \nknow where the centrifuges are and where they all are, but they are not \nsure. They think there hasn't been movement and in some cases they \nthink there may have been movement.\n  We need clarity, and the only way to get clarity is for the Iranians \nto agree to the rules that we establish for them to disclose through \nthe United Nations or through whatever body possible to see to it we \nhave total transparency, and in the absence of that they need to \nunderstand that our goal is to prevent them from ever possessing a \nweapon that could destroy humanity.\n  The nation of Iran states clearly and often and tells the world it \nyearns for the day until it destroys the nation of Israel and the \nJewish people. No entity, none whatsoever, deserves the ability to have \nenriched uranium or any other tool to actually carry out what it says \nis its stated goal.\n  So I rise today as one Georgian, but one of millions of Americans, to \nsend a clear and unvarnished message to the people of Iran. We want the \npeople of Iran to know freedom and democracy, to be released from the \ntyranny of the ayatollahs and the current totalitarian government but, \nmost importantly, we will not stand 1 day, 1 minute, or 1 hour for Iran \nto possess fissionable material or a weapon that could destroy mankind.\n  I end by commending the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Isakson, who is on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He is a ranking member on the African subcommittee. He has, \nfrankly, opened my eyes with what we are doing in Africa. A little \nmoney goes a long way in Africa, trying to prevent radical Islamists \nfrom taking over the continent of Africa, combating the Chinese who are \ntrying to buy up all the resources, and using American taxpayer dollars \nto create an environment and create jobs back here at home and, \nfrankly, save thousands if not millions of young children from certain \ndeath from AIDS and malaria. Johnny is everything right about being a \nSenator in that regard. I appreciate him coming down here today.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire doesn't mind, can we go to our good \nfriend Senator Blumenthal? I have had the pleasure of going to Egypt \nwith him and all these other hotspots and\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nenjoyed working with him on this resolution. This started with a \nmeeting in our offices, an idea to try to back up what President Obama \nsaid about not containing a nuclear-armed Iran. The next thing we know \nwe are on the floor of the Senate today with 82 cosponsors.\n  My good friend from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my \ncolleague and friend from South Carolina who has so eloquently and \npowerfully stated the case for this resolution. But even before \ndiscussing resolution 41, I thank him and our colleagues who spoke \ntoday on the floor about the Rand Paul resolution.\n  I think this morning's debate--and I listened to it for all 3 hours, \nbecause I was presiding at the time--marked one of the finer moments of \nmy brief time as a Member of the Senate. What I saw this morning was an \narticulate, thoughtful, and courageous statement against a resolution \nthat would do grave harm to this Nation's national interests if it \nbecame law and if it bound the U.S. Government and cut off aid to these \ncountries. I think the case stated was courageous because it very \nlikely may prove unpopular with some elements of their own party--to \nput it very bluntly, the political reality here. But I think it was one \nof the finer moments of this body because it marked a point of clarity \nand a clear recognition for the need to come together as a nation when \nour national interests are threatened, when our national security is at \nstake, when the harm to this Nation requires acting together.\n  I am hoping this spirit of bipartisanship will also come together, as \nit has so far with 82 cosponsors, on the resolution we have sponsored, \nS.J. Res. 41. As Senator Graham has rightly observed, it began with the \nleadership of a handful of Senators. He was one of the key leaders, as \nwere Senator Lieberman, Senator Ayotte, Senator Hoeven, Senator Casey, \nand Senator Menendez. I was proud to be among them. The spirit of \nbipartisanship and the strength of that spirit was really \nextraordinary.\n\n  Here is what we know. At a time of confusion and obfuscation, in many \nrespects, where foreign policy is concerned, knowing with certainty \nsome of the facts is very important. We all know from the International \nAtomic Energy Agency that as of November 2011, Iran had produced \napproximately 5,000 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 3.5 percent. We \nalso know that this Iranian regime is the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism in the world, according to our Department of State. We know \nthis regime has repeatedly expressed its desire to ``wipe Israel off \nthe map.'' We know this regime has provided weapons training to Hamas, \nHezbollah, and militias in Iraq who murder civilians and spread terror. \nWe know it has already actively and consistently provided aid to the \nAssad regime in Syria in its brutal and unconscionable repression of \nits own people. The torture and murders that have occurred have been \ndirectly linked to Iran. We know the Iranian Government is attempting \nto develop nuclear weapons. If it does, it will lead to an arms race in \nthat part of the world that will be as threatening as any other \npotential harm to this Nation. We know Iran would create access for \nterrorists to these nuclear weapons, making the Middle East a nuclear \ntinderbox. We cannot trust this regime. We know that fact beyond any \npotential doubt.\n  Iran's nuclear program is of extraordinarily grave concern not only \nto nations in that part of the world but to all nations everywhere that \nwant peace. That is why an international coalition has come together, \nwith the leadership of the United States of America. Iran cannot be \npermitted to continue its nuclear program to a point where it is \ncapable of making a nuclear weapon.\n  Despite repeated calls for it to suspend or stop this program, we \nknow with certainty that Iranian leaders show no signs of waiting or \nwanting to halt their program to build nuclear weapons. In fact, recent \nintelligence shows they are continuing to enrich uranium and develop \nnuclear facilities.\n  That is why we need S.J. Res. 41. There is no question that the \nadministration, under President Obama, has repeatedly affirmed his \ncommitment to such a policy. The President has made his position and \nthe position of the United States absolutely clear. I am quoting \nPresident Obama:\n\n       Iran's leaders should understand that I do not have a \n     policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from \n     obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\n  That is the message of S.J. Res. 41. That is the message we must \nconvey as a nation together from all parties, all parts of the United \nStates, and all interests, that time is limited. Time is limited to \nkeep Iran from acquiring nuclear weapon capability.\n  This resolution calls for increased pressure on Iran to come into \ncompliance with the U.S. security resolution. This resolution builds on \nthe efforts of myself and others to call for successful P5+1 talks that \nwould lead Iran to halt its nuclear program. This resolution says to \nthe world that the United States and governments of other responsible \nnations have a vital, mutual interest in working together to prevent \nIran from acquiring nuclear weapon capability. Let's underscore the \nwords and recognize their importance: nuclear weapons capability.\n  Many of us have written multiple times to President Obama outlaying a \nframework that would lead to successful negotiations. My hope is that \nthe combination of strict international sanctions and international \ncondemnation of a nuclear-armed Iran will convince that government to \ndesist and cease its program of nuclear weapons capability building. It \nis not in our interest, it is not in the world's interest, and \nultimately it is not in that regime's interest. If sanctions fail, we \nmust be prepared to act.\n  This resolution expresses the resolution and the resoluteness of this \nbody. I am hopeful that sanctions will work, but if the Government of \nIran is unconvinced by this very compelling case, it must know that \nthis issue is not a partisan one, it is not one on which we are \ndivided. We stand together, we stand strong, and we are resolute and \nresilient. The United States and its allies will join together to \nprevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from South Carolina and all 82 of my \ncolleagues who have joined as cosponsors. We began with a handful, but \nI think the compelling power and persuasiveness of the need for this \nresolution is carrying the day.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina, my good friend and the \nleader of this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Blumenthal for those articulate words \nabout the resolution and for his kind comments. Senator Lieberman was \non the ground floor of this, as he is with everything, including bills \nto construct foreign policy for the country.\n  One of the original partners we had trying to get this matter going \nwas Senator Ayotte, who is a freshman Senator but has quickly hit the \nground running and has become a strong voice on national security.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the \nSenator whatever time she needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Carolina. \nHe has really led the effort on this incredibly important resolution. I \nalso thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  The bipartisan nature of this resolution tells us very clearly that \nthis really is the policy of this Congress and how important this issue \nis for our country. This resolution will ensure that we give a clear \nmessage to Iran that it is not our policy and that the United States \nand the world will not accept Iran acquiring the capability of having a \nnuclear weapon. We understand that it would make the Middle East a more \ndangerous place than it is now and would cause an arms race in that \npart of the world. In addition, it would also cause us to be in a \nposition in which one of our strongest allies in the Middle East, \nIsrael, is threatened with annihilation because that is exactly what \nthe Iranian regime has said.\n  Most importantly, it will endanger our own country if Iran acquires a \nnuclear weapon because Iran is incredibly hostile to the United States \nof America. Iran participates with various terrorist groups, including \nHezbollah. One\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nof the greatest risks we face is that the regime itself wouldn't use \nthe nuclear weapon; they would just give it to a terrorist group who \ncould hit any one of our allies. They could use it to harm us and our \ncountry, and then, of course, the world changes. We cannot allow this \nto happen, and it is very important to have 82 Senators sponsoring this \nresolution.\n  I wish to talk briefly about the Paul amendment that is pending \nbefore this body. How we act on this amendment, as my colleague from \nGeorgia so eloquently said, will define the foreign policy of the \nUnited States of America. I wish to state my strong opposition to the \nPaul amendment because I am very concerned that if we pass the Paul \namendment, then we are sending the very message to the radical \nIslamists and the terrorists of the world that they want to hear from \nus, which is that we will withdraw.\n  Let's be clear on what their goal is when they attack us. They don't \nwant us to be engaged. They would like the Middle East to become a \nseventh-century, Taliban-style government that is a threat to our \ncountry.\n  In my view, for us to withdraw now, we would put ourselves in a \nposition where, for example, the amendment is so broadly drafted that \neven if one of our ally's embassies were attacked, such as Israel, we \nwould have to withdraw aid and it would send the absolute wrong \nmessage. It would be to the detriment of the safety of the United \nStates of America.\n  I understand that my colleague Senator Paul is well intentioned, but \nevery time we have withdrawn, people have died and the world has not \nbecome safer and the battle comes here. We don't want the battle to be \nhere. We don't want any of these elements to be in our country. We \ncan't forget what happened to us on September 11.\n  As my colleagues have eloquently stated before, our only tools can't \nbe our military. The reason we have so many of our present and former \nmilitary leaders standing up and saying they oppose the Paul amendment \nis because they understand that by engaging with these countries \nthrough the small foreign aid budget we have, we can prevent conflict. \nWe can actually be in a position where we are engaged and we are \nsending the message to the radical Islamist terrorists that, no, the \nUnited States of America will not back off. They cannot put us in a \nposition where they can bring the battle to our soil. We will not be \ndefeated by them.\n  I think if we were to pass this amendment from my colleague, no \nmatter how well intentioned it is, we would only be empowering those \nradical elements. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Paul \namendment.\n  I also believe it very much relates to this containment resolution \nfor the following reasons: We see Iran right now ignoring what the U.N. \nhas asked of it, ignoring what the good people of the world want to \nhave happen in Syria. In fact, Iran is supporting Hezbollah. They are \narming and training Asad's forces in Syria. They are providing weapons \nto insurgents in Afghanistan who are killing our troops. They are \nengaged with radical elements in Iraq. If we look at the whole course \nof events, we can imagine that Iran will cheer if we pass an amendment \nin which we say that we back off our commitment to Pakistan, our \ncommitment to Egypt, and our commitment to Libya and other areas around \nthe world. God forbid if one of our other allies' embassies were \nattacked.\n  Most importantly, as my colleagues have said, Iran would cheer if the \nPaul amendment passes because it would actually break the Camp David \nAccords in which we agreed as a country to provide aid to Egypt. It \nwould also make Israel less safe, and there is nothing in the world \nthat Iran wants more than to have Israel be less safe. In fact, they \nhave stated very clearly that their goal is to annihilate Israel from \nthe face of the Earth.\n  We cannot allow them to get nuclear weapons. They are marching closer \nand closer to this capability. Senator Blumenthal told us about the \nenrichment of the uranium. This is not the level of enrichment used for \na powerplant. It is being enriched to have the capability of having a \nnuclear weapon.\n  They have created more and more centrifuges despite us asking them to \nstop, despite the sanctions we have put in place, all for the \npossibility of having that nuclear weapon they could use that would \nchange the world, not to mention what they have said about our friend \nIsrael, that they would seek to annihilate Israel.\n  The world is a very dangerous place. If we allow Iran to acquire a \nnuclear weapon, this is a game changer for the world. That is why this \nresolution is so incredibly important.\n  I very much appreciate the leadership on both sides of the aisle in \nsupport of this resolution, and my colleague from South Carolina for \nbringing this forward, because we need to tell the world we are not \ngoing to allow this game changer to happen. Iran needs to hear a very \nclear message from us as a Congress, backing up our President, that we \nwill not allow for the containment of a nuclear-armed Iran, for the \nsafety of the world.\n  Finally, we need to let our friends in Israel know, when Prime \nMinister Netanyahu said on September 16 that ``those in the \ninternational community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't \nhave a moral right to place a red light before Israel,'' I say to our \nfriends in Israel: Please know that by passing this resolution, we \nstand with you. We will work with you to make sure the tyrannical \nregime in Iran never gets that weapon of mass destruction that could \nvery much change the safety of the Middle East, the safety of your \ncountry, as well as our own country and the world.\n  With that, I yield for my colleague from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thanks to Senator Ayotte for helping to get this whole \nprocess going, for being on the Senate floor and for getting this whole \nprocess started, and for her strong voice on national security.\n  Now I wish to recognize my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nCorker. He is on the Foreign Relations Committee and is moving up the \nladder to be chairman or ranking member, depending on how the election \ncomes out. But no matter how it comes out, Senator Corker will be there \ntalking about constructive engagements and guarding the taxpayer \ndollar. I would like for him to give his thoughts about the Rand Paul \namendment and the noncontainment of a nuclear-capable Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the great Senator from \nSouth Carolina, the State where I was born. I do want to say the \ncommittee makes those decisions. I don't want anybody to be jumping the \ngun with the kind of statements made earlier about future situations.\n  First of all, I wish to speak to the resolution brought forward on \nIran. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for that and for the \ntremendous work he has done to bring so many of us on as cosponsors. I \nthink it is a strong signal to Iran, but also to people in the \nneighborhood, about our beliefs. So I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for that.\n  I wish to speak mainly, though, about the Paul amendment. First of \nall, I wish to say to the Senator from Kentucky that I understand the \nsentiments that drive people to look at foreign aid the way a lot of \npeople around this country are looking at it today. I wish to remind \npeople that our total foreign aid budget is 1 percent of what we spend \neach year, but that doesn't mean we don't need to look at it in a very \ndifferent way.\n  We haven't done an authorization bill on foreign aid since I have \nbeen here. I have been here almost 6 years now. I know the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is the ranking member on Foreign Operations, and I know \nthey spend a lot of time looking at things in an appropriate way. But \nthere is no question that as a body we should be looking more closely \nat how we generate foreign aid to other countries, and I hope we are \ngoing to be doing that in this next Congress when, hopefully, we will \nbegin to function in a much better way.\n  I wish to say the purpose of foreign aid at the end of the day, in \nmany cases, is to keep our men and women in uniform from having to be \ndeployed in other places because of unrest that is against our national \ninterests. So I would like to point that out.\n  In this particular case, regarding Libya, Egypt and Pakistan, I would\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\njust like to point out three things: No. 1, the people of Libya are \nvery thankful for our intervention. However, people have come in and \ncreated a travesty in Benghazi around our consulate, and these are \npeople who are trying to undermine what we are doing there.\n  So the way the Paul amendment is drafted, if terrorists in any \ncountry we are aiding happen to do something at one of our embassies or \nconsulates, then we withdraw aid. So what that means is that basically, \nterrorists--people such as al-Qaida, the Taliban, and other groups--are \ndeciding what we are going to do as it relates to foreign aid. That \nwould be a real big step for the Senate to say that in the future, \neverything we do relating to foreign aid will be determined by \nterrorists. I don't think that is what we want to do as a body.\n  So let me set Libya aside and say this was obviously something that \nwasn't a popular movement. It was done by premeditated terrorists. It \nwas terrible. We all loved Chris Stevens, and we thank him for the work \nhe has done for our Nation. But this is not the way for us to react to \na country that is trying to evolve into, hopefully, a functioning \ndemocracy and, hopefully, a country that in some way down the road will \ncreate even more stability in that part of the world.\n  Let's move to Egypt. I was just in Egypt and sat down with the \nmilitary leaders. One of the things we continue to talk about is the \nCamp David Accords. The aid we send to Egypt is to reinforce, in many \nways, the Camp David Accords. That is very important to Israel, which \nis one of our major allies, one of the biggest allies we have in the \nworld. So I don't know why we would decide to cut off all aid, which \nwould totally undermine the Camp David Accords, which would totally \nundermine the security of a country that is one of our biggest allies.\n  Now, do we need to take into account the response in Egypt to what \nhappened at our embassy? I think we should, and I think it should \naffect the negotiations we have with them regarding our foreign aid. I \nmean, let's face it. We have had decades of relationships with their \nmilitary, and even though there have been a lot of changes in the \ncountry, the military is still there and, candidly, they did respond \nexactly the way we would like for them to respond. They are a great \nally.\n\n  The President was a little hesitant to respond. I understand the fine \nline he is walking. He had just been elected. I understand the country \nhasn't been through this process, and I understand he didn't respond \nexactly the way we would expect him to respond. He, since that time, \nhas, but I still think it should affect our negotiations and we ought \nto go slowly.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from South Carolina, working \nwith his counterpart, has taken those things into account as it relates \nto this next year, and I thank them for that.\n  So in Egypt, it looks to me as if we are slowing this down a little \nbit. We are making sure the relationship we have with Egypt is \nappropriate under the circumstances, and I thank the Senator for \nhelping to make that happen. But withdrawing all aid would basically \ntotally undermine the Camp David Accords, which most of us in this body \nbelieve to be something that is very important.\n  So let me move to Pakistan. Pakistan is a place where probably most \nof us are most disappointed. We understand the relationship the \nintelligence agencies in Pakistan have with the Haqqani network, and \nthat has been disappointing. We understand the trouble we have had \ntrying to close down some of the ammonium nitrate plants that are there \nand that are actually helping to create some of the IEDs that are used \nto dismember and harm and kill our men and women in uniform in \nAfghanistan. So we are disappointed about a lot of things in Pakistan.\n  Obviously, one of the most disappointing things--or maybe one of the \nthings that is most difficult for us to understand--is the treatment of \nthis physician who aided us with Osama bin Laden. Yet there is a legal \nprocess that is underway there, and I think we sometimes forget that, \nand there is a court of law there and, hopefully, that will have an \noutcome that ends up showing that it has been handled in a judicious \nway.\n  Let me just speak to Pakistan. We are getting ready to leave \nAfghanistan. We are going to have all of our troops out of Afghanistan, \nor a big part of our troops out of Afghanistan, by 2014. I met \nyesterday with General Dempsey. He was telling me that in order to meet \nthat timeline, we have to move a truckload of equipment out of \nAfghanistan every 7 minutes between now and the end of 2014--every 7 \nminutes. Well, what is the major route we use to move our equipment out \nof Afghanistan? Pakistan.\n  Now, if we want to cut our nose off to spite our face, I would say \nlet's close off that route, let's create enmity between us, more enmity \nthan already exists.\n  I think most of us realize we have a very transactional-oriented \nrelationship with Pakistan. It is not quite the way those of us in \nAmerica would like to see it be, but the fact is there are some \nvaluable things there that have a lot to do, by the way, with the \nsafety of our men and women in uniform. If we have to take another \nroute out in getting all of this equipment and material out of there, \nwe are probably going to take a route that doesn't work quite as well \nfor our men and women in uniform.\n  So, again, I understand the sentiment. Our phone is ringing off the \nhook with people who share the same sentiment. I understand it. When we \nsee on television people rising up in these nations against us--by the \nway, these countries are not monolithic. It is not unlike here. We have \ngroups, such as Occupy Wall Street, that are able to express \nthemselves, but they don't represent my viewpoint. These countries are \nin some ways like ours. I mean, they have people who protest and do \nthings. That doesn't mean the whole country feels that way. These are \ncountries that have had strong men leading their countries in some \nplaces and aren't used to understanding what it means to be able to \nexpress themselves, and they don't understand how to operate in a \nsociety that is more open than it has been in the past.\n  So that certainly doesn't quell my strong feelings about what has \nhappened in Benghazi, nor does it for anyone else here, I am sure. But \nthe fact is we need to look at foreign aid in a different way. I think \nwe have taken some steps to do that. We need to continue to improve. We \nneed to make sure there is accountability.\n  What I do know is the Paul amendment is not the way to do it. Again, \nI appreciate the energy the Senator has brought to this body and the \nmany good points he brings forth. But I know this: We do not want an \namendment to pass that says if terrorists attack an embassy or \nconsulate anyplace around the world, aid is taken from that country. I \ndo not want a terrorist determining what our relationship is going to \nbe with that country, and I think all of us know that our withdrawal \nfrom the Middle East will leave us in a world that is vastly unsafe for \nour citizens and for people around the world.\n  While I know our engagement needs to continue and evolve, I know this \namendment is not the way to make that happen. I strongly oppose it, and \nI will vote against it if we ever get a vote on this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker for his very good, \ncountry-by-country explanation; kind of a big picture, rational \napproach to what we are trying to do. I understand Senator Paul's \nconvictions. A lot of Americans are frustrated. We are broke but giving \nmoney to people overseas. They all hate us.\n  Well, they all don't hate us. Some do, some don't. Let's invest in \nthe ones we can live with and stand up to the ones who want to kill us \nall.\n  Before I turn it over to Senator Hoeven, one last thought about the \nworld in which we live. We could get hit in the next minute. We could \nget hit today. We could get hit tomorrow. They are trying to get here \nas desperately as they can. Thank God for every day we have been able \nto survive without being attacked again in our homeland. But I would \nsay this: One of the reasons we have been effective after 9/11 is that \nwe are in their backyard. We are deployed over there--not just with \nmilitary force but with assistance. We are making their lives more \ndifficult by raising money and operating and being able to maneuver and\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nfind allies. To get to America now to attack us is harder than it was \non September 10, 2001, because we are engaged in the fight. If we \nwithdraw aid, we take one of the most valuable tools off the table. \nThere has to be more tools in the tool kit than just bombing people or \ndisengaging from the world. So this 1 percent of the budget is a \ngodsend to those in the military.\n\n\n                              S.J. Res. 41\n\n  Now I will turn back to S.J. Res. 41. Senator Hoeven of North Dakota \nwas my first Republican cosponsor of the idea that we cannot contain a \nnuclear-capable Iran, and I cannot tell my colleagues how much I \nappreciate his leadership.\n  So I yield to Senator Hoeven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his leadership on this incredibly important issue and to \nalso express my appreciation for the Senator from Tennessee and my \nagreement with his remarks. I thought he was right-on with what he \nsaid, and I support what he had to say.\n\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of S.J. Res. 41 with Senator \nGraham. He is knowledgeable on this issue. He has dedicated an \nincredible amount of time and commitment to this effort.\n  Recently I was with Senator Graham and Senator McCain and others. We \nwere in Afghanistan, and then we were in Egypt, where we met with the \nMuslim Brotherhood. We were in Israel, where we met with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. Then we were in Libya, where we met with a number of the \nmilitia groups who now control Benghazi and Mirsrata and, of course, \nTripoli. And we were in Tunisia as well. I have to say that it is \nincredibly important that we had the opportunity to go to those \ncountries. Senator Graham has been there many times, as has Senator \nMcCain. But it is very important that we understand what is going on.\n  Some of the comments Senator Corker expressed are so true. We have to \nunderstand what is going on in these countries. At the same time, we \nhave to communicate with these countries as they try to build \ndemocracies. But we must be clear and consistent in our foreign policy \nthat we support our friends, we support our allies, we will oppose our \nopponents, and that we demand safety for our embassies and for \nAmericans abroad. We provide no less to the people who come to our \ncountry, and we expect the same in return.\n  S.J. Res. 41 is a bipartisan effort. And I want to express that \nagain; that is so important. It is a bipartisan effort--80 Senators \nstanding together and expressing their support, bringing this \nresolution to the Senate floor, and saying to the administration: We \nneed to take a tough stand with Iran. We cannot allow Iran to develop \nnuclear weapons. It is not an option. Containment--a nuclear Iran \ncontained is not an option. It does not work.\n  Look what is going on in the Middle East right now, in Egypt, in \nLibya, Tunisia, Yemen. Across the Middle East right now, you have \nextremist groups--fundamental Islamic extremist groups--that are \nundermining the democratic efforts in those countries. Look at the \nattacks on our Embassy. Look at the killing of our Ambassador. We \ncannot allow that and can only prevent that through strength--through \nstrength.\n  So we have to stand for America's interests in all of these \ncountries, and we have to prevent a nuclear Iran. Iran is helping the \nextremists throughout all of these countries, supporting Bashar Asad in \nSyria, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas--all these groups that are \nundertaking violence throughout the Middle East, not only against \nAmericans but against their own people, undermining these nations' \ndemocracies. The way we help stop that and the way we help support \nfreedom and democracy is through a strong, consistent foreign policy.\n  That is what the resolution, on a bipartisan basis, is all about--\nsaying to the administration: We must stand up to Iran, and we must \nprevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And if Iran were to develop \na nuclear weapon, that could also start a race for other countries in \nthe Middle East to develop a nuclear capability. Look at the unstable \nsituation there. It is certainly not a situation where nuclear weapons \ncan be added to the equation as well.\n  We have worked in the Senate, in the House, to provide tools to the \nadministration to put sanctions in place to prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. The Kirk-Menendez legislation, which was \npassed as part of the Defense authorization bill, provides strong \nsanctions against Iran that still have not been fully implemented. The \nbest way to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is through \nsanctions. All options have to be on the table. We must support Israel \nin whatever action Israel determines it must take to protect itself. \nAll options for the United States must be on the table as well. The \nbest way to stop Iran, if we can, is with sanctions, but the only way \nthat is going to work is if they are fully imposed to the full extent \npossible.\n  Let me use Kirk-Menendez as an example. What did that legislation \nprovide? That legislation provided a tool to the administration that \nessentially barred any company or country that does business with Iran \nor its Central Bank from doing business with the central banking system \nin the United States. That is an effective tool because if Iran cannot \nsell its oil, it cannot continue to function.\n  We must fully impose those sanctions. We must stand strongly with our \nclosest friend and ally Israel in the region. This resolution is a \nbipartisan message to our administration saying: Stand strong. We can \nand we must prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see the majority leader and the minority \nleader are on the floor, and I will turn the floor back to the esteemed \nSenator from South Carolina and thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before I turn this over, may I have just 2 \nminutes to wrap up.\n  I want to thank Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for scheduling \nthis vote. Eighty-two Senators stand behind President Obama's statement \nthat it is bad policy to contain a nuclear-capable Iran. Let me tell \nyou right quickly why. If the Iranians get a nuclear weapon or nuclear \ncapability, the Sunni Arab States will want one themselves to counter \nthe Shia Persian influence, and you will have a nuclear arms race in \nthe Mid East. That is not a good result. That is the road to \nArmageddon. Israel will never know a minute's peace. If the ayatollahs \nin Iran have a nuclear weapon, my God, what would living in Israel be \nlike? Look at the threat you would live under the rest of your life. \nThat is a no-go for the people of Israel.\n  The big concern I have above all else is that the ayatollahs will \nshare that nuclear capability, that technology with a terrorist group. \nThe only reason thousands have died in the war on terror and not \nmillions is they just cannot get the weapons to kill millions of us. \nAnd if the ayatollahs had those nuclear weapons or that capability, \nthey would share it with terrorists. That is why containment is not a \ngood idea.\n  This is not an authorization to use force. It encourages sanctions. \nIt encourages diplomacy. It says that all options are on the table. It \nis not authorizing force, but it is taking off the table the idea that \nthe Iranians can get a nuclear weapon and we will try to contain them \nbecause that is just emptying Pandora's box.\n  One last thought. An Israeli soldier was killed today because the \nSinai border between Egypt and Israel was breached. Part of our aid to \nEgypt has conditions that say: If you break the treaty with Israel, you \nlose the money. And you need to beef up the security in the Sinai.\n  The Egyptian Army is basically being driven out of the Sinai. They \nare moving back in. So if you really do care about the security of \nIsrael, we cannot break relations with Egypt. It is a complicated \nrelationship, but it is in our interest to be involved.\n  Again, we are all over the world in different fashions, and I would \nrather be helping people help themselves than having to send soldiers \nin every time there is a hot spot in the world. We cannot disengage \nfrom the world. It is our destiny to be the leader of the free world; \nwe just need to do it smartly.\n  One percent of our budget is spent on foreign assistance. I think it \nmakes sense.\n  With that, I will yield the floor and thank all of my colleagues for \njumping\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\non board for a resolution that I think is timely. If the Senate of the \nUnited States ever needed to speak with one voice on a single topic, it \nis now, and that single topic is to the Iranian regime: You will not be \nallowed to get a nuclear weapon, period.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 p.m. \nthis evening, there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the \nmajority leader and Senator Paul or their designees; that following the \nuse or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to votes in \nrelation to the following items in the order listed: passage of S. \n3576, passage of S.J. Res. 41, cloture on H.J. Res. 117; that if \ncloture is invoked on H.J. Res. 117, the pending amendments be \nwithdrawn and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of H.J. Res. 117; \nthat immediately following that vote, the Senate proceed to the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to S. 3525; that if cloture is not \ninvoked on H.J. Res. 117, the Senate proceed to the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3525; that the vote on passage of S. 3576 be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that if S. 3576 does not \nachieve 60 affirmative votes, then it be returned to the calendar; that \nfollowing the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 3525, the \nmajority leader be recognized; finally, that no amendments, motions, or \npoints of order be in order during the consideration of these measures.\n  That all begins at 11:30. Mr. President, usually we have a 15-minute \nvote for the first one, but I think, with the time we are doing this, I \nwould like all votes to be 10-minute votes, so I also ask unanimous \nconsent that be the case and that between each vote there be 2 minutes \nequally divided so the sponsors and those opposing the passage of that \nlegislation can speak on them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this agreement paves the way for the \ncompletion of our remaining business for this work period. It is going \nto be a very early morning or late night, however you look at it, but \nit is the right thing to do. I expect that upon the completion of the \nscheduled votes, the motion to proceed to the sportsmen's bill will be \npending, postcloture. I am gratified that we are on track to attempt to \nmove this measure when we get back. After we address that bill, when we \nreturn in November, I intend to move to Senator Menendez's housing \nbill. But I will be in touch with the Republican leader several times \nbefore the election, I am sure, anyway.\n  Mr. President, before we leave here, everyone should understand that \nwhat we are going to try to do this evening--I have spoken with the \nRepublican leader--is that when people finish their talking--we hope it \ncan be early this evening--we would go into recess--and hopefully we \ncan do that at 5 or 6 o'clock tonight--until 11:30 tonight. I hope that \ncan be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                              S.J. Res. 41\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have before us a resolution on \ncontainment of Iran. I have voted for sanctions on Iran and do not \nthink it is a good idea that Iran have nuclear weapons. However, I am \nvery concerned about this particular resolution. I think a vote for \nthis resolution is a vote for the concept of preemptive war. I know of \nno other way to interpret this resolution.\n  The resolution says that containment--the strategy of trying to \nprevent expansion or invasion of countries--will never be our policy \nwith regard to Iran. While I think it unwise to announce that we will \ncontain Iran--I do think it unwise to tell Iran: Oh, it is fine to get \na nuclear weapon; we will contain you--I also think it is equally \nunwise to say: We will never contain you.\n  The reason I say this is that we woke up one day and Pakistan had \nnuclear weapons. We woke up one day and Russia had nuclear weapons--\nChina and India and North Korea. Had we made the statement--the rash \nstatement--that we will never contain any country that has nuclear \nweapons, what does that mean? I think that means that you have \ndecided--right now, before anything happens, you have decided that you \nwill preemptively go to war.\n  We have been at war for a decade now. We have been at war in \nAfghanistan. I supported going to Afghanistan, but I am ready to come \nhome from Afghanistan. We were at war in Iraq for nearly 10 years. I am \nglad we are coming home from Iraq. But I do not want to automatically \ncommit our country to a war in Iran.\n  So while I do think it is a mistake to say we will not contain them, \nI think it is also a mistake to say we will contain them. It is a \nmistake to have a policy that is explicit one way or the other.\n  President Reagan was once criticized and accused of having no foreign \npolicy. He replied that it was not that he had no foreign policy; it \nwas that he did not care to share it with everyone. Because if you give \neveryone--your potential enemies or friends--if you say to every \ncountry: If you do X, I will do X, or if you maybe do this, I will do \nthat, you are exposing exactly what your plans are, and that may not be \nthe best strategy. In other words, foreign policy is an ever-shifting \nbattleground, and there should be a certain strategic ambiguity to \nforeign policy.\n  So when we announce to Iran or to the world that we will never, ever \ncontain Iran, it is an announcement that the bombs will be dropping if \nwe ever hear that they are a nuclear power. I do not think we should \nsay automatically we are willing to accept them as a nuclear power, but \nI do not think we should automatically say there will be a preemptive \nwar with Iran.\n  Now, everybody has been bragging. They say: Oh, everybody in the \nSenate is for this. Everybody is not. I am not for this. I may be alone \non this, but, interestingly, if you travel to Israel, there is a very \nspirited debate on this.\n  Meir Dagan, who was the head of the Mossad, cares deeply about \nIsrael, would not be, by anyone's imagination accused of being a \nshrinking violet--he has done many things to prevent Iran from having a \nnuclear weapon. He is worried about what happens the minute the bombs \nstart dropping on Iran. Where do you think the next set of bombs will \ngo? They will be on Tel Aviv. They will not be on the United States. \nBut if you live in Tel Aviv, you might have some concern over what \nhappens and what Iran does.\n  The other thing about beginning a war is that historically in our \ncountry we have had defensive wars. Nobody messes with us, and I agree \nwith that. You mess with the United States there will be significant \nrepercussions. We will not let you invade other countries and we will \nnot let you invade the United States. But the idea that we will have \noffensive war and not defensive war is a concept that is new in our \nhistory.\n  Preemptive war, going to war and saying we will go to war to prevent \nyou from doing certain activities is a new concept in our lexicon of \nforeign policy. I think it is a dangerous one. Announcing to the world, \nas this resolution does, that containment will never be our policy is \nunwise. It is a recipe for perpetual war. A country that vows to never \ncontain an enemy is a country that vows to always preemptively attack. \nTo rule out containment as a strategy or as a strategic and sometimes \nmilitarily active form of defense is to admit we have become Orwellian. \nYes, we have always been at war with East Asia or, yes, we have always \nbeen at war with Eurasia. It is an idea that we will always be \nperpetually at war.\n  I am proud of being for a strong national defense. I am proud of \nbeing for protecting our country. But I cannot accept a resolution that \nsays we will completely get rid of the containment strategy that was a \nstrategy that kept us safe for 60 years during the most aggressive and \ndangerous war we have ever encountered, the Cold War. The Soviet Union \nhad 30,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the \nUnited States and attack us and devastate our country.\n  If we would have had this concept that we rule out the idea of \ncontainment, we would have had an awful and devastating and maybe \ncataclysmic war with Russia. Now North Korea is more similar to Iran, a \ntwo-bit dictatorship that has trouble feeding their own people, has \ntrouble having enough supplies of food and gasoline for their own \npeople. There are similarities. But\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nwhen North Korea announced it had a nuclear weapon, did we immediately \nstart dropping bombs? Did we say we will not contain them? We contained \nNorth Korea. Some would argue the leadership of North Korea is equally \nas irrational as the leadership of Iran, if not more so. So we were \nable to contain a two-bit socialist, very small and unproductive \ncountry such as North Korea. I see no reason why, if we had to, we \ncould not contain Iran. I am not promoting that as a philosophy. We \nshould not be telling Iran we will contain them. But for goodness' \nsake, we should not be saying: We will never contain you.\n  The people who vote for this resolution I think are well meaning, but \nI do not think they are thinking this through. We have had this before. \nWhen the resolution came up for the Iraq war, many voted for it and \nthen some came back later and said: I voted for it before I voted \nagainst it. They wanted it both ways. Many come up to me now and say: I \nvoted for the Iraq war, but it was a mistake. I voted for this concept \nof offensive war, of preemptive war to stop Iraq from having weapons of \nmass destruction, but I made a mistake.\n  I think the Iraq war was a mistake. I was not here, but I would have \nvoted no. I fear we are pushing on. Every month there has to be a new \nand more bellicose resolution to ensure we will go to war and that at \nall costs we will go to war in Iran. I think it is a mistake. I think \nthere should be some strategic ambiguity, meaning that we do not \nannounce to our enemies exactly what we are going to do. We let them \nknow firmly what our position is, but we do not announce to them our \nentire military strategy.\n  To do so, to rule out a strategy that we had for 60 years that \nworked, that kept us in a very difficult and uneasy peace with the \nSoviet Union, does anybody here argue we would have been much better if \ncontainment would not have been a strategy, if we would have said \nabsolutely to Russia, if you do this, we are going to--the bombs will \ndrop tomorrow.\n  That scares me. But what scares me more is that so many Members of \nthis body are jumping up and down to embrace each other in the \nbipartisan desire that we will not have containment as a strategy, that \nwe absolutely will go to war if we wake up and Iran has nuclear \nweapons. You know what, the other day Meir Dagan, the former head of \nthe Mossad, said that you cannot bomb the nuclear knowledge out of the \npsyche. Nuclear knowledge, the knowledge to make nuclear weapons, is \nout there now. It is in Iran. We will not be able to stop that \nknowledge. We will not be able to eradicate the knowledge of nuclear \nweapons. That is something to think about. Because there may come a \nday--and this is the prelude to the next argument. The next argument we \nhave on this floor will be one day when Iran announces, and am not for \nthis, I think we should do everything--I voted for sanctions. I think \nwe should do everything to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon.\n  But my goodness this is a huge mistake. It may be unpopular for me at \nhome to say this, but I will say it. I will say it loudly. To rule out \nany kind of defensive strategy that does not include an offensive war \nis a huge mistake for the country. I will vigorously oppose this \nresolution. I hope those who have glommed onto this resolution so \nquickly, because there is an incredible force behind this resolution, \nthere is an incredible lobbying apparatus that says you have to go onto \nthis or else. I hope they will reread this and reconsider. Think about \nthe double and triple amputees who have come home to your town. Think \nabout the soldiers who have committed suicide. Think about the hundreds \nof thousands of soldiers who are overseas now. Ask yourself, are we \nready to send another 100,000 or 200,000 or 300,000 soldiers to Iran?\n  I am not asking that we do nothing. We just beefed up the sanctions a \ncouple months ago. But there are other things to do besides saying we \nwill always have to go to war. For example, who does Iran trade with? \nYou know the reason why the sanctions probably will not ultimately \nwork? Because Iran trades with China and Russia and India and Japan and \nthey are exempt from the sanctions. We say there are sanctions, but \nthen we give them exemptions and they sell all their oil somewhere \nelse. We do not have the power to shut down Iran through sanctions.\n\n  If we were to convince somehow Russia and China to be on our side, we \ncould have leverage, and I think Iran would listen. The sanctions have \nbrought them back to the table. They are negotiating. I do not for 1 \nminute believe everything they say or think they are trustworthy. But \nit is better than war to have negotiations, even with a fallible and \nperhaps deceitful partner sometimes--but it is still better than war.\n  I think there is such an eagerness or such a lack of reluctance in \nthis body to think through the issues of war. That is how we get into \nthis. We get into it because everybody wants to be stronger than the \nnext guy. Everybody wants to be more bellicose than the next guy. \nEverybody wants to say: Nobody pushes us around and we are not going to \ntake it. But there are other ways. There are other ways.\n  We have to worry about and think about what ultimately are the \nrepercussions. Our soldiers are not inanimate clay that we put on this \nmaster board of chess, this geopolitical chess game, to move around. \nThese are young men and women who live in your neighborhood, who live \nin the neighboring town. When I think about war, I think about this \nresolution; I do not think about empty black and white words on a page. \nI think about those young men and woman and my commitment, my real and \nstrong commitment that I am not going to war without absolute \nprovocation, without a threat to the national security, and for \ngoodness' sake, without a debate over it.\n  The other side may say: This does not say anything about war. No, but \nit says some things that are very unwise; that we would rule out an \nentire form of defense strategy that we used for 60 years successfully \nto stay out of war. I think it is a mistake to say it is OK for Iran to \nbe a nuclear country and we will contain them. But I think it is also a \nmistake to say we will never contain them.\n  I have another amendment that is coming up this evening. This is an \namendment to place limitations on foreign aid. For the last hour or \ntwo, we have had a bit of the other side giving their response. That is \nfine. We discover the truth by hearing the debate on both sides of \nthis. But Senator Moynihan, who used to serve up here who is deceased, \nonce said: Everybody has the right to their own opinion, but you do not \nhave the right to make up your own set of facts.\n  There was a Senator here earlier who said: Oh, that guy from \nKentucky, he does not believe in a strong national defense. He would \nslash national defense. So anybody who is against foreign aid is not \nfor national defense.\n  This particular Senator said: He would gut defense and he would cut \nit by 16 percent. That is just sort of making up your facts. That is \nnot fair. He is entitled to his opinion, but he is not entitled to make \nup the facts. I do have a budget that I put forward that balances the \nbudget in 5 years. I also have a priority within that budget that I \nthink the most important thing our government does and that the \nConstitution mandates is a strong national defense. I think it is the \nmost important thing we do in this country.\n  So in my budget I am able to cut a significant amount of spending, \nbut I actually limit the military sequester. The military sequester was \nan automatic cut. I do it by cutting out other spending, real cuts in \nspending in the same year to reduce the size of government, but I do \nnot have a 16-percent cut in military in 1 year.\n  In fact, under the military sequester, I actually restore $50 billion \nthat allows the first year not to have any cuts in military. Do I think \nthere should be some cuts in military? Yes. But I make it a little bit \neasier on the cuts over time. To say I am proposing a 16-percent cut is \nuntrue.\n  Others have said: Yes, the military sequester is so horrible. He is \ngoing to cut foreign aid. The country will be defenseless. The hordes \nwill be over here. We will have to fight them over there. There is a \ncertain irony to this because half these people, these Senators who are \ncaterwauling about this military sequester, guess what they will not \ntell you. They voted for the military sequester. I voted against the \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\nsequester last year because I did not think there was going to be \nenough cuts to rescue us from this debt bomb that is ticking.\n  But the people who voted for the military sequester are now up here \naccusing me of wanting to gut defense and all the military cuts and \nthey voted for the military sequester. Others have come to the floor \nand said: If we do not pay people to be our friend, if we do not give \npeople foreign aid, then we are wanting to withdraw from the world, \nthat we are going to withdraw into a little, tiny shell, into a closet \nand lock ourselves in a fortress and we are not going to engage the \nworld.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. We do not give any foreign \naid to England. Have we withdrawn from England? We do not give any \nforeign aid to anybody in Europe. Have we withdrawn from Europe? We are \nincredibly connected with Europe. We are incredibly connected with \nChina, despite our differences--incredibly connected with China. We do \nnot have to give foreign aid to be connected to the world. We should \ntrade with the world. That is the connection. The more we are \ninterconnected through trade, the less likely we are to go to war.\n  The other side also says that if we do not have foreign aid we will \nhave war. My goodness, has anybody been paying attention? We have had \ntwo pretty big wars for a decade. We are involved in the longest war in \nthe history of our country. I do not see any evidence that foreign aid \nis preventing war.\n  Some might say: But foreign aid is humanitarian and we want to help \npoor people. I see zero evidence that foreign aid is helping poor \npeople. It is helping rich people in poor countries. I went through an \nhour's worth of this earlier talking about how dictators are the ones \nstealing the money in Africa. Africans live on an average of $2 a day. \nThey did 30 years ago and they still do because foreign aid does not \nget to the people; it is stolen by the dictators.\n  The other point to make about foreign aid is: My goodness, if we do \nnot have foreign aid, we will be fighting them on our shores. Because \nwe have foreign aid, we have a great deal of antipathy. What they need \nto think through--and nobody is thinking through--is why are the Arabs \nmad? Why are they yelling and screaming and burning the American flag? \nThat makes me mad, and that is one reason I don't want to send them any \nmoney, because they are burning our flag. But why are they mad?\n\n  They are mad because Mubarak, who was a dictator in Egypt--do you \nknow what he did when the crowds were formed? He hosed them down with \nteargas made in Pennsylvania and bought with foreign aid. When the \npolice came with truncheons and beat the crap out of people who were \nprotesting in Egypt, they did it with money from the United States. \nThey are not mad at us because we are rich, they are not mad at us \nbecause we drive cars and have nice clothes and have music they find \ndistasteful. They are really not even ultimately mad at us because of \nthat movie. They do not like it, and I understand there are \nsensibilities on this, but that is not ultimately why they are mad. But \nthey get really mad when they are hit over the head with a police \ntruncheon paid for with foreign aid.\n  So it is exactly the opposite of what the other side says. The other \nside says without foreign aid we will have more war. I say because of \nthe foreign aid we have more war. There is no objective evidence. Is \nthere any objective evidence we have had less war with foreign aid? \nNone. Zero. There is a lot of evidence we are out of money, though. We \nare $1 trillion in the hole every year, and they all come down and pay \nlip service to it, but then say: Oh, well, $30 billion won't make a \ndifference. I say we have to start somewhere, and foreign aid is a \ngreat place to start.\n  These Senators are disconnected from the public. I defy any Senator \nwho votes to continue foreign aid with no limitations to go home and \nask their people. I will bet 90 percent of the people at home--it \nroutinely polls in the 70s--are in favor of not sending money overseas, \nparticularly if asked whether they want to send money overseas to \npeople who despise us or if they would want to send money overseas to \npeople who are burning our flag; would they want to send money overseas \nto a country that has tortured a man who helped us get bin Laden; to a \ncountry that allowed bin Laden to live within its midst for 6 or 7 \nyears unmolested; to a country that is mad at us now because we got bin \nLaden; to a country where a third of the population would vote for bin \nLaden for president.\n  I say far from destabilizing the world, what would happen if we were \nto remove foreign aid is we would remove the impetus to the Arab spring \nbecoming the Arab winter. What I see is people recognizing that people \nare angry, but I see no intelligent discussion about why they are \nangry. When people come to me and they say: Oh, it is because we are \nrich and we are a wealthy country, that doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Many of these people actually in the Arab spring do want freedom--a \nfreedom like our freedom. It may be a little different, because it is a \ndifferent culture and they believe in a different system of democracy \nthan we do, but they still want some freedom. Some might ask: If they \nwant freedom and we have freedom, why wouldn't they admire our system; \nwhy wouldn't they be sympathetic; why are they burning our flag; why \nare 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people rallying and burning our \nflag? It is because too often our foreign aid has gone to support \ndictators who have oppressed their people.\n  Mubarak got $60 billion in Egypt. Estimates of his family's worth are \nup to $50 billion. They repressed their people. No one could come into \nthe street without being beaten over the head with a police baton or \nsprayed with teargas made in Pennsylvania. They were mad at Mubarak, \nunderstandably, so that anger is transferred to us. The same with Ben \nAli in Tunisia, and the same with Hussein.\n  Remember that Hussein was our ally before he was our enemy. In the \nIran-Iraq war we had American planes on both sides. We had military \nadvisers supporting Hussein against Iran, but we had F-4 Phantoms \nflying on Iran's side that were left there when we left. So this goes \nback a long way.\n  I remember being in high school and being perplexed as to why the \nIranians hated us. Why were they burning our flag? Why were they \nburning our Embassy and jumping up and down like a bunch of idiots \nburning our flag? Why did they hate us so much? Because we kept in \npower a man--the shah--whom they didn't like, whom they despised, and \nwho was autocratic and had a very significant police force that didn't \nallow dissent.\n  It is the opposite of what the other side argues for. The other side \nis arguing that without foreign aid we will have war. I am arguing that \nbecause of foreign aid we have war. Because of foreign aid and because \nof the misapplication of foreign aid, because of the theft of foreign \naid, and because foreign aid is given to people who repress their \npeople, the Arab spring, which has a healthy element to it, has become \nthe Arab winter. If we don't understand that, we are never going to get \nbeyond that.\n  We have to also go back to the specifics of what I am asking for in \nthis amendment. In this amendment, what I am asking for is that there \nsimply be restrictions. I am asking that in order to get our foreign \naid, a country has to act like an ally; they have to significantly and \nbelievably pledge to protect our Embassy. In Libya's regard, they have \nto promise to turn over the people who assassinated our Ambassador.\n  I think that is the minimum of what we should do. Frankly, I think we \nprobably shouldn't be sending aid at all, but I think this is a first \nstep in the right direction; to say, for goodness sakes, if we are \ngoing to send aid to people, at least send it to people who are acting \nlike our allies.\n  When we see the American flag being burned in public by tens of \nthousands of the horde around our Embassies around the world, we should \nask ourselves if we want to send good money after bad to that country. \nDo we believe it is working? And when we think about whether our money \nshould go to African despots and dictators, we should ask if that money \nis getting to the poor people in Africa or is our foreign aid going to \nrich people in poor countries. That is the history of it. It is the \nhistory of repression, it is the history of human rights abuse, it is \nthe history of theft and more corruption than anyone can ever imagine.\n  I will probably lose this vote, but I have fought long and hard. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nfought for 6 weeks to get this vote, and so we are going to have this \nvote at midnight. People aren't too happy with me now, but we are going \nto have a vote tonight at midnight, and I think it is an important \nvote. I think it is an important first step whether we win or lose. \nBecause every Senator who votes on this tonight will have to go home \nand they will have to engage their constituents and explain to their \nconstituents why they are still willing to send money to countries that \nare burning the American flag; why they are still willing to send money \nto countries where there is ample evidence of corruption and thievery; \nwhy they are still willing to send foreign aid to countries that are \nopenly disdainful of us.\n  Does everyone realize the President of Afghanistan, or senior \nadvisers, have said that if there is a war with Pakistan--between the \nUnited States and Pakistan--they will side with Pakistan? Pakistan's \nsenior advisers have said if there is a war with Iran, they will side \nwith Iran. These are the people we are sending billions of dollars to \nand saying: Please be our friends. They laugh and snigger at us and \nturn away and say: Fools. That is what they say about us.\n  I say what we need in this country is an American spring--an American \nspring where we wake up and say: Look, to make our country great again, \nto retain American greatness, we have to figure out how to grow at \nhome. And I think that means leaving more money at home. I hope the \nSenate will consider this when they vote this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                  Report on Operation Fast and Furious\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the inspector general of \nthe Department of Justice issued his report on ATF's Operation Fast and \nFurious. This report is a significant milestone for the family of \nBorder Patrol Agent Brian Terry. He was killed in a firefight with \nillegal aliens who were armed with illegal guns from Fast and Furious.\n  Attorney General Holder delayed any discipline for the officials \nresponsible for Fast and Furious until after this report was released. \nThe time for accountability has come. There are no more excuses for \ninaction.\n  The inspector general's nonpartisan review confirmed virtually \neverything I heard from whistleblowers over the last year and a half. \nThe Justice Department tried to push all the blame on the ATF and \nofficials down in Phoenix, AZ, but the inspector general confirmed that \nsenior officials in Washington ignored red flag after red flag.\n  Senior officials in both the Justice Department and ATF knew or \nshould have known that Operation Fast and Furious was putting guns into \nthe hands of criminals. But they ignored the risk and failed to take \nsteps to protect the public safety. The Inspector General also \nconfirmed that there were major information-sharing failures between \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  We are still going through the nearly 500-page report, as well as 309 \npages of new documents the Justice Department produced late Wednesday. \nHowever, I was surprised to learn from the report that Attorney General \nHolder testified that he doesn't remember the conversation with me \nabout Fast and Furious in my office on January 31, 2011. That is when I \nhanded the first letters to the Attorney General opening the \ninvestigation of Fast and Furious.\n  I happen to remember that conversation. My staff told the Attorney \nGeneral that day what whistleblowers had told us. Remember, \nwhistleblowers got involved in coming to Congress because for months \nthey were sending reports up from Phoenix to main Justice that selling \nguns illegally or encouraging our gun dealers to sell guns illegally \nwas not a very smart thing for our Justice Department to do. And when \nthey weren't listened to, these whistleblowers started coming to this \nSenator.\n  Specifically, at that meeting with Holder, we discussed that two \nweapons the ATF let go in Fast and Furious were found at the murder \nscene of Border Patrol Agent Terry. I emphasized I was personally \nbringing it to his attention--meaning the attention of the Attorney \nGeneral--because these were very serious and credible allegations, not \njust some run-of-the-mill letter that I send to departments generally.\n  Yet even after that meeting, the Department didn't take this case \nseriously. The inspector general's independent report says so \nexplicitly.\n\n       We do not believe that the gravity of this allegation was \n     met with an equally serious effort by the Department to \n     determine whether ATF and the U.S. Attorney's Office had \n     allowed the sale of hundreds of weapons to straw purchasers.\n\n  The Justice Department claimed its process for writing letters to \nCongress was sound. But its response to me, in its February 4, 2011, \nletter, was false. That letter came back only 4 or 5 days after I first \nhanded the letter to the Attorney General. The February 4, 2011, letter \nwas false because DOJ later withdrew it and claimed it relied on bad \ninformation from the ATF and the U.S. Attorney's Office. However, the \ninspector general agreed with me that the Justice Department's response \nwas seriously flawed--and not just the initial response. The inspector \ngeneral also found that the Justice Department knew its initial reply \nwasn't true when it reaffirmed the denial of the whistleblower \nallegations in a May 2, 2011 letter to me.\n  Instead of acknowledging it was wrong, the Department repeatedly \ndoubled down on its denials.\n  For example, Attorney General Holder said on multiple occasions since \nNovember 2011 that the wiretap evidence authorized by the Justice \nDepartment headquarters did not put senior leadership on notice that \nthe ATF was walking guns.\n  Most recently, on June 7 of this year, the Attorney General went \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee. At this point, many Members of \nCongress had obtained and read the affidavits, even though the Justice \nDepartment did not want us to see them. Members who reviewed them said \nthat the affidavits contained evidence of gunwalking. But Attorney \nGeneral Holder testified:\n\n       I've looked at these affidavits, I've looked at these \n     summaries. There's nothing in those affidavits as I've \n     reviewed them that indicates gunwalking was allowed.\n\n  The inspector general has read these same wiretap affidavits. Since \nthe inspector general is independent and nonpartisan, that independent, \nnonpartisan conclusion is at odds with the quote I just gave you from \nthe Attorney General, and that quote from the Attorney General comes \nfrom testimony before the other body.\n  I quote from his report:\n\n       [T]he affidavits described specific incidents that would \n     suggest . . . ATF was employing a strategy of not \n     interdicting weapons or arresting known straw purchasers.\n\n  In fact, much of the inspector general's report is redacted because \nthose affidavits are still under seal. Chairman Issa and I asked the \nJustice Department months ago to move to unseal them so the public \ncould decide for themselves. Now the inspector general has joined \nCongressman Issa and this Senator, and is also calling for the \nDepartment to ask for permission of the court to release the \naffidavits. The Justice Department should have filed that motion months \nago. Unsealing the affidavits will allow the American people and the \nTerry family to see the whole story.\n  The details of those affidavits show that senior officials knew, or \nshould have known, about gunwalking in Fast and Furious. The inspector \ngeneral independently confirmed this point, quite contrary to Attorney \nGeneral Holder's denials. Those denials by the Attorney General show \neither incompetence or lack of truthfulness. Congress created an \nexplicit statutory duty for certain senior Justice Department officials \nto authorize all wiretap applications, not just those involved with \nFast and Furious.\n  Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, who served \ndirectly under criminal division head Lanny Breuer, was one of the \nofficials who approved some of these affidavits. Senior officials such \nas Mr. Weinstein tried to claim that they shouldn't be held accountable \nbecause they only read memos summarizing the wiretaps, not the full \nwiretap applications, as I think is required under law. But the \ninspector general found that Justice Department officials should review \nmore than just the cover memo. He said that under the statute, they \nhave the responsibility to be fully informed before authorizing wiretap \napplications.\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\n  Yet the inspector general also found that even\n\n     . . . a reader of the . . . cover memorandum would infer from \n     the facts that ATF agents did not take enforcement action to \n     interdict the weapons or arrest [straw purchasers].\n\n  So the memo Mr. Weinstein admits he did read indicated that ATF had \nwalked guns, according to the inspector general.\n  Back in September of last year, Attorney General Holder said at a \npress conference:\n\n       The notion that somehow or other this thing reaches the \n     upper levels of the Justice Department is something that . . \n     . I don't think is supported by the facts.\n\n  Maybe the Attorney General doesn't think someone who reports directly \nto the head of the criminal division is a senior official, but this \nSenator does.\n  As a result of the inspector general's findings, Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Weinstein has resigned. Mr. Weinstein should be held \naccountable, but he shouldn't take the fall for more senior officials \nwho are also culpable.\n  Mr. Weinstein reported directly to Assistant Attorney General Lanny \nBreuer. When the Justice Department sent its letter to me denying ATF \never walked guns, Breuer knew otherwise. He knew in 2010 about \ngunwalking in another case, Operation Wide Receiver. That was long \nbefore the allegations in Fast and Furious; yet he waited 9 months \nbefore e-mails about Wide Receiver were about to be produced to \nCongress before he publicly apologized for not doing more about \ngunwalking in the previous gun walking Wide Receiver.\n  I asked Breuer whether he had seen the draft of the February 4 false \nletter to me. Breuer testified:\n\n       I cannot say for sure whether I saw a draft of the letter \n     that was sent to you.\n\n  Now I will explain why that was a false statement that he made to me.\n  A month after Breuer's testimony, the Justice Department released \nmore documents showing that Breuer was sent five drafts of the letter \nbefore it was sent to me. He forwarded three of them to his personal e-\nmail account. Breuer still maintained in written responses that it was \n``highly unlikely'' he had read the letter because he was in Mexico \nwhen it was sent. On this matter, the inspector general report \ncontained a significant factual error.\n  By the way, there aren't many errors in this inspector general's \nreport. I compliment him for a very good job that he did.\n  The report read:\n\n       The OIG found no e-mail messages from Breuer in which he \n     proposed edits, commented on the drafts, or otherwise \n     indicated he had read them.\n\n  That statement of the inspector general is not true. In response to \none of the drafts that Breuer received, he commented to Weinstein that \nit was ``great work.''\n  That may not be a proposed edit, but it is certainly a comment. Thus, \nBreuer's statement to Congress is simply not credible. E-mails show \nthat Breuer was very engaged in the process, asking for and receiving \nupdates from Weinstein at every stage of the drafting of that letter of \nFebruary 4, 2011 that 8 or 9 months later they withdrew because it was \nfalse. Breuer and Weinstein sent multiple e-mails to each other on the \nmatter each day, with Breuer asking after a quiet period, ``Jason, let \nme know what's happening with this.''\n  So, quite obviously, he was involved before the letter was ever sent \nto me. Rather than holding him accountable for this evidence, the \ninspector general's report gives him a pass.\n\n  Worse, new e-mails produced Wednesday show that Breuer was in the \nweeds about his deputy Jason Weinstein coming to brief the Senate \nJudiciary Committee staff a week after the Justice Department's false \nletter was sent to me.\n  On February 13, 2011, Breuer sent an e-mail about such details as \nwhat specific questions my staff asked of Weinstein at this briefing. \nBreuer wrote:\n\n       The goal--and by all accounts it seems to have worked--was \n     to communicate that ATF's work in the AZ case and others like \n     it reflected sound judgment and investigative work.\n\n  It is clear that Breuer was in the weeds enough to know what the \nJustice Department was communicating to me was undermined by the \ngunwalking he knew about in Wide Receiver. He should have come forward \nin February 2011 and told Congress that he knew ATF had in fact walked \nguns. His failure to do so, coupled with his attempt to mislead \nCongress, is why I have called for him to resign or be fired. I made \nthat request last fall on the floor of this Senate.\n  The Attorney General has been saying for months that he would hold \noff on any personnel action until the inspector general's report was \nreleased. We have been hearing that for almost a year, ``Let the \ninspector general finish his work, and then we will decide what to \ndo.'' So, Mr. Attorney General, it is time to hold people accountable.\n  I wish to close with language from a statement that the family of \nBorder Patrol Agent Brian Terry issued. Agent Terry is the person where \ntwo guns that were walked were found at his murder scene.\n  From the family of Brian Terry:\n\n       The Department's failure chronicled in the report had \n     deadly and tragic consequences for hundreds of innocent \n     American and Mexican victims of violent crimes.\n       And our son, friend, relative and hero, Brian Terry, is \n     dead.\n       Questions and concerns should have been raised before the \n     weapons purchased in this failed government sting wound up in \n     the hands of drug dealers and killers, including those who \n     killed Brian.\n       The focus today should not be on political spin control nor \n     on praise for the Department of Justice supervisors who chose \n     to resign in light of the report's findings, but rather on \n     the gross negligence of the Department documented in the \n     report and the tragic consequences of that negligence.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our Nation faces an absolutely fundamental \nchoice in this year's election: Are we going to rescue, restore, and \nrebuild the middle class or are we going to continue to shift even more \nwealth and advantages to those at the top at the expense of the middle \nclass?\n  As I have done every day we have been in session here, I want to \npoint out to the American people what the blueprint is for this country \nunder the Romney-Ryan budget. That is their budget. A budget is a \nblueprint of where you want to go, what you want to do, how you want to \nbuild something--how you want to build the future of our country. That \nis the Ryan budget. So I want to take a look again at the Ryan budget \nand what it does for the future of this country.\n  First of all, the very centerpiece of the Ryan budget is whopping new \ntax cuts, mostly for those at the top, the richest 2 percent. Those \nmaking $1 million or more a year would receive $265,000 a year in new \ntax cuts on top of the $129,000 they would get from extending the old \nBush tax cuts. That means now if you are in the top 2 percent and you \nare making over $1 million a year, you get $394,000 in new tax cuts.\n  We keep hearing about Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan talking about \nentitlements. We have got to cut back on entitlements. Don't we? What \nabout this? That is what they always talk about. They are talking about \npeople who are lower income, who rely upon certain things such as \nnutrition assistance or job training programs, maybe Pell grants for \nstudents, for poor kids to go to college--cut back on those. What about \nthis entitlement? This is an entitlement; you are entitled to it: If \nyou make over $1 million a year, you will be entitled to those tax \ncuts.\n\n  We don't hear them cutting back on that entitlement. No. They want to \nextend it. How do they pay for all these new tax cuts? The total is \n$4.5 trillion over 10 years. They do not exactly say how, but the \nRepublican budget, that Ryan budget, would offset these tax cuts by \nmaking very deep and Draconian cuts in programs that undergird the \nmiddle class--everything from education, student loans, grants, law \nenforcement, clean air, clean water, food safety, medical research, \nhighways, bridges and other infrastructure, all cut in the Ryan budget.\n  The Ryan budget, as I will explain a little bit more in detail \nshortly, would end Medicare. We will hear a lot of people saying it \nwill end Medicare as we know it. Well, if we end something as we know \nit, that means we end it.\n  The Romney-Ryan budget, since Mr. Romney called it marvelous--the \nRomney-Ryan budget would end Medicare and make it a voucher care \nsystem. That would force seniors to pay nearly\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n$6,000 more per year out of their pockets for health care in the \nfuture.\n  Last, they offset these tax cuts by raising taxes on the middle \nclass--actually raising taxes on the middle class. Mr. Ryan's budget is \nto use the deficit crisis as a pretext for dismantling Medicare, \nMedicaid, cutting education and environmental protection, workplace \nsafety, and all the things I have said. What they do is double down on \nthe theory that if we just give more and more to those at the top, it \nwill trickle down to everybody else. That theory was tried under \nPresident George W. Bush, and it did not work out too well.\n  Today I want to focus on the devastating impact of the Romney-Ryan \nbudget on Medicare and on health care generally. Since he first arrived \nin Congress, Representative Ryan has consistently pushed a very \nspecific and radical health care program to end Medicare. Under his \nproposal, seniors would no longer have the guaranteed Medicare benefits \nthey have enjoyed for decades. Instead, they would get a voucher from \nthe Federal Government. They can then go out and buy individual private \ninsurance or Medicare.\n  Again, they say: You can buy Medicare. You can stay in Medicare if \nyou want or you can buy private insurance. Let's take a look at that. \nIn 10 years the Ryan plan would eliminate Medicare, shift to vouchers, \nbut the vouchers would not be enough to cover the health care costs so \nseniors' out-of-pocket costs would go up.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that the \nRyan proposal could increase annual out-of-pocket costs for seniors by \nmore than $1,200 in 2030, almost $6,000 in 2050. If we total all these \nyears, if we add one year after the other that seniors would have to \npay, seniors retiring in 2023, over their lifetime, would be paying \nalmost $60,000 more in total. For seniors retiring in 2030 it would be \nabout $125,000. When we get up to 2050, a senior retiring then would be \nspending about $330,000 over their retirement years just for health \ncare. That is what voucher care means.\n  In addition, the Ryan plan would leave the traditional Medicare \nsystem in a death spiral. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, in extolling their \nbudget, say: You know, we will give them a voucher. If you want to, you \ncan go out and buy traditional Medicare or you can buy a private \ninsurance plan.\n  What does that mean? That means if someone is a very healthy senior \nthey might get a better deal by going out and buying a private \ninsurance plan. So who stays in Medicare? The poorest and the sickest. \nThen the Medicare costs explode and it becomes unaffordable and we \ndestroy the whole Medicare system. Do not buy that argument of Mr. \nRyan, that someone can stay in Medicare if they want. No, it would \ndestroy it.\n  Make no mistake, the Ryan plan is a radical break with the past. This \nis not some little transition. This is not some little bit of \nexperimentation or something. No, the Ryan budget is a radical break \nwith what we have had in the past. It turns a successful, reliable \ncomprehensive source of health care that seniors have depended on for \ndecades, paid into over years of hard work--they turn it into an \nunpredictable, unreliable voucher care system.\n  Our approach is very different. President Obama has fought to \nstrengthen Medicare, not end it. He believes Medicare is a sacred \ncompact, and he has improved Medicare in the Affordable Care Act or \nwhat we now know as ObamaCare.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have been saying \n``ObamaCare'' as though it is a pejorative. It has a bad connotation. I \nuse it as a very good connotation because I want to tell you President \nObama does care. He cares about the fact that kids can stay on their \nparents' policy until age 26. He does care that insurance companies can \nno longer put lifetime caps on real sick people any longer. President \nObama does care if someone has a preexisting condition, they cannot be \ndenied affordable health care insurance. So, yes, President Obama does \ncare. That is why I think ObamaCare really does describe it well--Obama \ncares.\n  For example, in ObamaCare we eliminate gaps in coverage; that is, the \ndoughnut hole. We close the doughnut hole. We reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs. According to Medicare's Actuary--not me, the \nActuary--the Affordable Care Act extends the program's solvency by 8 \nyears, from 2016 to 2024, by getting rid of wasteful subsidies to \ninsurance companies, getting rid of fraud, waste, and abuse in the \nsystem. So our plan for Medicare is simple: Mend it, don't end it. That \nis just what we do.\n  The Ryan plan is bad news for those who depend on Medicare for their \nbasic health care needs. It is disastrous for people who depend on the \nMedicaid Program. The Ryan budget would block-grant Medicaid, put the \nentire program under the States, and then cut it by $810 billion over \nthe next 10 years. That's right. The Medicaid Program, block-grant it \nto the States, cut it by $810 billion over the next 10 years.\n  What does Medicaid do? Seniors, if they pay into the program, have \nMedicare when they retire. If they become disabled, if they have paid \nin the requisite amount of money, they can get disability coverage or \nsurvivors' benefits. I am talking about Medicaid, health care for low-\nincome Americans and other populations.\n  The Medicaid Program is something we instituted over half a century \nago now to tell all Americans that they are going to be able to have \nquality health care. Do you remember that debate? I remember watching \none of the debates that the Republicans were having in their \nPresidential series. The question was asked: You know we take care of \nsick people in our country. Where do they go? They can go to the \nemergency room. It costs a lot more money. But the question was asked--\nsomething about, do you just deny that? A lot of people would say just \nlet them die, leave them out on the street.\n  Is that the kind of country we want to be? If we are sick and we do \nnot have the wherewithal we cannot get health care? We moved beyond \nthat. We have moved beyond that as a society.\n  The other population is Americans with disabilities. Almost one in \nevery two Americans, almost 50 percent of Americans with disabilities \ndepend on Medicaid for access to health services and support that span \neverything from hospital to home care. Services from the Medicaid \nProgram allow our citizens with disabilities to live with dignity and \nwith purpose in their homes and in their communities. Nearly 3 million \nseniors and people with disabilities use the Medicaid Program to avoid \ncostly nursing home care. If we cut home and community-based care for \nthis group of Americans, then they would have to turn to institutional \ncare.\n  The short-term cuts, these cuts they are going to make in Medicaid, \nwill lead to longer term expenses because we know that institutional \ncare is more expensive than care at home or in the community. I guess, \nunless we just say to them: Tough luck, you are on your own. Tough \nluck. You have a disability? Cut your Medicaid. Can't live at home? Go \nlive in an institution. Oh, the institution is no longer there because \nwe cannot afford it--then I guess you have to go out on the street and \nbeg.\n  Is that what we want to see? Like many third world countries where we \nsee people with disabilities on the corners begging? Families with a \nchild with a disability out in the street begging? Is that what we \nwant? Do we want to walk down the street and see people who, through no \nfault of their own, are disabled and they are out there begging with a \ntin cup and a tin plate? Is that the kind of country we want to become?\n  To dismantle the Medicaid Program, as they would do under the Ryan \nbudget, would dismantle our commitment to quality affordable health \ncare for all. The Medicaid Program is a lifeline to hundreds of \nthousands of middle-class families--yes, middle-class families, working \nfamilies who have children with lifelong disabilities such as Down \nsyndrome or autism. Instead of cutting these families off from a \ncritical lifeline, we should be strengthening the long-term viability \nof this program, Medicaid, reassuring these families that America is \nnot going to turn its back on them when they need help the most.\n  You do not have to take my word for it about shredding this compact. \nI have said many times that we have a unique American social contract, \na compact that evolved over our march from a society in which we had \nchild labor,\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\nwhich, if people were older and poor, they went to the county home; \nwhere children died in infancy; where, if people were disabled, they \nwere put in dark places.\n  We evolved a social contract. We said, basically, in America we are \ngoing to provide a ladder of opportunity or ramp of opportunity. We are \ngoing to make sure we take care that we educate our young and take care \nof our elderly, a social safety net.\n  Here is the former Reagan economic adviser, Mr. Bruce Bartlett. Here \nis what he said:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them.\n\n  Then again, we don't have to take those words. I think the bishops \nhad something to say about that when the bishops said the Ryan budget \nfails the moral test. The Nation's Catholic bishops reiterated their \ndemand that the Federal budget protect the poor and said the GOP \nmeasure ``fails to meet these moral criteria.'' That is the Ryan \nbudget.\n  At the centerpiece of the Ryan budget is its promise to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act or ObamaCare. Again, once we get past this \npolitical theater and look at what repeal of the Affordable Care Act or \nObamaCare would actually mean, it is not a very pretty picture. Repeal \nwould reopen the Medicare prescription doughnut hole, requiring seniors \nto pay about $600 more per year on average for prescription drugs.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, about 86 million \nAmericans received at least one free preventive service in 2011 and \nalmost 1 million Iowans received at least one free prevention service \nin 2011. That would be repealed, and then they would be charged. \nAmericans now get services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and other \ncancer screenings. Eighty-six million Americans received free \npreventive services. This is in keeping with ObamaCare's goal that \nchanges from a sick care society to a health care society. Rather than \nfocusing all of our attention and money on emergency room care or when \npeople get the sickest, we start to move it more upfront to preventive \ncare. We would get to people early and prevent illness. We would keep \npeople healthy and out of the hospital in the first place.\n  The Ryan budget shreds all of that. It is back to the old system we \nalways had--no preventive care. When someone gets sick, they go to the \nemergency room, and that is busting us as a country. That is breaking \nour budget. We have to put more into prevention.\n  Mr. President, your mother was right, an ounce of prevention is worth \na pound of cure. I don't know why we have not learned that. We did \nlearn it. We put that in ObamaCare.\n  The Ryan budget says, no, we want to get rid of that. The repeal of \nObamaCare would allow insurance companies to deny people coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition. Nearly half of Americans have some \nform of a preexisting health condition, and right now the Affordable \nCare Act covers all children. In 2014--just 1 year and a little over 2 \nmonths from now--everyone will be covered even if they have a \npreexisting condition.\n  This is Eleanor Pierce from Cedar Falls, IA. She was denied health \ninsurance, when she lost her job, because of a preexisting condition of \nhigh blood pressure. Without coverage, she racked up $60,000 in medical \ndebts. If you repeal ObamaCare, more than 30 million people would be \ndenied access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance. It \nwould make insured Americans pay more than tens of billions of dollars \nof uncompensated care when they show up in emergency rooms.\n  Actually, repealing ObamaCare would cost American families an average \nof over $1,100 extra in premiums annually right now that we are paying \nfor uncompensated care when people show up in an emergency room. Repeal \nwould kick more than 3 million young people off their parents' policy.\n  That hurts people like Emily Schlichting. She testified at one of our \nhearings. She is a young woman from Omaha. She said that ``young people \nare the future of this country and we are the most affected by reform. \nWe are the generation that is most uninsured. We need the Affordable \nCare Act because it is literally an investment in the future of this \ncountry.''\n  She suffers from a rare autoimmune disorder. In the bad old days, \nthat made her uninsurable. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act or \nObamaCare, she is now covered under her parents' policy until age 26. \nGuess what. In 2014 her preexisting condition will mean nothing. She \nwill be able to get affordable health insurance. The Ryan budget says, \nsorry, Emily, you are on your own.\n  These are just a few of the ways in which the Ryan plan to repeal \nObamaCare would drag us backward to the bad old days when insurance \ncompanies were in the driver's seat and millions of Americans were one \nillness away from bankruptcy.\n  Over the last few weeks, Governor Romney and Representative Ryan have \nbeen saying that the President's health reform robs Medicare. I heard \nthat he said that in Florida last night. I don't know how else to say \nthis, but that is totally false. That is untrue. First of all, \nnonpartisan economists have certified that the President's health care \nplan or ObamaCare has strengthened the Medicare Program and extends its \nsolvency by 8 years. If we were robbing the Medicare Program, how could \nit extend its solvency by 8 more years?\n  The Affordable Care Act doesn't rob Medicare, it makes the program \nmore efficient and more reliable. It saves $700 billion, not from \nbeneficiaries, not from recipients who are on Medicare, but from \noverpayments to private insurance companies, providers, \npharmaceuticals. It cracks down on fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  What is interesting is that the Ryan budget has exactly the same \nsavings in his budget as ObamaCare has in the plan we passed here. It \nis the same and exact to the dollar. It is written the same way. As \nPresident Clinton said: ``You gotta give [him] one thing--it takes some \nbrass to attack a guy for doing what you did.'' Ryan put in his budget \nexactly what we had in ObamaCare, and now they are attacking President \nObama for what they have in their budget. Go figure. In both of his \nbudget proposals, Mr. Ryan keeps all of the Affordable Care Act's \nmedical improvements that we put in the Affordable Care Act.\n  I heard Mr. Romney in Florida last night attacking President Obama \nfor doing what Mr. Romney said was marvelous about Mr. Ryan's budget. \nIn short, Mr. Ryan's Medicare plan would end Medicare.\n  There is something else that I hear them say all the time. They say \nthey are going to protect everyone over age 55. Under the Ryan plan he \nsays they are going to go to this voucher care, but anyone over age 55 \nis protected. I have to ask: Protected from what? I mean, if it is such \na good deal, why don't we do it for everybody? Yet Mr. Ryan and Mr. \nRomney say, no, everyone over age 55 has the same Medicare system and \nthey don't get the voucher program. It is only for those under age 55. \nThere must be something wrong with it then. If it is so darn good, why \ndon't they put everybody in there right away? Conversely, if they are \nprotecting everyone over age 55, why don't they protect everyone under \nage 55? Got it? If they are aged 55 and over they are unprotected. Put \nthem on a voucher program. That is the dirty little secret they are not \ntelling us.\n  Again, by repealing the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, 439,000 Iowa \nseniors would be forced onto these vouchers, 60,000 Iowa seniors would \nbe forced back into the doughnut hole and paying more money for their \ndrugs, and 400,000 Iowa seniors would pay for preventive services that \nthey now get at no cost. More than 30 million people will be denied \ncoverage under the Ryan budget. ObamaCare insures more than 94 percent \nof all Americans. That is what would happen; they would be denied \ncoverage.\n  I will close with this: The bottom line is President Obama and \nObamaCare protects Medicare. It keeps it solvent. It keeps everyone \ncovered. The Ryan budget shreds the social safety net for Medicaid and \ndestroys Medicare by turning it into a voucher system. ObamaCare \nprotects Americans from insurance company abuses, expands coverage, \nincreases the quality of care, shifts more into prevention and keeping \npeople healthy. The Ryan budget does away with all of that and would \ndrag us backward to the bad old days.\n  When we look at the Ryan budget--or the Romney-Ryan budget, since Mr.\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nRomney called it marvelous--we have to shake our heads in disbelief \nthat they would take America back that far after we have come so far in \ncovering people and getting rid of preexisting condition clauses. \nObamaCare takes off caps on lifetime coverage for those who have a \nserious illness so they don't go bankrupt. ObamaCare makes sure kids in \nAmerica can stay on their parents' policies. We don't want to go back, \nand that is why this Ryan budget must be totally defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Harkin, for his remarks. I certainly agree with him. I want to \namplify a point Senator Harkin made. There was a frightening story in \nthe New York Times today. I don't know that people have digested it, \nbut the headline is ``Life Spans Shrink for Least-Educated Whites in \nthe U.S.''\n  Generally speaking, the trend for life expectancy in the United \nStates, and all over the world, has been going up. The goal of a good \nsociety and a strong health care system is to see that people live \nlonger, healthier, and happier lives, but as a result of the \ndevastating attacks in a variety of ways on the working class of this \ncountry, over a period of years--not just starting yesterday--this is \nwhere we are. Let me quote from this article. I hope people hear this \nbecause this is shocking stuff. I quote:\n\n       The steepest declines were for white women without a high \n     school diploma, who lost five years of life between 1990 and \n     2008.\n\n  Their life expectancy went down by 5 years. This is astronomical. \nGoing back to the article, it says:\n\n       S. Jay Olshansky, a public health professor at the \n     University of Illinois at Chicago and the lead investigator \n     on the study, published last month in Health Affairs.\n\n  What happened is between 1990 and 2008--an 18-year period--life \nexpectancy for white women without a high school diploma declined by 5 \nyears.\n  The article states:\n\n       White men lacking a high school diploma lost 3 years of \n     life. Life expectancy for both blacks and Hispanics of the \n     same education level rose, the data showed. But Blacks \n     overall do not live as long as whites, while Hispanics live \n     longer than both whites and blacks.\n\n  So let's digest what that means. As chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPrimary Health and Aging, last year we held a hearing entitled \n``Poverty as a Death Sentence.'' What that hearing pointed out is that \npeople who are in the top 20 percent live, as I recall, about 6 years \nlonger than people in the bottom 20 percent. But what new evidence is \nsuggesting is that people without a high school degree--the least \neducated people in America and often the poorest people in America--we \nare now seeing a significant decline in the life expectancies of both \nmen and women. This is moving in exactly the wrong direction.\n  The authors of the study are not exactly sure why this is taking \nplace. Many low-income, uneducated people are using drugs, cutting \nshort their lives. Lack of health care is certainly one of the reasons. \nMore and more low-income people can't access health care, which is why \nit is so important that we defeat the Romney-Ryan effort to devastate, \nas Senator Harkin just said, Medicaid and throw millions and millions \nof people off health insurance. If life expectancy for low-income \npeople is now going down, think of what it will mean if we throw \nmillions more off Medicaid. It is a death sentence.\n  I also wish to say a word on the issue of Social Security, and I wish \nto thank the Presiding Officer and Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nBegich for joining me yesterday in releasing a letter which had 29 \nsignatures on it from Members of the Senate, and that letter was pretty \nsimple. What it said is that Social Security has not added a nickel to \nthe deficit because Social Security, of course, is funded by the \npayroll tax. It said Social Security has a $2.7 trillion surplus and \ncan pay out all the benefits to eligible Americans over the next 21 \nyears. So it is absolutely wrong and bad public policy to be talking \nabout cutting Social Security within the context of deficit reduction \nwhen Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.\n  The reason we are in a deficit situation in a significant way--the \nreason we have gone a very long way in the wrong direction since \nJanuary 2001 when Bill Clinton left office with a $236 billion \nsurplus--has nothing to do with Social Security. It has everything to \ndo with Bush and those people who voted for two wars and forgot to pay \nfor them, thereby adding to the deficit; those people who gave huge tax \nbreaks, much of it going to the richest people in this country, forgot \nto pay for it; passed the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and \nforgot to pay for it; and a recession caused by Wall Street which \nresulted in lower revenue coming into the Federal Government. Those are \nthe reasons why we are in a deficit, not because of Social Security.\n  I understand Republicans want to cut Social Security. That is what \nthey do. They are not very sympathetic to Social Security. They have \nopposed Social Security for years. They don't believe the government \nshould be involved in retirement security. They want to balance the \nbudget on the backs of the elderly, the sick, the children and the poor \nand give tax breaks to the rich. I understand that. More and more \nAmericans understand that.\n  But I will tell my colleagues what I am concerned about. I am \nconcerned about President Obama. Four years ago, the President was very \nclear on this issue. When the President was running for election \nagainst Senator McCain, this is what he told AARP and, ironically, he \njust spoke to AARP, I believe it was today. So 4 years ago, same venue. \nThis is what he said 4 years ago:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear: I will not do either.\n\n  Candidate Barack Obama said that 4 years ago. Barack Obama is in the \nWhite House now.\n  We have people such as billionaire Pete Peterson, who has been \npushing deficit reduction on the backs of working people for years now. \nHe has been spending huge amounts of money to make sure we do deficit \nreduction not by asking the wealthiest people in this country to pay \ntheir fair share but by balancing the budget on the backs of the \nelderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. These guys have come up \nwith a strategy called the chained CPI.\n  Nobody in America outside Capitol Hill knows what the chained CPI is. \nIt is a new formulation as to how we determine cost-of-living \nadjustments--COLAs--for seniors. What these economists have decided--\nthese rightwing economists--COLAs today are formulated in a way that \nare too generous--too generous for America's seniors and for disabled \nveterans. They want to reformulate how we come up with these COLAs. If \nthey get their way--and I have a great deal of fear that unless some of \nus stop them, unless the American people stop them, they will, in fact, \nget their way--what this will mean is that if a person is 65 years of \nage today, by the time they are 75, they will lose about $560 a year in \ntheir benefits. If a person is 65 years of age today, in 20 years, when \nthat person is 85, they will lose $1,000 a year.\n  Let me be very clear. I do not believe we should move to a deficit \nreduction on the backs of a senior citizen living on $14,000 or $15,000 \na year and take $1,000 away from them and then get on the floor of the \nSenate and talk about how we have to give more tax breaks to \nbillionaires. I think that is not only morally inexcusable, I think it \nis bad economics.\n  While we are talking about this so-called chained CPI which will cut \nbenefits for seniors, we are also talking about cutting VA benefits for \ndisabled veterans. So I want to hear all these tough guys here who \nthink we should balance the budget on the backs of the elderly and the \nchildren, let them get up here and tell us why, when somebody fought in \na war to defend the United States--maybe they lost their legs or their \neyes or their arms--they want to cut their benefits and then they want \nto give tax breaks to billionaires.\n  The American people don't want to do that. So I think we have to get \non the phones right now. We have to call our Senators and we have to \ncall Members of the House and we have to call President Obama: Mr. \nPresident, 4 years ago you told us you weren't going to cut Social \nSecurity. Is that still your position? Four years ago, you came up with \nan idea that is, in fact,\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nexactly the right idea. You made the point that multimillionaires are \ncontributing the same amount of money into the Social Security trust \nfund as somebody making $110,000, and 4 years ago you made the point \nthat if we lift that cap--and we don't have to start at $110,000; we \ncan go up to $250,000--if we lift that cap above $250,000, we could \nbring in enough revenue to fund Social Security for the next 75 years. \nThat was your position, Mr. President, 4 years ago. Is that your \nposition today? Are you going to stand up to the Republicans and the \nWall Street folks who want us to cut Social Security?\n\n  That is where we are right now.\n  My last point I wish to make is on the much discussed remarks of \nGovernor Romney from the video released recently that has gone all over \nthe Internet. There is a lot that can be said about it, and I suspect \neverybody has said a lot. I just want to pick up on one point. I feel \nstrongly about this point because I am the son of a working-class \nfamily--of a father who never made a lot of money but worked hard his \nentire life and of a mother who raised her kids as best she could. So I \ntake this kind of personally.\n  This is what Mr. Romney said in connection with the famous 47 percent \nof the people who don't pay taxes, which is not true, of course. As we \nknow, they pay Social Security taxes and gasoline taxes, Medicare \ntaxes. But be that as it may, that is not the issue I want to get to.\n  This is what Mr. Romney said:\n\n       My job is not to worry about those people. I will never \n     convince them they should take personal responsibility and \n     care for their lives.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       I will never convince them they should take personal \n     responsibility and care for their lives.\n\n  He was talking about my parents. He was talking about the parents of \nmillions of people who worked hard their whole lives who don't need \nadvice from a multimillionaire who went to elite schools and had all \nthe money and privileges his family could provide him. We don't need \nadvice from him to families who have worked and struggled their whole \nlives to, in fact, take personal responsibility to make sure their kids \ndid well. That is an incredibly arrogant statement from a guy \nsurrounded by money, speaking to millionaires, who should not be making \nthat statement.\n  People on Social Security, people on Medicare, in many cases, have \nworked their entire lives, have done the best they could to provide for \ntheir kids, have seen their kids go to college. Many of the people on \nSocial Security, Medicare have fought in wars defending this country. \nThey do not need advice from a multimillionaire about how they should \ntake personal responsibility for their lives. That is an insulting \nremark and it would become Governor Romney to apologize for that \nremark.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Might I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). There is no controlled time. The \nSenator may consume as much time as he wishes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have to say I always enjoy my colleague from \nVermont. He is a very sincere and dedicated man and I like him. There \nis no use kidding about it; you can't help but like him, in my eyes. \nBut I don't know any Republican Senator who wants to cut Social \nSecurity. They want to save Social Security. I don't know anybody who \nwants to cut Medicare or Medicaid. We want to save Medicare and \nMedicaid. Anybody in their right mind who looks at this knows we have \nto do some things and change some things or we are not going to have \nMedicare and Medicaid for our people and we will not have Social \nSecurity continue.\n  With regard to Mitt Romney, yes, he may not have articulated his \nthoughts as well as he may have wished. But there is no way in this \nworld Mitt Romney meant his comments to be taken the way they have been \ntaken by the left in this country. All he is saying is there are too \nmany people riding in the wagon and not enough people pulling the wagon \nand we are going to have to get jobs for those who should be outside \nthe wagon, pulling the wagon, and help them to have the self-esteem \nthat comes from working. That is what the whole welfare bill of 1996 \nwas all about, in having a work requirement: We are going to help you, \nwe are going to subsidize you, we are going to give you job training, \nbut after a certain period of time, if you don't have a job, you are \noff the dole. Literally two-thirds, almost two-thirds of the people who \nhave been on the dole, some for generations, went to work after \nincentives were realigned through Republican welfare reform. That is \nthe Republican approach, to get people back to work, to provide \nefficient incentives, and to get this economy moving again; not to hurt \nanybody. So these things can be exaggerated to a point where sometimes \nit becomes confusing to the American people, and that is not right \neither.\n  I know Mitt Romney. I know how he cares for people. I know what he \ndid when he was a bishop in the LDS Church, in the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. I was a bishop when I was running for \nSenate, and I have to tell my colleagues I spent at least 30 hours a \nweek of my own time and expense, because there is no paid clergy in the \nLDS faith, other than the general authorities and those are very few \npeople, and we all volunteer our time. We help people from every walk \nof life.\n\n\n                 Fiscal History of the 1990s and 2000s\n\n  Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some very important \nthings that are related to what I have just been saying.\n  There has been much discussion by President Obama about the source of \nour current economic and fiscal challenges. The President seems to \nsuggest we could easily return to the prosperity of the 1990s by \nadopting the policies of President Clinton, particularly by raising \ntaxes to the level they were during his Presidency. At the recent \nDemocratic National Convention, President Clinton himself made a \nsimilar argument. But the positive economic and fiscal history of the \n1990s was not owing to higher taxes, and the economic and fiscal \nchallenges we face today--in particular, our $16 trillion national debt \nand exploding entitlement spending programs--cannot be fixed by higher \ntax rates.\n  During his convention speech, President Clinton claimed that \nPresident Obama inherited a damaged economy, put a floor under the \ncrash, began the road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a \nmodern, well-balanced economy. Tell that to the 12.5 million unemployed \nAmericans who continue to struggle with unemployment. Tell that to \nAmericans who have been suffering through unemployment rates above 8 \npercent for 43 consecutive months. Explain to Americans how \nredistribution, massive expansion of refundable tax credits, ballooned \ntransfer payments, and an interventionist Federal Reserve represent a \nfoundation for future growth of the economy. Explain how this economy \nis ``well balanced'' when government spending represents as much as 25 \npercent of GDP, debt is higher than an entire year's worth of the \noutput of the economy, and we have an activist Federal Reserve that has \nincreased its balance sheet by well over $1 trillion.\n  President Clinton does admit that, under President Obama, we are not \nwhere we need to be. So, instead, he asks whether we are better off \nthan when President Obama took office, and he answers in the \naffirmative. Putting aside the rhetoric and spin and considering the \nfacts, this is a dubious claim at best.\n  Relative to the beginning of 2009 when President Obama took office, \njobs are down by 261,000 and unemployment remains above 8 percent. But \nwait. Democrats say the President cannot be held responsible for bad \nthings that happened during his Presidency; those things were inherited \nor due to Europe or caused by uncontrollable forces. All right, then. \nLet's look at the President's jobs record after the end of the \nrecession, which the National Bureau of Economic Research says was June \nof 2009. Since then, job growth under President Obama has been only \n73,600 jobs per month on average--far too weak to move the unemployment \nrate below 8 percent.\n  Democrats say the only reason we do not have more jobs is because \nRepublicans will not agree to more Keynesian stimulus--never mind that \nthe previous dose, which cost over $800 billion\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nand was promised to deliver unemployment below 8 percent, failed to get \nunemployment down.\n  Remember those promised shovel-ready jobs that became a source of \namusement to the President? Remember the promised infrastructure? \nAmericans should ask themselves where all those things are. Where are \nthe jobs? Well, the President makes claims of saving millions of jobs \nbecause of stimulus magic. And the Federal Reserve claims millions of \njobs saved from its so-called quantitative easing. There you have it. \nThe President's foundation of well-balanced economic growth rests on \ndebt-financed Keynesian stimulus and Federal Reserve stimulus.\n  Absent anything but a dismal record on jobs, President Obama has \ndecided to try to run on President Clinton's record. So let's consider \nPresident Clinton's rose-colored nostalgia--a revisionist history \nadopted by President Obama and his surrogates.\n  President Clinton's view goes like this: I came into office with a \nweak economy. I raised taxes. The economy boomed.\n  President Clinton's depiction of the roaring 1990s is missing a few \nchapters. In his first years in office, Democrats controlled Congress. \nHe and the Democrats raised income taxes and gas taxes. He tried to \nimpose a Btu energy tax, attempted a government takeover of health \ncare--known as HillaryCare and proposed a $31 billion stimulus while \nputting off welfare reform.\n  The first few years of the Clinton Presidency can fairly be \ncharacterized as prioritizing tax-and-spend economic policy. But \nHillaryCare failed, and American voters decided to make some changes. \nThey faced uncertainty over taxes, health care, energy costs, deficits, \nand runaway government spending. After 2 years of complete Democratic \ncontrol of Washington, American voters decided in 1994 that Republican \ncontrol of the Senate and House was desirable.\n  Does this sound familiar? A new Democrat in the White House, complete \nDemocratic control of Congress, prioritizing higher taxes, a government \ntakeover of the Nation's health care system, and more spending, \nfollowed by a popular uprising that gave some Republican balance in \nCongress. It was the first Republican Congress in over 40 years.\n  But in contrast to President Obama's refusal to heed the message of \nthe 2010 election, President Clinton listened to the American people \nand moved to the political center. He embraced a Republican goal of a \nbalanced budget and, after two vetoes, signed GOP welfare reform \nlegislation shortly before the 1996 election. In 1996 President Clinton \nwas reelected, but Republicans retained control of Congress.\n  Now, President Obama claims these were the good old days because \nPresident Clinton raised taxes. Let's consider that tax landscape. \nPresident Clinton did raise the top income tax rate in 1993, and \nDemocrats credit that increase for shrinking the deficit and unleashing \nfuture economic growth. However, he also agreed with Republicans in \n1997 to cut the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent from 28 percent, \nwhich contributed to revenue and economic growth. I know because it was \nthe Hatch-Lieberman bill that they followed in doing that. Joe \nLieberman had the guts to stand up on that issue, as did I, and it \nhappened. The Democrats said we would lose revenues. The revenues went \nup because people did not feel gouged anymore. Funny how that chapter \ngets left out of the Democrats' 1990s story.\n  In 2000 President Clinton left office with Federal receipts measuring \n20.6 percent of GDP--well above the 17.5 percent seen in 1992 before he \ntook office. But those receipts were boosted by capital gains \nrealizations associated with the Internet stock bubble that formed \ntoward the end of the Clinton Presidency.\n  But even more notable and something Democrats do not discuss in \nrelation to the Clinton Presidency is that he left office with Federal \noutlays measuring 18.2 percent of GDP--significantly below the 22.1 \npercent seen in 1992 before Clinton took office. Significant reductions \nin Federal outlays as a share of GDP occurred once Republicans gained \ncontrol of the Congress. In contrast, President Obama has presided over \nthe largest spending spree since World War II, with outlays as high as \n25.2 percent of the entire economy--something that has not happened \nsince the years surrounding World War II.\n  In his 1996 State of the Union speech, President Clinton took credit \nfor budget improvements and spending restraint imposed by Republicans \nin Congress. He famously stated that the era of big government is over. \nBut in a nod to the Republicans' role in containing the budget, in that \nsame speech, he said: ``I compliment the Republican leadership and \nmembership for the energy and determination you have brought to this \ntask of balancing the budget.'' Compare that to the sentiment of \nPresident Obama: We tried it their way, and it did not work.\n\n  President Obama and those Democrats who embrace the history of the \n1990s also conveniently neglect to give any credit to Ronald Reagan, \nwhose ending of the Cold War led to a peace dividend which helped allow \nPresident Clinton to curtail growth in Federal defense outlays.\n  In summary, the Democratic nostalgia for the 1990s is based on a very \nlimited recollection of events. They see that Clinton raised taxes, the \neconomy grew, and the budget improved. Apparently, correlation is all \nthat is necessary to establish causality in their world, particularly \nwhen it works in their favor.\n  What also gets left out of the standard Democratic history is a \nstock-price bubble that was actually the basis of much of the growth in \nthe 1990s. So let's consider the Clinton bubble further and ask what it \ncould possibly mean for the recent financial crisis.\n  One of the charges levied by President Clinton, which echoes a \nfamiliar Democratic talking point, is that Americans should be wary of \nRepublicans because we champion deregulation that ``got us into this \nmess.'' But who generated the mess? The mess was a devastating \nfinancial crisis, and who sowed the seeds of that crisis?\n  First, consider the significant financial deregulation under the Bush \nadministration. The fact is there was not any. So where did the \nderegulation in finance come from? Whose policies promoted financial \nmarkets prone to bubbles and irrational exuberance and bailouts?\n  It was under President Clinton's watch that warnings were ignored \nabout the riskiness of derivatives. It was under his watch that risky \nderivatives led to the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital \nManagement--or LTCM and to an eventual bailout arranged by the Fed. It \nwas under his watch that the Fed left market participants with a belief \nthat should there be significant market turbulence, the Fed would be \nthere to bail them out. It was under his watch that the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act was signed into law, which many Democrats believe \ncontributed to the crisis by repealing part of the Glass-Steagall Act \nof 1933. I think that they misunderstand the financial crisis by making \nthat claim, but since they and President Obama appear to believe it, \nthrough their promotion of the so-called Volker rule, then the \nderegulation they decry came under Clinton.\n  As a basis for strong fundamental growth in the economy, President \nClinton's stock bubble was lacking, and numerous companies crashed. A \nbursting stock bubble, along with corporate accounting scandals, which \nincluded the Enron debacle, left a mess for President Bush, who, by the \nway, did not whine about it for 4 straight years.\n  It was under President Clinton's watch that significant growth began \nin risky subprime mortgage lending, which ended up at the heart of the \nrecent financial crisis. And warnings were ignored--even the warning by \nthe Clinton-appointed Federal Reserve official Edward Gramlich. \nClinton's presidency pushed financial deregulation, and it showed \ninattention to the beginnings of speculative excesses in housing and \nmortgage markets.\n  The financial crisis was indeed severe. Seeds of the crisis were sown \nduring President Clinton's Presidency and then nurtured by many years \nof regulatory inattention. Failure of regulators to do their job during \nthe Bush administration has nothing to do with deregulation. There was \nno deregulation. There were plenty of regulations to go around, but the \nregulators failed to use their authority as bubbles and irrational \nexuberance was tolerated by\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nthe unaccountable regulators. To say that Republican deregulation \ncaused the recent crisis is simply false.\n  We have faced crises before. President Obama is not unique in this \nrespect. What is unique is how poorly he has handled our economic and \nfiscal crisis.\n  In February 2009 President Obama said his Presidency would be a \n``one-term proposition'' if the economy did not recover within 3 years. \nWell, it has been over 3 years and the economy has not recovered; \ntherefore, by the President's own metric, his administration should be \na one-time proposition. No, he wants 4 more years to do more of the \nsame.\n  The President has no plan.\n  The President claims to want to get our deficit under control by \nraising taxes on the wealthy and keeping the tax burden on middle-class \nAmericans where it is. But the President's tax proposals do not work, \nas we learned from his Buffett tax, which fell over $800 billion short \nof his plan to use the tax to pay for a long-term alternative minimum \ntax patch. The unpleasant fact facing the President is that there \nsimply is not enough revenue from taxing the so-called rich to fill his \ndesires of permanently larger government.\n  Taxing business owners who the President thinks are undeserving of \ntheir success will simply not pay for his redistribution dreams. Of \ncourse, contrary to President Obama's disdain for business, Americans \nwho own and operate businesses did build them, and they also paid \ntaxes, which built the roads and bridges they use. And make no mistake, \nbusiness owners and American workers did build America. They did build \nit.\n  Mr. President, let me go back just a little bit here. I made the \ncomment, with regard to all of this media criticism of Governor Romney, \nthat he was inarticulate in a private meeting, where no press was \ninvited, and he is the first to admit that.\n  He certainly has tried to explain himself. But he is right. He is \nright. There are at least 47 percent of Americans who do not pay a \nnickel or a penny of income taxes. The standard answer by my friends on \nthe other side is, well, they pay payroll taxes. Well, everyone does \nthat. But those are unlike income taxes. With payroll taxes, workers \npay into Social Security and Disability Insurance and the like. Which \nis to say, they pay in; but they also receive benefits. To equate the \npayroll tax system with the income tax system is simply misleading.\n  But in the income tax system, 23 million or so people get refundable \ntax credits which are more than they pay in payroll taxes, and a little \nless than 16 million get refundable tax credits that are more than they \nand their employers pay in payroll taxes.\n  Now, do Republicans want to tax the truly poor? Heavens no. This is a \ngreat country. We can take care of the truly poor. The question is, Are \nall of those in the--according to Joint Tax Committee, recently the \nbottom 51 percent did not pay any income taxes--are all of those in the \ntruly poor category? The answer is no.\n  Well, what does Governor Romney mean? He means that, as I said at the \nbeginning, there are too many people who are riding in the wagon and \nnot enough pulling. Many people simply have no skin in the game in the \nincome tax system, which means they really don't care much if income \ntaxes on others are raised. And it is not their fault in many cases, \nexcept there are millions who will not find a job in the Obama economy, \nor they just become discouraged given the bleak labor market. I do not \nblame them, with the economy, but they ought to be looking for jobs \nanyway. I would do anything if it were me. I would do anything to be \nable to support my family other than be on Federal largesse. But that \nis the way it is today.\n  Governor Romney's goal in this life is to pull us out of this mess, \nget spending down to no more than 20 percent of the GDP, which would be \na remarkable downturn in spending compared to what we have today, and \nalso to get people to work, get them to where they have the self-esteem \nthat comes from working, which we did on welfare reform in 1996. I \nworked hard on that bill, as did so many others at that time. Give them \nthe self-esteem that comes from supporting themselves. That is what he \nmeant. That is what is meant here. He will create jobs, and a vibrant \neconomy where all workers prosper and can find work.\n  Frankly, let's just be honest, the mainstream media is not for \nGovernor Romney. We all know that. Anybody with brains knows that. All \nyou have to do is watch it. And that is the way it has been here ever \nsince I have been in the Congress. Frankly, they are not going to treat \nGovernor Romney fairly. But I will tell you this: Mitt Romney will put \nAmerica to work. He knows how to do it. This man has been successful in \neverything he has ever undertaken to do. He does not need this job as \nPresident, but he is running because he knows this country is in \ntrouble. He knows it is not following good economic practices. He knows \nthis administration is a disaster from a jobs standpoint, among other \nthings. He could have the most lovely life, and he is taking this kind \nof unmitigated barrage of assaults in trying to do that which he knows \nis right for this country.\n  I think we ought to be more fair in these Presidential elections. I \nwish the media was split 50/50. It is not. Everybody knows it. I care a \ngreat deal for my friends in the media, but there is no one with brains \nwho does not understand that especially the mainstream media right here \nin Washington, DC, New York, Los Angeles, et cetera, is heavily stacked \nin favor of President Obama.\n  I like President Obama too. I have known him as a Senator. I have \nknown him as a friend. I have known him as a President. And what I am \nsaying here is that he has not done the job. I do not believe he is \ngoing to do the job. I do not think he has the background to do the \njob, and for us to not put somebody who does in there may be \ncatastrophic for the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my friend \nfrom Alabama and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, let me say from the outset that this \nSenate and this Nation are profoundly fortunate to have had the \nservices of Senator Orrin Hatch for decades and decades. The speech he \njust delivered to this body was profound in so many ways and true in so \nmany ways. It was made at 10 minutes til 6 on a Friday night when \nperhaps Americans are looking elsewhere, but just so much of what the \nSenator said is absolutely the truth, and our country needs to hear it. \nI appreciate him coming and delivering it in such a talented way.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend and colleague. I really appreciate it. I \nenjoy serving with the Senator, as I do with everybody in this body.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Wicker just talked for a minute about this. \nWhat does the Senator think? Would it be great to have the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee be named Senator Orrin Hatch?\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, it would be. I think that with the leadership of \npeople such as Senator Hatch, we would not be ignoring what we have out \nthere facing us in America today, and that is nothing less than a \nfinancial crisis. The Senator from Utah is correct. The President of \nthe United States is doing everything he can to change the subject from \nthe central issue of our faltering economy. Yet the mainstream media is \nout there playing trivial pursuit, talking about everything that is not \nimportant, and that is a distraction. But you just can't get around the \nfacts. The facts are these: We have a $16 trillion staggering debt in \nthis country. This government has added $6 trillion in 3\\1/2\\ short \nyears. Just the facts. You can't get around it.\n  You also can't get around these absolute truths: We have had no \nappropriations bills come out of this Senate this year. Our Republican \nfriends in the House--it is a different story. They have done their \nwork, and they passed product after product, as they are supposed to \ndo. And my hat is off to the chair, the gentleman from Kentucky, \nChairman Rogers, for getting the appropriations bills done. We have not \ndone that in this Democrat-led Senate. We have not passed a defense \nbill--first time in half a century that we will\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\nhave gone through a whole session and not passed a defense bill, at a \ntime when we have troops at war, troops in harm's way. Our men and \nwomen are putting themselves at risk and fighting and dying. We do not \nhave a defense bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is amazing. We do not have a defense bill. The \nSenator serves on the Armed Services Committee, as I do. It came out of \ncommittee unanimously, bipartisan vote, and for some reason, the \nDemocratic leadership has failed to bring the bill up to the floor for \nthe first time in 50 years. Is that not amazing?\n  Mr. WICKER. No question about it. It does not make me comfortable to \npoint fingers, but there is no getting around the fact that there is \none person on this planet who can call up a bill before this Senate; \nthat is, the majority leader of the Senate. He has not brought up the \ndefense bill.\n  We also do not have a budget resolution. Again, our friends in the \nHouse, the Republicans in the House, under Speaker Boehner, have during \nthe 2 years of their stewardship brought budget resolutions to the \nfloor, passed them, sent them over here, only to be ignored.\n  The President has submitted budgets--did not get a single vote in the \nHouse of Representatives, did not get a single vote when we called it \nup as sort of a test vote here in the Senate. But this Senate, under \nthe leadership of the Democratic majority, has not followed the statute \nthat says you bring a budget resolution up every year--has not done it. \nWe are into our fourth year now.\n\n  Beyond that, they do not have a budget deficit reduction plan. It is \none thing to have a resolution that could say anything, but what the \nAmerican people need, what our future generations are crying out for is \na plan to reduce this debt.\n  I look forward to and hope to see the day when my friend from Alabama \nis chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I would ask him to assure \neveryone within the sound of our voices today that under his leadership \nas chairman of the Budget Committee, we will see a budget resolution \nbrought to the floor and debated according to statute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Wicker asked a very good question, and every \nAmerican needs to be thinking about that. I have given a lot of thought \nto it. We have not had a budget in 3 years--1,241 days. We have not had \na budget passed on the floor of this Senate. They did not even report \none from committee this year.\n  If we are blessed by the American people--we the Republican \nSenators--and have a majority in this body and if I am honored to have \nthe opportunity to lead the Budget Committee, we will have a budget. \nFailure is not an option. It cannot be that we will not comply with the \nlaw. But more than that, Senator Wicker, we have to have a plan to get \nus off the course to financial disaster, and the budget is the way you \nlay out that plan.\n  Does the Senator not agree that the difficulty our Democratic \ncolleagues had is that anything they thought they could agree on and \nbring forth would not be popular with the American people? And they did \nnot want to subject themselves to having it debated on the floor and \nhaving a vote on amendments, as the Budget Act allows, even though you \ncan pass a budget with a simple majority, cannot be filibustered?\n  I guess what I will ask the Senator, when you do not write a budget \nbecause you cannot agree or are unwilling to step forward with a plan, \nwhat you are really doing is failing to provide leadership. We were \nelected to lead, to have a plan that we are willing to announce to try \nto get us on the right course, a budget. Would the Senator not agree to \nsort of have a plan to deal with the crisis we are facing? We have not \nseen one in this body.\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, it is one of our basic responsibilities. As I said, \nthe discretionary part of it is the appropriations bills. Not one \nsingle appropriations bill has cleared this Senate during 2012. And \nyes, indeed, at a time when we are running a debt of $6 trillion, when \nwe are seeing our friends and allies across the ocean teetering on the \nbrink, we are seeing all the warning signs.\n  We have time in this Capitol, in this Capital City, the shining city \non the hill, to be an example to the world.\n  I can only answer the Senator's question by saying that the \nPresident's budget was so unpopular it did not get a single vote. There \nis not one single--even the most leftwing, left-leaning Senator would \nnot step forward and embrace that budget. I can only assume that what \nthey would have suggested would have been very much like that.\n  But when you are in the majority, you have a responsibility to lead. \nWe all have a responsibility to lead, but in particular, when you are \nthe only vehicle for bringing bills to the floor, you have a \nresponsibility to lead in a time of crisis. That is what we have been \nlacking here in the Senate.\n  Of course, we do have the Federal Reserve, and the leader of the \nFederal Reserve announced the other day that he is going to print $40 \nbillion extra each month. Now, that is his solution. I would counsel \nagainst that. I think most Members on this side would counsel against \nthat. But at least it is a plan. We have had no indication from the \nleader of the Senate whether they like that plan.\n  We do know this. We passed a stimulus bill over here that cost almost \n$1 trillion. Unemployment has gone up under this bill that was supposed \nto jump-start the economy. It was supposed to do two things: jump-start \nthe economy and keep the unemployment rate 8 percent or less. Of \ncourse, we know that for 42 months now, the unemployment rate has been \nover 8 percent. And the last thing the stimulus bill did was jump-start \nthe economy. It has been going downhill ever since. It is hard to put a \npretty face on this situation. Of course, the result is that a \nstaggering 23 million American citizens either do not have a job, are \nunderemployed, or have stopped looking for work.\n  In addition, of course, the President promised in 2008--the Senator \nremembers that promise--that he would cut the deficit in half by the \nend of his first term. Well, this is the end of his first term. The \ndeficit has mushroomed, not been cut in half. We are in a financial \ncrisis, and everybody on television seems to be trying to paint a rosy \npicture and avoid the subject. So I am glad to join with my friend, the \nranking member on the Budget Committee, to suggest that we will have a \nplan, as House Republicans had a specific plan, in black and white, to \naddress this unbelievable financial crisis our country faces.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, it is a challenge we have to face, and it is not \neasy. It will be a challenge and it will be difficult and it will force \nus to make difficult choices. But I feel very frustrated. We are from \nsmall towns in America. Where we grew up, if you had a tough choice to \nmake, if somebody came up with an idea and defended it, you respected \nthem, even if you didn't agree with it. If you didn't have a better \nplan, and all you did was criticize their plan, people wouldn't think \nmuch of you, would they?\n  Mr. WICKER. That is right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So what we did in this body, when the budgets were \nbrought up--they brought up the House budget--called the Ryan budget--\nand we brought up the President's budget, and Senator Toomey and others \nhad a budget, and every one of them was brought up--our Democratic \ncolleagues voted against every one of them. And not in one instance did \nthey set out before the people what they believed in, what they would \nadvocate for, what they would fight for, what they believed would fix \nthe American economy and put us on the right track. But they have \ninvested a tremendous amount of effort in attacking Congressman Ryan \nand the House budget.\n  Let me say this about that budget. Any budget is going to be subject \nto some complaint here and there, but it was historic. It would change \nthe debt course of America. It would reduce our deficit by $3.5 \ntrillion and it would create economic growth. It was designed not just \nto be a budget-cutting, frugal budget, but also to try to create growth \nand prosperity in this country and get this country moving again and \nget businesses hiring again.\n  It was a historic and good budget that would change the debt course \nof America and put us on the right path, yet all we have heard from our \ncolleagues, without offering anything\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nthemselves, is criticism of him. And I believe the House, as the \nSenator said, fulfilled their duty.\n  Mr. WICKER. I tell you what else it would do. It would tell the truth \nto the American people about what we are facing. I like what our young \nnominee for Vice President said. We have got time to fix this, but we \nneed to fix it, and we don't have much time.\n  Speaking of telling the truth, I wish to pivot, if I could, to a \nquestion that has been raised on this floor in the last couple of days \nabout this Senate's lack of compliance with the Budget Act. There is \nnot a more learned expert on the federal Budget Act of 1974 than my \nfriend from Alabama, and I would ask him to clarify, if he would, the \nstatements and misstatements and charges and countercharges that have \nbeen made about the fact there has not been a budget resolution brought \nto this floor for consideration and amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Wicker for raising this point because \nwe need to discuss this, and the American people need to ask themselves \nwho is telling the truth about this and who is accurate about this.\n  A group of us spoke--40 or more Republicans--and we expressed \nfrustration with the lack of action in this body, the likes of which we \nhave never seen perhaps in our history, with regard to not passing an \nappropriations bill. Historic research has been done, and we have not \npassed a single appropriations bill only two times: 2010 and this year, \nboth under this Democratic leadership. Those are the only times in \nhistory that no appropriations bill has passed.\n  Yesterday, however, Senator Reid used this language. It kind of hurt \nmy feelings, because I said we didn't have a budget, and I am the \nranking member of the Budget Committee. Maybe 10 or 15 Republicans \ntalked about our not having a budget, and Senator Reid said: ``It is a \nlie to say we don't have a budget.''\n  I don't know if that violates the rules of the Senate about personal \nattacks, but I try not to use that word--lie. I try not to say a \ncolleague is lying. Even if I ever would say something like that, I \nwould want to be sure I had absolute proof to back it up. And that is a \nresponsibility.\n  You know, we like Harry Reid. I consider him a friend, I really do. \nHe has always treated me fairly on the floor. But I have to say, the \nmajority leader shouldn't have said that. First of all, it is not \naccurate. For example, Senator Reid announced unequivocally that he had \nno intention of passing a budget. This is what he said last year. He \nsaid: ``There is no need to have a Democratic budget, in my opinion.''\n  It is a statutory requirement. Unfortunately, it doesn't say you go \nto jail if you don't pass one. The people are crying out for a plan to \nget out of the financial condition we are in, but he said there is no \nneed to have one, in his opinion.\n  He said at another time, ``It would be foolish for us to do a \nbudget.'' Foolish for us to do a budget. And they did not do one. There \nis no budget. So for him to say it is a lie when we say we don't have a \nbudget, well, that is inaccurate.\n  I will point out, as Senator Wicker knows, the Budget Act, the United \nStates Code, defines what a budget is. It lays out some of the things \nthat have to be a part of the budget and the process by which one is \nproduced. It has to be reported by the Budget Committee by April 1. It \nsets out the date as April 1. Then we have to have a floor vote by \nApril 15. And when it comes to the floor, the rule says we have \nunlimited amendments, with 50 hours of debate, and it can't be \nfilibustered. So 50 hours would mean about 1 week. It can be done in 6, \n7 days at most.\n  Mr. WICKER. It is the one thing that can't be filibustered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. The party with the majority, 53 Senators, \nought to be able to pass a budget. We passed a budget with 51 senators \none time. A budget allows us to control everything but Social Security. \nWe can't touch Social Security but we can deal with Medicare, Medicaid, \nfood stamps, pensions, as well as the discretionary accounts. So that \nwas all avoided.\n  My friend has been around here and in the House for a number of \nyears, but it seems to me it would have been a healthy thing indeed for \nthe Democrats to have brought to the floor a budget, even if I didn't \nagree with it. We then could have had a national public debate about \nthese difficult choices the Nation faces and Senators would have to \nvote as to whether they believed that balancing the budget was worth \ncutting some spending here, and how much they believed in taxes we \nought to raise, and how much would they be cutting in spending. We \ncould read the fine print and ask how much we are cutting and actually \ndebate and vote on these things. But that is what the majority leader \nand his colleagues wanted to avoid.\n  Mr. WICKER. It is what every city council, every State legislature \ncannot avoid. They do not have a printing press down in Montgomery, AL, \nor Jackson, MS.\n  I know the Senator has seen the local delegations of county officials \ncoming in and talking about economic development. They tell me: \nSenator, we have had to cut back on this, we have had to cut back on \nthat, we have had to do this to our budget. We used to be able to \nafford these things and now we can't afford them anymore. They have had \nto make sensible decisions. Councils and legislatures, Republican and \nDemocrat, have faced the hard choices, and it can't be any fun for \nthem. They have to face the voters and say: we paid for this last year, \nwe don't have the money this year. And families have had to do that as \nwell.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. In my hometown of Mobile, AL, \nthey fell one vote short of raising the sales tax because of the \nfinancial challenges they were facing, and they had a big debate about \nit, but they didn't duck the vote. They had the vote and they decided \nthey didn't need to raise the taxes. But it wasn't a question of the \ncity council being able to avoid a vote.\n  We in the great United States Senate, we travel the whole of our \nStates over and over and over again and we ask for this tough job. My \nwife has a good phrase for it when I complain. She says: Don't blame \nme. You asked for the job. Well, we asked for this job. Nobody said it \nwas going to be easy, and this is not easy because we have never faced \na more fundamental financial crisis. Because of demographics and \nhistory and trends that are going on in our population, the situation \nis such that it is going to be difficult to meet these challenges.\n  Mr. WICKER. But we can meet these challenges.\n  I have grown children--32, 28, and 25. They may be about to age into \nthe next year, and they wonder if they will even receive Medicare when \nit comes time to retire. That retirement for them will come sooner than \nthey think, though it seems like forever. But they do not believe--that \ngeneration doesn't believe--Medicare will be there for them. If we \ntackle this problem, Medicare can be there for the next generation. It \nshould be there for the next generation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Exactly.\n  Mr. WICKER. It won't look exactly like it does for my father, who is \n88 years old today and depends on Medicare, but Medicare could be \nthere. But not the way it is going now. We have to tackle these issues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My colleague is so right. We are not going to have to \ncancel these programs.\n  Mr. WICKER. No, sir.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We can save these programs. It is just going to require \nus to confront reality and make some changes in how we do business.\n  I wish to say one more thing about this budget, before I forget. My \nDemocratic colleagues claim the Budget Control Act was a budget, but it \nonly dealt with discretionary spending. It didn't deal with all the \nother spending. It only set limits on expenditures and it didn't have \nany debate on the floor. It was a secret agreement. There was a budget \nlimitation placed on spending as a result of Republicans insisting we \nhad to reduce some spending before we would allow the President to \nraise the debt limit. That went on into the wee hours of the morning \nand they put together a horrible deal and now we are paying the price \nfor it. It did cut some spending, and it limited how much spending we \ncould do, but it didn't go through the budget process, it didn't cover \nall the government programs, and it doesn't have anything like the \nindices of a budget.\n  An attempt was made--and successfully--to bring up the President's \nbudget for a vote. The motion was believed\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nto be legitimate because there was no budget, and we were going to have \na vote on it. Our Democratic colleagues ran to the Parliamentarian to \ntry to argue that this cap on spending that was agreed to last August \nwas a budget. They picked the Parliamentarian. The majority hires the \nParliamentarian. And very courageously and properly the Parliamentarian \nsaid: No, it is not a budget. So there was no budget in the Senate, and \nPresident Obama's budget was brought up and got zero votes.\n  I wanted to share that.\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, I appreciate the Senator's sharing his time with \nme.\n  Mr. President, I guess in a moment, Senator Sessions will yield the \nfloor and we will go dark, subject to the call of the Chair for a vote \nat midnight, and then we will sort of slink out of town, with no \nappropriations bills, no defense bill, and no dealing with \nsequestration, which means meat axe cuts to defense and other programs.\n  But we will have gotten away under cover of darkness to face the \nvoters, and in this country they are the ultimate arbiters.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to stand on the floor with a statesman \nsuch as my friend from Alabama and to thank him for his leadership on \nbudget issues and to thank him for coming here and telling the truth to \nour colleagues and to the American people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Olympia Snowe, who is not \nrunning again, is frustrated with this body and pointed out yesterday \non the Senate floor that we voted in this body a few years ago up until \nNovember 1. We act like we have to be out by the middle of September. \nWe aren't going to do any work during October, and we will come back \nmaybe after the election in a lameduck circumstance and see how much \njunk can be shoved through here without real votes.\n  Isn't it true that we have had plenty of time since September to \nbring up the Defense authorization bill, to bring up a budget, to bring \nup some of the appropriations bills, at least some of them?\n  Mr. WICKER. Day after day, hour after hour in quorum calls. It is \nvery frustrating, and frustrating to the people who sent us here to do \na job.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have heard it said that 40 percent of what we spend \nevery day is borrowed. Really, $4 billion a day is what we borrow. \nPeople probably think that can't be true, that 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend and put out the door has to be borrowed from countries around \nthe world and from others who will loan us the money, and we pay \ninterest on it.\n  In a recent interview in July on CNBC, Mr. Erskine Bowles--President \nClinton's Chief of Staff, appointed by President Obama to head the debt \ncommission--said this about the state of our finances:\n\n       If you take last year, 100 percent of our revenue that came \n     into the country, every nickel, every single dollar that came \n     into the country last year was spent on our--what's called \n     mandatory spending and interest on the debt. Mandatory \n     spending is principally the entitlement programs, Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and Social Security.\n       What that means is every single dollar we spent last year \n     on these two wars, national defense, homeland security, \n     education, infrastructure, high-value-added research, every \n     single dollar was borrowed. And half of it was borrowed from \n     foreign countries. That is crazy. Crazy. It's a formula for \n     failure in any organization.\n\n  That is the man President Obama chose to head the debt commission, a \nbusinessman who understands the threat this Nation faces.\n  We can get off this path. Congressman Ryan laid out a plan that would \nget us off this path. We have to get off this path.\n  As we head out from this Senate to return to our States and visit \nwith our constituents, and as we head into an election, I would just \nlike to ask, Is there one Senator on the other side of the aisle who \ncan defend to the good people of this country the decision of this body \nto withhold a budget, withhold a financial plan from the country? Can \nyou defend that? Can you defend not even attempting to do the \nfundamental requirement of Congress, which is to appropriate the money \nto run the government--not even bring up a single bill--for the second \ntime in the history of the Republic?\n  What about the Defense authorization bill? It came out of our Armed \nServices Committee unanimously. The leadership has refused to bring it \nup on the Senate floor. Can you defend that?\n  Really, can you defend failing to deal with the fiscal cliff, the \ndeep defense cuts and huge tax increases that will occur January 1? \nWouldn't the economy be better if that uncertainty had been removed? We \ncould have already brought up those bills and voted on them.\n  Instead, you know how they are going to do it: The leadership will \nmeet over here, and it will be December 23. The majority leader said we \nmay be here until December 23. That is when they will bring it all up. \nThat is when the health care bill was passed. Christmas Eve is when the \nhealth care bill was passed.\n  So that is the plan: Bring it up at the end. Everybody will have to \nvote for it, or the government will shut down and it will be a \ndisaster. That is the kind of thing we should be avoiding.\n  I believe the complaints that have been made today are not just \npolitical rhetoric, not just talk, but represent a legitimate, honest \ncriticism of the leadership of the Senate. I think the American people \nshould weigh that as they go to the polls.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on H.J. Res. \n117, a continuing resolution to fund Federal agencies for the next 6 \nmonths. While I appreciate that this measure avoids the need to \nnegotiate a spending bill during the lame duck session, after careful \nconsideration, I believe the promises I made to the people of \nPennsylvania in 2010 compel me to oppose this bill.\n  H.J. Res. 117 establishes discretionary appropriations for fiscal \nyear at $1.047 trillion, an amount equal to the spending cap created by \nthe Budget Control Act of 2011. Unfortunately, this figure is far above \nwhat is fiscally responsible, which is one of the reasons I voted \nagainst the Budget Control Act last year. Given that the Federal \nGovernment has now run deficits in excess of $1 trillion for 4 \nconsecutive years, it would be irresponsible to vote for a bill that \nincreases discretionary spending by about $8 billion.\n  Furthermore, H.J. Res. 117 employs a tired old accounting gimmick \ncalled ``changes in mandatory spending programs'' to make discretionary \nspending appear nearly $20 billion lower. This gimmick does not \neliminate mandatory spending; it only delays it, resulting in no actual \nbudgetary savings.\n  The continuing resolution fails to restore recently undermined \nwelfare-to-work provisions within the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies--TANF--Program. In 1996, a Republican led Congress and \nPresident Clinton enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act--P.L. 104-193, a key component of which \nestablished work requirements, helping individuals provide for \nthemselves and their families. On July 12, 2012, the administration \nunilaterally weakened reporting requirements for TANF, erroneously \nstipulating that waiver authority provided under section 1115 of the \nSocial Security Act enabled the agency to modify work participation \nrequirements, a provision explicitly outside the scope of waivable \nprovisions. Welfare-to-work provisions have proven instrumental in \ntransitioning millions off welfare. While TANF's work requirements have \ncontributed towards declining welfare rolls, there remain additional \nopportunities to strengthen and reform the TANF program. By failing to \nengage in a dialogue, Congress missed a critical opportunity to restore \nthe welfare-to-work requirements and assist more TANF recipients take \nsteps towards independence.\n  Though I am unable to support this continuing resolution, I would \nnote my support for one provision in the underlying legislation. I am \nhappy that a technical correction was included that ensures that States \nthat have not remediated all of their abandoned mine lands do not lose \nany payments from the Abandoned Mine Lands Trust Fund as a result of \nthe recently enacted Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act \n(Map-21). To pay for MAP-21, conferees inserted a provision intending \nto cap payments to States that have been certified by the EPA as having \nremediated all of their abandoned mine lands.\n  After enactment, there was some uncertainty about how this provision\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\nwould affect noncertified states like Pennsylvania because of the \nstructure of the funding formula. This was clearly not the intent of \nCongress. The Congressional Budget Office scored the provision as \ncapping payments to certified States only. Therefore, this technical \ncorrection ensures that Pennsylvania, the State with more abandoned \nmine lands than any other, continues to receive its baseline level of \nfunding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \nprovision included in the continuing resolution. As parents sent their \nchildren off to school this fall, many were uncertain whether their \nchild would be taught by teachers in training who are enrolled in \nalternative route programs. That is why I am pleased this legislation \nrequires the Department of Education to provide Congress, and the \nparents of Washington State and the country, information on how \nfrequently this is occurring. The data and report should be made public \nand available to parents and other interested parties. As a former \nteacher, a Parent Teacher Association member, a school board president, \nand most important a mom who actively participated in my two children's \njourney through the education system, I firmly believe that every \nparent deserves to know the qualifications of their child's teacher.\n  Specifically, the provision requires the Secretary of Education to \nreport to Congress no later than December 31, 2013, on the extent to \nwhich students with disabilities, English learners, students in rural \nareas, and students from low-income families are being taught by \nalternative route teachers in training who are deemed highly qualified \naccording to title 34 section 200.56(a)(2)(ii) of the Code of Federal \nRegulations. This regulation allows individuals who have not yet \nobtained regular State teacher certification but are participating in \nalternative route programs to be labeled ``highly qualified.'' The \nprovision included in this continuing resolution will require the \nDepartment of Education to gather and report the extent to which our \nmost vulnerable students and those with the highest needs are being \ntaught by teachers with the least amount of preparation. While we know \nmany students are being taught by these teachers in training, we do not \nknow if these teachers are equitably distributed among high need \nschools, in which States they are concentrated, or which student \nsubgroups they are teaching. The report will provide this information \nand will be vital for developing policies to ensure every child in \nAmerica receives a high-quality education.\n  The report should include data on the professional qualifications of \nteachers. In particular the number of teachers who have not met State \nqualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subjects \nareas in which the teacher provides instruction. Also, the report \nshould include the number teaching under emergency or other provisional \nstatus through which State qualification or licensing criteria have \nbeen waived, the baccalaureate degree major of the teacher and any \nother graduate certification or degree held by the teacher, and the \nfield of discipline of the teacher's certification or degree. States \nand local education agencies are already required to collect this data \naccording to the Parents' Right to Know provisions of the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2001.\n  I look forward to receiving this important report. Throughout my \npolitical career, from the school board to the Senate, I have been \ncommitted to doing everything I can to ensure every student has an \nopportunity to learn, and to succeed, to the best of his or her \nability. This report will help us craft policy that supports this goal. \nParents deserve to know who is teaching their child and it is our \nresponsibility to ensure this information is provided.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to \nthe Paul amendment, and to put this debate over foreign aid in some \ncontext.\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I see the threats this \nNation faces around the world.\n  We are no longer in a world where we can focus on ballistic missiles \nfrom Russia or troops pouring into Europe through the Fulda Gap. \nInstead, we face asymmetric threats--terrorist attacks, the potential \nuse of chemical weapons, and the thousands of attempted cyber \nintrusions that hit our networks every day.\n  In this environment, our partnerships with other nations are more \nimportant than ever, as attacks can emanate from anywhere, and the \nresponses to those threats often require bilateral or multilateral \nsupport.\n  I agree with Senator Paul that there are areas where other nations \ncan and should do more to combat these threats; after all, terrorism \nand extremist ideologies are not U.S. problems, they are global \nproblems.\n  On the subject of Pakistan, I strongly agree that Dr. Shakil Afridi \nshould be released from prison.\n  He helped play an important role in making the intelligence case that \nUsama bin Laden was at that compound in Abbottabad, and his actions \nhelped this Nation eliminate the world's most wanted target.\n  I had the opportunity to make this case directly to Pakistan's \nForeign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and Pakistan's Ambassador to the \nUnited States Sherry Rehman in a meeting on Wednesday.\n  But is the appropriate response to cut off all U.S. assistance to \nPakistan--including economic and humanitarian assistance--because of \nDr. Afridi? No, clearly, it is not.\n  I joined an effort by Senator Graham on the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill to cut $33 million in Foreign Military Financing \nfor Pakistan in FY 2013--$1 million for every year of Dr. Afridi's \nprison sentence. It was a targeted effort, and it enabled us to send a \npublic message to Pakistan.\n  The United States and Pakistan have had a series of confrontations \nover the past couple of years, and the relationship has been sorely \ntested. There has been fault on both sides.\n  And we are now improving our coordination and partnership in key \nareas, including on counterterrorism. We absolutely need to continue to \npress Pakistan to do more, and to release Dr. Afridi--and we are.\n  But eliminating all foreign assistance without a national security \nwaiver is a knee-jerk reaction that will cause the United States more \nharm than good.\n  The amendment would also cut off all foreign assistance to the \nnascent governments in Egypt and Libya because elements of their \npopulace or foreign fighters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the \nconsulate in Benghazi.\n  Both of those governments have denounced the attacks, and both have \nincreased the security they are providing to U.S. missions.\n  We are still learning who was behind these attacks, whether motivated \nsolely by a stupid video put out by someone with no regard for \nreligious tolerance or the safety of Americans overseas or by terrorist \nelements who used the protests as a pretext to carry out an agenda of \nviolence against the United States.\n  But one thing is pretty clear: the anger and violence directed \nagainst the United States by the people of Libya, Egypt, and perhaps \nnumerous other Middle Eastern countries will not be lessened by \nreducing American aid.\n  The Paul amendment goes even further, though. It would prohibit any \ndirect U.S. assistance to any country in which a U.S. diplomatic \nfacility was attacked, trespassed upon, breached, or attempted to be \nattacked, trespassed upon, or breached even if the host government \nprovided every possible measure of security and support, and no matter \nhow small the infraction.\n  I believe in a strategy of engagement. I believe that the United \nStates should work with countries to root out terrorists and denounce \nextremism of all forms.\n  And I believe that we should use foreign aid--which, by the way, \naccounts for only 1 percent of the U.S. government's budget--to bring \nhumanitarian relief, support democratization, and help other \ngovernments improve their own security and law enforcement efforts to \ndefeat terrorism and extremism.\n  Indeed, at this time, we should look to the example set by Ambassador \nChris Stevens, a man who dedicated himself to learning the language and \nthe culture of the Middle East and promoting the universal values of \ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law--from his time as a Peace \nCorps volunteer in Morocco, to tours as a\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nForeign Service Officer in Jerusalem, Damascus, Riyadh, and Cairo, and, \nfinally, as our Ambassador to a democratic Libya.\n  Ambassador Stevens worked tirelessly to help the people of Libya \nbuild a new country and new future after years of brutal dictatorship.\n  He knew that path would not be easy and there would be many \nchallenges. But he also knew that the Libyan people could succeed and \nthat leadership and support from the United States would be crucial.\n  This amendment will turn America away from the commitment to the \nMiddle East that Ambassador Stevens championed and towards isolation.\n  It will harm America's interests, will harm our national security, \nand will promote anti-Americanism in precisely the parts of the world \nwhere we need to be more, not less, engaged.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Paul amendment.\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in every region of the world, the \nUnited States should search for ways to use foreign aid and \nhumanitarian assistance to strengthen our influence, the effectiveness \nof our leadership, and the service of our national interests and \nideals. When done effectively, in partnership with the private sector, \nwith faith-based organizations, and our allies, foreign aid is a cost-\neffective way not only to export our values and our example but to \nadvance our security and economic goals.\n  Foreign aid is a foreign policy tool used by the United States to \nwork with other countries. In the case of Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan, \neach receives significant amounts of foreign aid from the U.S. \ntaxpayers, and U.S. citizens expect these countries to meet the \nconditions we set upon this aid. In the wake of the uprisings across \nthe Muslim world and the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the \nU.S. consulate in Libya, it is imperative that the United States \nreceive the full cooperation of the host nations in investigating and \nprosecuting those responsible for the attacks on our diplomatic \nmissions and the deaths of four brave Americans.\n  Senator Rand Paul's legislation would affect aid for these countries \nby effectively eliminating it. The American people deserve to be \noutraged following these attacks. However, the situations in these \nthree countries are very different.\n  In Egypt, the government has the security capabilities to protect our \nEmbassy and failed to do so. It was unacceptable that their President \ndidn't immediately condemn the attacks and instead focused on a YouTube \nvideo.\n  In Libya, there was a terrorist attack on our consulate which \nresulted in the death of four Americans, including the Ambassador. The \nLibyan people rejected Islamists in their recent election, but their \npro-Western Libyan Government does not have the security capabilities \nof the Egyptians. So far, the Libyans are trying to do the right thing \nby working with the United States to investigate these attacks and \nstrengthen their own security capabilities. In fact, just yesterday \nthousands of Libyans fed up with terrorism took matters into their own \nhands by seizing control of the headquarters of several militias and \ndemanding they be disarmed. Cutting off aid to Libya, which is trying \nto help us, is not the answer as it would weaken their ability to help \nus and undermine their efforts to defeat the terrorists in their \ncountry. It would also represent America's stunning rejection of what \nis clearly the Libyan people's will to reject extremists and terrorists \ntrying to lead Libya back to darkness.\n  With Pakistan, I believe we should condition some if not all of the \naid on the release of Dr. Afridi. He has been arrested on false \ncharges. The time has finally come for Pakistan to decide if they are \ngoing to be a truthful ally of the United States.\n  Senator Paul's legislation lumps in three different countries with \nthree very different situations, and I could not support such a measure \nas drafted. Prior to the vote on this matter, I urged Senator Paul to \nconsider, at a minimum, restructuring his amendment to recognize that \nthere are considerable differences between Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan. \nSince no changes were ultimately made, I opposed this measure.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Secretary of State Clinton said it \nwell: ``The United States rejects both the content and message of that \nvideo . . . and deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the \nreligious beliefs of others.''\n\n  The Secretary and President Obama have also said, repeatedly, that \nthere is never any justification for the violent acts that have been \nperpetrated against our diplomats, and they have called on the \ngovernments of those countries to protect our embassies and consulates. \nAnd of course, they are right.\n  As far as I am aware we have received the condolences and support of \nthe governments of these countries, as well as scores of other \ngovernments around the world.\n  The support and sympathy expressed, not only by foreign officials but \nby countless citizens of these countries who have denounced the attacks \non United States personnel, needs to be recognized.\n  There is no evidence, that I am aware of, that any of these \ngovernments were responsible for, or had any involvement in, these \nviolent demonstrations. They neither ordered nor condoned them. To the \ncontrary, they have since taken steps to protect our facilities and \npersonnel.\n  That is why I am mystified by the legislation offered by the junior \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator Paul, which would cut off aid to key \nU.S. allies like Israel, Indonesia and Jordan where such protests have \noccurred, even peaceful demonstrations, as well as security partners \nlike Egypt, Libya, and Pakistan.\n  On the one hand, there are some affirmations of our policy goals in \nthe legislation that I agree with--for example, we all want those \nresponsible for the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and the other \nAmericans in Benghazi, as well as the destruction of property there and \nin Cairo and elsewhere, to be brought to justice. And already, dozens \nof people are under arrest in those countries.\n  But anyone who is inclined to support this legislation should read \nthe fine print, because the way it is drafted is not only unworkable, \nit would serve to inflame an already dangerous situation, harming \nAmerica's national security interests.\n  For example, all aid would be cut off to governments in countries \nwhere a demonstration occurred, even a peaceful demonstration, until \nthe government arrests everyone who participated, and until the FBI has \nidentified everyone involved and they are all in the custody of the \nUnited States, even if we do not have extradition treaties with those \ncountries.\n  In other words, we would cut off aid to the governments of Egypt, \nIsrael, Jordan, Libya, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Nigeria, Turkey, \nLebanon,\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nIraq, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Yemen, and India, among others, until every \none of the thousands of people who participated in demonstrations in \nthose countries has been identified by name, arrested, and brought to \nthe United States and imprisoned.\n  I have seen unworkable, unwise legislation before, but this may win \nthe prize. Not only would this be a colossal waste of FBI resources, it \nwould be impossible to implement.\n  How is the FBI going to determine the identity of everyone who joined \nin these protests? Is that really what we want the FBI doing?\n  Are we, who believe in freedom of speech, really going to fill up our \nprisons with thousands of foreigners, including those who have engaged \nin peaceful demonstrations?\n  Does the author of this amendment have any idea how much that would \ncost U.S. taxpayers?\n  Are we really going to cut off aid to the Government of Egypt, which \nhas reaffirmed its peace agreement with Israel, sent troops against \nEgyptian extremists in the Sinai, deployed police to protect the U.S. \nembassy, and is in the process of negotiating an agreement with the \nIMF--with U.S. and European support--to reform its economy?\n  Are we going to also cut off aid to Israel--which we would not do, of \ncourse?\n  Do we really want to cut off aid to the Government of Indonesia, the \nlargest Muslim country in the world and a key U.S. ally in South East \nAsia?\n  And Libya, which we helped to liberate, and which has just emerged \nfrom a bloody revolution to overthrow a tyrant who posed a real threat \nto regional peace and security?\n  As I said before, we are all outraged and saddened by the tragic \nevents in Benghazi, Cairo, and elsewhere. There is no justification for \nit. We expect to see those responsible for the violence to be brought \nto justice, and we have insisted that these governments fulfill their \nobligation to protect our embassies, as we protect theirs.\n  But this is no way to honor the patriotism and sacrifice of \nAmbassador Stevens and the others who lost their lives.\n  We are not talking about brutal kleptocracies like the Mobutu \nGovernment of the 1980s who the junior Senator from Kentucky spoke of \ntoday.\n  These are fledgling democracies whose people have been ruled and \nbrutalized by corrupt dictators for decades. They are struggling to \ndraft new constitutions, elect parliaments, reform their police, \nrestructure their stagnant economies, and manage competing ethnic, \nreligious and political factions, some of which have been in conflict \nwith each other for centuries.\n  We can punish them by cutting off our aid, even though these \ngovernments had no more to do with organizing the protests than our \ngovernment had to do with producing the anti-Muslim video that is \ninciting the protests.\n  That might score political points for some back home.\n  Or we can support them in making decisions that will improve our \nrelations and strengthen our security.\n  Withdrawal is not an option for the United States. Isolationism is \nnot an option. Overreacting in ways that embolden violent extremists is \nnot an option.\n  This amendment is poorly conceived, poorly drafted, and would have \nall sorts of unintended and dangerous consequences. The best message \nthe United States Congress could send to the forces of democracy in \nthese countries is to defeat it overwhelmingly.\n  I believe, like so many both Democrats and Republicans who have \nspoken against this, it makes no sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, Americans are crying out for us to stop \ngiving away hard-earned tax dollars to countries that are not our \nfriends. I agree. We need to review all our foreign aid and make any \naid conditional on the protection of Americans and of our interests. \nBut when it comes to the bill offered by Senator Paul, I have to say I \ndo not like how some parts of it are worded. It has some flaws and \nMembers on both sides of the aisle have some legitimate concerns. I \nhave been working all day with Senator Paul to improve the language to \naddress concerns on our side.\n  Senator Paul has been more than accommodating on this. He was willing \nto limit the scope of the bill to Libya, Pakistan, and Egypt. With \nrespect to Libya and Egypt, he agreed to loosen restrictions so the \nfunds would not turn off for 60 days, and only turn off if it was clear \ntheir governments were not cooperating with the investigation into the \nattacks and efforts to find the perpetrators. In short, he was willing \nto accept the legitimate concerns that have been raised by colleagues \nwith respect to the potential unintended consequences of the bill.\n  Then Senator Paul asked the majority leader if he could modify the \nbill. Senators do this all the time--or at least we used to. We work \ntogether, we have managers' amendments, we allow Senators to modify \ntheir legislation to fix issues raised by other Senators. So after all \nthis work and this good faith accommodation by Senator Paul who, to \naddress the concerns of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, was \nagreeing to changes that narrowed the scope of the legislation far \nbeyond what he personally wanted--after all this, the other side of the \naisle decided to play gotcha. They would not let him modify his own \namendment. His request was made 8 to 10 hours before the vote--plenty \nof time for Members to review the changes--but the normal rules of \ncomity apparently do not apply anymore in the Senate.\n  This Senator is ashamed of the way the Senate is being run. We have \nhad an entire Congress of gag rules, limited debate, limited votes, \nlimited amendments, and the result has been no accomplishments. Over \nthe last 2 years, the Senate has become a laughingstock. I may not like \nthe way Senator Paul's bill is worded, his unmodified bill. I do not \nagree with the scope of the conditions in some cases, but I support the \ngoals of providing accountability in our foreign aid, of freeing Dr. \nAfridi, and of ensuring that those we support with our precious dollars \nare defending our interests and our diplomats overseas.\n  I will vote yes on this bill in support of these principles. The bill \nwill not pass, but the other side cannot hide from this issue forever. \nSenator Paul will be back and I will be back with him. We will get the \nvotes the American people are demanding.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Certainly.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the Senator this question. We all understand the \nnormal rules of the Senate. This is a big policy, cutting off four \ncountries' aid with a set of circumstances that is so rigid it may \nencompass countries such as Israel and others. The normal rules of \ncomity are that something such as this would go through the appropriate \ncommittee. That is why we have committees.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. This has never been to the Foreign Relations Committee. Does \nthe Senator believe some policy as important as this doesn't deserve a \nhearing, doesn't deserve a process? I think the Senator knows that as \nthe chairman I have never slowed down a process of our committee. The \nnormal rules of comity ought to require this to go through the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I say to the Senator, if that were true, I think he has \nto admit Senator Tester has one that his side pushed this night that \nhas not been through committee, violates the budget, and a number of \nother things.\n  The point is this. Senator Paul has been working on this legislation \nfor several months and has been working to try to get a vote on this \nfloor for several months and he could not get it. He was turned down \ntime and time again. This legislation has been out there. The issue of \nforeign aid has been out there. We have not taken it up as a committee \nas we should have. The fact that he is not given the opportunity to get \na vote on the amendment of his choice, to modify his own amendment, \ndoes break the precedent of the Senate and does break the comity we \nshould enjoy here. When a Member offers an amendment, they should be \nable to modify it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand tonight in support of the amendment \nof\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nSenator Paul to provide limitations on the amount and scope of foreign \naid the United States sends abroad. This is not a decision I have \nreached quickly, nor is it an issue I take lightly.\n  I appreciate that, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, \nconditions already exist on some of the foreign aid we send to \nPakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. I respectfully submit, however, that \nthese conditions are not producing the desired result nor are they yet \nfully enforced.\n  For example, is Pakistan cooperating with the United States on \ncountering terrorism efforts and preventing terrorists from basing or \noperating in Pakistan, as is already required in section 7046 of Public \nLaw 112-74? Are the programs and activities we support in Afghanistan \nsustainable, as is also required by section 7046? If the answer to \nthese and to other questions regarding this aid could possibly be no, \nthen we have an obligation to the American people to at least review \nthis aid and inspect every single dollar we send abroad to ensure that \nthe billions of dollars we send to Pakistan, to Egypt, and to Libya are \nwell spent.\n  I support this amendment, if for no other reason than to begin the \ndebate on the merit of sending billions of American dollars abroad each \nand every year. When will we stop sending this kind of money to nations \nthat harbor terrorists and imprison those who, like Dr. Afridi, would \ndefend our interests?\n  To be clear, I don't think the amendment of Senator Paul is perfect. \nMany of my colleagues have legitimate concerns about this amendment's \npotential effect on some of our allies outside the Middle East. That is \nwhy I and several other Senators have asked our staffs to work with \nSenator Paul and his office to narrow the scope of this amendment. \nSenator Paul was responsive to our concerns and was willing to make the \nrequested changes.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader refused to allow Senator Paul to \nmodify his own amendment. I don't yet have 2 full years under my belt \nas a Member of this body, but I have been around just long enough to \nsee that managers' amendments and modifications are routinely applied \nto their own legislation, and I am very sorry Senator Paul was not \ngiven the courtesy that apparently is reserved only for other Members \nof this distinguished body.\n  In a Senate where the majority leader has recently announced ``the \namendment days are over,'' I guess I should not be surprised.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will just take 1 minute before I yield back. With \nrespect to the question, first of all--I obviously do not run the \nSenate so I cannot speak about what happened with respect to these \nother pieces of legislation, but I am responsible for the Foreign \nRelations Committee. This particular amendment was filed at the desk on \nSeptember 19. We are here under rule XIV. That is not months of work. \nThe first time I heard of it was when it came to the desk. So this \ncould well have been a policy we amended in the committee, that we \nworked on appropriately, came up with some appropriate way of dealing \nwith legitimate issues.\n  I am not denigrating the legitimacy of some of the issues the Senator \nfrom Kentucky raises. We had a very profound conversation with the \nForeign Minister of Pakistan the other day. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee met with her. We went into Dr. Afridi's situation in some \ndetail, and there are other issues raised here. But just to come in out \nof the whole blue and file it at the desk and say let's change years of \npolicy with a country that we, in the case of Egypt, desperately rely \non with respect to the peace process in the Middle East, sustaining the \npeace agreement with Israel--it just defies rationale about how you \nmake good foreign policy.\n  I will have more to say about it in a moment, but I just want to make \nit clear this did not come to the floor until September 19 at the desk \nand it is here under rule XIV.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't know how much time we have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. We will hold off and come back.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. Not on my time, no. I will do it on the Senator's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Whose time is \nbeing----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If no one yields time, time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to respond to my friend and \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  In the first place, it is significant. Dr. Afridi has been in prison \nfor more than a year. It is significant that this amount of time has \nelapsed. It is appropriate that we respond in some fashion. I don't \nknow why exactly legislation has not emerged from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on which I sit. The fact is it has not.\n  I respect the junior Senator from Kentucky for having the courage to \nbring forward this legislation. Regardless, the fact is that this \nlegislation is now before us. We can argue about how it got here and \nabout whether it should have gone through committee, but it is before \nus. The fact that it is now before us means the Senator from Kentucky \nwho introduced it ought to have certain prerogatives--prerogatives to \nchange it or modify it before it gets to the floor. That is the point I \nwas making, and that is the point I think bears some mention here. I \nthink that is a point which was somehow lost in this discussion today, \nand that is most unfortunate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                   Unanimous consent Request--S. 3576\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set side and that S. 3576 be made pending; that the Paul \nsubstitute amendment No. 2849 to S. 3576 be adopted; and that at the \nappropriate time the Senate consider S. 3576 as amended under the terms \nof the earlier order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. It boggles the mind to think that Hillary Clinton was on \nCapitol Hill this week to ask for increasing aid to Egypt. It boggles \nthe mind that last month President Obama found an extra $1 billion to \ngive to Pakistan.\n  Meanwhile, Dr. Shakil Afridi has been in prison for a year. He said \ndirectly in interviews that he has been tortured by the Pakistani \nGovernment. Now he has been imprisoned for life. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee has had a year to act on this and has not been forthcoming in \ndoing anything to address Dr. Afridi or get him freed or to attach any \nrestrictions or limitations to foreign aid. The restrictions currently \nin place are for the administration, and they have been waived.\n  I say we don't give up the power of the purse. I say we keep the \npower of the purse and the restrictions with the legislature. This bill \nplaces restrictions on foreign aid to three countries. This bill does \nnot end foreign aid, it adds restrictions. Some have argued that \ninterrupting foreign aid now could inflame the Arab world. Does anyone \nthink they are not already inflamed? They are inflamed because our \nforeign aid has incensed them. Our foreign aid bought Mubarak tear gas \nand police truncheons. We need to understand why the Arabs are angry.\n  Some have argued that aid to Israel could be ended by this bill. That \nis ridiculous. The bill requires the Secretary of State to allege that \na country did not attempt to protect an embassy that was attacked. To \nimply that a Secretary of State, Republican or Democrat, is going to \nallege that Israel is not protecting our embassy is absurd. It boggles \nthe mind to think that any Senator wants to send foreign aid without \nconditions to countries that are burning our flag. I, for one, will not \nvote for one more penny to be sent to the people who riot and burn the \nAmerican flag. Enough is enough. We are running a trillion-dollar \ndeficit, and Americans are tired of their tax dollars being sent to \ncountries that are burning the American flag.\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on placing restrictions on foreign aid.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts. I \nyield the time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say quickly to the Senator from \nKentucky, whom I asked the other day whether he has ever been to \nPakistan or Egypt--I think if he had, he would know something more \nabout the millions of people in those countries who aspire to democracy \nand who have invested in our values and are trying to have a different \nfuture.\n  I particularly--``resent'' is not a particularly attractive word, but \nto hear him say that the Foreign Relations Committee has done nothing \non Dr. Afridi does a disservice to the efforts we have been making in \nwhat is called a quiet and thoughtful diplomacy. Not all diplomacy is \nconducted by passing a fly-by-night amendment on the floor of the \nSenate, pretending that is going to improve relations or change the \nworld. When we sit down with people and talk through problems, we can \nwork out a resolution.\n  We had a long conversation just a day ago with the Foreign Minister \nof Pakistan about Dr. Afridi. That was not the first conversation. For \nmonths some of us have been talking with Pakistan about how we resolve \nthis issue, which does, incidentally, have something to do with the law \nof another country, the politics of another country, and the political \ndemands and needs of another country. It is not always the best way to \nresolve those things simply by racing to the floor of the Senate and \nsaying: Here, do what we tell you. I am afraid that is not always how \nit works.\n  So I think the Senator from Kentucky has a lot to learn about how we \nget things done within the international community.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will take note \nthat AIPAC disagrees with the view of the Senator from Kentucky about \nthe effect this legislation may have on aid to Israel.\n  Every Member of Congress and all Americans should know what happened \ntoday in Benghazi, Libya. The reports are that as many as 30,000 \nLibyans took to the streets in Benghazi, the city in which Ambassador \nChris Stevens and three of his colleagues were tragically murdered 10 \ndays ago. These demonstrators marched peacefully to the gates of the \ncompound of Ansar al-Sharia, the militia that was responsible for the \nattack that killed Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues. The \ndemonstrators conducted themselves peacefully. According to media \nreports, they carried signs that read ``The Ambassador was Libya's \nfriend'' and ``No, no to militias.'' When these brave Libyans arrived \nat the gates of the compound, they told the militia that they and their \nviolent, extremist agenda are not welcome in the new Libya. Do we want \nto send a message tonight, after the people of Libya told the militants \nno, that we don't want to have anything to do with them, we won't \nassist them, we won't give them what they need to establish a \ndemocratic and free society?\n  Because of what happened in Benghazi today, somewhere Chris Stevens \nis smiling. He is smiling because this is the real Libya, the Libya he \nknew and loved so well. This is the Libya he wanted America to support \nand remain engaged with, the Libya of which he ultimately gave his \nlife. These brave people in Libya are friends of America's. They want \nour help, and they need our help. We must continue to provide it to \nthem, which is exactly what Chris Stevens would have wanted.\n  If the Senate were to cut off all U.S. assistance to Libya now, as \nthis amendment before us would do, it would abandon our friends to our \nterrorist enemies and destroy America's moral standing in the world and \ndo egregious harm to our national interests.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time is remaining altogether?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes 20 seconds on Senator \nPaul's time; 4 minutes left to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator plan to use his time?\n  Mr. PAUL. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If no one yields time, time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may use. I will be \nhappy to have the Senator speak last if that is what he wants to do.\n  We have heard today from 110 retired generals and admirals that the \nsuspension of U.S. aid is not in America's interest and that assistance \nis a critical component of America's national security strategy.\n  We have heard from Jewish Americans about the impacts this bill would \nhave on our relationship with Israel at what they have called ``a time \nof turmoil and uncertainty,'' and ``the U.S. government needs to be \nable to use all available tools to influence events in the region.''\n  It would affect Israel's security if the United States were to \nsuddenly pull out its assistance and change its relationship with Yemen \nand particularly change its relationship with Egypt.\n  I have heard from the State Department, which said this legislation \n``will weaken democracies'' and ``play into the hands of extremists.''\n  With respect to Libya, Senator McCain has just spoken eloquently \nabout Chris Stevens. He knew Chris Stevens. We knew him on our \ncommittee. He worked for Senator Lugar, and we knew him as a Pearson \nfellow. There was no more dedicated person. We just confirmed him and \nsent him over this May. I guarantee that the last thing he would want \nis his death being used as an excuse for the United States to cut off \nLibya and to disengage.\n  The 30,000 people who marched today marched for America. They marched \nfor themselves. They marched for democracy. They marched for what Chris \nStevens was investing in. I don't think we want to punish those people \nand that government because of what happened.\n  With respect to Egypt, the United States derives extraordinarily \nimportant security benefits from that relationship. Shutting down \nAmerican military assistance to Egypt would jeopardize our \nnonproliferation initiatives. It would undermine efforts to stop the \nsmuggling of weapons and interdicting of arms into Gaza, which affects \nthe security of Israel. It would undermine the 1979 peace treaty \nbetween Israel and Egypt. Those of us who have traveled to Israel in \nrecent months have heard concern from Israeli officials about the \nprospects of suspension of American military assistance to Egypt. They \nhave already talked about it. They are nervous about it, and they think \nit would have a profound negative impact on their security and Israel.\n  These are the connections the Paul legislation just doesn't face up \nto. Senator Paul's legislation would essentially shut down our ability \nto work with the new civilian government. And while we are working to \nbuild the same kind of alliance with them we have had previously, it \nwould really interrupt that and say to them that the United States of \nAmerica is not interested in having that kind of an alliance.\n  With respect to Pakistan, the reality is the United States has vital \nnational security interests in Pakistan, all of which are at stake. \nThey have a population of 190 million people, a troubled economy, \npockets of extremism, and a robust nuclear arsenal. We can't turn our \nbacks on any of that, and I think we need to remember that our aid \nplays a critical role in supporting our interests and our values.\n  The Paul amendment would make us less secure, and it is in no one's \ninterest.\n  Whatever time we have, I reserve the remainder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, nothing in this bill refers to Israel, and \nnothing would apply to Israel. To imagine that any money could be \nremoved from Israel, we would have to imagine that Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton accuses Israel of not protecting the Embassy. It is a \ncanard, and it is a typical one that has been used many times.\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\n  Nothing in the bill says we would have no aid to these countries. It \nsimply says to these countries that if they protect our Embassy--Libya, \nif you continue to cooperate and send back terrorists and catch the \nassassins, you will continue to get our aid.\n  It conditions aid on behavior. Right now, aid is not being \nconditioned on behavior.\n  We have Pakistan, which has actually tortured a friend of America's. \nDr. Shakil Afridi has been tortured for a year by the Pakistani \nGovernment.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has done nothing to address that, and \nso we have Dr. Shakil Afridi now in prison for years--for the rest of \nhis life, essentially. I don't see any action forthcoming from the \nForeign Affairs Committee.\n  What I would say to my colleagues is this is a bill that places \nrestrictions on foreign aid, it does not end foreign aid. It doesn't \nbreach the Israel-Egypt treaty or the Camp David Accords. It is a \ncanard. It is brought up routinely to try to prevent any changes or \nreform in foreign aid. We always hear it is going to end aid to Israel. \nIt is a canard.\n  What I would say to my colleagues is this bill does not end foreign \naid. It places restrictions on foreign aid. Ask the American people: Do \nyou think these restrictions are appropriate? Do you think a host \ncountry should protect our Embassy? Do you think a host country such as \nLibya should be asked to continue to cooperate? Do you think a host \ncountry such as Pakistan should turn over a friend of America and not \nimprison and torture a friend of America?\n  I think these are very reasonable restrictions. I think these are \nrestrictions we should have. I think these are restrictions anyone in \nAmerica would say are very reasonable, and I urge adoption of the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is order in the Senate.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for such time as I have left, let me make \nit clear: The Paul legislation requires all identifiable persons \nassociated with organizing, planning, participating in the attacks, \ntrespass, breach, or attempted attack, have been identified by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, or \nother United States law enforcement entity, and are in United States \ncustody. We are talking about other countries. That is an absolutely \nimpossible-to-fulfill requirement and that is why it would result in \nthe cutoff of aid automatically, and that is why it is dangerous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROVIDING LIMITATIONS ON UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S.J. Res. 41 by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 41) expressing the sense of \n     Congress regarding the nuclear program of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this resolution has 83 cosponsors. Even I \ncannot lose this vote.\n  This resolution says it will not be the policy of the United States \nto allow the Iranian regime to get a nuclear weapon and try to contain \nthem. President Obama has rejected containment. Governor Romney, 83 \nSenators have said that is a bad idea.\n  Very quickly, why will containment not work? If the Iranians get a \nnuclear weapon, every Sunni Arab state will want one themselves. Israel \nwill never know a minute's peace. And my biggest fear: If we allow \nthese people to get a nuclear weapon, they will share the technology \nwith terrorists. The reason thousands have died in the war on terror--\nnot millions--is because the terrorists cannot get the weapons to kill \nmillions.\n  Senator Casey has been terrific. My Democratic colleagues, thank you \nfor working in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield now to Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank all the \nMembers who are cosponsors, led by Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, \nand our team doing this.\n  This is bipartisan on a very important issue. I think it does three \nthings. It adds a sense of urgency because of the threat posed by an \nIranian nuclear program, it adds clarity, and also the resolve of the \nAmerican people to stop them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I vote to support S.J. Res. 41, \nreinforcing President Obama's policy of preventing Iran from possessing \na nuclear weapon rather than containing a nuclear Iran. I support this \nresolution, which explicitly states that nothing in\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nit should be construed as an authorization to use force, because its \nintention and its purpose is to echo and reinforce President Obama's \npolicy toward Iran. It is particularly important to make that clear \nbecause there has been a lot of debate about the meaning of the term \n``nuclear weapons capability'' in the resolution. But a brief \nexamination of the issue shows that the resolution and its language \nsupport the President's policy of preventing Iran from developing or \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  An authoritative definition of a nuclear weapons capability was \noffered in testimony by the Director of National Intelligence in 2009. \nHe stated that there are three parts of an effective nuclear weapons \ncapability: production of fissile material; effective means for weapon \ndelivery; and design, weaponization, and testing of the warhead itself. \nAccording to this definition, the Senate and the President are \narticulating the same position: we are committed to preventing Iran \nfrom achieving all of those components of a nuclear weapons capability, \nwhich amounts to saying that Iran must not develop or acquire nuclear \nweapons.\n  That we are reinforcing the President's policy was one of the main \nthemes in the debate on the resolution on the floor of the Senate. When \nthis was debated in May, that is what both the sponsor, Senator Graham, \nand the lead cosponsor, Senator Lieberman, emphasized repeatedly. \nSenator Lieberman stated, ``This resolution's main focus is to \nessentially back up with a congressional statement the position \nPresident Obama has articulated: that no matter what happens, \ncontainment of a nuclear Iran is not an acceptable policy from the \npoint of view of the security of the United States; that our policy is \nto prevent the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapons capability.'' And Senator Graham stated, \n``We are intending to echo a policy statement made by President Obama \nthat the policy of the United States will be--if you are listening in \nTehran--not to contain Iran if they obtain a nuclear capability.'' \nAgain, Senator Graham stated, ``We are not coming up with a new idea: \nwe are just reinforcing an idea put on the table by our own President--\nwe are not going to contain a nuclear-capable Iran as a policy.''\n  Other leading voices on this issue in the Senate made the same point \nat the time. Senator McCain stated, ``So this resolution we are \nconsidering is no different in any way--in fact, it is less specific \nthan what the President of the United States has said and what I \nbelieve most every Member of the U.S. Senate is on record one way or \nthe other saying: that the development of a nuclear weapon by Iran \nwould be an unacceptable situation.'' Senator Menendez similarly \ncharacterized the resolution as ``making the intentions or amplifying \nthe intentions of the President crystal clear.''\n  Those intentions are to prevent Iran from developing or acquiring a \nnuclear weapon. I share those intentions, and that is why I support the \nresolution today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote for this resolution which \nreaffirms current U.S. policy towards Iran.\n  In doing so, I want to emphasize that it is my understanding that \nthis Resolution, which is non-binding, is in no way intended by its \nsponsors to endorse, authorize, or otherwise encourage the use of \nmilitary force against Iran.\n  Secretary of Defense Panetta, Secretary of State Clinton, former \nSecretary of Defense Gates, and other top Pentagon officials have \nstrongly advised against the use of pre-emptive military force. They \nsaid it would, at best, only temporarily halt Iran's nuclear program, \nit would drive their program further underground, and it could ignite a \nwider war in the Middle East that could spin out of control.\n  I am as concerned as anyone about Iran. But while this Resolution \nreaffirms that concern, that is the extent of what it does. The policy \nof the Administration, and of our allies is to support sanctions, to \nuse diplomacy, to resort to military force only if all other options \nfail. This Resolution does not change that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in favor has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, a vote for this resolution is a vote for the \nconcept of preemptive war. I know of no other way to interpret this \nresolution.\n  The resolution states that containment will never be our policy \ntoward Iran. While I think it is unwise to say we will contain Iran, I \nthink it is equally unwise to say we will never contain Iran.\n  We woke up one day and Pakistan was a nuclear power. We woke up one \nday and North Korea was a nuclear power--India, Russia, China. But if \nwe would have announced preemptively that we were not going to contain \nanyone, then we would be at odds with these countries, and what would \nthe solution be? Preemptive war.\n  Announcing to the world, as this resolution does, that containment \nwill never be our policy is unwise. A country that vows to never \ncontain an enemy is a country that vows always to preemptively strike.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint \nresolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 41\n\n       Whereas, since at least the late 1980s, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and \n     well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities \n     to acquire nuclear capability;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding the full and \n     sustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities by the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran and its full cooperation with the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on all outstanding \n     issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those \n     concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear \n     program;\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\n       Whereas, on November 8, 2011, the IAEA issued an extensive \n     report that--\n       (1) documents ``serious concerns regarding possible \n     military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'';\n       (2) states that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant \n     to the development of a nuclear device''; and\n       (3) states that the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) may be ongoing;\n       Whereas, as of November 2008, Iran had produced, according \n     to the IAEA--\n       (1) approximately 630 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride \n     enriched up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (2) no uranium hexaflouride enriched up to 20 percent \n     uranium-235;\n       Whereas, as of November 2011, Iran had produced, according \n     to the IAEA--\n       (1) nearly 5,000 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched \n     up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (2) 79.7 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched up to \n     20 percent uranium-235;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2012, IAEA inspectors confirmed that \n     the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran had begun \n     enrichment activities at the Fordow site, including possibly \n     enrichment of uranium hexaflouride up to 20 percent uranium-\n     235;\n       Whereas section 2(2) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-\n     195) states, ``The United States and other responsible \n     countries have a vital interest in working together to \n     prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear \n     weapons capability.'';\n       Whereas, if the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     were successful in acquiring a nuclear weapon capability, it \n     would likely spur other countries in the region to consider \n     developing their own nuclear weapons capabilities;\n       Whereas, on December 6, 2011, Prince Turki al-Faisal of \n     Saudi Arabia stated that if international efforts to prevent \n     Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons fail, ``we must, as a \n     duty to our country and people, look into all options we are \n     given, including obtaining these weapons ourselves'';\n       Whereas top leaders of the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran have repeatedly threatened the existence of \n     the State of Israel, pledging to ``wipe Israel off the map'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated Iran as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and characterized Iran \n     as the ``most active state sponsor of terrorism'';\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murders of \n     hundreds of United States forces and innocent civilians;\n       Whereas, on July 28, 2011, the Department of the Treasury \n     charged that the Government of Iran had forged a ``secret \n     deal'' with al Qaeda to facilitate the movement of al Qaeda \n     fighters and funding through Iranian territory;\n       Whereas, in October 2011, senior leaders of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force were implicated \n     in a terrorist plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Ambassador \n     to the United States on United States soil;\n       Whereas, on December 26, 2011, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the serious human \n     rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     including torture, cruel and degrading treatment in \n     detention, the targeting of human rights defenders, violence \n     against women, and ``the systematic and serious restrictions \n     on freedom of peaceful assembly'' as well as severe \n     restrictions on the rights to ``freedom of thought, \n     conscience, religion or belief'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama, through the P5+1 process, \n     has made repeated efforts to engage the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran in dialogue about Iran's nuclear \n     program and its international commitments under the Treaty on \n     the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty'');\n       Whereas representatives of the P5+1 countries (the United \n     States, France, Germany, the People's Republic of China, the \n     Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom) and \n     representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran held \n     negotiations on Iran's nuclear program in Istanbul, Turkey on \n     April 14, 2012, and these discussions are set to resume in \n     Baghdad, Iraq on May 23, 2012;\n       Whereas, on March 31, 2010, President Obama stated that the \n     ``consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran are unacceptable'';\n       Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, \n     2012, President Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: \n     America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \n     weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve \n     that goal.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon'';\n       Whereas Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated, in \n     December 2011, that it was unacceptable for Iran to acquire \n     nuclear weapons, reaffirmed that all options were on the \n     table to thwart Iran's nuclear weapons efforts, and vowed \n     that if the United States gets ``intelligence that they are \n     proceeding with developing a nuclear weapon then we will take \n     whatever steps necessary to stop it'';\n       Whereas the Department of Defense's January 2012 Strategic \n     Guidance stated that United States defense efforts in the \n     Middle East would be aimed ``to prevent Iran's development of \n     a nuclear weapons capability and counter its destabilizing \n     policies''; and\n       Whereas, on April 2, 2012, President Obama stated, ``All \n     the evidence indicates that the Iranians are trying to \n     develop the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. They might \n     decide that, once they have that capacity that they'd hold \n     off right at the edge in order not to incur more sanctions. \n     But, if they've got nuclear weapons-building capacity and \n     they are flouting international resolutions, that creates \n     huge destabilizing effects in the region and will trigger an \n     arms race in the Middle East that is bad for U.S. national \n     security but is also bad for the entire world.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to proceed very briefly on my leader time. \nI ask consent that the next vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to \nS. 2535 be vitiated and the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 4089, which is at the desk and is the House-\npassed Sportsmen's Heritage Act, the bill be read a third time and \npassed with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  For the record, again, this will allow a bill to get to the \nPresident's desk immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the House \nbill is this big. It has three provisions. The bill we are going to \nvote on has 20, supported by over 50 groups--NRA, Ducks Unlimited, and \nmore than 50 others, a wonderful piece of legislation that is robust, \nit is conclusive, and it is not partisan. It is a very good piece of \nlegislation. It should be widely accepted. It is a fine piece of \nlegislation supported by conservation groups, sportsmen's groups all \nover America.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, we could have tonight \npassed the House-passed Sportsmen's bill. It would have gone straight \nto the President for signature. That having been thwarted by our \nfriends on the other side, I certainly think it is appropriate to vote \nto proceed to the measure before us and I intend to vote aye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided. The \nSenator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, as the majority leader pointed out, this \nSportsmen's Act is a compilation of 19 bills. Hunting season has \nalready started. This bill benefits 90 million Americans who hunt, \nfish, and watch wildlife,\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\nsupported by 56 groups from the Nature Conservancy to the NRA. It \nreduces our deficit by some $7 million due to net gain over 10 years. \nThis is an economic driver of outdoor industry, some $646 billion in \ndirect spending to our economy. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to \nproceed and since it is 20 after 1, I would like to have a voice vote \non it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to explain my vote in support of \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3525, the Sportsmen's Act of \n2012. I am supporting cloture in an effort to move this important bill \nforward. It is a compilation of almost 20 different pieces of \nlegislation that are important to the sportsmen's community. The \nSportsmen's Act will increase habitat conservation while improving \naccess to recreational fishing and hunting lands. The Senate deserves \nthe chance to debate this bill, and I support invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed in an effort to make it the pending business before \nthe Senate.\n  However, I want to voice my opposition to a provision in this bill \ndealing with polar bears. The provision would allow hunters who killed \npolar bears in Canada before a ban was put in place to bring their \nremains into the United States. I believe this provision could \nencourage further hunting of polar bears, increase demand for polar \nbear trophies, and lead to a rise in poaching or illegal trade of polar \nbear parts. It could also stimulate demand for other exotic and \nendangered animal parts from around the globe.\n  Polar bears are currently listed as threatened under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Their habitat is being threatened by global warming. We \nneed to do everything we can to curb the hunting of these creatures for \nsport and avoid the unintended consequence of putting polar bears and \nother endangered species at risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3525, a bill to protect and enhance \nopportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting, and for \nother purposes be brought to a close?\n  The yeas are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I have been asked on a number of occasions \nby Senator Levin and Senator McCain what we are going to do on the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by me \nafter consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 419, S. 3254, the Defense authorization bill; and that \nonly relevant amendments be in order on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am very \ndisappointed in this request. Senator McCain has been asking that the \nleader take up the Defense authorization bill for weeks. This evening \nhe tried very hard to get agreement from the Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of the committee, and others to try to work out a way that we \ncould take up this bill right after we come back or at some point after \nwe come back after the election.\n  After he leaves the Chamber, and after virtually everybody is gone, \nat 1:40 in the morning the majority leader asks unanimous consent to \ntake up the bill limited to relevant amendments. Now that would be fine \nwith me, and I am sure it is fine with Senator McCain, but everybody \nknows you can't get unanimous consent of your colleagues when they are \nall gone at 1:40 a.m. in the morning without any advanced notice that \nthe request was going to be made.\n  As a result--though I would be happy personally to agree to the \nrequest--we don't know what our Members would agree to and whether they \nwould agree to limiting this to relevant amendments. To me that is the \nonly thing that seems to be out of order, but obviously we can't agree \nto it because we can't hotline this at this time of the evening and get \nconsent from our Members.\n  What mostly bothers me is the implication, therefore, that the leader \nis all for taking it up and it is the Republicans who are objecting. I \nhope anyone who is aware of what has been going on here appreciates the \nfact that no one wants to go to the Defense authorization bill more \nthan my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, and our leader, Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  With great regret and only because at this time of morning there is \nno way to survey our Members to see whether they would agree to the \nrequest, we have no option but to object.\n  I would certainly hope the leader would contact Senator McCain. He \nleft the Chamber now, but perhaps he could contact him tomorrow or the \nnext day and ask if we can begin to work this out and allow us to talk \nto our Members so when we come back we can take up the Defense \nauthorization bill. We should.\n  The Republican Members of this body want to do so, and I would hope \nwe could work that out so it could be dealt with in the very early days \nafter the election.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I said I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin has consulted with John McCain \nin regard to this matter. Senator McCain knew this was going to happen. \nThat is what the chairman of the committee told me, and Senator Levin \nhas never misled me ever. Again, it is obvious the bill is being held \nup. So I am not surprised. This has been going on for 6 months.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield for one \nquestion from me?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my question is, Is the Senator saying that \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\nMcCain was aware the Senator was going to make this request tonight in \nthe form it was made?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Levin gave this to me and said he already talked to \nSenator McCain about this.\n  Mr. KYL. I know they talked all evening long, but I am not sure that \nSenator McCain was made aware that the Senator would propose this \ntonight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first learned about this several hours ago \nfrom Senator Levin, so I take him at his word.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Senate Republicans' partisan obstructionism \nhas reached a new low. There are 17 district court nominees pending \nbefore the Senate, and 12 of them would fill judicial emergency \nvacancies on our Federal trial courts. In an unprecedented breaking \nfrom our tradition, Senate Republicans have decided that they will \nrecess for the election and deny almost all of these consensus nominees \nconfirmation. Worse, they have decided to extend the delays that \nAmericans face in our overburdened Federal courts by denying new judges \nto those courts. We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. By \ndenying confirmation votes to 15 of these 17 nominations, Senate \nRepublicans are denying justice to the American people. By refusing to \nvote on these 15 nominations, Senate Republicans have declared that \nthey are unconcerned about the millions of Americans who will continue \nto lack adequate access to our Federal courts and speedy justice.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6609, September 21, 2012, the Record reads: The \nnominations were confirmed. JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Senate \nRepublicans' partisan obstructionism\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The nominations \nwere confirmed. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Republicans' \npartisans obstructionism\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Sadly this is just one more example of Senate Republicans putting \npartisanship ahead of the interests of the American people. The refusal \nto allow votes on consensus nominees has become standard operating \nprocedure for Senate Republicans. They refused to vote on 10 judicial \nnominees at the end of 2009, left 19 judicial nominees pending at the \nend of 2010, and blocked votes on 19 judicial nominees pending at the \nend of 2011. It took through May of this year to clean up the backlog \nleft from last year. Then in June Senate Republicans declared their \nshutdown of confirmations. I have served in the Senate for 37 years, \nand I have never seen so many judicial nominees, reported with \nbipartisan support, be denied a simple up-or-down vote for four months, \nfive months, six months, even 11 months. I have never seen such twisted \napplications of their ``Thurmond Rule'' and never have I seen the \nThurmond Rule used to block votes on consensus district court nominees. \nAnd if there was any doubt that Senate Republicans insist on being the \nparty of ``no'', their current decision to deny votes on these highly-\nqualified, noncontroversial district court nominees, supported by their \nhome State Senators both Republican and Democratic, while our Federal \ncourts still have almost 80 vacancies, shows that they care more about \nopposing this President's nominees than helping the American people.\n  Before the American people elected Barack Obama as our President, \ndistrict court nominees were generally confirmed within a couple of \nweeks of being reported by the Judiciary Committee. This was true of \nthose nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. \nDeference was traditionally afforded to home State Senators and \ndistrict court nominees supported by home State Senators were almost \nalways confirmed unanimously.\n  However, Senate Republicans have raised the level of partisanship so \nthat district court nominees have now become wrapped around the axle of \npartisanship. And that is unfortunate. In just this year, the Majority \nLeader has been forced to file cloture on 23 of President Obama's \njudicial nominees, including 19 district court nominees. Every single \none of those 23 nominees had bipartisan support, and when the Senate \nwas finally allowed to vote on them, all of the 22 who did receive an \nup-or-down vote were confirmed with votes from both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators.\n  In spite of this unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's \nnominees, Senate Republicans are oblivious to their foot-dragging and \nthe harm it is creating for Americans seeking justice from our Federal \ncourts across the country.\n  There are currently 78 Federal judicial vacancies. Judicial vacancies \nduring the last few years have been at historically high levels and \nhave remained near or above 80 for nearly the entire first term of the \nPresident. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently \nvacant. Vacancies on the Federal courts are more than two and one half \ntimes as many as they were on this date during the first term of \nPresident Bush. That is not what any objective observer would call \n``consistent progress.''\n  The fact is that due to across-the-board obstruction by Senate \nRepublicans, we remain well behind the pace we set during President \nBush's first term. According to the Congressional Research Service, 95 \npercent of President Bush's district court nominees were confirmed in \nhis first term. We would have had to confirm all 17 of the district \ncourt nominees the Majority Leader sought consent earlier this week, \njust to get close to parity with that level. Moreover, President \nObama's district court nominees have been consistently stalled, being \nforced to wait nearly three times longer for a Senate vote once \nreported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Nor has the Senate even been allowed to keep pace with the progress \nthat Senate Democrats made on President Bush's district court nominees \nin 2008, the last year of his presidency. That year, the Committee \nreported 24 district court nominees and all 24 were confirmed. We \ncontinued holding hearings and the Committee reported and the Senate \nthen confirmed nominees into September of that presidential election \nyear. This year, the Senate has been allowed to confirm only 13 \ndistrict court nominees reported this year. Because of Republican \nobstruction, the Senate has barely accomplished half of what we did in \n2008.\n  Indeed, in September 2008, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on \nand then reported 10 district court nominees, all of whom were then \nconfirmed by unanimous consent in that same month. Contrary to the \nassertion from the Republican leader, they were not backed up and long \ndelayed. We did not do what Senate Republicans are now doing. We moved \npromptly on consensus trial court nominees. This year,\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nRepublicans have backlogged consensus nominees who were reported in \nApril, five months ago. None of these nominees has been pending for \nless than seven weeks. To date, the Senate has been allowed to confirm \none district court nominee this September while 17 other Federal trial \ncourt nominees await Republicans agreeing to a vote so that they can be \nconfirmed and get to work for the American people.\n  There are still far too many judicial vacancies and the Republican \nleader's efforts to slice and dice various numbers in ways most \nflattering to this obstruction do nothing to explain why we cannot make \nmore progress. The Majority Leader is not ``jamming'' through nominees \nwhen he asks for votes that should have taken place before the Memorial \nDay, Fourth of July, and August recesses.\n  Despite the Republican filibuster against Caitlin Halligan to serve \non the D.C. Circuit, Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to serve on the Third \nCircuit; their filibuster of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to serve \non the Fourth Circuit; their opposition to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \nJustice Elena Kagan, Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to serve on the \nSixth Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to serve on the Second \nCircuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to serve on the Sixth \nCircuit, Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to serve on the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Stephanie Thacker of West Virginia to serve on the Fourth \nCircuit, Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to serve on the Ninth \nCircuit, Judge Nancy Freudenthal of the District of Wyoming, Judge \nBenita Pearson of the Northern District of Ohio, Judge Susan Hickey of \nthe Western District of Arkansas, Judge Ali Nathan of the Southern \nDistrict of New York, Judge Cathy Bissoon of the Western District of \nPennsylvania, Judge Yvonne Rogers of the Northern District of \nCalifornia, Judge Sharon Gleason of the District of Alaska, Judge Cathy \nBencivengo of the Southern District of California, Judge Margo Brodie \nof the Eastern District of New York, Judge Beth Phillips of the Western \nDistrict of Missouri, Judge Gina Groh of the Northern District of West \nVirginia, Judge Ronnie Abrams of the Southern District of New York, \nJudge Susie Morgan of the Eastern District of Louisiana, Judge Miranda \nDu of the District of Nevada and Judge Mary Lewis of the District of \nSouth Carolina, there is one area in which we have been able to make \nprogress is spite of Senate Republican obstruction. With the \nconfirmation last week of Judge Stephanie Rose to the district court in \nIowa, President Obama has already, in his fourth year in office, \nappointed as many women to the Federal bench as President Bush had in \nall eight years in which he was President. I hope that all Americans \nare proud of President Obama's outstanding effort to increase diversity \nin the Federal judiciary and to ensure that it better reflects all \nAmericans. Those commendable efforts are not preventing votes on the 17 \nFederal trial court nominees ready for final Senate action. Senate \nRepublicans are preventing those votes.\n  I wish Senate Republicans approached this as something other than an \nill-conceived game of tit for tat. This obstruction has real costs to \nthe American people. Last week I inserted in the Record an article \nabout the ``Human Costs of Judicial Confirmation Delays.'' The author, \nAndrew Cohen, described the problems facing just one of our Nation's 94 \ndistrict courts. In the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where there \nare two judicial emergency vacancies, a litigant had to wait nearly two \nmonths for an ``urgent injunction hearing'' because there ``simply \naren't enough federal judges in the Middle District of Pennsylvania to \nhandle his case.'' In that District, senior judges have had to take on \nfar more cases than they would otherwise. Four of those senior judges \nare at least 86 years old. The Chief Judge of that district called it \nan ``absurdity.'' It is not fair to the senior judges, and it is not \nfair to the litigants who rely on the court to do justice. Two of the \nFederal trial court nominees being held hostage by Senate Republicans \nwould fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.\n  This is just one example of the damage done to our courts by \nneedlessly delayed confirmations. I have heard from judges around the \ncountry whose courts have vacancies, including in Illinois and Florida. \nThey are working hard to keep their courts functioning, but they need \nhelp to ensure that all Americans have access to courts and to justice. \nThere are also judicial emergency vacancies in California, New York and \nIllinois that we could have filled this week but Senate Republicans \nobjected. Of the 17 district court nominees pending before the Senate a \ndozen would fill judicial emergency vacancies.\n  These longstanding vacancies are harming the American people, but it \ndoes not have to be this way. Americans seeking justice in Federal \ntrial courts in California, Connecticut, and Utah should not have to \nwait five months for a judge because Senate Republicans will not \nproceed with nominations that have bipartisan support and have been \nconsidered and voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Americans in \nFlorida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and \nOklahoma should not have to wait four and five extra months for their \ncourtrooms to have judges. If we were keeping pace with what Senate \nDemocrats did in President Bush's first term and as recently as 2008, \nthose nominees would be confirmed. They would be hearing cases and \nproviding justice today.\n  Some Senate Republicans have sought to justify their inaction on \nnominations by complaining that the President has not sent us enough \nnominees. The fact is that there are 17 district court nominees who can \nbe confirmed right now, including 12 who would fill emergency \nvacancies. The names of these 17 nominees have been printed in the \nSenate Executive Calendar every day for the last several months, every \nday since they were voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee months \nago. There is no excuse for not acting on them.\n  Today the Senate finally voted on the nomination of Gonzalo Curiel to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of California. He has the support of his home State \nSenators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. His nomination was \nreported with a virtually unanimous voice vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee five months ago. The only objection came as a protest on \nanother issue by Senator Lee.\n  Judge Curiel currently serves as a judge on the Superior Court of \nCalifornia in San Diego County. Prior to joining the State bench in \n2006, Judge Curiel spent 17 years as a Federal prosecutor and 10 years \nin private practice. As a Federal prosecutor he rose to become Chief of \nthe Narcotics Enforcement Section for the Southern District of \nCalifornia, and led the successful investigation and prosecution of a \nmultibillion dollar trafficking organization responsible for over 100 \ndrug-related murders in the United States and Mexico.\n  The Senate finally voted on the nomination of Robert Shelby to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Utah. He is currently a shareholder at the Salt Lake City law firm \nof Snow, Christensen & Martineau. After law school he served as a law \nclerk to Judge J. Thomas Greene in the District of Utah, the same court \nto which he is nominated. His nomination, which has the support of both \nof Utah's Senators, Senator Hatch and Senator Lee, was reported nearly \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote nearly five months \nago.\n  Further delays on the 15 additional district court nominees still \nawaiting their confirmation votes do not help the American people. \nThese nominees should be providing justice for the American people. \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said recently that this extreme \npartisanship erodes the public's confidence in our courts and ``makes \nthe judiciary look politicized when it is not, and it has to stop.'' He \nis right. If Senate Republicans have a good reason for why courts in \nCalifornia and Illinois and Michigan and New York and Pennsylvania \nshould remain overburdened and unable to provide the quality and speedy \njustice Americans deserve, then I wish they would let the American \npeople know what that reason is. The fact is, Senate Republicans have \nnot explained their unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's \nconsensus\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nnominees, they just try to pretend it does not exist. The American \npeople know better, and they deserve better.\n  Americans are rightfully proud of our legal system and its promise of \naccess to justice and speedy trials. This promise is embedded in our \nConstitution. When overburdened courts made it hard to keep this \ncenturies-old promise, the Senate should work in a bipartisan manner to \nfill judgeships and to create and fill new judgeships. That is what \nSenate Democrats did when Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George \nW. Bush were President. Since the American people elected President \nObama, Senate Republicans have determined that they are no longer \ninterested in whether or not our courts are able to meet this \nfundamental guarantee. They have decided that it is acceptable for \nhardworking Americans to wait two months for ``urgent'' hearings, and \nthat the ten additional judicial emergency vacancies they could fill \nright now should remain vacant for no good reason. The American people \ndeserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6609-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6609-S6611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Republicans' partisan obstructionism \nhas reached a new low. There are 17 district court nominees pending \nbefore the Senate, and 12 of them would fill judicial emergency \nvacancies on our Federal trial courts. In an unprecedented breaking \nfrom our tradition, Senate Republicans have decided that they will \nrecess for the election and deny almost all of these consensus nominees \nconfirmation. Worse, they have decided to extend the delays that \nAmericans face in our overburdened Federal courts by denying new judges \nto those courts. We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. By \ndenying confirmation votes to 15 of these 17 nominations, Senate \nRepublicans are denying justice to the American people. By refusing to \nvote on these 15 nominations, Senate Republicans have declared that \nthey are unconcerned about the millions of Americans who will continue \nto lack adequate access to our Federal courts and speedy justice.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6609, September 21, 2012, the Record reads: The \nnominations were confirmed. JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Senate \nRepublicans' partisan obstructionism\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The nominations \nwere confirmed. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Republicans' \npartisans obstructionism\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Sadly this is just one more example of Senate Republicans putting \npartisanship ahead of the interests of the American people. The refusal \nto allow votes on consensus nominees has become standard operating \nprocedure for Senate Republicans. They refused to vote on 10 judicial \nnominees at the end of 2009, left 19 judicial nominees pending at the \nend of 2010, and blocked votes on 19 judicial nominees pending at the \nend of 2011. It took through May of this year to clean up the backlog \nleft from last year. Then in June Senate Republicans declared their \nshutdown of confirmations. I have served in the Senate for 37 years, \nand I have never seen so many judicial nominees, reported with \nbipartisan support, be denied a simple up-or-down vote for four months, \nfive months, six months, even 11 months. I have never seen such twisted \napplications of their ``Thurmond Rule'' and never have I seen the \nThurmond Rule used to block votes on consensus district court nominees. \nAnd if there was any doubt that Senate Republicans insist on being the \nparty of ``no'', their current decision to deny votes on these highly-\nqualified, noncontroversial district court nominees, supported by their \nhome State Senators both Republican and Democratic, while our Federal \ncourts still have almost 80 vacancies, shows that they care more about \nopposing this President's nominees than helping the American people.\n  Before the American people elected Barack Obama as our President, \ndistrict court nominees were generally confirmed within a couple of \nweeks of being reported by the Judiciary Committee. This was true of \nthose nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. \nDeference was traditionally afforded to home State Senators and \ndistrict court nominees supported by home State Senators were almost \nalways confirmed unanimously.\n  However, Senate Republicans have raised the level of partisanship so \nthat district court nominees have now become wrapped around the axle of \npartisanship. And that is unfortunate. In just this year, the Majority \nLeader has been forced to file cloture on 23 of President Obama's \njudicial nominees, including 19 district court nominees. Every single \none of those 23 nominees had bipartisan support, and when the Senate \nwas finally allowed to vote on them, all of the 22 who did receive an \nup-or-down vote were confirmed with votes from both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators.\n  In spite of this unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's \nnominees, Senate Republicans are oblivious to their foot-dragging and \nthe harm it is creating for Americans seeking justice from our Federal \ncourts across the country.\n  There are currently 78 Federal judicial vacancies. Judicial vacancies \nduring the last few years have been at historically high levels and \nhave remained near or above 80 for nearly the entire first term of the \nPresident. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently \nvacant. Vacancies on the Federal courts are more than two and one half \ntimes as many as they were on this date during the first term of \nPresident Bush. That is not what any objective observer would call \n``consistent progress.''\n  The fact is that due to across-the-board obstruction by Senate \nRepublicans, we remain well behind the pace we set during President \nBush's first term. According to the Congressional Research Service, 95 \npercent of President Bush's district court nominees were confirmed in \nhis first term. We would have had to confirm all 17 of the district \ncourt nominees the Majority Leader sought consent earlier this week, \njust to get close to parity with that level. Moreover, President \nObama's district court nominees have been consistently stalled, being \nforced to wait nearly three times longer for a Senate vote once \nreported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Nor has the Senate even been allowed to keep pace with the progress \nthat Senate Democrats made on President Bush's district court nominees \nin 2008, the last year of his presidency. That year, the Committee \nreported 24 district court nominees and all 24 were confirmed. We \ncontinued holding hearings and the Committee reported and the Senate \nthen confirmed nominees into September of that presidential election \nyear. This year, the Senate has been allowed to confirm only 13 \ndistrict court nominees reported this year. Because of Republican \nobstruction, the Senate has barely accomplished half of what we did in \n2008.\n  Indeed, in September 2008, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on \nand then reported 10 district court nominees, all of whom were then \nconfirmed by unanimous consent in that same month. Contrary to the \nassertion from the Republican leader, they were not backed up and long \ndelayed. We did not do what Senate Republicans are now doing. We moved \npromptly on consensus trial court nominees. This year,\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nRepublicans have backlogged consensus nominees who were reported in \nApril, five months ago. None of these nominees has been pending for \nless than seven weeks. To date, the Senate has been allowed to confirm \none district court nominee this September while 17 other Federal trial \ncourt nominees await Republicans agreeing to a vote so that they can be \nconfirmed and get to work for the American people.\n  There are still far too many judicial vacancies and the Republican \nleader's efforts to slice and dice various numbers in ways most \nflattering to this obstruction do nothing to explain why we cannot make \nmore progress. The Majority Leader is not ``jamming'' through nominees \nwhen he asks for votes that should have taken place before the Memorial \nDay, Fourth of July, and August recesses.\n  Despite the Republican filibuster against Caitlin Halligan to serve \non the D.C. Circuit, Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to serve on the Third \nCircuit; their filibuster of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to serve \non the Fourth Circuit; their opposition to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \nJustice Elena Kagan, Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to serve on the \nSixth Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to serve on the Second \nCircuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to serve on the Sixth \nCircuit, Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to serve on the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Stephanie Thacker of West Virginia to serve on the Fourth \nCircuit, Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to serve on the Ninth \nCircuit, Judge Nancy Freudenthal of the District of Wyoming, Judge \nBenita Pearson of the Northern District of Ohio, Judge Susan Hickey of \nthe Western District of Arkansas, Judge Ali Nathan of the Southern \nDistrict of New York, Judge Cathy Bissoon of the Western District of \nPennsylvania, Judge Yvonne Rogers of the Northern District of \nCalifornia, Judge Sharon Gleason of the District of Alaska, Judge Cathy \nBencivengo of the Southern District of California, Judge Margo Brodie \nof the Eastern District of New York, Judge Beth Phillips of the Western \nDistrict of Missouri, Judge Gina Groh of the Northern District of West \nVirginia, Judge Ronnie Abrams of the Southern District of New York, \nJudge Susie Morgan of the Eastern District of Louisiana, Judge Miranda \nDu of the District of Nevada and Judge Mary Lewis of the District of \nSouth Carolina, there is one area in which we have been able to make \nprogress is spite of Senate Republican obstruction. With the \nconfirmation last week of Judge Stephanie Rose to the district court in \nIowa, President Obama has already, in his fourth year in office, \nappointed as many women to the Federal bench as President Bush had in \nall eight years in which he was President. I hope that all Americans \nare proud of President Obama's outstanding effort to increase diversity \nin the Federal judiciary and to ensure that it better reflects all \nAmericans. Those commendable efforts are not preventing votes on the 17 \nFederal trial court nominees ready for final Senate action. Senate \nRepublicans are preventing those votes.\n  I wish Senate Republicans approached this as something other than an \nill-conceived game of tit for tat. This obstruction has real costs to \nthe American people. Last week I inserted in the Record an article \nabout the ``Human Costs of Judicial Confirmation Delays.'' The author, \nAndrew Cohen, described the problems facing just one of our Nation's 94 \ndistrict courts. In the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where there \nare two judicial emergency vacancies, a litigant had to wait nearly two \nmonths for an ``urgent injunction hearing'' because there ``simply \naren't enough federal judges in the Middle District of Pennsylvania to \nhandle his case.'' In that District, senior judges have had to take on \nfar more cases than they would otherwise. Four of those senior judges \nare at least 86 years old. The Chief Judge of that district called it \nan ``absurdity.'' It is not fair to the senior judges, and it is not \nfair to the litigants who rely on the court to do justice. Two of the \nFederal trial court nominees being held hostage by Senate Republicans \nwould fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.\n  This is just one example of the damage done to our courts by \nneedlessly delayed confirmations. I have heard from judges around the \ncountry whose courts have vacancies, including in Illinois and Florida. \nThey are working hard to keep their courts functioning, but they need \nhelp to ensure that all Americans have access to courts and to justice. \nThere are also judicial emergency vacancies in California, New York and \nIllinois that we could have filled this week but Senate Republicans \nobjected. Of the 17 district court nominees pending before the Senate a \ndozen would fill judicial emergency vacancies.\n  These longstanding vacancies are harming the American people, but it \ndoes not have to be this way. Americans seeking justice in Federal \ntrial courts in California, Connecticut, and Utah should not have to \nwait five months for a judge because Senate Republicans will not \nproceed with nominations that have bipartisan support and have been \nconsidered and voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Americans in \nFlorida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and \nOklahoma should not have to wait four and five extra months for their \ncourtrooms to have judges. If we were keeping pace with what Senate \nDemocrats did in President Bush's first term and as recently as 2008, \nthose nominees would be confirmed. They would be hearing cases and \nproviding justice today.\n  Some Senate Republicans have sought to justify their inaction on \nnominations by complaining that the President has not sent us enough \nnominees. The fact is that there are 17 district court nominees who can \nbe confirmed right now, including 12 who would fill emergency \nvacancies. The names of these 17 nominees have been printed in the \nSenate Executive Calendar every day for the last several months, every \nday since they were voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee months \nago. There is no excuse for not acting on them.\n  Today the Senate finally voted on the nomination of Gonzalo Curiel to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of California. He has the support of his home State \nSenators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. His nomination was \nreported with a virtually unanimous voice vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee five months ago. The only objection came as a protest on \nanother issue by Senator Lee.\n  Judge Curiel currently serves as a judge on the Superior Court of \nCalifornia in San Diego County. Prior to joining the State bench in \n2006, Judge Curiel spent 17 years as a Federal prosecutor and 10 years \nin private practice. As a Federal prosecutor he rose to become Chief of \nthe Narcotics Enforcement Section for the Southern District of \nCalifornia, and led the successful investigation and prosecution of a \nmultibillion dollar trafficking organization responsible for over 100 \ndrug-related murders in the United States and Mexico.\n  The Senate finally voted on the nomination of Robert Shelby to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Utah. He is currently a shareholder at the Salt Lake City law firm \nof Snow, Christensen & Martineau. After law school he served as a law \nclerk to Judge J. Thomas Greene in the District of Utah, the same court \nto which he is nominated. His nomination, which has the support of both \nof Utah's Senators, Senator Hatch and Senator Lee, was reported nearly \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote nearly five months \nago.\n  Further delays on the 15 additional district court nominees still \nawaiting their confirmation votes do not help the American people. \nThese nominees should be providing justice for the American people. \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said recently that this extreme \npartisanship erodes the public's confidence in our courts and ``makes \nthe judiciary look politicized when it is not, and it has to stop.'' He \nis right. If Senate Republicans have a good reason for why courts in \nCalifornia and Illinois and Michigan and New York and Pennsylvania \nshould remain overburdened and unable to provide the quality and speedy \njustice Americans deserve, then I wish they would let the American \npeople know what that reason is. The fact is, Senate Republicans have \nnot explained their unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's \nconsensus\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nnominees, they just try to pretend it does not exist. The American \npeople know better, and they deserve better.\n  Americans are rightfully proud of our legal system and its promise of \naccess to justice and speedy trials. This promise is embedded in our \nConstitution. When overburdened courts made it hard to keep this \ncenturies-old promise, the Senate should work in a bipartisan manner to \nfill judgeships and to create and fill new judgeships. That is what \nSenate Democrats did when Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George \nW. Bush were President. Since the American people elected President \nObama, Senate Republicans have determined that they are no longer \ninterested in whether or not our courts are able to meet this \nfundamental guarantee. They have decided that it is acceptable for \nhardworking Americans to wait two months for ``urgent'' hearings, and \nthat the ten additional judicial emergency vacancies they could fill \nright now should remain vacant for no good reason.

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nOregon, Mr. Merkley, for working with the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, and me today to address his concerns with our bipartisan \nbill, S. 1956, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition \nAct. The amendment, which he has filed for consideration and which is \ncurrently running through the hotline process, reconfirms that the \nSecretary of Transportation's responsibility to determine there is a \npublic interest before taking any action does not end after the first \ndetermination. Instead, it is an ongoing responsibility.\n  The amendment that Mr. Merkley has filed, and which I support, \nclarifies that it is the Secretary's right to reassess the public \ninterest determination. Additionally, the amendment clarifies that if \nthe EU ETS is amended, if there is an international agreement on \naviation emissions, or if a Federal public law is enacted that \naddresses aviation emissions, that the Secretary will again revisit the \npublic interest determination.\n  Again, I would like to thank the Senator from Oregon for working with \nme, and I look forward to passage of S. 1956.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendment be considered, the Cardin and Merkley amendments at \nthe desk be agreed to, the committee-reported amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  I would also extend my appreciation to all Senators who have been \ninvolved in this contentious issue--for a while, at least--and \nespecially Senator Thune, who has helped us work through this and a \nnumber of other things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to pay taxes and \n    penalties imposed on United States air carriers pursuant to the \n                European Union emissions trading scheme)\n\n       Beginning on page 5, strike line 14 and all that follows \n     through page 6, line 2, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the institution of the Senate is unique in \nits robust protections of the rights of the minority. In establishing \nour democracy, our Founders warned of the dangers of a tyrannical \nmajority, and through our history as a country the Senate has stood, \noften alone, against that threat. One of the essential aspects of the \nSenate is the ability of 41 Senators, a minority, to defeat a measure \nif they are willing to talk and there are not 60 Senators who will vote \nto end the talking. Throughout the history of the Senate, the minority \nhas usually used its right to thwart the will of the majority \njudiciously and only on measures of the greatest importance. Without \nthat self-restraint, we would be exchanging a tyranny of the majority \nfor a tyranny of the minority, and, indeed, that could mean a tiny \nminority.\n  That important quality of self-restraint is essential for the proper \nfunctioning of the Senate. With this quality, the Senate can debate, \nnegotiate, and compromise; and without it, the result is gridlock. In a \nlegislative body where extended debate is a central principle, self-\nrestraint is what allows the gears of government to eventually turn. \nThe Senate cannot operate without it.\n  It is that self-restraint that is too often missing in today's \nSenate. It is one reason for the low public approval of Congress. In \nfact, scholars of the Congress have noted an unprecedented change in \nthe functioning of the Senate. In his testimony before the Senate Rules \nCommittee on May 19, 2010, Norm Ornstein said:\n\n       The sharp increase in cloture motions reflects the \n     routinization of the filibuster; it's used not as a tool of \n     last resort for a minority that feels intensely about a major \n     issue but as a weapon to delay and obstruct on nearly all \n     matters, including routine and widely supported ones. It is \n     fair to say that this has never happened before in the \n     history of the Senate.\n\n  Wait, some might say, the Senate seems to have plenty of debate, \nperhaps too much. But the sad fact is, in today's Senate, a small \nminority of Senators routinely block the Senate from even beginning \ndebate on legislation by filibustering or more accurately, perhaps, \nthreaten to filibuster the motion to proceed to legislation. Without 60 \nvotes to end debate on the motion to proceed, the Senate is routinely \nblocked from even beginning debate on critical legislation, making \nnegotiation and compromise on legislation far more difficult.\n  Mr. Ornstein is right. The routine threat of a filibuster is an abuse \nof the rules. Just consider the number of filibusters of the motions to \nproceed. From the time the cloture rule was first extended to cover the \nmotion to proceed in 1949 to 1990, 41 years, the Senate saw a total of \n53 filibusters on the motion to proceed. During those years, Senate \nminorities would filibuster no more than a handful of motions to \nproceed during any single Congress. In recent years, the numbers of \nfilibusters have exploded. Now, it is not uncommon for the Senate to \nsee dozens of filibusters of the motions to proceed during any single \nCongress, as has been the case in the last 2 years. Where is the self-\nrestraint?\n  Why is this so important? Why should the country care if a small \ngroup of Senators block the Senate from doing its work? What is at \nstake? In my opinion, the stakes could not be higher.\n  Over and over again, the Senate is forced to waste time just on the \nquestion of whether to begin debate on a bill. The process of \nthreatening a filibuster and requiring cloture on every motion to \nproceed, including the mandatory postcloture debate time of 30 hours \nunder the Senate rules, can consume a week of the Senate's time. That \nis a full week of the Senate's time consumed just by the question of \nwhether to begin debate on a bill. Where is the self-restraint?\n  Does self-restraint mean that Senators must abandon long-held \npositions or violate principle? Of course not. Throughout the history \nof the Senate, Senators have fought fiercely for their positions and \nbeliefs. Still, at some point, the fighting stopped and agreements were \nstruck. That is the way of every legislative body. The majority's \nability to act is what allows other legislative bodies to function. \nSelf-restraint is what separates a functioning U.S. Senate from a \nbroken one. It is what separates a Senate that is capable of doing the \nNation's business from a Senate that is prevented from even beginning a \ndebate on that business. The lack of self-restraint is the root of the \nproblem the Senate faces.\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\n  In the Senate, a tension has always existed between the majority that \nwishes to enact legislation and the minority that wishes to amend or \ndefeat it. That tension is not unique to today's Senate. The rules of \nthe Senate have always provided the minority with an arsenal of \nparliamentary weapons to counter a determined majority. For instance, \nif a majority leader blocks the minority from offering amendments to a \nbill, then the minority can filibuster the legislation and deny it \npassage if it lacks 60 votes. The ability to extend debate and deny \ncloture are powerful tools that the minority can use to prevent the \nSenate from acting.\n  On the other hand, short of 60 votes, Senate rules do not provide a \ntool for the majority to counter an obstructionist minority. The \nmajority leader could offer a minority days, weeks, or months of debate \nand endless amendments to a bill, but nothing in the rules of this body \nwould allow the majority to even begin debate if a unified minority \nfilibusters the motion to proceed, which it does now routinely.\n  Republicans insist that they filibuster motions to proceed because \nthe majority leader fills the amendment tree and blocks consideration \nof minority amendments. That rationale could justify a filibuster of a \nbill after the Senate begins its consideration and the leader fills the \ntree. It does not justify the routine filibusters of the motion to \nproceed.\n  The Senate must strike a balance between protecting the rights of the \nminority and the need of the Senate to function better. To limit the \nconsideration of the motion to proceed would not stifle debate; in \nfact, it would help ensure Senators have the opportunity to have a \ndebate.\n  As a practical matter, we will have little chance of ending the \nfilibuster on the motion to proceed unless we, at the same time, assure \nthe minority opportunities to offer and vote on amendments, forcing \nthem to filibuster the bill itself in order to gain that assurance.\n  According to the Senate rules, any change to those rules can be \nadopted by a simple majority vote. However, rule XXII of the Standing \nRules of the Senate requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the \nSenators present and voting in order to invoke cloture and end debate \non a proposed change to the rules. This extraordinarily high threshold \nhas prevented most attempts to amend the rules of the Senate.\n  Some of our colleagues believe the rules of the Senate can be changed \noutside the auspices of the Senate rules. They say the U.S. \nConstitution allows a simple majority to change the Senate rules. They \ncall it ``the constitutional option;'' others call it ``the nuclear \noption.'' Supporters of the constitutional option point out that the \nConstitution endows each House of Congress with the authority to \nestablish its own rules of proceedings. Accordingly, at the beginning \nof every Congress, the House of Representatives adopts rules by a \nmajority vote. Those rules govern proceedings of the House for only the \nterm of that Congress. Supporters of the constitutional option argue \nthe Constitution empowers the Senate to do the same.\n  The mechanics of the constitutional option are fairly \nstraightforward. One such approach to this option would occur as \nfollows. At the beginning of a Congress, a Senator would offer a \nresolution adopting Senate rules. The resolution would be filibustered, \nand so cloture would be filed. Cloture would yield an affirmative vote \nof a simple majority, but not the two-thirds necessary to end debate as \ndescribed in rule XXII. Supporters of the resolution would raise a \nconstitutional point of order, which the Presiding Officer, presumably \nthe Vice President, would sustain under this scenario. The chair's \nruling would be appealed, and finally the appeal would be tabled by a \nsimple majority vote. And just like that, the Senate could become a \nsimple majoritarian body.\n  Historically, of course, the Senate has not adopted its rules at the \nbeginning of a Congress as the House does. In fact, Senate rules \nexplicitly address this. According to rule V of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate, ``The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress \nto the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in these \nrules.'' Rule V makes clear that the Senate is a continuing body. \nIndeed, only one-third of its membership is up for election every 2 \nyears while the other two-thirds of its membership continue their \nservice into the new Congress, which is why a quorum in the Senate is \ncontinuously in being from Congress to Congress.\n  Both supporters and opponents of the constitutional option have \ncompelling arguments, but none of them are new. This question has been \ndebated for decades. Confronting the same question in 1949, Senator \nArthur Vandenberg, one of my predecessors from Michigan, said:\n\n       I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate are as \n     important to equity and order in the Senate as is the \n     Constitution to the life of the Republic, and that those \n     rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself, in \n     the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves. One of \n     the immutable truths in Washington's Farewell Address, which \n     cannot be altered even by changing events in a changing \n     world, is the following sentence: The Constitution, which at \n     any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic \n     act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.' I \n     respectfully submit as a basic explanation of my attitude, \n     that I accept this admonition without reservation, and I \n     think it is equally applicable to the situation which \n     Senators here confront, though obviously the comparison \n     cannot be lit-\n     eral. . . . [T]he Father of his Country said to us, by \n     analogy, The rules of the Senate, which at any time exist, \n     until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole \n     Senate, are sacredly obligatory upon all.'\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       I have heard it erroneously argued in the cloakrooms that \n     since the Senate rules themselves authorize a change in the \n     rules through due legislative process by a majority vote, it \n     is within the spirit of the rules when we reach the same net \n     result by a majority vote of the Senate upholding a \n     parliamentary ruling of the Vice President which, in effect, \n     changes the rules. This would appear to be some sort of \n     doctrine of amendment by proxy. It is argued that the Senate \n     itself makes the change in both instances by majority vote; \n     and it is asked, What is the difference? Of course, this is \n     really an argument that the end justifies the means.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       When a substantive change is made in the rules by \n     sustaining a ruling of the Presiding Officer of the Senate--\n     and that is what I contend is being undertaken here--it does \n     not mean that the rules are permanently changed. It simply \n     means that regardless of precedent or traditional practice, \n     the rules hereafter, mean whatever the Presiding Officer of \n     the Senate, plus a simple majority of Senators voting at the \n     time, want the rules to mean. We fit the rules to the \n     occasion, instead of fitting the occasion to the rules. \n     Therefore, in the final analysis, under such circumstances, \n     there are no rules except the transient, unregulated wishes \n     of a majority of whatever quorum is temporarily in control of \n     the Senate. That, Mr. President, is not my idea of the \n     greatest deliberative body in the world. . . . No matter how \n     important [the pending issue's] immediate incidence may seem \n     to many today, the integrity of the Senate's rules is our \n     paramount concern, today, tomorrow, and so long as this great \n     institution lives.\n\n  Mr. President, the November elections are upon us. I believe it is \nimportant to lay out my position on the constitutional option now, \nbefore we know the outcome of the election and the makeup of the Senate \nnext year. I believe one's position on this question is so essential to \nthe nature and the future of the Senate that it should not be dependent \nupon the outcome of an election but upon the best interests of this \ninstitution.\n  I believe the so-called constitutional option to change the rules of \nthe Senate, if actually implemented, would turn the Senate into a \nlegislative body where the majority can, whenever it wishes, run \nroughshod over the rights of the minority. My frustration with the \nrecent abuses of the rules does not overwhelm my duty to defend the \nuniqueness and integrity of this great institution.\n  With that in mind, I suggest a change to the Senate rules that would \nprovide the majority leader with an additional procedural option that \npreserves his ability to control the floor while maintaining the \nnecessary 60-vote threshold to end debate. This alternative procedure \nwould avoid the filibuster on the motion to proceed, preserve the \nability of the majority leader to fill the amendment tree, but at the \nsame time ensure all Senators have the ability to offer and have votes \non relevant, timely filed amendments prior to a vote on final passage \nof a measure.\n  Using this procedure, the majority leader could move to proceed to \nthe consideration of a measure with only\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nrelevant amendments in order. When a motion to proceed is made in such \nform, the consideration of that motion would be limited to 2 hours. If \nthe Senate adopted that motion, then Senators would have until 1 p.m. \nthe following session day to file relevant, first-degree amendments and \nuntil 1 p.m. the session day after that to file relevant, second-degree \namendments.\n  This procedure would guarantee that any Senator who has a timely \nfiled, relevant amendment could offer that amendment prior to final \npassage, even if the amendment tree is filled. For example, if the \nSenate is considering a bill under this procedure and the amendment \ntree is filled, following disposition of all pending amendments but \nprior to the third reading, it would be in order for any Senator with a \nrelevant, timely filed amendment to call up that amendment. Once \npending, that amendment would need to be disposed of before final \npassage.\n  While this procedure would expedite the process to begin \nconsideration of a bill, it would not abandon the essential principle \nthat a supermajority is necessary to bring debate to a close on a bill \nin the Senate. Nothing under this procedure would deny Senators his or \nher right to extended debate on a bill, unless, of course, 60 or more \nSenators vote to invoke cloture. Aside from the filing deadlines, the \nonly substantive change from the current cloture process would be the \napplication of a relevancy standard rather than the conventional \ngermaneness standard. Only relevant amendments would be in order only \nif the majority leader opted to use this alternative approach to moving \nto proceed.\n  This procedure would not be needed or even appropriate for every bill \nthat is placed on the calendar. But for some bills, the majority leader \nmight view this alternative procedure as a useful tool that could help \nboth the majority and the minority achieve their aims. And should this \nalternative procedure prove to be ineffective, the majority leader \ncould always abandon it for regular order, and if the right to get \nvotes on relevant amendments is abused by filing a dilatory number of \nrelevant amendments, the majority leader would simply not utilize the \noption.\n  As I said, an election season is upon us. We will soon recess, and \nonly after November 6 will we know who will hold a majority in this \nbody. My support for ending the current motion to proceed process will \nbe there after the election, regardless which party controls the Senate \nin the next Congress. My goal is not to gain partisan advantage but to \nprotect the unique role of the Senate. Increasingly, after facing years \nof excessive obstruction, some Members on my side of the aisle see the \nfilibuster as an archaic procedure that prevents the Senate from \naddressing the pressing needs of the Nation. I suspect that some of my \nfriends in the minority today, if in the majority sometime in the \nfuture, will find the filibuster equally frustrating to their own \nefforts. We face an increasing danger that, in order to end the \ngridlock that prevents either side from offering solutions to the \nchallenges we face, pressure to severely reduce minority rights will \nbecome irresistible.\n  If we are to preserve the Senate's function as a check on haste, as a \nhaven for minority views, we must ensure that protection of minority \nrights is no longer a barrier to any and all action. Limiting excessive \nfilibusters on the motion to proceed is one modest change we can make \nthat addresses this crisis without changing the Senate's fundamental \ncharacter. I ask my colleagues to consider carefully whether a change \nin the present might be necessary to avoid more radical change in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6614-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING NEIL A. ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the life \nand career of Neil A. Armstrong. Americans and people around the world \npaused when Mr. Armstrong passed away on August 25, 2012, to recall his \nheroic accomplishments and historic legacy.\n  Neil Armstrong is remembered as a man who pushed the frontiers of \nspace exploration and engineering. Over the course of his life and \nservice to the Nation, he promoted the idea of never doubting what is \npossible. He inspired countless young men and women to pursue careers \nin science and engineering, many of whom became aeronautics workers at \nfacilities like the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.\n  Mr. Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, OH, on August 5, 1930. He \nreceived a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Perdue \nUniversity, a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from the \nUniversity of California, and received honorary doctorates from \nmultiple universities.\n  Mr. Armstrong embarked on a remarkable career that would involve his \nflying more than 200 different models of aircraft including jets, \nrockets, helicopters and gliders.\n  From 1949 to 1952, Mr. Armstrong served as a naval aviator, and in \n1955 joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, now the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. From 1955 through 1972, \nhe served as an engineer, test pilot, astronaut, and administrator for \nour Nation's ambitious space program.\n  Mr. Armstrong's transfer to astronaut status in 1962 led to his \nperforming the first successful docking of two vehicles in space in \nMarch 1966 as the command pilot for Gemini 8. Mr. Armstrong \nsubsequently became commander for Apollo 11, the first manned lunar \nmission, and was the first man to land a craft on the moon. At 10:56 \np.m. ET on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first man to step \non the surface of the moon. It was one of the defining moments of the \n20th century and one of the proudest days for the American people.\n  Following his career with NASA, Mr. Armstrong was a Professor of \nAerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati between 1971 and \n1979. Mr. Armstrong was decorated by 17 countries and was the recipient \nof many special honors including: the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nthe Congressional Gold Medal, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, \nthe Explorers Club Medal, the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, the \nNASA Distinguished Service Medal, the Harmon International Aviation \nTrophy, the Royal Geographic Society's Gold Medal, the Federal \nAeronautique Internationale's Gold Space Medal, the American \nAstronautical Society Flight Achievement Award, the Robert J. Collier \nTrophy, the AIAA Astronautics Award, the Octave Chanute Award, and the \nJohn J. Montgomery Award.\n  Mr. Armstrong will be remembered not only for his famous words as he \nstepped foot on the moon--``That's one small step for a man, one giant \nleap for mankind''--but more importantly for inspiring generations of \npeople around the world to explore and push the boundaries of what they \nbelieve is possible. Neil Armstrong was a true American hero who will \nbe missed by many, but never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6614-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6614-S6616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE ACA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court decision on the \nAffordable Care Act has put the brakes on Medicaid expansion for now.\n  The Federal Government can no longer force States to expand their \nMedicaid programs.\n  With the expansion and the billions of dollars that States would have \nhad to spend on hold, and as we look at solutions to address our 16 \ntrillion dollar national debt, now is a good time for us to step back \nand ask what role health care should play for States in our Federal \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, as of today, the primary function of a state is health \nadministration--not primary and secondary education, not public safety, \nnot roads and bridges.\n  According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, \nMedicaid is the single largest spending line in state budgets at 23.6 \npercent.\n  The economic downturn and high unemployment have resulted in an \nincrease in Medicaid enrollment as individuals lose job-based coverage \nand incomes decline.\n  Medicaid enrollment increased by 5.1 percent during fiscal 2011 and \nis estimated to increase by 3.3 percent in fiscal 2012.\n  In governors' recommended budgets for fiscal 2013, Medicaid \nenrollment would rise by an additional 3.6 percent.\n  This would represent a 12.5 percent increase in Medicaid enrollment \nover this three year period.\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\n  Medicaid enrollment surged during the economic downturn with \nenrollment rising by 7.2 percent from June 2009 to June 2010.\n  Although Medicaid enrollment is easing for now, the implementation of \nthe Affordable Care Act would have greatly increased the individuals \nserved in the Medicaid program in 2014 and thereafter.\n  The Affordable Care Act, as passed, required States to cover all \nchildless adults beginning in 2014 under Medicaid that heretofore had \nnot been covered.\n  The expansion to 138 percent of the poverty level was expected to \ncover 16 million people.\n  States would get 100 percent of the cost of new individuals enrolled \npaid for by the Federal Government for the first several years before \nthe Federal payment levels for those new individuals would fall to \napproximately 92 percent.\n  The Supreme Court rejected the mandatory expansion.\n  Quoting from the Supreme Court ruling\n\n       The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State's overall \n     budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no \n     real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.\n\n  The Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a \nmodification of the existing program, and that this modification is \npermissible because Congress reserved the ``right to alter, amend, or \nrepeal any provision'' of Medicaid.\n  But the expansion accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree.\n  The original program was designed to cover medical services for \nparticular categories of vulnerable individuals.\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program \nto meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with \nincome below 133 percent of the poverty level.\n  A State could hardly anticipate that Congress's reservation of the \nright to alter or amend the Medicaid program included the power to \ntransform it so dramatically.\n  The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening \nStates with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline \nto comply with the expansion.\n  As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, the Federal Government can \nno longer threaten the States with withdrawal of all Federal Medicaid \nfunding if States do not expand their Medicaid programs.\n  States now have the option to expand coverage.\n  Several States have now suggested they will not expand in 2014.\n  The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that only one-third of \nthe potential newly eligible population will reside in States that \nchoose to fully extend coverage.\n  According to CBO, about one-half of the potential newly eligible \npopulation will reside in States that only partially extend Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  The remainder, about one-sixth of the potential newly eligible \npopulation, will reside in States that do not extend Medicaid coverage \nat all in the next decade.\n  CBO's predicted Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act has \nbeen reduced by 35 percent.\n  Clearly CBO accepts the proposition that if States are not forced to \nextend coverage to the ACA mandatory population, they will not.\n  Mr. President, right before the August recess my office released a \nreport from the Government Accountability Office on State capacity to \nmeet the Medicaid requirements under the ACA.\n  It shows why CBO's skepticism is appropriate.\n  The report discusses challenges States are facing with information \ntechnology, guidance from CMS, and the budgetary uncertainty of \nincreased enrollment of those currently eligible for Medicaid.\n  The GAO surveyed the States and found that the vast majority expect \nto have additional costs related to administering their current \nprogram, developing eligibility systems, enrolling newly eligible \nindividuals and enrolling additional individuals who are currently \neligible.\n  The GAO focused particularly on the challenges faced by States in \nupdating their eligibility systems.\n  In the report, GAO found four main deterrents to States as they \nconsider the challenge of expanding their eligibility systems to meet \nthe goal of Medicaid expansion.\n  First, many States face a lengthy procurement process as they look to \nupgrade their technology to handle expansion.\n  Second, designing new eligibility systems is complex and may involve \nthe replacement of existing, outdated systems.\n  Third, States often have systems that operate across multiple \nprograms further increasing the cost and complexity of upgrading.\n  Fourth, as States have fought against their own budgetary problems, \nmany have reduced personnel resources to manage projects as complex as \nMedicaid expansion.\n  The GAO further found problems with the guidance CMS has been \nproviding the States.\n  30 of the 36 responding to the GAO survey found that CMS guidance was \nonly slightly useful or not useful at all.\n  Mr. President, many outside observers have treated the expansion of \nMedicaid as a foregone conclusion, that States couldn't possibly turn \ndown so much supposedly ``free money.''\n  The evidence from CBO and GAO is crystal clear.\n  When the Federal Government is involved, there's no such thing as a \nfree lunch.\n  States absolutely can turn down the option to expand and every State \nfaces a difficult decision in how they choose to move forward.\n  However, Mr. President, the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care \nAct is not the only fiscal pressure States face from the health care \nadministration.\n  One of the most expensive and complex populations receiving Federal \nhealth care services are those dually eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid, commonly referred to as DUALS.\n  They are poorer, sicker and often in need of more extensive and \nexpensive coordinated care.\n  The inefficiency created in the misaligned incentives of the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs is frequently cited as one of the areas in health \ncare in greatest need of reform.\n  The Affordable Care Act created an office in CMS charged with \ncreating demonstration projects to allow for greater coordination of \ndual eligibles.\n  Those demonstration projects have been moving forward at breakneck \npace with as many as 26 States looking to participate.\n  Essentially all the demonstrations seek to give States greater \ncontrol of the acute care of dual eligibles.\n  CMS has legal authority under the ACA to take these demonstrations \nnationally if they are successful.\n  Many outside groups are concerned about the size, scope and pace at \nwhich demonstrations are proceeding citing California's initial \nproposal to take control of one million dual eligibles as an example of \nthe outsized nature of the demonstrations.\n  In July, Senator Rockefeller wrote a strongly worded letter to CMS \nsuggesting they should halt the demonstrations for similar reasons.\n  Mr. President, no one argues that the way Medicare and Medicaid \ncoordinate for dual eligibles works.\n  Coordination today is akin to asking my wife and me to compose a \nletter with her writing the consonants and my writing the vowels.\n  Giving the States greater control of duals may be the right answer, \nbut when you consider the fiscal challenges faced by States, this \nshould be a decision considered by Congress examining all possible \nalternatives rather than something occurring through regulatory action.\n  Finally, the Affordable Care Act gives States broad leeway in \ncreating State-based Exchanges.\n  These State exchanges are the mechanism where people with incomes \nabove Medicaid eligibility will go to get health insurance.\n  It would be an understatement to say the States haven't moved very \nrapidly to get these Exchanges up and running.\n  I do acknowledge that many States may have been waiting for the \nSupreme Court ruling before moving ahead with their Exchanges.\n  However, I do think it remains equally plausible that States are \nmoving cautiously as they look at one more role in health care where \nthey are being asked to expand.\n  Mr. President, for the States, health care is a chaotic mess.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  The Federal Government is asking the States to take greater roles in \nadministering coverage for the uninsured in Medicaid, the dually \neligible and the uninsured in the private sector.\n  As we move forward in 2013, we will revisit, perhaps repeal, the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We will examine proposals to reign in the cost of our heath care \nentitlements.\n  Mr. President, as we do so, I strongly recommend we step back and \nreconsider what is the appropriate role for health care in our Federal \nsystem.\n  In July, Robert Samuelson wrote in the Washington Post about a \nproposal often associated with my friend from Tennessee, Senator \nAlexander, known as the ``grand swap.''\n  In this proposal, the Federal Government would assume all \nresponsibility for Medicaid and the States would assume all \nresponsibility for education.\n  Samuelson raises the proposal because, in his words,\n\n       Only the federal government can devise a solution to \n     control health costs; concentrating government health \n     spending at the federal level would intensify pressures to do \n     so.\n       States have tried mightily to control spending with at best \n     partial success.\n       For example, Medicaid reimbursement rates average only 72 \n     percent of Medicare levels.\n       The low rates have caused some doctors not to accept \n     Medicaid patients.\n\n  Mr. President, Samuelson raises a significant question, which \nCongress needs to consider in entitlement reform.\n  Congress should consider what States should do in health care and \nwhat are reasonable expectations.\n  If Congress wants States to administer benefits for the aged, blind \nand disabled, and low income individuals along with managing the \nexchanges for individuals with incomes up to 400 percent of poverty, \nCongress can do so.\n  If health care is the primary responsibility of States, it is because \nof decisions made by Congress.\n  If States are being asked to do so while also overseeing education, \npublic safety, roads and bridges and meet in most cases a balanced \nbudget requirement, Congress should temper its expectations regarding \nthe resources States will be able to devote to health care.\n  With significant restructuring of Medicare and Medicaid possible in \n2013, we should use this as an opportunity to reconsider the role of \nthe States in providing health care coverage inclusive of populations \nand services.\n  What we ask of the States should be thoughtfully considered in any \nreform discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6616-1",

RECOGNIZING TAIWAN'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the people and \nleaders of the Republic of China on Taiwan as they prepare to celebrate \nthe hundred-and-first anniversary of the founding of their country on \nOctober 10.\n  I would like to highlight Taiwan's economic successes over the last \ncentury--a success that has rightly been called a miracle. In just \nseveral decades, the people of Taiwan have transformed their economy \nfrom a recipient of American aid into one of our most important trade \npartners. The world economy relies upon Taiwan's computer chip \nfoundries, and the whole world benefits from the entrepreneurial spirit \nand inventiveness of Taiwan's people.\n  Looking forward to the future of our relationship with Taiwan, I \nbelieve it will be essential to take bold new steps to strengthen the \nties between us. In particular, it is past time for Washington to \nnegotiate a free trade agreement with Taiwan. That would be the first \nand most important step we could take to demonstrate our continued \ndedication to this relationship.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Jason \nYuan, who has ably represented Taiwan in the United States for the past \n4 years, on his new appointment to serve as Secretary-General of the \nNational Security Council of Taiwan. I am deeply grateful for his hard \nwork to further strengthen the ties between our two countries, and I \nwish Ambassador and Madame Yuan the very best of luck in their future \nendeavors.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \npeople of Taiwan on their many successes, and to recommit ourselves to \nstrengthening this essential relationship. As we look forward to \nTaiwan's national celebration, the people of both the United States and \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan have much to celebrate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6616-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL NORTON A. SCHWARTZ\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor GEN Norton A. \nSchwartz. General Schwartz will soon officially retire after 39 years \nas an Air Force officer, the last 4 spent as Chief of Staff. Throughout \nhis career, on the front lines and in the ``corporate'' Air Force, \nGeneral Schwartz served our Nation selflessly and ably, with dedication \nand distinction.\n  I came to know General Schwartz when he was appointed Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force in August 2008. He began his leadership at a very \ndifficult time. Controversy surrounded the Air Force's acquisition \nactivities and the control of our Nation's nuclear arsenal. The Air \nForce's attempt to acquire aerial refueling tanker aircraft had been \nmired in scandal and missteps, while the service had just come off two \nincidents of mishandling nuclear missiles and related materials.\n  General Schwartz established a command climate that helped the \nservice make the changes needed to address these issues. For example, \nGeneral Schwartz insisted on fully restoring excellence and integrity \nto the Air Force's acquisition workforce and practices. He succeeded. \nAfter years of failed attempts to get the tanker replacement program \nunder contract, the Air Force conducted a source-selection for the \nprogram, under full-and-open competition, that serves as a textbook \nexample of how the Department of Defense should award contracts for its \nlargest and most expensive weapon systems. Today, the Air Force's \nstrategy to acquire these tankers is sound. It can certainly be said \nthat under General Schwartz's leadership, this program is, for the \nfirst time in its checkered history, well-positioned for success.\n  Through his thoughtful temperament and purposeful humility, General \nSchwartz also helped restore Congress's confidence in the Air Force's \nacquisition practices and its management of the critical national \nsecurity resources entrusted to it. For this, both the warfighter and \nthe taxpayer will remain in his debt.\n  During public hearings before the Armed Services Committee and in our \nprivate meetings, I always appreciated General Schwartz's ``straight \ntalk'' about Air Force programs and operations. Despite his unwavering \ndedication to the Air Force, General Schwartz was never afraid to talk \nabout the hard truths, to propose solutions to problems, and to see \nthose solutions through. Neither was he shy about lauding the many \nexcellent people and accomplishments of the Air Force.\n  So I extend a grateful nation's thanks to GEN Norton A. Schwartz and \nhis wife Suzie for their service to our Nation and wish them every \nsuccess in the next chapter in their life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6616-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6616-S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             POSTAL REFORM\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Postal Service's financial crisis \ncontinues to escalate.\n  At the end of this month, the U.S. Postal Service will miss the \ndeadline for the required $5.6 billion payment toward its future \nretiree health care obligations. In fact, the Postal Service will have \ndefaulted on more than $11 billion in payments to fund health care for \nfuture retirees, raising concerns about its ability to keep promises to \ncurrent workers about their future benefits.\n  Five months ago, the Senate passed by a strong bipartisan vote \nlegislation to shore up the Postal Service. Yet the House has failed to \nact. And unfortunately, the House is about to adjourn without taking up \neither the Senate-passed postal bill or a House version.\n  I have implored House leaders to take up postal reform legislation--\nany postal reform legislation--so the conference process and the \ndifficult negotiations involved in that process can begin in earnest.\n  No one should pretend this is not a crisis worthy of congressional \naction.\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\n  The Postal Service has lost more than $13 billion during the past 2 \nyears and is losing $25 million each day. It will reach its credit \nlimit of $15 billion by the end of the year. Despite the fact that \nCongress has deferred or reduced the Postal Service's payments for \nfuture retiree health benefits multiple times, the Postal Service has \nstill reported billions of dollars in deficits--clear evidence that its \nfiscal woes go far beyond this requirement.\n  The Senate bill passed in April ensures those promises to future \nretirees will be kept, while still providing financial relief by \nrestructuring the payment plan in a responsible way.\n  Much is at stake. Without legislative reforms, the universal mail \nservice that drives a trillion-dollar mail industry and supports more \nthan 8 million jobs will be in jeopardy.\n  A key reason for the Postal Service's crisis is simply a changing \nworld, where more and more communication is online rather than via \ntraditional mail. First-class mail volume has fallen by 26 percent over \nthe past 6 years and continues to decline. Reflecting that sharp drop \nin volume, the Postal Service's revenue has also plummeted from $72.8 \nbillion in 2006 to $65.7 billion in 2011.\n  Nearly 80 percent of the Postal Service's costs are workforce-\nrelated, and so, as painful as it may be, finding a compassionate way \nto reduce these costs is simply unavoidable. In doing so, however, it \nis critical that the service on which many postal customers depend--\ncustomers the Postal Service desperately needs to keep--be preserved. \nThe worst thing the Postal Service could do would be to drive more \ncustomers out of the mail, causing revenues to decline further and \nensuring that the financial free fall continues. That would trigger a \ndeath spiral from which the Postal Service might never recover.\n  We need to help put the Postal Service back on solid financial \nfooting, not only to help protect those who work in jobs related to \nmailing industry but also so that taxpayers are not left holding the \nbag.\n  The bill I coauthored along with Senators Lieberman, Carper, and \nScott Brown would do just that.\n  Our bill encourages the Postal Service to operate more like a \nbusiness by cutting internal costs first instead of driving away \ncustomers with deep service cuts or steep price hikes.\n  Our bill would transfer to the Postal Service the nearly $11 billion \nit has overpaid into the Federal Employee Retirement System and direct \nthe Postmaster General to use a portion of this money for retirement \nand separation incentives in order to reduce the size of the workforce \nin a compassionate way.\n  Let me emphasize: This refund is not taxpayer money. It was \ncontributed by the Postal Service using ratepayer dollars. It is an \noverpayment that was identified and confirmed by the actuaries at OPM \nand verified by the GAO. GAO recently confirmed OPM's assessment that \nthis figure now has risen to nearly $11 billion.\n  The Senate-passed bill also includes a new requirement that \narbitrators rendering binding decisions in labor disputes consider the \nfinancial condition of the Postal Service. I know that it might defy \nbelief that an arbitrator would not automatically consider the looming \nbankruptcy of the Postal Service when ruling on contract disputes. Some \nprevious arbitrators, however, have discounted this factor in their \ndecisions because the requirement to consider it was not explicitly \nlisted in law.\n  For the first time in 35 years, the bill also brings sorely needed, \ncommonsense reforms to the Federal Workers' Compensation Program, not \nonly at the Postal Service but across the entire Federal Government. \nMore than 45,500 people are on the long-term rolls for Federal workers' \ncomp, and 40 percent of those are Postal Service employees. The reforms \nwill help injured employees return to work and ensure that workers' \ncomp is not a substitute for retirement benefits.\n  The Senate bill would also rationalize what has been an erratic and \nDraconian closure plan for thousands of rural post offices. While some \npost offices can and should be closed, curbing access for customers \ncould well jeopardize revenue. Therefore, our bill would set up a new \nprocess that would involve the consideration of alternatives to \nclosure, such as reducing hours, co-locating a post office at a nearby \npharmacy, or renting out excess space to other government agencies. \nPerhaps most important, the process includes the requirement for the \nviews of the affected community to be heard and responded to prior to \nany final decision.\n  Our bill would prevent the Postal Service from eliminating Saturday \ndelivery for the next 2 years. Instead, it directs the USPS to embark \non a period of aggressive cost-cutting and then would allow this \nreduction in service only if the Government Accountability Office and \npostal regulators both certify that elimination of Saturday delivery is \nstill necessary to achieve solvency.\n  The Senate's bipartisan postal reform bill preserves the Postal \nService and the critical economic activity it supports.\n  Now, the House must act. Failure to do so puts in peril American \ncommerce and could harm our fragile economy.\n  I am confident that, for the good of our country, we will be able to \ncome together with our House colleagues and work out our differences, \nno matter how significant those differences may be. No doubt more \ncompromises will be required along the way, but it is critical that we \nget a bill to the President for his signature as soon as possible.\n  Our task is urgent. Postal employees, businesses who rely on the U.S. \nmail, and the American people should not have to wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6617-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD ALZHEIMER'S ACTION DAY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues in \nbringing attention to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which \ntragically affects so many people across our Nation, including in my \nhome State of Hawaii. Today, the Alzheimer's Association recognizes \nWorld Alzheimer's Action Day as a way of raising awareness and reducing \nthe stigma associated with Alzheimer's. Sadly, this disease has touched \nthe lives of the families of so many of my friends, colleagues, and \nstaff.\n  In 2010, 27,000 people in Hawaii were living with Alzheimer's \ndisease. Their family members and loved ones sacrificed to help them \nwith nearly $800 million worth of unpaid care. Not only is this a \ndevastating disease for the people afflicted with it, but the emotional \nand monetary costs to their families are enormous.\n  The reach of the disease continues to grow, and it is estimated that \nthe cost of caring for people with Alzheimer's and other dementia in \nAmerica will reach $1.1 trillion by 2050. Despite the fact that \nAlzheimer's has affected so many, the disease itself remains poorly \nunderstood. Not only does it cause memory loss and confusion, but it is \nalso the sixth leading cause of death nationwide.\n  During the last Congress, my colleagues and I worked together to pass \nthe National Alzheimer's Project Act, which President Obama signed into \nlaw in 2011. This law created a national strategic plan to address the \ncrisis of Alzheimer's disease and to make ending Alzheimer's a national \npriority. We have a plan in place to fight this disease, but finding a \ncure will require us to continue funding research into the disease. \nWhile we work towards a cure, we must also support caregivers and raise \npublic awareness of the effects of this disease.\n  I would also like to express my profound gratitude to all those who \nare caring for family members who are afflicted with Alzheimer's \ndisease and other forms of dementia. Many caregivers have one or more \njobs and other family members to care for and it can often be a \nthankless job. So mahalo nui loa, thank you very much, for your \nsacrifices. I call on my colleagues to continue supporting Alzheimer's \ndisease research and education so that we may find a cure and end this \ndevastating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6617-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6617-S6618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT EPPLIN\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the distinguished \npublic service of Robert Epplin, who served for nearly 20 years as \nstaff in the Senate, and most recently for the past 3\\1/2\\ years as my \nlegislative director. Rob's service in the Senate, as well\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nas his service in the executive branch, has typified what a dedicated \npublic servant should be: he took pride in his work and faced \nchallenges with determination and tenacity; he recognized what an honor \nit was to serve the people of this country and my constituents, in \nparticular; and he had a respect for and an unparalleled understanding \nof the Senate as an institution. Because of these many fine qualities, \nRob earned the respect and admiration of so many of his staff \ncolleagues, as well as so many Senators.\n  Rob got his start in Washington in 1989 working as a research analyst \nat the Republican National Committee. In 1991 he went to work at the \nDepartment of Education, serving in the office of then-Secretary Lamar \nAlexander.\n  Rob began his work in the Senate in 1993 when he served as an adviser \nfor budget, economic, foreign affairs, and defense issues for former \nSenator Bob Packwood of Oregon. At the time he accepted the position, I \nam sure he had little inkling that his work would lead to more than a \ndecade of service to the Oregon congressional delegation. In 1994, Rob \nmoved to the Senate Finance Committee, where he continued to work for \nSenator Packwood as a professional staff member responsible for \npensions, benefits, social security, and economic issues. He then \nworked for the Office of Management and Budget before returning in 1997 \nto the Senate and Oregon delegation as a senior adviser, and later \nlegislative director, to my friend and former colleague, Senator Gordon \nSmith.\n  During his career in public service, Rob left his mark on issues \nranging from tax and national security to budget policy. But it was his \nlong fight for the passage of historic civil rights legislation, \nincluding the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell law and hate crimes \nlegislation, that gives him the most pride. America now welcomes the \nservice of any qualified individual who is willing to put on the \nuniform, and we no longer dismiss brave, dedicated, and skilled service \nmen and women simply because they are gay. In addition, those who \ncommit hate crimes against individuals based on their sexual \norientation can now be punished under Federal law.\n  As Rob leaves the Senate after nearly 20 years of hard work and \ndedicated public service, he also leaves behind an impressive list of \naccomplishments, and colleagues whose lives he touched because he was \nsuch an exceptional role model and mentor. I wish him continued success \nand every happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6618-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MONTFORD POINT MARINE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on the 25th day of June 1941, President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 8802 establishing the \nfair employment practice that began to erase discrimination in the \nArmed Forces.\n  In 1942, President Roosevelt established a presidential directive \ngiving African Americans an opportunity to be recruited into the Marine \nCorps. These African Americans, from all States, were not sent to the \ntraditional boot camps of Parris Island, SC and San Diego, CA. Instead, \nAfrican American Marines were segregated--experiencing basic training \nat Montford Point--a facility at Camp Lejeune, NC. Approximately 20,000 \nAfrican American Marines received basic training at Montford Point \nbetween 1942 and 1949.\n  In July of 1948 President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order No. \n9981 negating segregation. In September of 1949, Montford Marine Camp \nwas deactivated, ending 7 years of segregation.\n  On April 19, 1974, Montford Point Camp was renamed Camp Johnson, in \nhonor of the late Sergeant Major, Gilbert H. ``Hashmark'' Johnson. \nJohnson was one of the first African Americans to join the Corps, a \nDistinguished Montford Point Drill Instructor and a Veteran of WWII and \nKorea. The Camp remains the only Marine Corps installation named in \nhonor of an African American.\n  The awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal came to fruition after \nthe signing of H.R. 2447, Public Law 112-59 by President Obama on 23 \nNov 11, which is the highest civilian honor for the distinguished \nachievement. The Congressional Gold Medal was presented to 366 Original \nMontford Point Marines, 27 June 2012 at the Capital Visitor's Center in \nWashington, DC. The next day, replicas of this medal were presented to \nthese men at the Commandant of the Marine Corps' residence.\n  January of 2012 began the keeling of the USNS Montford Point, T-MLP-\n1, the lead ship of her class of Mobile Landing Platforms, MLP, a ship \nnamed in honor of the Original Montford Point Marines.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Junior \nLeague of Washington, JLW, as this organization honors 100 years of \ncommunity service and dedication to the greater Washington, DC, area. \nThe Junior League has approximately 300 organizations across the world, \nincluding eight leagues in my home State of Louisiana. I know that the \nwomen in these organizations make a profound impact on their \ncommunities, and in particular, I recognize the positive impact the \nwomen of the Junior League of Washington have made in communities \nthroughout our Nation's Capital since 1912.\n  The Junior League of Washington, JLW, is an organization of women \ncommitted to promoting volunteerism, developing the potential of women, \nand improving communities through the effective action and leadership \nof trained volunteers. Its purpose is exclusively educational and \ncharitable. Throughout their history, the JLW has provided millions of \nvolunteer hours and more than $5.4 million to the community.\n  It was one woman, Miss Elizabeth Noyes, and her sewing circle, that \nstarted the JLW in 1912. The League quickly grew to over 100 women \nworking for the welfare of children and serving the helpless and sick. \nOne hundred years later, the league is still going strong with over \n2,300 members still striving to improve the lives of children and the \npoor.\n  The league continues this mission and in the late 1990s chose to \nfocus its energies on literacy-related programs. The ability to read, \nwrite, and communicate affects far more than a person's knowledge of \nliteracy masterpieces. It changes their access to jobs, health care, \nand transportation, and the way they raise their children. The JLW has \nadopted a broad approach to solving the literacy challenges their \ncommunity faces by addressing the issue from many angles: adult, child, \nand cultural. The league is proud to partner with over 23 organizations \nthroughout the area to achieve this laudable goal.\n  In addition, the league honors and celebrates diversity while \nfocusing on shared values, and it strives to create an environment in \nwhich any woman committed to improving her community, regardless of \nrace, religion, or national origin, will feel welcome and be encouraged \nto be part of the organization. The JLW is a vibrant presence in the \nlives of the women and children in the greater metropolitan area of the \nDistrict of Columbia, serving as a resource throughout the community to \neffect positive change, seek common ground, and inspire hope.\n  In honor of their centennial year, the women of the JLW have create \nthe Resolution Read Program, committing themselves to purchasing and \ndistributing 100,000 new books to needy children in the greater \nWashington, DC, community. This is no small undertaking for a small \ngroup of women, but by meeting this goal, many children throughout the \narea will get a book to call their own. As such, JLW will continue to \nmake a lasting impact in their community by fostering a passion for \nbooks and reading where it otherwise might not exist.\n  I would like to sincerely thank the volunteers of the Junior League \nof\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nWashington for their commitment to volunteerism, their community, and \nthe District of Columbia. Their efforts are extraordinary and greatly \nappreciated. I congratulate the league on their 100 years of success \nand look forward to hearing about all the wonderful things the league \nwill accomplish by their Bicentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6619-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEDERAL LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 10 years have passed since the first \nconsumer enrolled in the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, an \ninsurance option for Federal employees, retirees and their loved ones \ncreated by the Long-Term Care Security Act. This law set a new standard \nregarding providing for the unique and important medical needs of \nseniors and individuals with disabilities. Participants in the program \nare now confident that they will receive help financing the care that \nthey may require. I am pleased to recognize the 10th anniversary of the \nfirst enrollment in this important program, and I am proud that its \nadministration is handled by Long Term Care Partners, LLC, which is \nlocated in my home State of New Hampshire.\n  Today, 1 in 10 Americans aged 55 and older carries a long-term care \ninsurance policy; however, it is estimated that 70 percent of people \nover age 65 will eventually require long-term care. Our Nation's \nchanging demographics and significant medical advances have contributed \nto an aging population, and addressing the issue of how best to care \nfor seniors and individuals with disabilities should be part of our \nnational discourse on how we support ourselves and our families. These \nservices are critical for so many Americans who need assistance to \ncontinue living independently and actively in their communities.\n  The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program was the first benefit \noffered to the Federal workforce that was completely employee-funded, \ncoming at no cost to the taxpayer. The program is unique in that, at \nthe time of its inception, it was the first benefit offered uniformly \nto all Federal employees, including military personnel and staff of the \nU.S. Postal Service. It is also the Nation's first successful large-\nscale, long-term care insurance program with consistent benefits, \nregardless of where the recipient lives.\n  With nearly 270,000 enrollees, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance \nProgram has made a difference in the lives of so many in the Federal \nworkforce. It is the largest group long-term care insurance program in \nthe country and has already paid nearly $215 million in claims. The \nprogram helps its beneficiaries stay where they are most comfortable, \nwith more than 85 percent of these claims going to home and community-\nbased services.\n  Every family needs to plan for retirement and how to best care for \naging loved ones and those with disabilities. Long-term care insurance \nis one way that millions of Americans get the support they need to \nremain independent and active in their communities. For Federal \nemployees, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program is an important \noption that provides a sense of security and comfort in knowing that \nfamily members will be cared for in times of need.\n  I stand today to recognize the Federal Long Term Care Insurance \nProgram's 10th anniversary and to wish the program continued success as \nit embarks on its second decade of assisting Federal employees and \ntheir families in planning for their retirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6619-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO PASTOR YOUCEF NADARKHANI\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to share \na rare piece of good news related to international religious freedom. \nOn October 11 of last year I submitted for the Record the story of a \nChristian pastor in Iran who had been charged with apostasy and \nsentenced to death. Earlier this month, after almost 3 years of \nimprisonment, Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani has been released and is at home \nwith his family.\n  The good news for Pastor Youcef comes after years of struggle, and we \ncan only imagine the joy his own family feels after a long, difficult \nfight for his freedom. Many organizations and individuals, often \nrisking their own lives, deserve thanks for their enduring commitment \nto Pastor Youcef's cause. Pastor Youcef's enduring faith in God saw him \nthrough this trying time and his experience is an inspiration to people \nof faith everywhere.\n  This moment of relief and thanksgiving comes as a reminder that the \nliberties we enjoy as Americans come at a high price to those who have \nfought and continue to fight for our freedoms. And too many people in \ncountries like Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and Pakistan, to name a few, still do \nnot enjoy the basic human rights you and I have here at home.\n  The persecution of religious minorities and Christians like Pastor \nYoucef abroad is unfortunately nothing new. That's why I introduced the \nNear East and South Central Asia Religious Freedom Act in June of last \nyear. The bill came out of coordination with U.S. Congressman Frank \nWolf in the House and my colleague, U.S. Senator Carl Levin. It creates \na special envoy on religious freedom in the State Department to monitor \nthe status of religious minorities in these particularly vulnerable \nregions.\n  We can and we must do more to advance religious freedom abroad. I am \nsincerely committed to this effort and believe that it is essential to \npromoting the God-given right to liberty around the world. My \ncolleagues and I are hopeful that the Senate can soon join the House in \npassing this important legislation.\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE CITY CLUB OF CLEVELAND\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize The City Club \nof Cleveland, the oldest continuously operating free speech forum in \nthe country.\n  Often referred to as a ``Citadel of Free Speech,'' The City Club \noffers an unbiased setting for dynamic discussions and exchange of \nideas on important issues of interest to citizens and communities \nthroughout Ohio and the United States. The City Club has succeeded in \nits mission to inform, educate and inspire citizens by presenting \nsignificant ideas and providing opportunities for dialog in a collegial \nsetting, and has secured its place in history as an impartial, vital \ncenter for discussion of diverse topics.\n  The City Club forums encourage active debate and participation by the \naudience. Over the years, local, national and international leaders \nhave been featured as speakers and have addressed a wide variety of \nsubjects which have impacted our region, state and Nation.

The \nworld has lost a dedicated attorney, a civil rights activist who took \npart in the Selma-Montgomery march, and an advocate who specialized in \ndisability law.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 75th \nanniversary of the city of Greenbelt, the first planned community in \nthe United States built by the Federal Government. Greenbelt was \nenvisioned as a social experiment by Rexford Guy Tugwell, a friend and \nadviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The town was built under \nthe authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. It was \ndesigned to provide low-income housing and drew 5,700 applicants for \nthe original 885 residences. The first families arrived on October 1, \n1937. They were chosen to meet income and other criteria, including a \ndemonstrated willingness to participate in community organizations.\n  Most early residents were under 30 years of age and were from diverse \nreligious backgrounds. They were blue and white collar workers, but due \nto the segregation at the time, no African Americans were able to \npurchase homes or live in Greenbelt. Physically, Greenbelt was designed \nas a complete city with homes, businesses, schools, roads, recreation \nfacilities, and town government. Homes were clustered in \n``superblocks'' with a system of interior walkways permitting residents \nto go from home to town center without crossing a major street. Streets \nwere designed to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic and \ncommunity amenities and businesses were centrally located for easy \naccess.\n  The first residents were pioneers in community engagement. They \nquickly formed a government--the first city manager form of government \nin the State of Maryland. They formed the first kindergarten in Prince \nGeorge's County, started a journalism club that today continues to \npublish the weekly Greenbelt News Review, formed the Greenbelt Health \nAssociation, established police, fire and rescue squads, and opened the \nfirst public swimming pool in the Washington area in 1939. Greenbelt \nConsumer Services, Inc. operated the grocery store, gas station, drug \nand variety stores, barber and beauty shops, movie theater, valet shop, \nand tobacco shop, and over the years, as needs arose, citizens formed \nnumerous cooperatives.\n  The Federal Government built an additional 1,000 homes in 1941 to \naccommodate families coming to Washington in connection with the \ndefense programs of World War II. In 1952, Congress voted to sell off \nthe Greenbelt towns, and citizens in Greenbelt formed a housing \ncooperative which purchased the homes. In 1997, when Greenbelt \ncelebrated its 60th anniversary, the U.S. Department of Interior \nrecognized Historic Greenbelt as a National Historic Landmark.\n  Today, many of the original features of this planned community still \nexist, although the city itself has expanded to include additional \nshopping centers, high-rise office buildings, garden apartments, \ntownhouses, and private development. Around a dozen original families \nstill live in Greenbelt, passing on the cooperative spirit and sense of \ncommunity that has made Greenbelt a thriving city and a special place \nto call home.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the residents and \nthe city of Greenbelt on successfully nurturing 75 years of community \nplanning, cooperation, and engagement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6620-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING AL ADAMS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. I speak today to honor the memory of Al Adams, \nan Alaska Native leader. In the Alaska legislature for some 20 years, \nAl Adams was regarded as one of the most effective advocates for the \ninterests of rural Alaska. Senator Adams died on August 13 after a long \nbattle with cancer. Alaska's Governor ordered flags in the State \nlowered to half staff in honor of Adams' service to Alaska. His \nfuneral, at ChangePoint Alaska in Anchorage, drew over 1,500 mourners. \nA second funeral was conducted in Al's hometown of Kotzebue.\n  Al Adams was born in Kotzebue, AK in 1942. He attended Mt. Edgecumbe \nHigh School in Sitka. Following high school, he attended the University \nof Alaska Fairbanks and RCA Technical Institute. There is a back story \nbehind the RCA Technical Institute. Prior to enactment of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act of 1971, one of the better jobs that a \nNative person from rural Alaska could hope for was a job tracking \nsatellites at the Gilmore Creek Satellite Tracking Facility near \nFairbanks. Several of those who traveled with Al to Los Angeles for \ntraining at the RCA Technical Institute would later become leading \nplayers in the implementation of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct.\n  Over the course of his career, Al would serve as president of \nKikiktagruk Inupiat Corporation and executive vice president of NANA \nRegional Corporation, but his service in the Alaska legislature left \nAl's most enduring legacies. Al served in the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives from 1980-1988 and in the Alaska Senate from 1989-2000. \nHe was known as ``Mr. Finance.'' Al chaired the powerful House Finance \nCommittee. He served 18 years on the Legislative Budget and Audit \nCommittee and 12 years on the Operating Budget Conference Committee. As \na Representative and Senator from rural western Alaska he understood \nthe unique problems that his communities faced and ensured that they \nreceived an equitable share of State funding.\n  Al's most enduring legislative accomplishment is the Power Cost \nEqualization Program. One of the greatest impediments to the viability \nof traditional Native communities in rural Alaska is the cost of \nelectricity. Since rural Alaska largely lives ``off the grid'' \nelectricity must be generated locally by burning diesel fuel which is \ntransported long distances by barge. The Power Cost Equalization \nProgram protects rural communities by setting a cap on the price that \nrural consumers pay for energy. It is a tremendously important program \nand rural Alaska has Al Adams to thank for it.\n  Following his service as a legislator, Al became a lobbyist. We do \nnot commonly commend the work of lobbyists in the pages of the Record, \nbut Al was a special kind of lobbyist. He lobbied selectively for the \ncauses he believed in, representing the North Slope Borough and the \nNorthwest Arctic Borough. During this period he used his vast \nlegislative and political experience to educate his Native people on \nhow they can be more effective in the political arena. Just one \nexample, recognizing that rural Alaska's reliance on imported diesel \nwas ultimately unsustainable, he lobbied to develop local sources of \nenergy in western Alaska, at one time proposing an intraregional grid \nto power remote communities. He lobbied to make it possible for the \ntribal hospital in Kotzebue to build a new long-term care wing on their \nhospital. Al Adams used his insider access and knowledge for good.\n  I would like to spend a moment to discuss Al on a personal level. I \nwill always remember his smile--that crinkly smile--and his sense of \nhumor which could defuse even the tensest of meetings. Al operated in \nmultiple worlds at once--the world of politics, the world of business--\nbut he never abandoned his Inupiaq roots. His official obituary relates \nthat Al often organized subsistence hunting and fishing trips for his \nchildren, where he passed down traditional Inupiaq skills. He \ncoordinated all the logistics for these memorable outings and even \nserved as camp cook, making sure everyone else was well fed. Whether \ndipnetting at the mouth of the Kenai, caribou hunting outside Kotzebue \nor visiting the fish wheel at Chitina, he let his wife, children and \ngrandchildren know that they were loved and that they came first and \nforemost in his life.\n  I have lost a dear friend, the Native community has lost a respected \nleader, and all Alaska has lost a statesman whose legacies will long be \nremembered. The Senate extends its condolences to the Al Adams family \nand all who mourn the loss of this exemplary Alaskan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6620-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6620-S6621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING RICHARD FRANK\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the front page of this morning's \nFairbanks Daily News-Miner carries the\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nsad news that Richard Frank, an Athabascan elder, died at age 85.\n  Richard Frank is an individual of great significance in the history \nof post-statehood Alaska. He was among the first Alaska Native leaders \nto recognize the risk that development of the modern State of Alaska \nposed to the subsistence lifestyle of traditional villages like his \nhome village of Minto in Interior Alaska. He was among the first Native \nleaders to organize his people in opposition to State land selections \nthat would prejudice the eventual settlement of the aboriginal land \nclaims of Alaska Natives. And his leadership, recognized throughout the \nState, is one of the reasons that the Native peoples of Alaska won \ntheir battle for land claims with passage of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act of 1971.\n  Richard Frank was born on August 27, 1927, in Old Minto. He was \neducated at the village school. Some historians say that the village \nschool provided an education up to the third grade. Others say it was \nthe fourth. What is undisputed is that Richard Frank possessed a sense \nof adventure and wisdom far beyond his formal education. Growing up \naround the fishing and trapping camps of the Yukon River he gained an \nappreciation of the interdependence between the land and the Native way \nof life. But some would say it was his experience in the Army Air Corps \nduring World War II that best prepared him for the leadership role he \nwould occupy in the 1960s.\n  Richard's wartime experience is chronicled in Fern Chardonnet's book, \n``Alaska at War, 1941-1945.'' She relates that World War II presented \nan extraordinary opportunity for Alaska Natives. Many, for the first \ntime, received the same pay and benefits as White workers, and a chance \nto acquire new skills and to build genuine self esteem. Richard Frank \nwas a case in point. Upon enlisting he was encouraged to pursue \nspecialized training as an aircraft mechanic. At first he said, ``No,'' \nbut his commanding officer had confidence in Richard and he agreed to \npursue the training. Richard relates that the passing score in training \nwas 2.5 and he completed the course with a 3.9. He went on to service \nP-47 fighters in the South Pacific.\n  Richard regarded himself as lucky. Service in the military showed \nyoung men from the village that there was another option. After the war \nRichard worked as a mechanic for Wien Alaska Airlines and Boeing, \nthough his heart remained in village Alaska.\n  The son of a traditional village chief, he found his calling in the \nearly 1960s as the battle for Alaska's lands was beginning. The Alaska \nStatehood Act gave the State of Alaska the right to select lands but \nleft resolution of Alaska Native land claims for another day.\n  One of the areas where State land selections first conflicted with \nNative hunting, fishing, and trapping activities was in the Minto Lakes \nregion of Interior Alaska. The State wanted to establish a recreation \narea in 1961 near the Athabascan village of Minto and to construct a \nroad so that the region would be more easily accessible to Fairbanks \nresidents and visiting sportsmen. In addition, State officials believed \nthat the area held potential for future development of oil and other \nresources.\n  Learning of these plans of the State, Minto filed a protest with the \nU.S. Interior Department. The people of Minto had filed blanket claims \nto the area in the 1930s, and Richard's father, then Traditional Chief, \ndelineated this area as belonging to the Minto people in 1951. Minto \nasked the Federal agency to protect their rights to the region by \nturning down the State's application for the land. Minto's attorney was \nnone other than the late Senator Ted Stevens who took up their cause \npro bono.\n  In response to the protest, a meeting of sportsmen, biologists, \nconservationists, and State officials was held in 1963 to discuss the \nproposed road and recreation area.\n  Richard argued that State development in the region would ruin the \nsubsistence way of life of the Natives and urged that the recreation \narea be established elsewhere, where new hunting pressure would not \nthreaten the traditional economy. He said, ``A village is at stake. Ask \nyourself this question, is a recreation area worth the future of a \nvillage?''\n  He also took his cause to the Alaska Conservation Society in \nAnchorage. He told the conservation society members that without the \nuse of the lakes, Minto's people would go hungry. Lael Morgan, in her \nlandmark book, ``The Life and Times of Howard Rock,'' relates Richard's \npleas for support. He said, ``Nothing is so sorrowful for a hunter, \nempty handed, to be greeted by hungry children.''\n  A 1985 history of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \ncharacterized Minto's protest as a precursor of events to come. During \nthe years that followed, many other Native communities would protest \nactions that threatened their lands. In 1966, Secretary of the Interior \nStewart Udall gave the land claims movement teeth by initiating a \nfreeze on the transfer of lands to the State which were protested by \nthe Native people.\n  As a well respected Native leader and elder, Richard went on to play \nsignificant roles in the Tanana Chiefs Conference and the Fairbanks \nNative Association. He served on the Governor's Veterans Advisory \nCommittee and founded the Alaska Native Veterans Association. It is \nalso appropriate to acknowledge Richard's role as the patriarch of one \nof the truly great Fairbanks families. Richard's wife of 57 years, \nAnna, became the first Native American woman ordained as a priest in \nthe Episcopal Church in 1983. Richard was the father of four and was \nblessed with grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  As a significant figure in Alaska's history, Richard was generous to \ncollectors of oral history. One of those oral histories was done for \nthe Alaska Trappers Association, which notes, ``Richard freely shares \ninsight into the Native view of the world. He takes great pride in \ntheir dedication to family. He speaks often of the lessons he learned \nfrom his elders.''\n  Alaska has truly lost a significant figure. If it is any condolence, \nRichard's life experiences were rich, he accomplished a great deal for \nhis Native people, and he supported a truly wonderful family. Thanks to \nmodern technology, his stories and life experiences will live on for \neternity.\n  On behalf of the Senate I extend condolences to Reverend Anna, \nRichard's family, and the Athabascan people of Interior Alaska who are \npreparing to honor and celebrate Richard's life next week with a \nMemorial Potlatch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6621-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6621-S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BARNEY UHART\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that \nBarney Uhart of Anchorage, AK passed away on September 8, 2012 after a \nlong battle with cancer. Barney was President Emeritus of the Chugach \nAlaska Corporation, one of the thirteen regional Alaska Native \nCorporations. Chugach Alaska Corporation is owned by over 2,300 \nshareholders of Alutiiq, Eskimo and Indian heritage.\n  Barney was elected President and CEO of Chugach Alaska Corporation in \nMay 2000 and served in that role until July 2012. In July he announced \nhis retirement to focus on his health and spend time with his family. \nBut the Chugach Alaska Corporation board would not let him go. That is \nhow Barney earned the title of President Emeritus.\n  Barney was a master in administering Base Operations Services \ncontracts, a field he entered into on something of a lark. As the story \ngoes, while living in Hawaii he was delivering furniture with a friend \nto a company called Kentron International. This was back in 1979. He \nwondered what they did and slipped a resume under the door. A few days \nlater he learned that they managed remote sites and was on his way to \nWake Island. Over the course of his career Barney came to know more \nabout places like Wake Island, Midway Island and Amchitka than anyone I \nknow. He would return to Wake Island many times over the course of his \ncareer, helping his successor employers win that Base Operations \nSupport contract. You might even call him the Mayor Emeritus of Wake \nIsland.\n  Barney joined the Chugach Alaska family in 1993 as an Operations \nManager with Chugach Development Corporation. Known as a charismatic \nleader and a hard worker, he quickly rose through the ranks. Those at \nChugach Alaska tell me that his dedication to the company, its people \nand employees\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nwas steadfast. His hard work and commitment helped provide real, \ntangible, and ongoing benefits to the Native shareholders of Chugach \nAlaska. He strove tirelessly to help fulfill the promise of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. His work in opening up the 8(a) program \nto meaningful participation by Alaska Natives, Lower 48 Indian tribes, \nand Native Hawaiians is recognized throughout the Native American \ncontractor community.\n  Barney Uhart will be remembered as a leader, a friend and a champion \nof doing the right thing and doing things right. I express my \ncondolences to his wife Randi, his children Jordan, Abigail and Jacob, \nand the shareholders of Chugach Alaska Corporation on the loss of this \nexemplary Alaskan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6622-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COAST GUARD PAY AND PERSONNEL CENTER\n\n Mr. ROBERTS.

The center is a shining example of the \nCoast Guard motto, Semper Paratus, Always Ready.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6622-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the outstanding accomplishments of Air Force Space Command. \nAnd of course, I offer my deep respect and thanks to the 42,000 men and \nwomen who keep constant watch over our most distant skies. These great \nAmericans are responsible for a staggering range of essential missions, \nand this week, I join them in celebrating the 30th anniversary of the \ncommand's creation.\n  Air Force Space Command was established in 1982 as our national \nleaders recognized the growing need to dominate the space domain to \nenhance our warfighting capabilities and to better protect our \nservicemembers. The command's responsibilities and capabilities have \nsteadily increased over the past 30 years to keep pace with technology \nand foreign threats, and from the outset, those missions have been a \ncritical part of our national defense architecture.\n  All day, every day, Air Force Space Command personnel provide our \nwarfighters with the space-based assets they require at the speed of \nneed. And at the same time, they keep a major portion of our economy, \ntravel, and transportation on track. They fly the GPS satellites that \nmake modern computing, air travel, and precision munitions possible. \nAir Force Space Command provides our Nation with global ballistic \nmissile early warning and defense. Without Air Force Space Command, \nthere would be no military satellite communications and our \nmeteorological and navigational data would be far less advanced and \naccurate. These airmen and civilians of Space Command demonstrate \namazing technical and scientific proficiency as they conduct space \nbased surveillance, land-based intercontinental ballistic missile \noperations, and most recently, prosecute a cyber space mission that is \ngrowing more essential to our security every day. Their capabilities \nhave strengthened our Nation's homeland defense, allowed disaster \nrelief efforts to be more timely and efficient, and enhanced America's \nmilitary operational capabilities in all stages of warfare. Simply put, \nwithout Air Force Space Command, the strategic and technological \nadvantages enjoyed by both the military and civilian communities in the \nUnited States would not be possible.\n  Of course, all of these tremendous accomplishments are due to the \nremarkable devotion to duty, sacrifice, and dedication displayed by \nSpace Command personnel around the world every day. As we all know, our \nservice men and women, both active duty and those in the Reserve \ncomponent, aren't simply serving in the military--they are our \nmilitary. Additionally, civilian members of Air Force Space Command \nprovide the stability and corporate knowledge that's essential to the \ncommand's enduring success. Yes, it's a true total force effort. \nColorado is the proud home of Air Force Space Command headquarters, but \nright now, their personnel are deployed to every corner of the globe, \nproviding unparalleled space and cyber space expertise to combatant \ncommanders in every theater of operations. As they celebrate yet \nanother milestone, I would like to honor these patriots for their \nselfless service and dedication to our Nation's security. On behalf of \nall Coloradans and to every member of Air Force Space Command, past and \npresent: happy 30th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6622-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING EDWARD D. PARE\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the State of Rhode Island has \nlost a dear and dedicated public servant. Captain Edward D. Pare was a \nsworn officer of the Rhode Island State Police for 2\\1/2\\ decades, from \n1959 until his retirement in 1986.\n  Captain Pare was a true son of Rhode Island, born in Coventry, RI. In \naddition to serving our State, he also served his country in the U.S. \nNavy, sailing appropriately enough aboard the USS Pawcatuck, named for \nthe river that flows across the southern part of our State.\n  Captain Pare left an indelible mark on the force. He was captain of \ndetectives for many years prior to his retirement. In this important \nrole, Captain Pare had his hand in every major investigation undertaken \nby the State police during that period. His leadership and commitment \nwere the hallmarks of his stint with the department and set an example \nfor a generation of officers. Even beyond his retirement, Captain Pare \nwas known in law enforcement circles and across Rhode Island as simply \n``The Captain.''\n  During his tenure with the State police, Captain Pare acted as both \nthe head of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the \ndirector of the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. There had \nbeen concerns raised about mismanagement and corruption at these \nagencies. Captain Pare, as the ``gold standard'' of competence, rigor, \nand integrity, provided public assurance that any such problems would \nbe met and mastered.\n  Captain Pare's sense of public service was a family value, carried on \nby his sons, Ed and Steven. During our Rhode Island banking crisis, I \nhad the pleasure of working alongside Ed at the Rhode Island Department \nof Business Regulation, where he worked for the people of Rhode Island \nfor many years in a number of roles, including superintendent of \nbanking and superintendent of the securities division. Steven followed \nhis father's path into the State police, rising in his 26 years to the \nrank of colonel and serving as State trooper, detective, and \nsuperintendent of the force. Steven continues his work in law \nenforcement and homeland security today as commissioner of public \nsafety for the city of Providence.\n  Captain Pare is survived by his beloved wife Phyllis, and in addition \nto Ed and Steven, he leaves behind his daughter Diane, son Gary, and 12 \ngrandchildren. The captain's impact on our communities was profound, \nand his legacy of integrity and service to others will be remembered by \nRhode Islanders for a long time to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6622-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6622-5", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6622-S6623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nStates submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6623-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2012\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 733.

A bill to adopt fair standards and procedures by which \ndeterminations of Copyright Royalty Judges are made with respect to \nwebcasting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Internet \nRadio Fairness Act. The goal of this proposal is to help one of \nAmerica's oldest, most dynamic industries grow into the 21st Century. \nThanks to new digital music technologies, the ways in which consumers \ncan listen and buy music has been revolutionized.\n  Internet technology is even changing the music industry itself. The \nNet is freeing artists from the shackles of major record label \nmiddlemen by enabling artists to broadcast and sell directly to \nconsumers. In fact, right now bands on independent labels are \ndominating the music charts. Artists like Amanda Palmer are leaving the \nrecord labels behind by instead reaching for success by embracing \nInternet platforms like Kickstarter to get her music heard.\n  I am a firm believer that further unleashing Internet technology will \nexpand the music marketplace to better reward Internet innovation and \nmusical artists.\n  The Internet has changed our lives. It is reshaping how people \ncommunicate, collaborate and engage in commerce. The Internet empowers \nthe powerless, it gives everyone a voice, and it advances human rights \nand the cause of freedom around the world. The growth and evolution of \nthe Internet comes from good, innovative ideas and from policy \nenvironments that protect the Net from unfair and discriminatory taxes, \nregulation, and legal liability.\n  Unfortunately, one area of the Internet ecosystem that is stifled is \nthe digital services of broadcast music. In 1998 Federal laws were \nenacted to specifically thwart the development of Internet platforms \nthat are commercially viable as broadcasters of digital music. Since \nthen, concerns about online copyright infringement intensified, record \nsales plummeted, and many commercially successful musicians are \nstruggling. Consumers and rightsholders are increasingly seeking \ninnovative, new models that can better promote music and compensate \nartists. The Internet Radio Fairness Act intends to answer some of \nthese calls.\n  Under current law royalty rates prescribed for Internet Radio are \nestablished based on what a panel of special copyright judges determine \nto be the market rate for musical licenses. But there is no functioning \nmarket for these licenses and these judges are left with very little \ninformation to make reasonable conclusions. That is why Congress \nroutinely intervenes to correct the work of these judges. The current \nmethod these judges use to establish royalty rates for Internet Radio \nhas led to webcasters paying five times the amount of royalties--as a \npercentage of revenue--as other digital music broadcasters, like \nsatellite and cable. The long-established method that copyright judges \nuse to determine royalty rates for satellite and cable providers \nenables a broader set of factors to be considered.\n  The Internet Radio Fairness Act would end the discrimination against \nthe Internet and Internet Radio in the digital marketplace. It would \ntreat Internet Radio, for purposes of establishing royalty rates, in \nthe same way that satellite and cable radio are treated. It would \nenable the copyright judges the ability to consider factors they have \nlong been familiar with to establish royalty rates for Internet\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\nRadio in the same way they have long done for other broadcasters.\n  Doing this can enable new Internet Radio startups to succeed and \ncreate jobs, foster competition, and the expansion of the music \nmarketplace in part so that artists can obtain broader exposure and \nmore compensation.\n  I hope to work with you, with stakeholders, and with my Senate \ncolleagues to discuss this legislation and additional ideas that are \nnecessary to unleash the power of the Internet to foster a broader, \nmore dynamic marketplace for digital music.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 3610. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny \nthe inclusion of any antidumping or countervailing duties in the \ndetermination of the basis of any energy tax credit property; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor two important \npieces of legislation. My colleagues in this body are all aware of the \nchallenges that American manufacturers struggle with in the global \nmarket. A particular challenge faces producers of renewable energy \ntechnology. Not only do these producers compete against decades of \ngovernment subsidies provided to the oil and gas industry, these \nmanufacturers are increasingly competing against China's unfair trade \npractices.\n  As my colleagues know, the record is clear that China is cheating. \nChina is illegally subsidizing their producers of solar and wind energy \ntechnology. China is enabling solar panels and wind energy property to \nbe sold in the U.S. at below market value due to the government \nsubsidies they are provided by China.\n  The Department of Commerce is investigating these practices. The \nDepartment has already found specific practices employed by China that \nare against international trade rules. As a result the government will \nsoon assign antidumping and countervailing duties on solar panels, for \nexample, as they have been determined by the Department of Commerce to \nbe unfairly traded.\n  The first measure that I sponsored today is very simple. The \nInvestment Tax Credit Integrity Act, S. 3610, would simply say for \npurposes of the tax credit that American buyers of solar panels and \nother qualifying renewable energy can claim, taxpayers cannot use the \ntax credit to offset the antidumping and countervailing duties that are \nassigned to this merchandise. As you know, the rate of these duties is \ndesigned to remedy the unfair trade that was exposed; it would be \ncounterproductive to allow the Investment Tax Credit to undermine the \npurpose of these duties.\n  The second measure that I filed today, S. 3611, is equally important. \nThe Buy Fairly Traded Goods Act says that federal agencies should not, \nwith taxpayer money, buy merchandise, like Chinese subsidized solar \npanels, that are subject to U.S. duties assigned to remedy the unfair \ntrade practices. Taxpayer money should not be used to buy property that \nthe Department of Commerce has determined is unfairly traded and which \nis shown to harm U.S. manufacturers. This measure is written so there \nmay be limited exceptions in the event of a national security issue, \nand it is crafted to comply with America's international trade \nobligations. Importantly, this bill also instructs federal agencies to \nuse their contracting power to ensure that developers who are producing \nrenewable energy for use by the federal government do not buy property \nfor that purpose that is subject to trade remedies.\n  I am pleased that Senator Merkley has joined me in sponsoring these \nproposals. Mr. Merkley has a strong record for standing up for American \nbusinesses and the workers who are struggling during these difficult \ntimes due to the unscrupulous trade practices employed by the People's \nRepublic of China.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Johanns):\n  S. 3614. A bill to establish a pilot program to authorize the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to nonprofit \norganizations to rehabilitate and modify homes of disabled and low-\nincome veterans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Housing \nAssistance for Veterans Act along with my colleague Senator Johanns.\n  Our veterans have made many personal sacrifices in service to our \nnation. We must honor our commitment to provide them with the care they \nhave earned and deserved, in both word and deed. One such way is to \nensure that they have access to adequate housing.\n  According to Rebuilding Together, more than a quarter of all \nveterans, about six million, are estimated to be disabled. In my home \nState of Rhode Island, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are \nmore than 19,000 veterans with disabilities, each of whom face their \nown unique challenges in terms of their housing needs.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has programs that assist \nthese veterans in adapting and improving their homes. Unfortunately, \nthese programs do not extend assistance to all veterans with \ndisabilities. It is clear we must do more, and with this legislation, \nwe are seeking to serve all veterans with disabilities, regardless of \nthe severity of the disability and whether the disability is service-\nconnected. The Housing Assistance for Veterans Act will give them the \nopportunity to renovate and modify their existing homes by installing \nwheelchair ramps, widening doors, re-equipping rooms, and making \nnecessary additions and adjustments to existing structures, all so that \nthese homes are both more suitable and safer for our veterans.\n  Our legislation encourages key stakeholders, such as the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, the VA, housing non-profits, and \nveterans service organizations, to work together to serve our veterans. \nIn order to extend the reach of this Federal funding, grant recipients \nwould be expected to either match Federal funding or make in-kind \ncontributions, through encouraging volunteers to help make repairs or \nengaging businesses to donate needed supplies.\n  This bill is supported by Rebuilding Together, VetsFirst, Vietnam \nVeterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and Habitat for Humanity. I thank Senator Johanns for working \nwith me on this important bill, and I look forward to working with him \nand the rest of our colleagues to pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6629-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6629-S6630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 575--COMMENDING THE 4 AMERICAN PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO \n    DIED IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA JOHN \n CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, SEAN SMITH, TYRONE WOODS, AND GLEN DOHERTY, FOR \nTHEIR TIRELESS EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND CONDEMNING \n     THE VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 580\n\n       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican \n     Island;\n       Whereas, in 2012, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the premier \n     system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the world, \n     and has grown to more than 150,000,000 acres, 558 national \n     wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management districts in \n     every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the United States, and these protected lands offer a variety \n     of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas more than 360 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and more than 300 units of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, \n     averaging more than 2,500,000 hunting visits and more than \n     7,000,000 fishing visits each year;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experienced \n     more than 30,000,000 wildlife observation visits during \n     fiscal year 2012;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas, for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate $4 in economic activity;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     approximately 47,000,000 visits each year, which generated \n     nearly $2,100,000,000 and more than 35,000 jobs in local \n     economies during fiscal year 2012;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\n     of mammals, 250 species of reptiles and amphibians, and more \n     than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to \n     outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in \n     funds, which has enabled the purchase or lease of more than \n     5,500,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the National Wildlife \n     Refuge System;\n       Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect \n     imperiled species, and of the more than 1,300 federally \n     listed threatened and endangered species in the United \n     States, 280 species are found on units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas more than 42,000 volunteers and approximately 220 \n     national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute \n     nearly 1,600,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 766 full-\n     time employees, and provide an important link to local \n     communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge \n     located within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the United States have \n     held festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek \n     stakeholder input on the implementation of ``Conserving the \n     Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', an update \n     to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife Service for \n     the future of the National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 14, 2012, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service; and\n       Whereas the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week by \n     the Senate would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States, raise awareness about the \n     importance of wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System, and celebrate the myriad recreational opportunities \n     available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 14, 2012, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife Refuge \n     Week with appropriate events and activities;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for future generations;\n       (5) identifies the significance of national wildlife \n     refuges in advancing the traditions of wildlife observation, \n     photography, environmental education, and interpretation;\n       (6) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems, as well as compatible uses;\n       (7) acknowledges the role of national wildlife refuges in \n     conserving waterfowl and waterfowl habitat pursuant to the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755, chapter 128);\n       (8) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife \n     conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       (9) expresses the intent of the Senate--\n       (A) to continue working to conserve wildlife; and\n       (B) to manage the National Wildlife Refuge System for \n     current and future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) overriding \n     mission is to lead a unified national effort to protect the \n     United States. United\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\n     States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the \n     largest investigative agency within DHS and is charged with \n     enforcing a wide array of laws, including laws related to \n     securing the border and combating criminal smuggling.\n       (2) Mexico's northern border with the United States has \n     experienced a dramatic surge in border crime and violence in \n     recent years due to intense competition between Mexican drug \n     cartels and criminal smuggling organizations that employ \n     predatory tactics to realize their profits.\n       (3) Law enforcement agencies at the United States northern \n     border also face challenges from transnational smuggling \n     organizations.\n       (4) In response, DHS has partnered with Federal, State, \n     local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement counterparts to \n     create the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) \n     initiative as a comprehensive approach to addressing border \n     security threats. These multi-agency teams are designed to \n     increase information-sharing and collaboration among the \n     participating law enforcement agencies.\n       (5) BEST teams incorporate personnel from ICE, United \n     States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFE), the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation (FBI), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), \n     and the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO), along with other key \n     Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies.\n       (6) Foreign law enforcement agencies participating in BEST \n     include Mexico's Secretaria de Seguridad Publica (SSP), the \n     Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the Ontario Provincial \n     Police (OPP), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 466\n\n       Whereas Ukraine has experienced encouraging growth and \n     reforms since it declared its independence from the former \n     Soviet Union in 1991 and adopted its first constitution in \n     1996;\n       Whereas the 1996 constitution provided basic freedoms like \n     the freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and press, but was \n     ultimately too weak to contain the existing corruption-laced \n     political culture inherited from its communist past;\n       Whereas, as a result of the electoral fraud by which Prime \n     Minister Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner of the \n     2004 presidential election, the citizens of the Ukraine \n     organized a series of protests, strikes, and sit-ins, which \n     came to be known as ``The Orange Revolution'';\n       Whereas the Orange Revolution, in concert with \n     international pressure, forced an unprecedented second run-\n     off election, which resulted in opposition leader Viktor \n     Yushchenko defeating Mr. Yanukovych by a margin of 52 percent \n     to 44 percent;\n       Whereas, in the 2010 presidential election, incumbent \n     Yushchenko won only 5.5 percent in the first round of voting, \n     which left former Prime Minister Yanukovych and then Prime \n     Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to face one another in the run-off \n     election;\n       Whereas, Mr. Yanukovych defeated Ms. Tymoshenko by a margin \n     of 49 percent to 44 percent;\n       Whereas, shortly after the 2010 inauguration of Mr. \n     Yanukovych, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court found most of \n     the 2004 Orange Revolution inspired constitutional reforms \n     unconstitutional;\n       Whereas, in 2010, President Yanukovych appointed Viktor \n     Pshonka Prosecutor General;\n       Whereas, since Mr. Pshonka's appointment, more than a dozen \n     political leaders associated with the 2004 Orange Revolution \n     have faced criminal charges under the Abuse of Office and \n     Exceeding Official Powers articles of the Ukrainian Criminal \n     Code;\n       Whereas, in 2011, Prosecutor General Pshonka brought \n     charges under these Abuse of Office articles against former \n     Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko over her decision while in \n     office to conclude a natural gas contract between Ukraine and \n     Russia;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2011, Ms. Tymoshenko was found \n     guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison, fined \n     $189,000,000, and banned from holding public office for three \n     years following the completion of her sentence;\n       Whereas, recognizing the judicial abuses present in \n     Ukraine, the Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe (PACE) \n     passed Resolution 1862 on January 26, 2012;\n       Whereas Resolution 1862 declared that the Abuse of Office \n     and Exceeding Official Powers articles under which Ms. \n     Tymoshenko was convicted are ``overly broad in application \n     and effectively allow for ex post facto criminalization of \n     normal political decision making'';\n       Whereas, since Ms. Tymoshenko's imprisonment, the \n     Prosecutor General's Office has reopened additional cases \n     against her that were previously closed and thought to be \n     sealed under a 10-year statute of limitations;\n       Whereas, beginning on October 28, 2011, and multiple times \n     since, Ukrainian Deputy Prosecutor General Renat Kuzmin has \n     alleged in television interviews that Tymoshenko was involved \n     in contract killings, but has filed no formal charges;\n       Whereas, for much of Ms. Tymoshenko's detention, she had \n     limited outside contact and access to needed medical \n     treatment;\n       Whereas international calls for Ms. Tymoshenko's release, \n     access to outside visitors, and adequate medical treatment \n     were initially ignored even as her health continued to \n     deteriorate;\n       Whereas, on April 28, 2012, major international news \n     organizations, including the British Broadcast Corporation \n     and Reuters, reported on and produced photos of bruises \n     allegedly received by Ms. Tymoshenko from prison guards on \n     April 20, 2012;\n       Whereas, in response to her inhumane treatment, Ms. \n     Tymoshenko began a hunger strike on April 20, 2012;\n       Whereas, amid international outrage, the European Union has \n     delayed indefinitely the signing of a free trade agreement \n     with Ukraine;\n       Whereas, under international pressure, Ms. Tymoshenko was \n     moved to a hospital in Kharkiv on May 9, 2012, prompting her \n     to end her hunger strike, yet leaving her in poor health; and\n       Whereas on May 30, 2012, the European Parliament passed a \n     resolution (C153/21) deploring the sentencing of Ms. \n     Tymoshenko: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the selective and politically motivated \n     prosecution and imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia \n     Tymoshenko;\n       (2) expresses its deep concern that the politicized \n     prosecutions and continued detention of Ms. Tymoshenko and \n     other members of her party took place in a country that is \n     scheduled to assume chairmanship of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2013;\n       (3) expresses its deep concern that the continued detention \n     of Ms. Tymoshenko threatens to jeopardize ties between the \n     United States and Ukraine;\n       (4) calls for the Government of Ukraine to release Ms. \n     Tymoshenko, to provide her with timely access to medical \n     care, and to conduct the October parliamentary elections in a \n     fair and transparent manner consistent with OSCE standards; \n     and\n       (5) calls on the Department of State to institute a visa \n     ban against those responsible for the imprisonment and \n     mistreatment of Ms. Tymoshenko and the more than dozen \n     political leaders associated with the 2004 Orange Revolution.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, a moving 11-day journey recently came to an \nend. Nearly 4,300 athletes from 166 countries traveled to London, \nEngland, to fulfill their dream of representing their country at the \n2012 Paralympic games. I congratulate each of these athletes on a job \nwell done and for their hard work, determination and triumph. Their \naccomplishments inspired us all and help to broaden our sense of what \nis possible for individuals living with a disability.\n  Shortly after the 2012 Olympic games concluded, Olympic officials \nworked feverishly to transform the Olympic venues for the upcoming \nParalympic games. Their task was formidable, and their work was \nimpressive. And once again, London proved to be an exceedingly \nwelcoming host. In fact, more than 2.7 million spectators attended the \ngames, shattering the previous mark and making these games the best \nattended in history. Many venues were filled to capacity. The energy \nand excitement of the fans was impressive and a wonderful inspiration \nfor these athletes to showcase their talents. While the world watched \nwith joy and amazement, the athletes competed fiercely, setting an \nastonishing 251 world records in the process.\n  Those in attendance and audiences around the world were treated to \nmany dazzling performances and were introduced to some truly inspiring \npersonal stories. One such story is that of LT. Brad Synder. Almost 1 \nyear ago to the day, Lieutenant Synder was bravely serving his country \nin Afghanistan when a bomb exploded, rendering him blind. One year \nlater, he stood in London, again representing his country, with two \ngold medals and a silver in swimming around his neck and a world record \nin his grasp. In the face of such a tragic and life-altering injury, \nthis brave soldier refused to let this injury define him and forged \nahead, setting his sights on a new goal. There is also LCDR Steven \nPeace who began cycling during rehabilitation from a stroke he suffered \nduring Active Duty and competed for Team USA in that event. And there \nis Scot Severn, another former soldier, who won bronze in shot put at \nthese games after recovering from injuries sustained from a lighting \nstrike while on duty. These are but a few of the seemingly endless \nstories of perseverance and strength that define the lives of these \nathletes and enrich the lives of all of us.\n  It was in 1948 that the seed of what would grow to become the second \nlargest sporting event in the world was planted in London. Sir Ludwig \nGuttman sought to inspire recently wounded World War II veterans by \norganizing a sporting event to raise their spirits and aid their \nrehabilitation. After years of increasing participation and awareness, \nthis sporting event, which was conceived to parallel the Olympic games, \nwould formally become known as the Paralympic games in 1960. In 2012, \n227 athletes represented the United States in London.\n  There were many Paralympic athletes with ties to Michigan on Team \nUSA. They represented their Nation and Michigan admirably. They include \nSteve Peace in cycling, Asya Miller in goalball, Robin Theryoung in \ngoalball, Tucker Dupree in swimming, Scott Severn in track and field, \nBryan Barten in wheelchair tennis, and Mackenzie Soldan in wheelchair \ntennis. Along with these impressive athletes, I also congratulate the \nlegions of coaches, trainers, officials, support staff, family and \nfriends who played indispensable roles for these athletes and helped to \nmake their performances possible.\n  There are more than 24 million Americans living with a disability and \nmany more who face some sort of physical, visual or mental challenge. \nThe athletes who competed in London sent a strong, compelling signal \nthat, while their circumstance may seem daunting, there are many \nmountains to climb and races to win if they are determined and willing \nto pursue excellence in whatever field they choose, whether it be the \ntrack, a classroom or any other worthy pursuit. These games also bring \ngreater awareness and more resources to efforts to increase the \navailability of physical activity for disabled Americans across the \nNation, the benefits of which have been well-documented in recent \nyears.\n  The 2012 Paralympic games dazzled us with impressive athletic feats, \ninspired us with stories of courage and perseverance, and reminded us \nthat we can all overcome adversity and pursue excellence both in \ncompetition and in life. The 2012 summer Paralympic games, like the \nOlympic games that preceded it, was a stage on which athletes from \nacross the globe came together in friendly competition. Barb and I \nsalute every athlete who represented Team USA in London. As one \norganizer eloquently stated, ``The Paralympians have lifted the cloud \nof limitation.'' For that, we owe them a deep debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6677-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6677-S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        2012 PARALYMPIC ATHLETES\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize three of our \nNation's inspiring Paralympians, with Connecticut roots, who competed, \nalong with 227 American teammates and more than 4,000 athletes from \nover 160 countries, in this year's Paralympic games in London. During \nthese games, which took place from August 29 to September 9, the United \nStates brought home 98 medals, including 31 gold medals. The \nexceptional drive, discipline, and dreams of these athletes are as \nextraordinary as the medals. Their personal stories of sacrifice and \nhard work, effort and energy, and aspirations turned into realities, \ndespite setbacks and adversity, are truly remarkable.\n  In 1948 at Aylesbury, England's Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the idea \nof the Paralympics was formed, and so it is historically significant \nthat England hosted this year's Paralympic games. Sir Ludwig Guttmann \nenvisioned including disabled veterans in international sports \ncompetition, and in 1948 his dream was realized in the International \nWheelchair Games. In 1960, Rome hosted the first official Paralympic \ngames as we know them today. As we look back at this year's games--one \nof the largest Paralympics in historya--we celebrate this legacy. We \nare reminded of how important these games were for the rehabilitation \nof our disabled World War II veterans.\n  For Tara Profitt of Newington, CT, and member of the 2012 U.S. \nParalympic Table Tennis Team, England as host country is personally \nsignificant. Ms. Profitt competed in the women's singles competition at \nthe 1984 Paralympics hosted in Stoke Mandeville, England, but always \nhoped to have the opportunity to play alongside her college friend and \nfellow table tennis champion, Pamela Fontaine, in the women's team \nclass. This year, in addition to participating individually in the \nwomen's single class events, Ms. Profitt and Ms. Fontaine were selected \nto represent the United States together in the women's team event, \nreuniting again on familiar territory. Ms. Profitt has credited Ms. \nFontaine with inspiring her to become the athlete she is today, \nencouraging her to engage in sports again after the diving injury that \nshe suffered as a teenager. They have worked hard to qualify over the \npast few years, traveling around the world to compete, and this year \nachieved the goal that they have held dearly for decades: to play \ntogether, celebrating their country and friendship on an international \nstage.\n  Representing the United States in track and field, three-time gold \nmedalist Paul Nitz traveled from Bloomfield, CT, to participate in his \nthird Paralympic games. This year, he was given the tremendous honor of \nserving as track captain for the U.S. Paralympic Track and Field team, \ninspiring both first-time and veteran athletes. Mr. Nitz has an \naccomplished athletic record: He won the Gold in the 100m event in \n1992, 1996, and 2000 and broke the 100m world record during the 2012 \nSwiss Series. This year, I am proud to announce that he brought home \nthe bronze in the 100m. Equally commendable, Mr. Nitz works in his \ncommunity--as an employee of the Hartford Insurance Group--to \npositively change public perception regarding disability. In addition \nto his impressive athletic achievements, through his efforts at the \nHartford, he has led great strides across the Nation in dispelling \nprejudice, misconception, and judgment.\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\n  I also applaud the Hartford Insurance Group for their commitment to \nthe Paralympic games: Since 2003, it has been a founding partner of the \nU.S. Paralympics, an official division of the U.S. Olympic Committee.\n  Five-time Paralympian Scott Danberg calls Stamford his hometown, and \nConnecticut has been proud to follow him throughout his impressive \nathletic career. Recently, as a well-known and regarded member of the \nU.S. Paralympic track and field team, he competed in the men's discus \nevent, throwing his personal best for this season in London. And this \nyear he was nominated by his fellow track and field members and then \nchosen by a vote by the U.S. paralympic team as our Nation's flag \nbearer during opening ceremonies. He adds this tremendous honor to his \npast accomplishments, including the bronze at the 2011 IPC World \nChampionships, the gold at the 2010 U.S. Paralympics Track & Field \nNational Championships in both discus and shot put, and the silver in \njavelin at the 1998 Paralympic games.\n  I hope that Connecticut's Paralympians can continue to promote \ninternational and national awareness and engagement and we can continue \nto come together as a nation, recognizing what unites us. Thank you for \njoining me in applauding our amazing American athletes and those around \nthe world who have shown the athleticism, stamina, and national \nidentity that transcends differences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6678-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING MISSISSIPPI'S OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the gifted \nathletes from my home State of Mississippi who represented the United \nStates in the 2012 London Olympic games and Paralympic games. They join \nan extraordinary legacy built by generations of great American \nOlympians and Paralympians, and their historic successes on the world \nstage are a proud moment for Mississippi.\n  In the London Olympic games, Gulfport native Brittney Reese became \nthe first American woman to win a gold medal in long jump since Jackie \nJoyner-Kersee, who won it more than two decades ago in the Seoul games. \nThe Olympic title tops an impressive career for the former University \nof Mississippi standout and four-time world champion, who has become an \nunmatched competitor over the past several years.\n  Particularly heartfelt and inspiring was Reese's dedication of her \ngold-medal success to the people of Mississippi and those still \nrecovering from Hurricane Katrina, which damaged her family's home 7 \nyears ago. As she told reporters, ``This is a great way for me to bring \nsomething home and show them we can all do this together.''\n  Bianca Knight of Ridgeland helped lead the women's 4x100-meter relay \nteam to a gold-medal win in an incredible 40.82 seconds--besting the \nworld record set by East Germany in 1985. The performance earned the \nUnited States its first Olympic gold medal in the women's relay event \nsince 1996 in Atlanta.\n  In the men's 4x100-meter relay, Coldwater sprinter Trell Kimmons and \nhis teammates blazed through to a silver-medal finish--setting a new \nAmerican record. Former Jackson State University track star Michael \nTinsley also won silver in the 400-meter hurdles. Isiah Young, a \ntalented athlete at the University of Mississippi, made his Olympic \ndebut in the exciting 200-meter dash, advancing to the semifinals with \nan impressive run against decorated Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt.\n  One Mississippian continued her Olympic success this time as a coach \nfor the U.S. women's basketball team. Assistant coach Jennifer Gillom, \nan Ole Miss graduate from Abbeville, helped lead the team to a gold-\nmedal victory in London. She won gold as a player during the Seoul \nGames and is the first person in Ole Miss women's basketball history to \nbe part of multiple medal wins.\n  Like the Olympics, the London Paralympic games were also a \nspectacular display of athleticism and perseverance. The international \nsports event for athletes with disabilities began shortly after World \nWar II as a way for those with war injuries to enhance their quality of \nlife. More than 4,000 athletes competed in this year's Paralympic \ngames--including four Mississippians who captivated the world with \noutstanding performances.\n  Shaquille Vance of Houston set a new American record in the men's \n200-meter-T42 event--earning the silver medal. Richard Browne of \nJackson sprinted to a silver-medal finish in the highly anticipated \n100-meter-T44 race. Top-ranked competitors Ryan Estep and Joseph \nBrinson of Florence showcased their expertise as part of the U.S. \nwheelchair fencing team, with Estep competing in the epee-style event \nand Brinson in the saber-style competition.\n  I thank the family and friends who have supported and encouraged \nthese athletes throughout this incredible journey. The Olympics and \nParalympics are a dream for athletes around the world and a life-\nchanging experience for those who participate. I congratulate these \ninspiring Mississippians on their remarkable accomplishments. They have \nworked hard and made us proud.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Res. 576\n\n       Whereas October 10, 2012, marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     signing of Public Law 87-788 (commonly known as the \n     ``McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act'') (16 U.S.C. \n     582a et seq.), which authorized the Secretary of Agriculture \n     to encourage and assist States in conducting a program of \n     forestry research;\n       Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act was \n     named for the 2 primary, bipartisan sponsors of the Act, \n     Representative Clifford G. McIntire of Maine and Senator John \n     C. Stennis of Mississippi, who recognized that research in \n     forestry is the ``driving force behind progress in developing \n     and utilizing the Nation's forests'';\n       Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act \n     recognized that forestry research would be more effective \n     nationwide if efforts among State-supported institutions of \n     higher education were partnered and more closely coordinated \n     with forestry research activities in the Federal Government;\n       Whereas Congressman McIntire and Senator Stennis stated a \n     clear intent to address the important need of the United \n     States for increased numbers of highly trained forestry \n     scientists and other research professionals;\n       Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act has \n     provided 5 decades of base funding to establish and \n     strengthen research and training capacity in forestry at \n     State-supported institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas funds provided by the Act to State-supported \n     institutions of higher education are highly leveraged with \n     non-Federal funds;\n       Whereas university-based forestry research has provided an \n     accumulated wealth of science-based knowledge, skills, and \n     technologies that have been critical for sustaining United \n     States forests for economic, ecological, and social benefits;\n       Whereas funds provided by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative \n     Forestry Act for forestry research at State-supported \n     institutions of higher education have provided significant \n     graduate student support over the last 50 years, resulting in \n     8,500 master's degrees and 2,600 doctoral degrees;\n       Whereas the State-supported institutions of higher \n     education that receive funds under the McIntire-Stennis \n     Cooperative Forestry Act conduct forestry research in all 50 \n     States and 4 territories of the United States, and \n     disseminate the results of those efforts locally, regionally, \n     nationally, and globally for the betterment of the \n     communities of the institutions, the United States, and the \n     world; and\n       Whereas many State-supported institutions of higher \n     education are celebrating and commemorating the 50th \n     anniversary of the signing of the McIntire-Stennis \n     Cooperative Forestry Act: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the signing of \n     Public Law 87-788 (commonly known as the ``McIntire-Stennis \n     Cooperative Forestry Act'') (16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.) by \n     President John F. Kennedy;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the \n     McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities;\n       (3) affirms the continuing importance and vitality of the \n     State-supported institutions of higher education conducting \n     forestry research and training supported by the McIntire-\n     Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act; and\n       (4) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit to the National Association of University Forest \n     Resources Programs an enrolled copy of this resolution for \n     appropriate display.\n\n                              S. Res. 577\n\n       Whereas the First Special Service Force (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``Force''), a military unit composed of \n     volunteers from the United States and Canada, was activated \n     in July 1942 at Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana;\n       Whereas the Force was initially intended to target military \n     and industrial installations that were supporting the German \n     war effort, including important hydroelectric plants, which \n     would severely limit the production of strategic materials \n     used by the Axis powers;\n       Whereas, from July 1942 through June 1943, volunteers of \n     the Force trained in hazardous, arctic conditions in the \n     mountains of western Montana, and in the waterways of Camp \n     Bradford, Virginia;\n       Whereas the combat echelon of the Force totaled 1,800 \n     soldiers, half from the United States and half from Canada;\n       Whereas the Force also contained a service battalion, \n     composed of 800 members from the United States, that provided \n     important support for the combat troops;\n       Whereas a special bond developed between the Canadian and \n     United States soldiers, who were not segregated by country, \n     although the commander of the Force was a United States \n     colonel;\n       Whereas the Force was the only unit formed during World War \n     II that consisted of troops from Canada and the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in October 1943, the Force went to Italy, where it \n     fought in battles south of Cassino, including Monte La \n     Difensa and Monte Majo, two mountain peaks that were a \n     critical anchor of the German defense line;\n       Whereas, during the night of December 3, 1943, the Force \n     ascended to the top of the precipitous face of Monte La \n     Difensa, where the Force suffered heavy casualties and \n     overcame fierce resistance to overtake the German line;\n       Whereas, after the battle for La Difensa, the Force \n     continued to fight tough battles at high altitudes, in rugged \n     terrain, and in severe weather;\n       Whereas, after battles on the strongly defended Italian \n     peaks of Sammucro, Vischiataro, and Remetanea, the size of \n     the Force had been reduced from 1,800 soldiers to fewer than \n     500;\n       Whereas, for 4 months in 1944, the Force engaged in raids \n     and aggressive patrols at the Anzio Beachhead;\n       Whereas, on June 4, 1944, members of the Force were among \n     the first Allied troops to liberate Rome;\n       Whereas, after liberating Rome, the Force moved to southern \n     Italy and prepared to assist in the liberation of France;\n       Whereas, during the early morning of August 15, 1944, \n     members of the Force made silent landings on Les Iles \n     D'Hyeres, small islands in the Mediterranean Sea along the \n     southern coast of France;\n       Whereas the Force faced a sustained and withering assault \n     from the German garrisons as the Force progressed from the \n     islands to the Franco-Italian border;\n       Whereas, after the Allied forces secured the Franco-Italian \n     border, the United States Army ordered the disbandment of the \n     Force on December 5, 1944, in Nice, France;\n       Whereas, during 251 days of combat, the Force suffered \n     2,314 casualties, or 134 percent of its authorized strength, \n     captured thousands of prisoners, won 5 United States campaign \n     stars and 8 Canadian battle honors, and never failed a \n     mission;\n       Whereas the United States is forever indebted to the acts \n     of bravery and selflessness of the troops of the Force, who \n     risked their lives for the cause of freedom;\n       Whereas the efforts of the Force along the seas and skies \n     of Europe were critical in repelling the advance of Nazi \n     Germany and liberating numerous communities in France and \n     Italy;\n       Whereas the bond between the members of the Force from the \n     United States and those from Canada has endured over the \n     decades, as the members meet every year for a reunion, \n     alternating between the United States and Canada; and\n       Whereas the traditions and honors exhibited by the Force \n     are carried on by 2 outstanding active units of 2 great \n     democracies, the Special Forces of the United States and the \n     Canadian Special Operations Regiment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and honors the \n     superior service of the First Special Service Force during \n     World War II.\n\n                              S. Res. 578\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a \n     special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration for 11 \n     years who was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while \n     engaged in the battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established by the \n     National Family Partnership to preserve the memory of Special \n     Agent Camarena and further the cause for which he gave his \n     life;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally \n     recognized since 1988 and is now the oldest and largest drug \n     prevention program in the United States, reaching millions of \n     young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, established in \n     1973, aggressively targets organizations involved in the \n     growing, manufacturing, and distribution of controlled \n     substances and has been a steadfast partner in commemorating \n     Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and attorneys general of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, PRIDE Youth Programs, Young \n     Marines, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and hundreds of \n     other organizations throughout the United States annually \n     celebrate Red Ribbon Week during the period of October 23 \n     through October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     United States faces in securing a safe and healthy future for \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas emerging drug threats and growing epidemics demand \n     attention, with a particular focus on prescription \n     medications, the second most abused drug by young people in \n     the United States, and synthetic drugs;\n       Whereas, since the majority of teenagers abusing \n     prescription medications get the medications from family, \n     friends, and home medicine cabinets, the Drug Enforcement\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\n     Administration will host a National Take Back Day on \n     September 29, 2012, for the public to safely dispose of \n     unused or expired prescription medications that can lead to \n     accidental poisoning, overdose, and abuse;\n       Whereas synthetic marijuana, also known as ``K2'' or \n     ``Spice'', has become especially popular, particularly among \n     teenagers and young adults, and in 2011 poison centers across \n     the United States responded to about 6,960 calls related to \n     synthetic marijuana, up from approximately 2,900 calls in \n     2010;\n       Whereas Congress recently enacted the Food and Drug \n     Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144; \n     126 Stat. 993), which adds 26 synthetic drugs to the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), including \n     the drugs commonly found in products marketed as K2, Spice, \n     and bath salts; and\n       Whereas parents, young people, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during the week-long celebration of \n     Red Ribbon Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2012;\n       (2) encourages children and teenagers to choose to live \n     drug-free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to promote the creation of drug-free communities; and\n       (B) to participate in drug prevention activities to show \n     support for healthy, productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n                              S. Res. 579\n\n       Whereas there are 105 historically Black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities \n     provide the quality education essential to full participation \n     in a complex, highly technological society;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities have a \n     rich heritage and have played a prominent role in the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities allow \n     talented and diverse students, many of whom represent \n     underserved populations, to attain their full potential \n     through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically Black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 24 through September \n     28, 2012, as ``National Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities Week''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs to demonstrate support for \n     historically Black colleges and universities in the United \n     States.\n\n                              S. Res. 580\n\n       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican \n     Island;\n       Whereas, in 2012, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the premier \n     system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the world, \n     and has grown to more than 150,000,000 acres, 558 national \n     wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management districts in \n     every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the United States, and these protected lands offer a variety \n     of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas more than 360 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and more than 300 units of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, \n     averaging more than 2,500,000 hunting visits and more than \n     7,000,000 fishing visits each year;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experienced \n     more than 30,000,000 wildlife observation visits during \n     fiscal year 2012;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas, for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate $4 in economic activity;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     approximately 47,000,000 visits each year, which generated \n     nearly $2,100,000,000 and more than 35,000 jobs in local \n     economies during fiscal year 2012;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to \n     outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in \n     funds, which has enabled the purchase or lease of more than \n     5,500,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the National Wildlife \n     Refuge System;\n       Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect \n     imperiled species, and of the more than 1,300 federally \n     listed threatened and endangered species in the United \n     States, 280 species are found on units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas more than 42,000 volunteers and approximately 220 \n     national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute \n     nearly 1,600,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 766 full-\n     time employees, and provide an important link to local \n     communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge \n     located within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the United States have \n     held festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek \n     stakeholder input on the implementation of ``Conserving the \n     Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', an update \n     to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife Service for \n     the future of the National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 14, 2012, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service; and\n       Whereas the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week by \n     the Senate would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States, raise awareness about the \n     importance of wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System, and celebrate the myriad recreational opportunities \n     available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 14, 2012, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife Refuge \n     Week with appropriate events and activities;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for future generations;\n       (5) identifies the significance of national wildlife \n     refuges in advancing the traditions of wildlife observation, \n     photography, environmental education, and interpretation;\n       (6) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems, as well as compatible uses;\n       (7) acknowledges the role of national wildlife refuges in \n     conserving waterfowl and waterfowl habitat pursuant to the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755, chapter 128);\n       (8) reaffirms the support of the

Res. 585\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution, \nalong with my colleague Senator Tom Udall, recognizing the centennial \nanniversary of New Mexico's statehood.\n  For over 100 years, New Mexico, the ``Land of Enchantment,'' has \nenriched the Nation with its magnificent landscapes, diverse people, \nand unique culture. New Mexico's road to statehood began in 1850 when \nthe New Mexico Territory was established. Statehood was finally \nachieved on January 6, 1912 when President William Howard Taft signed \nthe proclamation making New Mexico the 47th State of the Union. New \nMexico's history long predates this, though, with the State's earliest \ninhabitants dating as far back as 11,000 B.C. The State's capitol, \nSanta Fe, is the oldest capital city in the United States, having been \nestablished by the Spanish in 1610.\n  New Mexico's beautiful deserts and mountains have been a magnet for \nvisitors. It is no wonder that our State has inspired artists beginning \nwith our earliest inhabitants. New Mexicans have a proud history of \nmilitary service, and the State has served as a center for scientific \ninnovation for over half a century through the national laboratories \nbased there. Among New Mexico's agricultural products, its chile crop \nmakes it the ``Chile Capital of the World.''\n  Given New Mexico's many contributions and accomplishments in its \nfirst 100 years as a State, and even before then, I am proud to \nintroduce this resolution recognizing the extraordinary history and \nheritage of the State, and commending the State and its people on this \ncentennial anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/21/senate-section/article/S6684-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SIGNING AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.
