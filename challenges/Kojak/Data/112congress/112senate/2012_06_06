Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 415, S. \n3240.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 415, S. 3240, a bill to \n     reauthorize agriculture programs through 2017, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nfarm bill.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that today at 4 p.m. the Senate proceed \nto executive session to consider Calendar No. 610; that there be 90 \nminutes for debate, which will be equally divided in the usual form; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no \nfurther motions be in order; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following my remarks and those of my \nesteemed colleague, the first hour will be equally divided, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half. We hope to reach an agreement to begin consideration of the \nfarm bill today.\n  Madam President, in a time when too many of the products we buy are \nmade overseas, America can be satisfied that most of the food we eat is \ngrown right here at home. The American agricultural industry boasted a \n$42 billion trade surplus last year--greater than any other sector in \nour economy. Our farmers are the most productive in the world, \nexporting $136 billion worth of their yield last year.\n  It is amazing how States produce agricultural products. The State of \nNew York isn't considered by most people to be an agricultural State, \nbut it is. The State of Michigan is not considered by most people to be \nan agricultural State, but it is. Even some of the States in the \nwestern part of the United States produce products that are exported. \nFor example, in Nevada, alfalfa is exported. It is very high in \nprotein. It is made into pellets, and it is a needed commodity \noverseas. So all over America the farm bill is important.\n  Our farmers are the most productive in the world, exporting $136 \nbillion worth of their yield last year. At a time of economic \nuncertainty, America's agricultural industry supports 16 million much \nneeded jobs. So Congress must give farmers the certainty they need to \nkeep this industry thriving.\n  I commend Senators Stabenow and Roberts, the managers of this bill, \nfor crafting a strong bipartisan bill. This\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nmeasure will create jobs and cut subsidies. It includes important \nreforms that make farm and food stamp programs more accountable and \nmore defensible.\n  With more farmers seeking global markets for their product more than \never before, this bill supports rural farm jobs as well as urban \nmanufacturing jobs. It will help new farmers--especially those who \nserved their country in the Armed Forces--to build successful \nbusinesses. This legislation helps local farmers sell their products \nwhere they grow them--connecting farms, schools, and communities. And \nit saves $23 billion, which we will use to reduce this deficit we have.\n  I know there are a number of Democratic and Republican Senators who \nwish to offer amendments to this legislation. I have confidence in the \nleadership of Senators Stabenow and Roberts and look forward to working \nquickly and cooperatively to pass the bill that creates jobs, cuts \nsubsidies, and reduces the deficit, while protecting American farmers.\n\n\n                   Capitol Police Chief Phillip Morse\n\n  Madam President, every day the dedicated officers of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice keep members of Congress, our staffs, and millions of visitors \nfrom around the world who visit the Capitol grounds each year safe. For \nthe last 6 years, this department has been led and run by Chief of \nPolice Phillip Morse. He spent more than half of his life on the \nCapitol Police Force, and I think it is time for a little down time. \nToday Chief Morse retires after 28 years serving and protecting the \nU.S. Capitol. I thank him for his service and congratulate him on a job \nwell done.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n               68th Anniversary of D-day and Honor Flight\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today, on the 68th anniversary of D-\nday, I am honored to recognize a distinguished group of World War II \nveterans from my State of Kentucky who have come to the Nation's \nCapital to visit the World War II Memorial on the Mall that they helped \nto inspire.\n  Thanks to the noble work of the Honor Flight Program and the leaders \nof the Bluegrass Chapter, including Brian Duffy, these brave patriots, \nalong with their brothers-in-arms from the Korean war, will see the \nnational memorials built in their honor today. Over the years, the \nHonor Flight Bluegrass Chapter has brought some 1,100 veterans--most \nfrom Kentucky--to Washington, DC, for this purpose. This program \nprovides transportation, lodging, and food for the veterans. Without \nHonor Flight, most of these veterans would never be able to visit the \nCapital or see the World War II Memorial.\n  I have been privileged to visit with groups of Honor Flight veterans \nbefore, and I am pleased to report that I will be meeting with today's \ngroup at their memorial as well. My father served in World War II, and \nit is an honor to shake hands with his contemporaries, hear their \nstories, and thank them for their service.\n  America is forever indebted to the heroic members of the U.S. \nmilitary who defended this great Nation and fought for freedom and \nagainst tyranny in World War II. They have truly earned the title of \n``the greatest generation.''\n  I also thank the Honor Flight Program and Brian Duffy for their \ncontinued commitment to bring Kentucky's World War II and Korean \nveterans to see their memorials. Brian and the Bluegrass Chapter do \nwhat they do because they have great admiration and respect for our \nmilitary veterans. I know my colleagues join me in saying that this \nSenate shares that admiration and respect, be it for members of ``the \ngreatest generation'' or for the current generation of brave volunteers \nwho have served in Afghanistan and/or Iraq or are serving today \nelsewhere across the world.\n  I wish to recognize each and every World War II and Korean war \nveteran from Kentucky who is visiting the memorial in our Nation's \nCapital today, and I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nList of World War II and Korean War Veterans Brought by Honor Flight to \nVisit the National Memorials on June 6, 2012--The 68th Anniversary of D \n                                  Day\n\n       Sam Adams; Louisville, KY\n       Clifford Barker; Morehead, KY\n       David Braun; Jamestown, KY\n       Harry Hughes Bush; Richmond, KY\n       Edgar Lewis Casada; Highland, IN\n       Herman Combs; Bronston, KY\n       Franklin Delano Coovert; Lexington, KY\n       Thomas Alton Curtsinger; Owensboro, KY\n       Guy Moorman Deane Jr.; Owensboro, KY\n       Earl E.

Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Sequestration Transparency Act\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe significant uncertainty surrounding sequestration and its threat to \nour economy. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted that the \npending fiscal cliff facing this country; that is, the scheduled tax \nincreases and across-the-board spending cuts that will result from the \nexpiration of current tax policy and the enactment of sequestration, \ncould lead to recession. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office said \nrepeatedly that if the tax increases and sequestration occur at the end \nof this year, there will be a 1.3-percent economic contraction during \nthe first quarter of 2013. I believe that would argue for extending the \nexisting tax rates. I think the uncertainty associated with the tax \nrates perhaps expiring at the end of the year and businesses not \nknowing what is going to happen is creating a real problem and a real \ncloud out there in the economy.\n  I believe it is important that there be economic certainty for people \nin this country, particularly for investors and small businesses. So it \nseems to me, at least, that getting those tax rates extended would be a \nvery important part of the solution.\n\n  Having said that, I also believe we need tax reform for this country. \nWe need comprehensive tax reform that will fuel economic growth. I \nthink there is enormous potential for economic growth and job creation \nif, in fact, we could get to overhauling our Tax Code in this country, \nmaking it more simple, more fair, more clear, and obviously lowering \nthe rates and broadening the tax base. But until that happens, we need \ncertainty, which means we need to get the existing tax rates extended. \nI hope we can do that sooner rather than later because I think the \nlonger we wait, the greater we put at risk our economy and what could \nhappen if we don't act.\n  So that is one component of the fiscal cliff. Obviously, there are \nother components.\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\n  Under the Budget Control Act, the spending authority of most Federal \ndepartments and agencies is going to be reduced on January 2, 2013, as \na result of the sequestration. Now, the triggered reduction in spending \nis $1.2 trillion. After accounting for 18 percent in debt service \nsavings, the required reductions amount to $984 billion to be \ndistributed evenly over 9 years--in other words, $109.3 billion per \nyear. So if we look at it year by year, that is $54.7 billion in \nreductions that will be necessary in both the defense and nondefense \ncategories of the budget starting on January 2, 2013. It is expected \nthat those cuts will range between 7 and 9 percent, but we believe the \nadministration needs a plan for implementing sequestration, after a \nnumber of conflicting statements about how and if it will be carried \nout.\n  As one example of the conflicting statements coming out of the Obama \nadministration, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta sent a letter to Senator \nMcCain last November saying that the sequestration would not impact war \nfunding. In April the OMB Controller testified before the House Budget \nCommittee that the issue of whether war funding would be reduced by the \nsequester was still being evaluated. Just last week another official \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget said that war funding would, \nin fact, be impacted by the sequester.\n  It has been almost a full year since the Budget Control Act was \npassed, and Congress needs a precise understanding from this \nadministration as to the full effects of sequestration on all programs \nand accounts across the Federal Government, including national security \nfunding. That is why I have introduced a bill, along with Budget \nCommittee ranking member Jeff Sessions, that would require the \nadministration to bring some much needed transparency to the scheduled \nacross-the-board spending cuts. Our legislation, S. 3228, the \nSequestration Transparency Act, would require the administration to \nsubmit to Congress a detailed preview of the sequestration required by \nthe Budget Control Act. Specifically, this bill would require the \nPresident to submit a report to Congress by July 9--next month--of 2012 \nthat includes an estimate of the sequestration percentages and amounts \nnecessary to achieve the required reduction for each spending category \non an account level. The administration's report would also be required \nto include any other data and explanations that enhance the public's \nunderstanding of a sequester and actions to be taken under it.\n  This report will assist Congress in its yearend legislative business, \nincluding fiscal year 2013 appropriations and addressing the deep and \nunbalanced defense budget cuts that are expected under sequestration, \nwhich are in addition--in addition--to the $487 billion in reductions \nthat were carried out last August.\n  Of course, we would not be in this situation had the Senate passed a \nserious budget over the last 3 years that addressed tax and entitlement \nreform. The Senate's failure to produce a budget year after year has \nleft us with the Budget Control Act. Now the Budget Control Act is the \nlaw of the land.\n  While I am certainly disappointed that the President and the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach an agreement to \nbring down our deficits in the long term, the cuts to national defense \nthat are scheduled to go into effect are particularly troubling. The \nPresident's own Defense Secretary warned that the sequester would \n``hollow out the force and inflict serious damage to our national \ndefense.'' That is from the President's own Defense Secretary. Yet, \nafter repeated requests from both the House and the Senate, the \nadministration has refused to provide even the most basic details about \nthe cuts required by the sequester.\n  There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding sequestration and the \ntax increases that would occur the first of next year. At a time when \nour economy continues to grow at a very sluggish pace and unemployment \nremains above 8 percent, the last thing we need coming out of \nWashington is more uncertainty. Job creators are concerned about the \npending fiscal cliff, and if Congress does not act before the election \nto deal with these issues, the economy will suffer from this \nuncertainty in the coming months.\n  The legislation I have introduced, along with Senator Sessions, \nrequires the administration to share with Congress and with the \nAmerican people their plan for exactly how the sequestration will be \ncarried out. This is straightforward legislation. It is about \ntransparency, and it is something where I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will work to ensure that these numbers--this \nsequestration plan--are shared with the Congress and with the American \npeople.\n  We have, as everybody knows, a big pileup occurring at the end of the \nyear with sequestration. The pileup includes tax rate increases which \nwill occur on marginal income tax rates, capital gains rates, dividend \nrates, the death taxes, the debt limit increase. All of these things \nhappen at a time that will create incredible amounts of uncertainty in \nour economy. The best we can do for the American people, for our job \ncreators, for investors, and for our small businesses is to provide as \nmuch certainty as is possible going into the end of this year. It seems \nto me, at least, that starts with ensuring that we have a plan coming \nout of the administration that specifically clarifies how this \nsequestration would be implemented so that Congress can react \naccordingly, hopefully before the end of the year and hopefully \nsometime in the next few months, perhaps as a part of our \nappropriations process this year.\n  With regard to the tax increases, I would make the same argument that \nformer President Bill Clinton has been making, which is that we need to \nextend these tax rates. We create too much economic uncertainty out \nthere by having this cloud on the horizon, which I think is a real \nwarning sign to us, and it is a reminder that we get on a regular \nbasis--frankly, for the most part, on a daily basis--when we talk to \nsmall businesses in our home States about the importance of addressing \nthe tax, the regulatory, the spending, and debt issues before the end \nof the year when this big pileup would occur.\n\n  So I would argue for and plead with my colleagues to work together on \nthe sequestration issue to ensure that it doesn't have the devastating \nimpacts on our national security budget and that, combined with the tax \nincreases, it doesn't have the devastating impact on our economy that \nis being predicted by the Congressional Budget Office. They have \npointed out that if these things all happen at the end of the year, it \ncould cost us 1.3 percent of economic growth, which, according to the \nPresident's own economic advisers, means about 1.3 million jobs for \nAmerican workers. We already have chronic high unemployment now--40 \nconsecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent. We have a sluggish, \nanemic economy. We shouldn't pile on top of that all this uncertainty \nwith regard to taxes, with regard to regulations, with regard to what \nis going to happen regarding sequestration at the end of the year.\n  Again, this bill simply does not address in substance how we would \nchange that, but it merely requests and requires the administration to \nprovide to the Congress and the American people a clear plan about how \nthey intend to implement sequestration in hopes that we might be able \nto make some necessary changes to ensure that the defense budget isn't \ngutted and that these adverse impacts on the economy are not felt by \nthe American people and by our small businesses. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this legislation and that we can get a vote on it very \nsoon; that we can get the administration acting in a way that will \ninform not only us as Members of Congress but also the American public.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, yesterday, Vice President Biden and \nother Obama administration officials hosted presidents and leaders from \ncolleges and universities at the White House. Officials promoted this \nevent as an opportunity, they said, to highlight the transparency of \ncollege costs. They\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nsaid these schools were committed to providing key financial \ninformation to all of their incoming students starting next year.\n  Well, once again, transparency took a back seat to politics. In fact, \nthe White House failed--failed--to level with college students about \nimportant financial information, including how the President's health \ncare law is going to make it harder for many students in terms of their \nability to get health insurance through their universities.\n  Earlier this week, the real story came out, and I will tell you it is \ndiscouraging. I continue to come to the floor week after week with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law because I think the \nhealth care law is bad for patients, it is bad for providers--the \nnurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--it is terrible \nfor our taxpayers. I do not think I realized at the time I started \ndoing these second opinions that it was going to be terrible for \nstudents going to college.\n  Take a look at these unintended consequences that have come out of \nthis health care law. But I will tell you, on Monday, national news \nreports showed that the coverage requirements in the President's health \ncare law--the mandated requirements in the health care law of a certain \nlevel of government-approved coverage--well, it is causing colleges all \nacross the country to drop insurance coverage for their students. I \nwould like to explain exactly how this works.\n  As Members of this body who voted for this on the other side of the \naisle will recall, the health care law eliminates annual and lifetime \nbenefits for insurance plans. Many colleges offer their students an \nopportunity for limited benefit policies to give students access to \naffordable health insurance coverage that actually is something that a \ncollege student might need, might benefit from, may be helped with.\n  These are the same benefit plans that have been popular with many \nunions across the country. The plans were so popular that the \nadministration issued over 1,700 waivers which impacted over 4 million \nAmericans. These Washington waivers ensured that people who got their \ninsurance through certain corporations and unions would not lose the \ncoverage they had in the lead-up to the full implementation of the \nhealth care law.\n  Well, over half of these waivers were granted to individuals who \nreceived their insurance through their unions so these individuals \nwould not lose their coverage during the time when the unions were \nsaying: This health care law is too expensive for us. We don't want to \nlive under these mandates. We can't afford it.\n  Well, the colleges are finding the same situation. But unlike the \nunions, the colleges are not eligible to apply for these special \nadministration waivers from the health care law. So students across the \ncountry are suffering the consequences.\n  This year, because of the President's health care law, these students \nare not going to be able to purchase or afford coverage through their \nschools. Schools are faced with two options: One is raise premiums \ndramatically, drastically, or just don't offer the health insurance \nprograms students like, parents like, and the universities like to \nprovide. The President of the United States and the Democrats who voted \nfor this health care law essentially have said: Too bad.\n  So let's give an example from New York State. The State University of \nNew York in Plattsburgh offered students coverage in the past for $440 \nper year. Next year policies will cost anywhere between $1,300 and \n$1,600 per student per year. That is an increase of four times, 400 \npercent. Why? Because the students are going to end up paying for a lot \nof insurance they do not need, they do not want, and they possibly \ncannot afford. But yet the President mandates they get this high level \nof insurance coverage even though it is something the people at the \nuniversity think their students do not need. The universities do not \nhave a choice. The President makes those decisions, not the president \nof the university but the President of the United States.\n  The University of Puget Sound in Washington was able to offer its \nstudents insurance last year for $165--insurance they believed was \nhelpful to the students. Next year, to comply with the President's \nhealth care law--the mandated high levels of coverage--they estimate a \npolicy will now cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\n  Since the Obama administration's mandates were so expensive, what is \nthe University of Puget Sound going to do? Well, they announced they \nwill not be offering any insurance coverage to any students next year--\na decision made by the university.\n  It is clear the President's health care law leaves many students with \ntwo bad choices: They can either be forced to pay vastly increased \npremiums or basically lose access to coverage altogether. This new \ndevelopment flies completely in the face of the President's promise. \nThe President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. But \nlet's specifically go to the President's exact promise:\n\n       No matter how we reform health care--\n\n  The President of the United States said--\n\n     we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will \n     be able to keep your doctor. Period.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan. Period.\n\n  He then said:\n\n       No one will take it away. No matter what.\n\n  He said:\n\n       My view is that health care reform should be guided by a \n     simple principle: fix what's broken and build on what works.\n\n  Here we are, over 2 years later, and we continue to witness the Obama \nadministration breaking this very specific promise. Now we can add \ncollege students to the long list of people who found out the reality \ndoes not match President Obama's rhetoric. At a time when students \nacross the Nation face increasing tuition costs and a bleak job market, \nnow they have to deal with losing their health insurance.\n  Each day it becomes more obvious that the Obama economy, which \nincludes the President's health care law, has made life worse for \nmillions of Americans. It cannot continue. If the Supreme Court does \nnot completely repeal this health care law, Congress needs to do it. \nRepublicans are committed to repealing this law and replacing it with \nstep-by-step reforms. We will continue to help Americans of all ages \nwork to get the care they want from a doctor they choose at a lower \ncost.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just left a meeting a few feet away from here with the \nleaders of some of the American colleges and universities. They came to \nbrief us on a challenge we face across America that we had better be \naware of. It is the growing student loan debt.\n  Just in October 1 year ago, student loan debt in America surpassed \ncredit card debt. It is now $1 trillion. More and more students are \ngoing more deeply into debt, which many of them can never repay. \nStudent loan debt is different than other debt. It is different because \none cannot discharge it in bankruptcy, which means it is a debt they \nwill carry for a lifetime.\n  Imagine someone who is 19, 20 years old, that they have been told as \nlong as they have been on this Earth education is the key to the \nfuture, and they are sitting across the table from a financial \ncounselor who says they have been accepted at this college. All they \nneed to do is sign up right here for a loan.\n  What is the natural instinct? Of course, it is to sign on the dotted \nline: I am doing what I was told to do; I am going to the best school I \ncan get into; I am going to borrow the money and make it happen and my \nlife will be successful and I will pay the money back.\n  The formula is right, but there are problems. If they drop out of \nschool,\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nthey end up with no diploma, just debt. If they go to a bad school, \nthey end up with a worthless diploma and debt. If they end up, \nunfortunately, in some aspects of life, occupations and professions, it \nmay take decades to pay off a debt. The average student loan debt is \nabout $25,000 once someone has completed 4 years of education.\n  We have asked students across Illinois and across the Nation to tell \nus their stories and the student loan debts go as high as $100,000 and \nmore for 4 years of education. Many of these students are finding \nthemselves in an impossible predicament, where they literally cannot \nget on with their lives, cannot find a job and, unfortunately, are \nstill stuck with the debt.\n  They are lucky, incidentally, if they are dealing with a Federal \nstudent loan guaranteed debt, so-called Stafford loans, because that is \n3.4 percent interest. There are ways they can have that debt forgiven \nand consolidated. It is a flexible type of debt guaranteed by the \nFederal Government.\n  But if they step over that line of Federal Government debt and get \ninto a private student loan, hang on tight. The interest rates go from \n3.4 percent to the heavens, 18-percent credit card rate debts. Interest \nrates are not uncommon when it comes to these private loans. Students \nfind themselves being swallowed by debt they cannot repay that is \nunfortunately compounded and just goes from bad to worse, to even \nworse.\n  Students I have run into thought they were doing the right thing. \nThey went to some of these worthless for-profit schools. They can \nhardly avoid them. If one gets on the Internet and punches in the \nsearch engine for ``college'' or ``universities,'' hang on tight. They \nare about to be inundated with ads from for-profit schools that tell \njust how easy it is to get a college diploma. All you have to do is \nsign up. They used to run an ad here on one of the television stations \nin Washington. It showed a pretty young girl and she was lounging on \nher bed with her laptop computer and she said: I am going to college in \nmy pajamas. That kind of come-on--to suggest you can get a worthy \ncollege diploma through a for-profit school--unfortunately lures many \nof these kids into a mountain of debt and worthless diplomas from this \nfor-profit industry--the most heavily subsidized private business in \nAmerica.\n\n  Ninety percent of the money that for-profit schools have in revenue \ncomes right from the Federal Government. Heck, they ought to have their \nemployees join a Federal employees union for that matter because 90 \npercent of their revenue comes right out of the Federal Treasury. \nStudents end up with the debt and a worthless diploma.\n  Last week, the quarterly report on household debt of the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York found that student loan debt hit $904 billion \nin the first quarter of 2012, up from $241 billion just 10 years ago. \nThat is a 275-percent increase since the same period in 2003. The \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau--which many people on the other \nside of the aisle would like to put out of business--the only leading \nconsumer protection bureau in the Federal Government, estimates that \noutstanding student loan debt may be even higher, up to $1 trillion.\n  Students continue to pile on the debt, even as America--most \nAmericans--cut back on other forms of credit, such as mortgage and \ncredit cards. According to a senior economist at the New York Federal \nReserve Bank:\n\n       It remains the only form of consumer debt to substantially \n     increase since the peak of household debt in 2008.\n\n  The hole just gets deeper for students and the families borrowing \nmoney for higher education. Students are graduating with massive \namounts of debt and having a very difficult time paying it back. \nDelinquency rates for student loans are higher than rates for mortgages \nor automobile loans.\n  Every week, I hear from students drowning in debt, and I don't mean \njust recent graduates. Some of the borrowers are in their thirties and \nforties, even older, and still paying off student loans or paying off \nprivate student loans they cosigned for their children or \ngrandchildren. Student loan debt has serious consequences for families \nand for our economy. In a recent survey of college graduates by Rutgers \nUniversity, 40 percent of the participants said they delayed making a \nmajor purchase, such as a home or car, because of student debt. More \nthan one-quarter of those surveyed put off continuing their education \nor had moved in with relatives to save money to pay their student \nloans.\n  Private student loans don't come with the same consumer protections \nand payment plans Federal loans offer. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, \nchairman of our Senate education committee, introduced a bill with me \nto help families understand the difference between the Federal student \nloan and private student loans. We call it the Know Before You Owe \nPrivate Student Loan Act. It would require private student loan lenders \nto confirm the potential borrower's enrollment status and cost of \nattendance. The bill would also require institutions to counsel \nstudents about the difference between Federal and private student \nloans. Many students just don't know the difference.\n  The come-on is, listen, we have only one sheet of paper you have to \nfill out and you will get a private loan or do you want to go through \nfive sheets of paper over here for the Federal Government? This is \neasier. Easier, yes, but a debt that is going to be much more serious \nfor you in years to come.\n  Last week, the attorneys general from 22 States wrote to Members of \nthe House and Senate asking that Congress fix the so-called 90 10 \nloophole. The 90 10 rule, as it is currently written, requires for-\nprofit colleges to receive at least 10 percent of their revenue from \nsomething other than the Federal Government--10 percent. But current \nlaw considers Federal sources only those funds from the Department of \nEducation's title IV Federal financial aid programs, which includes \nPell grants and federally guaranteed student loans. Other Federal \nsubsidies for students, such as GI bill funds and the Department of \nDefense tuition assistance, aren't counted.\n  The attorneys general across America once again are ahead of \nCongress. They recognize that including GI bill and DOD funds will \neliminate the powerful incentive the for-profit colleges have to \nrecruit veterans and Active military in order to comply with the 90 10 \nrule.\n  Holly Petraeus is the wife of General Petraeus. Her husband is a true \nAmerican hero. She has stood by his side through all his military \nassignments, dearly loves the military and their families. She works \nfor the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her specialty is to find \nthose rip-off institutions that are going after veterans to try to soak \nup their GI bill benefits for a worthless education.\n  How did we reach this point? Why are we, at this moment in time, \nwhere we are--facing this student loan debt bomb. Years ago, with \nwidespread reports of waste, fraud, and abuse in the for-profit college \nsector, Congress created the 85 15 rule to weed out fraudulent fly-by-\nnight schools that relied almost entirely on taxpayer dollars. The 85 \n15 rule said a school could take in no more than 85 percent of its \nrevenue from the Federal Government. The other 15 had to come from \nother sources. It worked, and many of the worst schools, fortunately, \nclosed.\n  In 1998, the rule was loosened to 90 10--90 percent Federal subsidy. \nNow we see we need to return to the original intent of the law and \ncrack down on these for-profit schools that are taking advantage of \nveterans, servicemembers, and students across the board.\n  In January, Senator Harkin and I introduced the Protect Our Students \nand Taxpayers Act--the POST Act--that will make several changes to the \n90 10 rule. To better protect the students and our taxpayer dollars, \nthe POST Act would reinstate the original 85 15 ratio, and the bill \nwould change the definition of what is considered Federal revenue.\n  This may sound like bureaucratic gobbledygook, but let's get to the \nbottom line. If an institution needs to rely on the Federal Treasury \nfor 90 percent of their revenue to exist as a school, there is a \nserious question about whether they are a real school. If the students \nmake no contribution--or only 10 percent toward their education--then, \nfrankly, what they are doing is just milking the Federal Treasury to \nkeep the lights on at their school. I might add, these for-profit \nschools are highly profitable. Some of the biggest investment \ncounselors and\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nmanagers in America invest in these schools because they are money \nmachines. They bring their money directly from the Federal Government, \nwith no guarantee that students will end up with an education.\n\n  The numbers I return to time and again tell the story. Ten percent of \nstudents finishing high school--10 percent--end up in for-profit \nschools--10 percent. Yet these for-profit schools eat up to 25 percent \nof all Federal aid to education. They are sucking in the Pell grants \nand the Stafford loans and then--hang on--they have a student loan \ndefault rate almost twice the level of other colleges and universities. \nWhat does that tell us? They have come up with an economic model which \nreaches deep in the Treasury to bring in money to keep the lights on \nand to pay their CEOs very generous salaries. They are also, of course, \nloaning money to students, and those students are defaulting, unable to \nrepay their student loans at twice the rate of other colleges and \nuniversities.\n  You might say to yourself: Well, Senator, if that is the case, why \ndon't you do something about it? The problem is the for-profit school \nindustry in America is one of the most politically wired industries in \nthis country. They have friends in high places, and it is very \ndifficult to get reform legislation through the House or the Senate \nwhen they are so politically connected. Yet Senator Harkin and I \nbelieve it is worth the effort, and we are going to ask our colleagues \nto join us in that effort.\n  What is worse is that students are aggressively recruited to attend \nthese colleges, lured into taking out massive amounts of debt and may \nnot even graduate. Think about that. A study published earlier this \nyear by the Education Sector shows that the borrowers who drop out are \nmore than four times more likely than those who graduate to default on \ntheir college loans because they are more likely to be unemployed and \nearn less when they do get a job. The dropout rates rose across all \nkinds of colleges, but the biggest increases were found in the for-\nprofit 4-year institutions, where a staggering 54 percent of those who \nhad borrowed to pursue a bachelor's degree dropped out of school--more \nthan half. The study showed 16.8 percent of dropouts defaulted on their \nloans compared with 3.7 percent of those who graduated.\n  What difference does it make to these for-profit universities? They \ngot their money.\n  Alexander Brooks recently contacted my office about his student debt. \nAlexander is from Normal, IL, and graduated in 2006 with a degree in \ncomputer networking from ITT, a for-profit institution. Alex never got \na job in his field. He drives a schoolbus to pay his rent, even though \nhe has this so-called degree in computer networking. He said he would \nlike to get married to his long-time girlfriend, but he doesn't want to \nhave her share in the burden of his student loan debt.\n  When asked about the quality of education he received from ITT--what \nwe will hear being advertised on the television every time we turn it \non--here is what he said:\n\n       ITT fell short of preparing me for what happens after \n     graduation. Although the school provided me with a degree, \n     the program did not provide any of the necessary \n     certifications needed to get a job in the computer field.\n\n  Alex would like to go back to school, but he can't borrow any more \nmoney. When he graduated 6 years ago from ITT, a for-profit school, his \ntotal loan balance was $40,000. That was when he graduated. Six years \nlater, his balance is $50,000. Six years of payments, falling further \nand further behind. His private student loans have interest rates up to \n9.25 percent, almost double the Federal student loan rate.\n  Alex isn't alone. Many of his fellow students from ITT have the same \ntrouble repaying their loan. ITT's 3-year cohort default rate is over \n29 percent. That means that within 3 years of entering repayment \nstatus, almost one-third of students have already defaulted. In 2009, \nITT received 85.8 percent of all its revenue--this for-profit school--\nfrom the Federal student aid programs. It was the third largest \nrecipient of GI bill funds, receiving $99 million in the school year \n2010 2011. If GI bill funds and other Federal aid were counted, ITT \nwould likely be at or close to receiving 100 percent of its revenue \nfrom the Federal Government--totally federally subsidized.\n  Federal student aid money is just about all that keeps this \ninstitution alive, running, generating profits, and paying handsome \nsalaries to those who own it. What do the taxpayers get in return for \nthis investment? More Americans with student loan debt they will never \nbe able to pay off. That is not a good deal for taxpayers or students.\n  High student loan debt is not limited to for-profit college students. \nStudents at private nonprofit institutions graduate with an average of \nabout $26,000 in debt. Students who graduate from public institutions \ngraduated with an average debt of $15,600.\n  What I say back home in Illinois I hope some will listen to \ncarefully. Education is critical for a student or person to succeed. I \nencourage people to pursue it but go to the low-cost alternative if \nthey haven't made up their mind or don't have a clear goal in front of \nthem that is reasonable. Go to their community college. Start there. \nLearn to what it means to go to college. They can do it at an \naffordable cost in their neighborhood, in their town, and then progress \nfrom the community college level to the right place for them. The \nstudents who sign up for these worthless for-profit schools or sign up \nfor a heavy load of debt may find themselves in a terrible situation, \nand it is impossible for them to pursue a higher education.\n  We have to do something to control the cost of postsecondary \neducation, ease the burden of student debt, and crack down on the \naggressive recruiting practices used by these for-profit colleges by \nclosing the 90 10 loophole. Congress should start by coming to an \nagreement on the student loan interest rate hike that will prevent the \ninterest rates on subsidized Federal student loans from doubling.\n  Let me close with this because I see my colleague from Rhode Island \nis here. On July 1, the interest rate on Federal loans--Stafford \nloans--will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. For a student \nborrowing $20,000 over the course of a 4-year education, it means at \n6.8 percent as opposed to 3.4 they will be paying back $24,000 instead \nof $20,000. Why do we want to dig this hole any deeper for students \nacross America?\n  We have put together an alternative on the floor to keep the interest \nrate low. Unfortunately, the other side has objected. I hope we can \nwork out a reasonable bipartisan way to keep interest rates on student \nloans at a lower level. We owe it to these families and to these \nstudents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me first thank the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois for his determined efforts, as well as my senior \ncolleague in this body, Senator Jack Reed, for his determined efforts \nin trying to get to a resolution that will prevent the student loan \ninterest rates from doubling.\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  I am here to speak about another problem--something very important to \nordinary Americans that is also being jammed up as a result of \nobstruction and intransigence--and that is the highway bill.\n  We had a March 31 deadline, the House and the Senate, to get a \nhighway bill done. The Senate did its job; we got a highway bill done \nby March 31. The House did not do its job; they failed to get a highway \nbill done.\n  Let me point out that we have been doing highway bills in Congress \nback since the Eisenhower administration, and this is not rocket \nscience. So it is telling that the body at the other end of this \nbuilding could not get a highway and bridge bill done by the March 31 \ndeadline. So what did they do? They extended it and took us to \nconference on the Senate bill.\n  Now, let's say a word about the Senate bill. The Senate bill is very \nhard to criticize. People sometimes criticize bills around here because \nthey get jammed through; there isn't enough time; there aren't enough \namendments; it is not bipartisan. None of those criticisms apply to the \nSenate bill.\n  The Senate highway bill came out of my Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--thanks to the leadership of Chairman Boxer and Ranking \nMember Inhofe with the unanimous support of every Republican and every \nDemocrat. It came to the floor. We had a\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\nwide-open process here on the floor. I think nearly 40 amendments were \naccepted either in floor votes or by agreement. Everybody had their \nchance, everybody had their day, and the net result was that the bill \ncleared out of the Senate with 75 Senators on record supporting it. \nThat is a pretty impressive majority around here.\n  So we have a 75-to-22 Senate bill that has the support of the chamber \nof commerce, the Association of Manufacturers, and it has the support \nof labor unions and the environmental community. There is really \nnothing to criticize about it either substantively or in terms of the \nprocess by which it was adopted, and yet our colleagues on the House \nside won't accept the bipartisan Senate bill. They have it bottled up \nin this conference. And the reason that I am on the floor today is that \nwe are being told now that the House is going to ask for another \nextension past the end of June to continue to dawdle and stall the \nbipartisan highway bill. What is the effect of that? What is the effect \nof dawdling and stalling the bipartisan Senate highway bill? The effect \nis loss of jobs.\n  The Presiding Officer is from New York, I am from Rhode Island, and \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah is here on the floor. All of us \nhave a common situation in our State, which is winter. In winter, it is \nreally hard to build and repair highways and bridges.\n  There is a summer construction season, and as we dawdle and delay and \nas the House jams up the bipartisan Senate highway bill, that summer \nseason gets whittled away. We are now to the point where my director of \ntransportation in Rhode Island, Mike Lewis, says that he had 97 jobs on \nhis roster to be done in this summer construction season, and if we \ncan't get this done earlier than when we anticipate doing it now, at \nthe end of this month, at the end of June, 40 of those projects will \ndrop off the roster and all of the jobs associated with them will be \nlost.\n  Rhode Island is a small State. Those numbers are going to echo \neastward and northward across the country in job losses this summer \nbecause of the delay of a bipartisan Senate highway bill by the House. \nThese are real jobs.\n  It is not just me making this observation and it is not just the \nRhode Island director of transportation. Standard & Poor's Global \nCredit Portal RatingsDirect service has put out a publication: \n``Increasingly Unpredictable Federal Funding Could Stall U.S. \nTransportation Infrastructure Projects.'' They say the following:\n\n       With the March 31st expiration looming, Congress passed on \n     March 29th yet another extension to fund U.S. highway \n     programs. This latest continuing resolution, the ninth, \n     provides funding through June 30, 2012. As construction \n     season begins in the northern half of the country, this \n     continuing uncertainty in funding could force states to delay \n     projects rather than risk funding changes or political \n     gridlock come July.\n\n  That is exactly what we are seeing.\n  They said:\n\n       In addition, the political gridlock in Washington, D.C., \n     and the doubt surrounding federal funding are making it \n     difficult for issuers throughout the infrastructure sector to \n     define long-term plans for funding necessary capital \n     projects.\n\n  If we get this turned around, then what happens? Well, according to \nStandard & Poor's, ``Once a long-term authorization is approved, we \nbelieve it will provide an impetus for transportation agencies to \nreconsider high-priority projects that had been shelved because of lack \nof funding.'' So we can put people to work in this country. We can put \npeople to work in this country on roads and bridges and highways--\nsomething every American understands. We can do it under a bipartisan \nSenate bill that has the support of everybody, from the business \ncommunity, to the labor community, to the environmental community, to, \nperhaps obviously, the highway construction community. But the House of \nRepresentatives, which couldn't pass a highway bill, is jamming us in \nthis endless conference. I don't know if it is their intention to knock \nout these jobs in this preelection period. I don't know if they just \ncan't get their house in order over there to do the basic legwork of \npassing a highway bill. But as we approach the end of this month, as we \napproach this second deadline--which it looks like they are going to \nmiss again--I will urge my colleagues, let's hold their feet to the \nfire. There is no excuse for not passing the bipartisan Senate highway \nbill that is widely supported and that will create or defend nearly 3 \nmillion jobs in this country--2.9 million, to use the exact number that \nhas been identified with this bill.\n  So I think it is very important that we stick to our guns on this \none. In Rhode Island, we have projects such as Highway 95, where it \ncomes through the city of Providence, it comes through as a bridge. It \nis a raised highway. If you go underneath that bridge to, say, drive \ninto the back entrance of the Providence Place Mall or to look where \nthe highway goes over the Amtrak rails that connect the Northeast \nCorridor, what do you see? You see wooden planks that have been laid \nbetween the I-beams so that the highway falling in doesn't land on cars \nunderneath, doesn't land on Amtrak trains or train tracks underneath. \nThis is a project that needs to be rebuilt. It needs to be rebuilt now. \nIt is connected to where State Routes 6 and 10 come in and connect to \n95. If you go under State Route 6 and State Route 10--as Senator Reed \nand I did recently with the mayor of Providence and with the \ntransportation director--you see that those highways are propped up by \nwooden supports. You see that pieces of the metal infrastructure have \ncrumbled and fallen off onto the ground. This is highway work that \nneeds to be done. These are not bridges to nowhere.\n  Every American driving across our bumpy roads knows we have work to \ndo, and I call on my colleagues in the House to quit dawdling, to let \nthis conference go. If they don't have an answer, if they can't pass a \nhighway bill, if they can't do the basic legwork of governance to do \nsomething as simple as a highway bill, then get out of the way. At \nleast get out of the way and let the bipartisan, widely supported \nSenate highway bill go.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          Extending Tax Relief\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the bad news keeps coming. Europe is in \ndire straits, with the debt-riddled economies of Greece and now Spain \nthreatening the future of the continent's economic union. There is real \nconcern that this debt-fueled contagion in Europe will undermine our \neconomy as well, and our economy cannot take too many more hits.\n  The unemployment rate went back up to 8.2 percent last month. Only \n69,000 net new payroll jobs were created. That is barely keeping up \nwith population growth and is hardly the type of robust job growth that \nwill be the foundation of a lasting and meaningful economic recovery. \nNow, we should have seen this coming. The minutes of the Federal \nReserve's most recent monetary policymaking meeting make numerous \nmention of uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy and that those \nuncertainties are a risk to the economic outlook.\n  Fed policymakers noted that ``they generally saw the U.S. fiscal \nsituation also as a risk to the economic outlook; if agreement is not \nreached on a plan for the federal budget, a sharp fiscal tightening \ncould occur at the start of 2013.'' They concluded that ``uncertainty \nabout the trajectory of future fiscal policy could lead businesses to \ndefer hiring and investing'' and ``uncertainty about the fiscal \nenvironment could hold back both household spending on durable goods \nand business capital expenditures.''\n  Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office reminded us yet again what \nthe consequences will be to our economy if we fail to get our debt \nunder control. According to one of their analyses, absent serious \nreform of entitlement spending programs, ``Federal debt would grow \nrapidly from its already high level, exceeding 90 percent of GDP in \n2022. After that . . . [d]ebt as a share of GDP would exceed its \nhistorical peak of 109 percent by 2026, and it would approach 200 \npercent in 2037.'' And that is an optimistic view. The impact of this \nmultiplying debt will be a gross national product that is reduced by \n4.5 percent in 2027 and 13.5 percent in 2037.\n  In other words, unless President Obama and his allies in the Senate \nget to work, Americans face a future of fewer jobs, flat or shrinking \nincomes, and loss of opportunity. And the sad truth is, as this chart \nshows, the President's allies have not gotten to work.\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nWe have had a hearing on tax extenders but none on the AMT patch--the \nalternative minimum tax patch--and none on tax reform. We did have a \nhearing on the 2013 tax cuts. But we have had no markups on any of \nthose, and we have had no floor consideration of any of those. Yet \nthese are all extremely important matters.\n  It was no surprise, therefore, when former President Clinton stated \nyesterday that we are still in a recession. Economists might say that \nis not technically accurate, but it is certainly how most Americans \nfeel. What did come as a surprise, however, was President Clinton's \nremarks on taxmageddon, the fiscal cliff the Nation faces at the end of \nthis year. At least yesterday, it sounded as though his view was that \nwe should do a complete 180 and race away from this cliff, extending in \nfull the tax relief enacted by President Bush and extended by President \nObama in 2010. Several weeks ago, 41 Senate Republicans made a similar \nrequest of the Senate's majority leader, Senator Reid. This fiscal \ncliff is unquestionably contributing to our fiscal crisis and slowing \nthe economy by creating enormous uncertainty for taxpayers and \nbusinesses.\n  Absent action to extend this tax relief, Americans will be hit with a \n$310 billion tax increase next year alone; 26 million middle-income \nfamilies will owe $92 billion in alternative minimum tax when filing \ntheir returns 1 year from now; a family of four earning $50,000 will \nget hit with a $2,183 tax hike; a small business owner will face a top \nmarginal tax rate hike of 17 percent. That is catastrophic. The number \nof farmers who will face the death tax will rise by 2,220 percent. The \nnumber of small business owners who will face the death tax will rise \nby 900 percent. There should be no higher priority for the President \nand the Congress than addressing these tax increases.\n  Yesterday, President Clinton seemed to agree, arguing that we should \nact now, not after the elections, to avoid the fiscal cliff. At a \nminimum, he concluded that a temporary extension of current tax relief \nis in order. To quote former President Clinton:\n\n       They will probably have to put everything off until early \n     next year. That's probably the best thing to do right now.\n\n  I understand that the minority leader of the Senate and the Speaker \nof the House have now called for a 1-year extension, during which time \nwe should do tax reform. That makes sense. And I am committed, as the \nranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, to do tax reform and \nhopefully bring both sides together, for once in a long time, to do \nwhat is in the best interest of this country.\n  President Clinton further argued:\n\n       What I think we need to do is to find some way to avoid the \n     fiscal cliff, to avoid doing anything that would contract the \n     economy now, and then deal with what's necessary in the long-\n     term debt-reduction plan as soon as they can, which \n     presumably will be after the election.\n\n  Now, channeling Gilda Radner, and presumably following a dressing \ndown by President Obama's campaign team, President Clinton tells us, \n``Never mind.''\n  But President Clinton knew what he was saying. One thing I can say, \nknowing him as well as I do, President Clinton is a very smart man. He \nwas making an elementary point, one that the President, President \nObama, seemed to agree with when he was not running for election on a \nplatform that single-mindedly obsesses over raising taxes on families \nwith incomes over $250,000.\n  President Clinton, not wanting to further undermine our economy, \nrecommended a short-term extension of all the tax relief. That is \nprecisely what President Obama agreed to at the end of 2010. Given our \ntepid economic growth and job creation and the threat from Europe, \ncommon sense would dictate a similar course today--certainly, if the \nalternative is a $310 billion tax increase.\n  But today President Obama is running for reelection, and tax relief \nfor the so-called rich would undermine his message of wealth \nredistribution. Failure to extend this tax relief, though, is not an \noption.\n  Just this morning another Obama supporter, a former Director for the \nNational Economic Council, Larry Summers, said:\n\n       The real risk to this economy is on the side of slowdown . \n     . . and that means we've got to make sure that we don't take \n     gasoline out of the tank at the end of this year. That's \n     gotta be the top priority.\n\n  The former Director of President Obama's Office of Management and \nBudget concluded that what he estimates to be a $500 billion tax \nincrease would be so large that ``the economy could be thrown back into \na recession.''\n  According to the magazine, The Economist, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has found that the combined effects of the sequester and the \nexpiring tax relief would add up to 3.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year \n2013. In a $15 trillion economy, that would be a hit to GDP of $540 \nbillion, which would surely tip us toward recession and even more job \nlosses.\n  The question the people of Utah and citizens around the country are \nasking themselves is, What is the holdup? If extending this tax relief \nis essential to providing families and businesses with the certainty \nand security necessary for economic growth, why are Senate Democrats \nrefusing to take it up? Why is the President not pushing for immediate \naction to avoid this fiscal cliff?\n  Let me suggest an answer. The President wants to drag this out until \nafter this election. Even if that means months of additional pain for \nAmerica's families and a real hit to our economy, it will serve his \nlong-term goal, a goal that he dares not announce until after the \nelection. President Obama does not want the precedent of extending this \ntax relief for everyone because, ultimately, his liberal base does not \nwant it extended for anyone.\n  The President and his advisers know our debt is unsustainable. Their \nbase will not allow for any serious changes to spending policy, and tax \nincreases on the wealthy alone are not adequate to get our fiscal house \nin order. The only solution, one that Hyde Park and Pennsylvania Avenue \nare loathe to discuss openly, are tax increases on everybody.\n  This is Matt Bai, writing last year in the New York Times:\n\n       If Democrats are serious about reversing the policy of the \n     Bush years, then they will probably have to be willing to \n     make a case for eliminating all the tax cuts, not just those \n     for the wealthiest Americans. And they may have to come up \n     with some kind of more comprehensive plan for modernizing the \n     entire tax code, in order to persuade voters that even if \n     some taxes go up, they might still come out ahead.\n\n  Ezra Klein, the liberal blogger at the Washington Post, put it this \nway:\n\n       We cannot fund anything close to the government's \n     commitments if we don't raise taxes, or if we let only the \n     Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000 expire.\n\n  Though he is now persona non grata in President Obama's camp, just a \nfew weeks ago President Clinton was echoing this recommendation of tax \nincreases for all.\n  This is President Clinton:\n\n       This is just me now, I'm not speaking for the White House--\n     I think you could tax me at 100 percent and you wouldn't \n     balance the budget. We are all going to have to contribute to \n     this, and if middle class people's wages were going up again, \n     and we had some growth to the economy, I don't think they \n     would object to going back to tax rates [from] when I was \n     president.\n\n  With due respect to our former President, I do think he was speaking \nfor the White House, and I do think most Americans would object to a \ntax hike. That is why President Obama has decided to lay low rather \nthan lead. The American people are not going to accept this. We live in \na republic, and it is fundamentally illegitimate, on an issue of this \nmagnitude, for a person running for President of the United States to \nput these decisions off until a lameduck session of Congress when he \ncan no longer be held to account by the American people.\n  It is not only an economic imperative that we extend this tax relief, \nit is demanded by our constitutional commitment to representative \ndemocracy. To borrow from Justice Scalia:\n\n       The American people love democracy and the American people \n     are not fools.\n\n  If the President and his campaign team think they can punt this issue \ninto the fall, they are sorely mistaken. The American people will voice \ntheir displeasure with this failure to lead in November. President \nClinton got it right the first time yesterday. The fiscal cliff must be \naddressed now. We cannot wait until later in the year. Our economy is \nstruggling. American families are treading water. We have tried it \ntheir way for almost 4 years.\n  We have tried a $850 billion stimulus. We have tried ObamaCare, which \nwas\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nalso supposed to be a jobs program. We have tried Dodd-Frank. It is \ntime to try something else.\n  There is no greater jobs program that Congress and the President \ncould pursue than a permanent extension of the tax relief signed by \nPresidents Bush and Obama. It would provide enormous confidence to \nAmerica's businesses and families at a time when confidence is sorely \nneeded. This issue is not going away. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass tax relief for all Americans sometime this summer.\n  We all realize we are in election mode. Maybe I realize that more \nthan most. The fact is, we cannot punt this anymore. We cannot kick it \ndown the road. We are going to have to find a means and a way whereby \nwe extend this tax relief and then spend the next year working on tax \nreform and hopefully a bipartisan tax reform bill that everybody here \ncan support.\n  So far this year just about everything the majority leader has \nbrought up for and on behalf of Democrats is to protect the sitting 23 \nDemocrats who are up for reelection this year. I don't blame the leader \nfor wanting to protect his fellow Democrats. That is, after all, maybe \npart of the job of the leader. On the other hand, there are things that \nare even more important, such as the future welfare of our country, \nsuch as jobs that are not being created. They are not being created \nbecause we have no creators in the White House. It takes a President to \nlead on these issues.\n\n  I suggest to President Obama he would have a much better chance of \nreelection if he would lead on some of these issues and if he would go \nalong with putting off these tax increases and committing Democrats and \nRepublicans to coming up with a bipartisan reform of this awful, \ndespicable, unworkable Tax Code. It might be one of the few ways we can \nbring people together. It might be one of the few ways we can turn this \ncountry around in the short term.\n  I think the minority leader and the Speaker of the House have \nsomething here. We ought to do this and make it the main focal point of \nour existence as Members of the Senate and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. If we do this, we might even find that we can get \nalong again. We might even find that we can work together. And we might \neven find the President can lead for a change, which would be a \npleasant change from what I have seen over the last number of years.\n  I happen to like the President. I do not agree with him. Yes, I would \nlike to replace him. But I like him personally. I believe if the \nPresident would lead here and would make this a focal point he would \nhave a better chance in this election. Not that I want him to be \nsuccessful, but at least he would have a better chance.\n  Deep down the American people believe nothing is being done by the \nWhite House, by this body, and throughout the country. I yearn for the \nday when Democrats and Republicans can get along with each other again, \nwhen we really put the country first rather than reelection first, when \nwe really look at each other and say: You know, I like him or her. I \nthink I can work with them. It would be wonderful if we would do that.\n  This is a pretty fair suggestion: Keep the tax cuts alive until we \nreform the tax system--this bloated, unworkable, stupid Tax Code. I \nactually believe it could be a way of making us all work together and \nmaking us all do so in the best interests of our country. Wouldn't that \nbe wonderful?\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides will go along with doing something \nthat makes sense--like this. I believe in these suggestions we have the \nmakings of something that would not only help our country but help all \nof us to get along with each other and work in the best interests of \nour country.\n  But I will make a final point; that is, it takes Presidential \nleadership to make major changes like this, and we do not have that \nright now.\n  Mr. President, in remarks a few minutes ago, I stated the following:\n\n       If extending this tax relief is essential to providing \n     families and businesses with the certainty and security \n     necessary for economic growth, why are Senate Democrats \n     refusing to take it up? And why is the President not pushing \n     for immediate action to avoid this fiscal cliff?\n       Let me suggest an answer.\n       The President wants to drag this out until after the \n     elections. Even if that means months of additional pain for \n     America's families and a real hit to our economy, it will \n     serve his long-term goal--a goal that he dare not announce \n     until after the election.\n       President Obama does not want the precedent of extending \n     this tax relief for everyone, because ultimately his liberal \n     base does not want it extended for anyone.\n       The President and his advisers know that our debt is \n     unsustainable. Their base will not allow for any serious \n     changes to spending policy, and tax increases on the wealthy \n     alone are not adequate to get our fiscal house in order.\n\n  As support for my theory that the President could be dragging out \nthis tax hike fight, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from the blog, ``Talking Points Memo,'' dated \nNovember 22, 2011. That blog's authors certainly are allies of \nPresident Obama and rarely does ``Talking Points Memo'' contain \nanything sympathetic to Republican policy positions. When it is \ncritical of President Obama, the blog's criticisms tend to spring from \nthe far left of the political spectrum. I ask my colleagues to ask \nthemselves the question above: ``Why is the President not pushing for \nimmediate action to avoid this fiscal cliff?'' and then read the \narticle.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Obama Issues Veto Threat on Bush Tax Cuts\n\n                           (By Brian Beutler)\n\n       President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation that \n     attempts to eliminate the automatic penalties for Super \n     Committee failure. But on January 1, 2013--the same day the \n     automatic, across the board spending cuts are scheduled to \n     take effect--all of the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And \n     the White House plans to use the threat of full expiration \n     the exact same way they're using the threat of \n     sequestration--to force Republicans to accept a higher tax \n     burden on wealthy Americans.\n       ``He won't sign a full extension,'' said one Senior \n     Administration Official at a White House background briefing \n     for reporters on the Super Committee.\n       ``I think if you look at everything that happens in January \n     2013, it is a compelling argument that there's a need to make \n     real policy,'' said another Senior Administration Official. \n     ``And I think the fact the sequester will hit in January 2013 \n     and the expiration of the tax cuts hits in 2013, the right \n     thing to do is tax reform that has both positive impact on \n     the economy and is fair in terms of distribution of the tax \n     burden, and then balanced savings that share the burden \n     amongst all the different parts of the budget from the very \n     rich to people on Medicare and Medicaid.''\n       If you despise government indiscriminately, the Super \n     Committee's inaction doesn't really matter on it's own--it \n     just means more spending cuts. ``Super Committee could not \n     agree how to cut $1.2 Trillion,'' tweeted anti-tax crusader \n     Grover Norquist. ``So now we `sequester' (french for ``cut'') \n     $1.2 Trillion. This is failing, how?''\n       True enough. But unless the White House changes its tune, \n     members of Congress won't just have a choice between lower \n     spending and higher taxes. If Republicans dig in their heels \n     and refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy, then taxes will go \n     up automatically. Democrats proved in the Super Committee \n     negotiations that they have the nerve to hold out on spending \n     cuts until Republicans toss Norquist and his fellow \n     conservative activists under the bus. Unless that changes, \n     it's a powerful incentive for Republicans to change their \n     strategy--and their orthodoxy.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Would the Senator withhold the \nrequest.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                    World War II Prayer Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy for 15 minutes with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, about the new legislation we just introduced, S. 3078, the \nWorld War II Prayer Act of 2012.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam Portman, this bill will lead to the placement of a \nplaque or inscription at the National World War II Memorial in \nWashington, DC, with a prayer that Franklin Delano Roosevelt shared \nwith the Nation by radio address 68 years ago today. The occasion was \nD-day, June 6, 1944.\n  On D-day American troops, joined by allied forces, carried out an \namphibious and airborne landing on five\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nbeaches on the heavily fortified coast of France's Normandy region. \nSome have termed those Normandy landings as the beginning of the end of \nthe war in Europe. I believe that is true because courageous Americans \nwere willing to risk their lives on the coast of France that day. \nThousands made the ultimate sacrifice that day.\n  With the invasion underway, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked \nour Nation to come together in prayer for the men who were engaged in \nthis dangerous but very important battle. His powerful and ecumenical \nprayer, drawing on our Nation's rich Judeo-Christian heritage and \nvalues, brought strength and inspiration to many during what was a \nchallenging time for our country.\n  Today I have the honor, along with Senator Lieberman, to introduce \nthis legislation to commemorate that prayer and that day. His words, of \ncourse, brought comfort to the many families and friends of the brave \nmen who were killed in action. Those words of Franklin Roosevelt are \netched in our history and in our minds, and we hope soon in stone. Our \nbill ensures that the prayer becomes a permanent reminder of the \nsacrifice of those who fought in World War II and in the power of \nprayer through difficult times.\n  We worked closely with the National Park Service to ensure that the \nplaque or inscription does not disrupt the World War II Memorial or \nbypass the Commemorative Works Act process, which governs monuments in \nWashington. The placement and design of the plaque would be assigned to \na commemorative works approval and review process, which makes it \nconsistent with legislation that was passed by previous Congresses.\n  It is adding some historical context to this beautiful memorial--\nadding a layer of commemoration, not taking anything away from the \nmemorial that is already in place.\n  My friend in the House of Representatives, Congressman Bill Johnson \nof Ohio, introduced a House companion bill to this legislation, which \nhas passed the House earlier this year with an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 386 to 26.\n  Today, on the 68th anniversary of this historic battle known as D-\nday, we hope to inspire the Senate to follow suit and tell the story of \nthis powerful prayer that moved the Nation in honor of heroes by \nplacing a marker with the prayer at the World War II Memorial.\n  Madam President, I would like to now turn things over to Senator \nLieberman, my cosponsor of this legislation, and a leader in the Senate \nand in our country for his thoughts. After that we will join to recite \nparts of this incredibly powerful extraordinary Presidential prayer \nfrom World War II.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Ohio for \ntaking the lead on what I call a noble project, and I am confident that \nall of our colleagues will join us in this to include FDR's national \nprayer at the World War II Memorial.\n  It is very important to remember that D-day, which was 68 years ago \ntoday, turned out to be a pivotal moment in the war in Europe. FDR \nchose not to give a speech announcing the landing at Normandy but to \noffer a national prayer. I think in doing so, he went to a very proud, \nnot only tradition in America but one of our great assets where we have \nhad the ability to bring faith and God in a very inclusive and \nnondiscriminatory way into our public life to the great benefit of our \nNation.\n  As he delivered these words of prayer in a historic radio broadcast, \nwhich of course is the way it was done in those days, the success of \nthe bold and dangerous D-day plan was far from assured. But with the \neloquent faithfulness of his words and with his steady Presidential \nleadership, I believe the brave American men and women in uniform who \nlanded at Normandy were strengthened by the conviction of our national \nvalues, the virtue and righteousness of their cause, and, of course, \nwith confidence that they would benefit from the guiding grace of God.\n  I remember words by President Reagan on another Normandy anniversary \nwhen he said:\n\n       The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was \n     right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a \n     just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead, or on the \n     next.\n\n  Indeed, I think adding FDR'S prayer to the grandness of the World War \nII Memorial will even elevate it, and it will rightly remind all who \nvisit of the essential role that faith in God played at that pivotal \nmoment of world history. It will also remind us that faith in God has \nplayed a pivotal role in American history every day since the \nDeclaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, when our Founders declared \nthat they were forming our new government to secure the rights of life, \nliberty, and happiness that each of us receive as an endowment from our \ncreator.\n  All of this is expressed in the wonderful idea that Senator Portman \nhas had and would be accomplished by this project.\n  I yield back to my friend from Ohio for the beginning of President \nRoosevelt's prayer.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Connecticut. As he said so \nwell, the power of prayer in this case, as was true in our Nation's \ngreat history, is a comfort and inspiration to the country.\n  As I noted earlier, we would like to recite the prayer. I would ask \nthose in the gallery and on the floor today to join us in this prayer. \nI will start by reading the first half, including some words that \nPresident Roosevelt said prior to the prayer, and then Senator \nLieberman will read the second half.\n  Franklin Roosevelt started off by saying:\n\n       My fellow Americans: Last night when I spoke with you about \n     the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of the \n     United States and our allies were crossing the Channel in \n     another and greater operation. It has come to pass with \n     success thus far.\n       And so in this poignant hour, I ask you to join me in \n     prayer.\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n\n  I would now like to turn to Senator Lieberman to read the second half \nof the prayer.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I continue with Roosevelt's prayer.\n\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee. Faith in \n     our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.\n\n  Madam President, as we know, many lives were lost on D-day and what \nfollowed, but it led to the defeat of--if I\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\nmay use President Roosevelt's words--``the unholy forces of our \nenemy,'' and of a remarkable period of peace and prosperity in America \nand certainly in Europe.\n  If I might add briefly, although the circumstances and challenges we \nface at this moment in our Nation's history are much less greater than \nAmerica faced on June 6, 1944, nonetheless, there is a certain absence \nof hopefulness and confidence today. I would respectfully suggest that \none of the great sources of hopefulness and confidence that we all \ncould benefit from today is exactly the faith in God in a very \ninclusive way such as President Roosevelt spoke on that fateful day of \nJune 6, 1944.\n  Again, with thanks to my friend from Ohio for this idea and for his \ngenerosity of spirit in inviting me to join both in sponsoring this \nproposal and in reading this prayer today, I yield the floor back to \nthe Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend. I tell the Senator \nthat I am proud to stand by his side in this small effort to \ncommemorate what happened 68 years ago today, which was the President \ncalling the Nation in prayer and invoking the Almighty to help protect \nour sons and daughters in battle.\n  I just came back from Afghanistan yesterday morning, and I would \nagree with my friend from Connecticut that so much of what we are \nfacing today would also be relevant to these words. I think, \nparticularly, these words in the prayer:\n\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight for tolerance \n     and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end \n     of battle, for their return to the haven of home.\n\n  That certainly describes our great young men and women in uniform who \nare in Afghanistan protecting us and encouraging tolerance, goodwill, \nand justice not just for us but for that country and, indeed, for the \nworld.\n  I thank my colleague again for his being willing to join me in this \neffort. I hope my other colleagues will join us in encouraging that \nthis important, extraordinary prayer and this example of the power of \nfaith in our Nation's history be added to the World War II Memorial.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today we have before us the Agriculture \nReform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012. It is more commonly known as the \nfarm bill. It is critically important for America's farmers and \nranchers. But it might also be known as the conservation bill, as the \nfood bill, and, even better, the kitchen table bill because this bill \naffects every one of us.\n  The Agriculture Committee is different from most other committees in \nCongress. Our committee room does not have a raised dais. Instead, we \nsit around a table just like families across the country do and just \nlike farmers and ranchers do after a long day of work in the fields. To \nwrite this farm bill, we sat down around our table and we talked to \neach other and we listened to each other and we worked in a bipartisan \nway to craft a bill that creates jobs while cutting subsidies and \nreducing the deficit.\n  The result of that effort is what is before us in the Senate. It is a \nbill that affects every family across the country. The farm bill makes \nit possible for many families to come together around their own kitchen \ntables to enjoy the bounty of the world's safest, most abundant, and \nmost affordable food supply.\n  We are also aware, especially in this very tough economy, that many \nof our neighbors, many of our friends, many of our family members are \nstruggling to put food on their own tables. The farm bill is critically \nimportant to those families as well. As we begin our debate in the \nSenate on the farm bill, let us remember the families all across the \ncountry who are counting on us to get this right.\n  I want my colleagues to also remember that the farm bill is a jobs \nbill--16 million jobs. Sixteen million jobs in this country rely on the \ncontinued strength of American agriculture. They are the people doing \nthe work it takes to put the food on our kitchen tables, not just those \non the farm but those who manufacture, sell farm equipment, the people \nwho ship the crops from one place to another, the people who have the \nfarmers markets and local food hubs, the people who work in food \nprocessing and crop protection and crop fertility, not to mention the \nresearchers and the scientists who worked hard every day to fight pests \nand diseases that threaten our food supply.\n  Throughout this recession, as those 16 million people can attest, \nagriculture has been one of the truly bright spots in our economy. That \nis why we made such an important effort, such an important bipartisan \neffort in this farm bill to support beginning farmers as well. We are \ngiving them additional support for training, mentoring, and outreach to \nensure the success of our next generation of farmers.\n  In addition, we are giving opportunities for U.S. veterans who are \ninterested in pursuing a career in agriculture, and we are creating a \nmilitary veterans agricultural liaison within the Department of \nAgriculture to educate veterans about farming and connecting them with \nbeginning farmer training programs. I would also remind my colleagues \nthat for those who have served and are serving us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the majority of them--over half of them--are coming from \nsmall towns and rural communities and they are coming home. One of the \nways to provide opportunities for jobs is to support them coming back \nto their community by having the opportunity to go into agriculture.\n  One of the brightest spots in agriculture has been in exports. This \nchart shows the incredible growth of agricultural exports over the last \nnumber of years. In fact, total agricultural exports in 2011 alone \nreached $136 billion. It is a 270-percent increase just in the last 10 \nyears, an explosion, as we reach out. American agriculture is looked to \nand depended upon to feed the families of the world.\n  Our trade surplus is $42.5 billion. Let me repeat that. We have a \nsignificant trade surplus in agriculture. We cannot say that in much of \nany other place in our economy. But in agriculture we are growing it \nhere at home. The jobs are here at home, and we are exporting it \noverseas, which is what I would like to see in every one of our \nindustries. It is one of the few areas where we have that kind of \nsuccess.\n  We know that for every $1 billion in agricultural exports, we are \ncreating 8,400 American jobs--8,400 American jobs for every $1 billion \nin exports. The investments we make in market development, in access \nfor our agricultural products overseas, will continue to create jobs \nhere at home.\n  As we were writing the farm bill, we also did something that families \nall cross the country are doing during these very hard times. We went \nthrough everything we are spending, everything we are spending money \non, and we looked at how we could do more for less. We literally went \nthrough every page of farm policy and agriculture spending through \nUSDA. This bill represents major reforms that will allow us to focus \nfewer resources on the things that create jobs and make the biggest \ndifference. In other words, we are refocusing. We are cutting the \nthings that are not important and refocusing on the things that are and \nthe things that create jobs.\n  The Agriculture Reform Food and Jobs Act is about cutting subsidies \nand creating jobs in America. The reforms in this bill start on page 1 \nwith the repeal of direct payments, countercyclical payments, and the \nAverage Crop Revenue Election, which has been called the ACRE Program.\n  We are creating a new approach, a new program that only helps farmers \nwhen there is a loss and only for crops they have actually planted, and \nwe are strengthening payment limits. We are ending more than 100 \nprograms and authorizations that are no longer needed, and we are doing \nall of this in order to be able to cut the deficit by $23 billion.\n  The most fundamental reform in the Agriculture Reform Food and Jobs \nAct is the shift away from direct payments\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nand toward risk management for farmers. Throughout this process, we \nhave been focused on principles, not programs, and the No. 1 principle \nis risk management. So we are repealing direct payments. We know \nfarmers face unique risks unlike those in other businesses.\n\n  Let me stress that again. I do not know of any business that has the \nsame kind of risks in market volatility, in weather volatility than our \nfarmers and ranchers do. It is very fortunate we still have people who \nwant to stay in that business, given all the risks, weather and market \nconditions, which are out of producers' control. They can have \ndevastating effects. We know that. But the current system focused \naround direct and countercyclical payments does not focus on actual \nrisk and it is no longer defensible or sustainable.\n  In this current fiscal and political environment, these programs \nactually jeopardize our ability to have a real safety net for farmers \nand the jobs that depend on them. That is why we are eliminating those \nprograms and instead strengthening crop insurance as the centerpiece of \nrisk management in the farm bill.\n  This is the No. 1 issue we heard from every farmer who has testified \nbefore the committee, whether it was in Michigan or in Kansas or across \nthe country. Every region of the country we have heard the same thing \nloudly and clearly.\n  The basic foundation of support for producers is crop insurance. We \nare expanding crop insurance in the bill to include specialty crops and \nothers as well. Because while we know crop insurance is the foundation, \nit does not work the same. It is not available for every commodity. \nThat is a commitment we have made to expand crop insurance, including \nspecialty crops, which are essentially the kinds of crops we are likely \nto find in the produce aisle of our supermarket or at the local farmers \nmarket: nuts, vegetables, fruits, and other products.\n  This is an extremely diverse group of crops, and the bill recognizes \nthe unique crop insurance needs of specialty crop growers. We are also \ntaking strides to help young and beginning farmers get started and \nsucceed in farming. We have made revisions to crop insurance to better \nhelp those new farmers by reducing their crop insurance premiums and \nproviding additional support when disasters strike.\n  Supplement crop insurance. This bill creates a simple market-oriented \nand risk-based program we are calling ARC, Agricultural Risk Coverage. \nARC represents a significant and historic reform in agriculture policy. \nFor years, Congress has struggled to balance the needs of different \ncommodities, different programs. This is solved with the new ARC \nProgram, which uses the market as a guide and treats every commodity \nthe same.\n  The current system essentially amounts to an income transfer from the \nFederal Treasury to only certain people, certain farmers, because \npayments are made every year without regard to whether the farmer had a \nsuccessful year or whether the individual is farming. I say ``certain \npeople'' because many farmers do not qualify for the help today as \nwell.\n  Direct and countercyclical payments are made using what is called \nbase acres. That is the current system to determine the payments. Base \nacres were set using what was planted on the farms back in 1980s. So \nthese base acres have little relevance to what is actually happening on \nmany farms today. This change is also very important for new farmers. \nWe have told beginning farmers this is a very important way to support \nthem.\n  Our ARC, on the other hand, the program we have developed in this \nbill, uses only the acres a farmer actually plants. It is able to adapt \nto free market forces and the decisions made being made on the farm \nwithout interference from those business decisions a farmer makes. We \nwant the marketplace making the decisions, not the government.\n  ARC is market oriented. Farmers only get help when the market moves \nin the opposite direction from historic price trends farmers use to \nplan their business and make planning decisions. The payment amount is \nbased on actual historic numbers from the marketplace, not from the \nHalls of Congress.\n  Finally, too many current program payments are being made to people \nwho do not actually farm or already have large incomes. The farm bill \nfixes this. Under current law, we say farm payments can only go to \npeople who are actively engaged in farming. This requirement contained \na loophole, however, known as the management loophole that lets a farm \noperation designate managers who are not actually farming, but because \nthey are listed as managers, they can still get a payment from the \ngovernment, and it can allow them to get around the payment limits.\n  That does not make any sense. Thanks to Senator Grassley, Senator Tim \nJohnson, who has legislation in this area--and Senator Grassley is a \nmember of our committee who has been such a champion on this issue--we \nhave eliminated that loophole and made sure the payments are going to \npeople who are actually farming.\n  This farm bill also reforms the adjusted gross income eligibility \nrequirement, lowers it substantially, eliminating any payment to \nmillionaires. Current law includes two AGI calculations, one for farm \nincome, one for nonfarm income, which is confusing and difficult to \nadminister. It may allow some people to split their income in a way \nthat they are eligible for payments they otherwise would not be \neligible for. We close this loophole. We use a single, simple AGI \ncalculation and restrict the eligibility to those who have less than \n$750,000 in AGI.\n  Finally, the farm bill caps payments at $50,000, less than half of \nwhat a farmer can currently receive. Coupled with closing the \nmanagement loophole, the farm bill contains the tightest and strongest \npayment limit reforms ever, while maintaining and strengthening the \nfarm safety net for farmers who really need it. And this is very \nimportant. This is not about eliminating options, it is about focusing \non those who have the most risk and have the most need.\n\n  In dairy, we also reform our Nation's dairy policies, replacing the \ndairy programs with new, market-oriented programs that allow farmers to \nmanage their own risk in a manner that works best for them. The dairy \nindustry suffered serious hardship in 2009, as many of us know--and \ncertainly the Presiding Officer knows we in Michigan have the same \nthing--when milk prices dropped substantially, wiping out many small \nand medium-sized dairies. Despite spending $1.3 billion that year, our \ncurrent dairy programs weren't able to help many of the farmers in \ncrisis. In some cases, dairy farms that had been passed down from \ngeneration to generation went bankrupt and, sadly, some farmers even \ntook their own lives.\n  Dairy operations across the country are extremely diverse, and the \ndairy policies we are setting in this bill recognize that diversity. We \ncreated programs that can be customized by each dairy, and we allow \nindividual dairies to determine whether to participate in the programs \nat all. Two programs will now comprise the dairy risk management \nsystem: the Dairy Production Margin Protection Program and the Dairy \nMarket Stabilization Program.\n  The first provides support based on margin--that is, the difference \nbetween the milk price and the feed input costs. This is important \nbecause rising grain prices, coupled with dropping milk prices, can \nhave a devastating impact on America's dairies. Producers will have to \nshare in the program's costs--and this is important--but it will allow \nthem to manage their risk on more of their production at higher \nprotection levels. We are providing a discounted premium for the first \n4 million pounds of milk marketed for each producer--which is somewhere \naround 200 to 250 cows--to make sure that small and medium-sized \noperations will be able to participate and that all farms will be \neligible.\n  The second program, the Market Stabilization Program, sends clear \nmarket signals to producers that indicate when they are oversupplying \nthe market. Dairy is a unique commodity in that it is produced 365 days \na year, cows must be milked daily, the raw product requires further \nhandling and processing, and there are significant regional differences \nin management and marketing. By temporarily reducing a participating \noperation's payment for milk marketed by a small percentage when there \nis too much supply, the\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\nmargin program removes the incentive for dairies to overproduce during \ntimes of low margins. The program also includes a suspension trigger \nbased on world prices that ensures U.S. dairies are competitive in the \nglobal market.\n  Conservation. Throughout this farm bill, we took the same approach as \na family sitting around the table would when they are trying to figure \nout cuts in their own budget. We went through every program, again \nlooked at what was working, what wasn't, looked for duplication and \nwaste, and we focused on principles, not programs. An excellent example \nof that really is conservation.\n  Farming is measured in generations. Farms are passed down from \nchildren to grandchildren. But a farm can only be successful if it has \nquality soil and clean water. One of the farmers who testified before \nour committee told us that conservation programs which ``enhance and \nprotect our natural resource base is a crop insurance program for the \nnation.'' I would agree. With a growing global population, it is even \nmore important than ever that we conserve water and conserve soil \nresources. Advances in technology and farm practices have helped our \nfarmers be more productive than ever before, but no amount of \ntechnology can overcome degraded soils, poor water quality, or a lack \nof water.\n  The farm bill is actually our Nation's single biggest investment in \nland and water conservation on private lands in our country. As we went \nthrough every program, we focused on making them more flexible and \neasier to use. We have been able to focus 23 different programs into \n13. We have reduced it to 13 and put them in 4 primary functions, with \na lot more flexibility for the users.\n  The first function is working lands--giving farmers and ranchers the \ntools they need to be better stewards of the land. The Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program--or EQIP--is one of the most important \nconservation programs for working lands, providing technical and \nfinancial assistance to farmers, ranchers, and private forest owners to \nhelp them conserve soil and water. This function also includes the \nConservation Stewardship Program, which encourages higher levels of \nconservation and the adoption of emerging conservation technologies.\n  We also continued the conservation innovation grants and the \nVoluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, which allows \nprivate landowners to get added benefits from their lands by opening \nthem up to hunting, fishing, bird watching, and other kinds of outdoor \nrecreation. We made these programs more flexible--and this is very \nimportant--and we added a focus on wildlife habitats and made them \neasier for farmers to take advantage of.\n  The second area is the Conservation Reserve Program--very important. \nIt removes highly erodible land from production to benefit soil and \nwater quality as well as wildlife habitat. Parts of the Southwest--\ncertainly my friend and colleague from Kansas knows this--have \nexperienced record droughts this year. It is stunning what has \nhappened, and it is the worst since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. But \nthe soil, while it was dry, stayed on the ground because the \nConservation Reserve Program was a part of that change protecting the \nsoil and air. Our conservation efforts are actually working, and we are \nseeing changes even in the worst of times as it relates to the \ndroughts.\n  CRP has also been critical in our efforts to rebuild wildlife \npopulations and to reduce pollution in our streams, our rivers, and our \nlakes. We also continued an important transition incentives program to \nhelp older farmers transition their land to beginning farmers.\n  Third, we focused on regional partnerships. We consolidated four \ndifferent programs into one that will provide competitive, merit-based \ngrants to regional partnerships comprised of conservation groups, \nuniversities, farmers, ranchers, and private landowners to support \nimprovements to soil health, water quality and quantity, and wildlife \nhabitat. That is certainly important to me for the Great Lakes--and I \nknow the Presiding Officer cares about that as well--but it is also \ncritical for the Chesapeake Bay. And I want to thank our colleagues \nfrom the bay area, certainly Senator Cardin and Senator Casey, who are \non the committee, but also Senator Warner and Members all across the \nbay who have been deeply involved in making sure we get this right. It \nis also there for other critical areas around the country that have \nlarge-scale regional challenges around conservation.\n\n  Finally, I am really proud of the work that was done around \neasements. Easements allow landowners to voluntarily enter into an \nagreement to preserve wetlands and farmland to protect against \ndevelopment and sprawl. This year, funding for both the Wetlands \nReserve Program and the Grasslands Reserve Program were was out. So we \nstreamlined and consolidated to establish an easement program with a \npermanent baseline going forward to protect agricultural lands from \ndevelopment.\n  This bill also includes a bipartisan sodsaver provision, and I wish \nto thank Senators Thune, Johanns, and Sherrod Brown for bringing it \nforward, authoring it, and working with us. This provision helps \nprevent the plowing up of native prairie. Sodsaver is aimed at \nprotecting grasslands at high risk of being converted to cropland. This \nis not only good for conservation, it saves taxpayers $200 million over \n10 years, and it is tied to crop insurance.\n  I should also say that while the conservation title in the farm bill \nis a big win for conservation of our environment, I am proud to say we \nhave continued to link the commodity title, which I described earlier, \nto conservation.\n  In crop insurance, the sodsaver program creates a penalty if, in \nfact, someone is plowing up native prairie. They would lose part of \ntheir discount under crop insurance if they did that. So it is tied \nthere, and that is very important.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we received support for our approach \nfrom 643 different conservation and environmental groups in all 50 \nStates. I think that says loudly and clearly that it is possible to \nmake smart cuts that increase flexibility without sacrificing \neffectiveness.\n  Another area in which we have made significant strides is nutrition \nand healthy foods. For too long our Nation's farm bill ignored the \ndiversity of agriculture and the kinds of healthy foods, such as fruits \nand vegetables, that families in America want to put on their kitchen \ntables as well. We made significant progress on this front in the 2008 \nfarm bill, with the first-ever specialty crops title, and we have \ncontinued the progress in the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act.\n  As I said earlier, as I go to every part of Michigan, I meet people \nwho have worked all their lives, paid taxes, and never imagined they \nwould be put in a position where they would need help putting food on \nthe table for their families. Because of this recession, which has been \nway too long in Michigan--it is getting better, but we have been hit \nharder, deeper, and longer than anywhere--a lot of families have had to \nask for temporary help. And when they need it, whether it is food \nassistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which \nused to be called food stamps and is now called SNAP, or whether it is \nhelp from a food bank, those families are grateful, and we should be \nthere when they need that temporary help.\n  We all expect those programs to have integrity. And as someone whose \nState has been hit harder than anyone else's, I want to make absolutely \nsure these programs are in place for families who need it, and that \nmeans making absolutely sure every dollar goes to only the families who \nneed it. That is why we are closing loopholes that allowed lottery \nwinners--and, unbelievably, we have had at least two instances of this \nin Michigan, where someone won the lottery and was able to continue on \nfood assistance. It is shameful that so many American children go to \nbed hungry at night and outrageous that people who have won millions of \ndollars in the lottery would be able to continue food assistance. So we \nmade it absolutely clear that those individuals would be removed from \nSNAP immediately.\n  We are also cracking down on the trafficking of food assistance \nbenefits. Right now, thanks to the efforts of the last farm bill, fraud \nis at an alltime low, but we can do even more. We are\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\ngiving additional resources to monitor and prevent benefit trafficking, \nas well as cracking down on liquor and tobacco stores that are \ncurrently allowed to participate in the program.\n  We are making sure that only people returning to school for career \nand technical training are eligible for food assistance, not college \nstudents who are currently at home or being supported by their parents.\n  Again, with so many families and so many children in need, we can't \nafford to divert funds in a way that just shouldn't be there.\n  We must also ensure that the standards Congress created for SNAP are \nfollowed by the States. We are eliminating a gap in standards that has \nallowed 16 States, including Michigan, to give just $1 to people in the \nform of energy assistance to help them automatically qualify for \nadditional SNAP benefits. We know families in parts of the country with \nhigh energy bills are often those who are most food insecure, and that \nis why we created the link between food assistance and LIHEAP. But it \nis clear Congress never intended for State governments to use this in a \nway that could jeopardize additional assistance for families with the \nhighest utility bills.\n  Just like with commodity programs, we need to make sure the work we \nare doing has integrity and is defensible in our current budget \nclimate, and we do this in a very careful way to make sure we do not \ninadvertently hurt families who truly do have significant energy costs.\n\n  In addition to increasing accountability, we are building on the \nsuccess of programs that reduce hunger and improve access to healthy \nfruits and vegetables. We increase assistance for food banks through \nthe Emergency Food Assistance Program. In 2010 more than 5 million \npeople visited a food bank, and as we recover from this recession, it \nis absolutely critical that these organizations have food in stock to \nhelp those in need.\n  We are streamlining the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which \nprovides food to low-income individuals, to focus on seniors, and we \nare moving women and children into the WIC Program, where they can be \nbetter served.\n  We are continuing the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which was \nauthored originally by Senator Harkin when he was chairing the \ncommittee, and I was very proud to work with him on that. It provides \nfree and healthy snacks to schools with a high number of low-income \nchildren, and it has been incredibly successful.\n  This bill triples our support for farmers markets and gives them \nresources to develop local infrastructure such as food hubs. And we are \ncontinuing an effort to give low-income seniors access to healthy \nfruits and vegetables at farmers markets and roadside stands.\n  We are increasing funding for innovative projects such as community \ngardens and urban greenhouse initiatives and protecting funding for \nprograms that improve people's health.\n  I should say that all of these are done with small amounts of \ndollars, but they are very effective.\n  We are creating a national pilot modeled after Michigan's successful \nDouble Up Food Bucks, which gives families relying on SNAP the \nopportunity to truly be able to buy fresh fruits and vegetables for \ntheir families. We are also authorizing the Healthy Food Financing \nInitiative to offer loans and grants to help address the problem of \nfood deserts in underserved communities.\n  We increased funding for several organic programs, which, by the way, \nis the fastest growing segment of American agriculture. We increased \nsupport for organic research and extension, and we nearly doubled \nfunding for the organic cost-share program that supports farmers.\n  This farm bill is a jobs bill, but it is also a food bill, and the \n2012 farm bill goes a long way toward making sure every mom and dad can \nput healthy, nutritious food on the table for their children.\n  As we worked through the farm bill around our table in the \nAgriculture Committee, we focused on streamlining and consolidating \nprograms to get the best possible results. I think that is what people \nwant us to do. I certainly know that is what people in Michigan want us \nto do. We certainly see that in conservation, but we also approached \nthis in every part of the farm bill.\n  In farm credit and rural development, we are streamlining the \nexisting laws, removing unused provisions, and making authorizations \nmore effective and the administration more effective so that when we \nhave a part-time mayor who is trying to figure out rural development \nprograms, they can actually do it and they actually use what have been \nextremely effective programs for rural communities.\n  In our research title, we eliminated dozens of unused or indefensible \nauthorizations but continued the most important research components and \nfunctions, while streamlining operations, improving accountability in \nthe use of Federal research funds, and creating an innovative, new \nresearch foundation that matches private dollars and leverages Federal \nresearch dollars to get more innovative food and agricultural research. \nAnd I wish to thank my friend from Kansas, Senator Roberts, for his \nimportant leadership in this as well.\n  We funded important energy programs, invested in specialty crops and \norganic farming, as I mentioned, and we have done all of this while \nsaving the Federal taxpayers $23 billion. We did it around our table in \nthe ag room, in a bipartisan fashion, working out differences and \narriving at real solutions.\n  In the coming days, as we get to debate on the farm bill, we will \ntalk more about specifics, and I will join my colleagues from the \ncommittee in further explaining various aspects of the bill, and we \nwill continue to work with all of our colleagues to find additional \nsolutions and to improve the bill so that our farm programs work best \nfor all of our regions and all of our States.\n  While I will do everything I can to work out issues with our \ncolleagues, I wish to stress the important balance we have struck in a \nbipartisan effort, the reforms we have undertaken, and the work we put \ninto making real reforms without hurting families and without hurting \nfarmers, who are so important to our economic recovery.\n  I am very proud of the work we have been able to accomplish--it has \nbeen a lot of hard work--and the way we saved American taxpayers $23 \nbillion through these reforms. I would encourage colleagues to look \nclosely at the work we have done in the bill, to find a way to support \nit, to help us send a strong message to all Americans that this \nCongress, this Senate can make tough, smart decisions that cut \nspending, invest in America, and that we can do it together.\n  Speaking of doing it together, I could not have done this without my \nfriend and my partner, Senator Roberts, the ranking member from Kansas. \nThis has been a long and difficult process, but frankly there is nobody \nI would rather have had sitting across the table from me as we worked \nout this bill. Too many people look at Washington and only see \ndysfunction and partisanship and divisiveness. Yet we on the \nAgriculture Committee have found a way to work together for the good of \nthe country, for 16 million people who depend on agriculture for their \nlivelihood. That couldn't have happened without Senator Roberts' \nleadership and support, and I thank him as we move forward on this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan for her very kind remarks. This has \nbeen a team effort. She has been a very strong leader to try to put \ntogether a bill. I thank her for her very detailed summary, title by \ntitle, of the farm bill--something a lot of us probably couldn't do, \nbut at any rate, she has done that, and it is in the Congressional \nRecord. I urge my colleagues to really take a look at what the \ndistinguished chairwoman has said today because she has literally gone \ndown every title in the farm bill. So if anybody has any questions, it \nis right there, and, as she has indicated, if anybody has questions of \neither of us, please be in contact with either us or our very able \nstaff.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Agriculture Reform, Food and \nJobs Act of 2012, the farm bill, and I am privileged to stand here \ntoday with Chairwoman Stabenow, who led this reform legislation through \nthe Agriculture\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nCommittee. It has truly been a bipartisan and a team effort. It \nrepresents the final product of numerous hearings and months of \ndiscussions as we worked to write a new farm bill during the most \ndifficult budget climate in our Nation's recent history.\n  I am proud to say that we have put together a bipartisan bill that \nstrengthens and preserves the safety net for our farmers and ranchers \nin rural America, while providing $23.6 billion--$24 billion, as a \npolitician's counting--in deficit reduction under this bill reported by \nthe committee on a bipartisan vote of 16 to 5.\n  Let me repeat that. The Senate Agriculture Committee voluntarily \nwrote and reported a bill that provides $23.6 billion in deficit \nreduction. It is a bill that represents real reform. We are the first \nauthorizing committee to produce those kinds of mandatory budget \nsavings, and it was voluntary.\n  We all remember the supercommittee that tried very hard to achieve \ndeficit reduction. The supercommittee was really not that super--not \nbecause of those people individually but because of the circumstances. \nWell, we are a supercommittee. We came up with $23.6 billion. I don't \nknow of anybody over on the House side--perhaps I am wrong, but in the \nSenate we are the only folks who have really come up with real budget \nsavings.\n  It also represents, as I have indicated and as the chairwoman \nindicated, real reform. Just listen to this. We have eliminated four \ncommodity programs that caused farmers untold hours of preparation--go \ndown to the Farm Service Agency and talk to the folks down there, who \nare hard-pressed anyway, and ask: ``Which program do I sign up for? How \ncan I plan down the road?'' We rolled all of these commodity programs \ninto one, while saving approximately $15 billion from the farm safety \nnet programs. That is truly remarkable.\n  Twenty-three conservation programs are streamlined into 13, while \nsaving nearly $6.4 billion. Approximately $4 billion is saved in the \nnutrition title, while at the same time expanding our efforts to root \nout fraud and abuse. Sixteen program authorizations are eliminated in \nthe rural development title, eliminating over $1 billion of authorized \nspending over 10 years on top of the mandatory. Two programs are \ncombined and another two eliminated in specialty crops. Over $200 \nmillion less in mandatory money is provided in the energy title \ncompared to the 2008 farm bill. Five programs are eliminated in the \nforestry title, reducing authorizations by at least $20 million. Over \n60 authorizations are eliminated from the research title, reducing \nauthorizations by at least $770 million over 5 years. Again, that is \n$23.6 billion in tough mandatory savings, at least $1.8 billion in \nreduced discretionary authorizations, and at least 100 programs or \nauthorizations that have been eliminated.\n  This is a reform bill. No other committee in the House or Senate has \nvoluntarily undertaken programmatic and funding reforms at this level \nin this budget climate--no other committee. Believe me, it would have \nbeen much easier to write a baseline bill with no change in CBO \nspending projections. We could have fulfilled everyone's request on the \ncommittee and in the Senate, but we would not have performed the duty \nthat we were elected to perform and that our constituents expect in \nthis budget climate and that farmers and ranchers expect and their \nlenders expect and all up and down Main Street throughout rural and \nsmalltown America or, for that matter, any taxpayer or any citizen of \nthe United States. We have reduced spending, and we have reformed \nprograms. That is what they want, and they want us to work together, \nand that is what we have done. At the same time, it is a bill that \nstrengthens and preserves our farm risk management, conservation, \nresearch, and rural community programs.\n  We have strengthened and preserved the Crop Insurance Program--as \npointed out by the distinguished chairwoman, the No. 1 priority of \nvirtually every producer who testified before our committee. Why? \nBecause their banker or their lenders say: You have to have crop \ninsurance, and you have to strengthen it, and you have to improve it. \nIn the past, we have been using crop insurance as a bank. No, we are \nnot going to do that anymore given the circumstances our farmers face \neven today in Kansas as we go through another dry spell, and also in \nTexas, Oklahoma, and the High Plains.\n  We have streamlined our commodity programs, while reducing the \ncomplexity for the producers. We have updated the acreage upon which \nsupport is based to reflect more recent cropping patterns. That is a \npoint I wish to discuss just a little bit more.\n  In recent days and weeks, it has seemed there has been just a little \nbit of confusion here in the Capitol region. It seems that some think \nwe should write a farm safety net program and allocate their funding by \ncommodity group or organization, sort of like a pie chart. If all you \ndid was listen to these groups, you would think we were robbing Peter \nto pay Paul.\n  I understand that the elimination of direct payments is a big deal to \nmany commodities. If anybody should understand that, it should be me. \nAs a key feature of the 1996 act, I originally authored the program at \nthat time. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the program has been \nwheat, especially in Kansas. But the taxpayers have been clear in this \nbudget climate: Why should Congress continue and defend a program based \non planting acreages established over 25 years ago? That doesn't make \nany sense.\n  Yes, the elimination of direct payments means the end of many wheat \npayments in Kansas, but that does not mean Kansas producers will no \nlonger have a farm safety net--quite the contrary. They will have a \nstrong risk management program. It will just be for different \ncrops. Why? Because when base acres were established over 25 years ago, \nKansas planted over 2.8 million acres of corn, 4.2 million acres of \nsorghum, 1.6 million acres of soybeans, and 12.1 million acres of \nwheat.\n\n  Now, in the most recent 3-year period, Kansas farmers planted 4.6 \nmillion acres of corn, 2.6 million acres of sorghum, 4 million acres of \nsoybeans, and 8.8 million acres of wheat. Why? That is 4.9 million \nfewer acres of wheat and sorghum and 4.2 million more acres of corn and \nsoybeans.\n  Why did that happen? Why did these acreage shifts in Kansas and all \nover the country change like that? It occurred because farmers made \nthose decisions, not Washington. Our producers have planted for the \ndomestic and international market, and we have done so in a way that we \ndo not encourage a WTO challenge. The cropping changes are much the \nsame all throughout the Nation, especially among States represented on \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  Money is shifting among commodities because farmers are farming \ndifferently. They are becoming much more diversified throughout the \nStates on this committee and the Nation. It is not shifting because we \nin Washington are intentionally picking winners and losers.\n  I understand some are frustrated with the decisions and changes we \nhave in this bill. That takes place in any farm bill. Quite honestly, \nthere are things that, if we had the funds available, the chairwoman \nand I both would have preferred to have done differently. But let's be \nblunt. This is not the 2002 or 2008 farm bill, and we do not have extra \nfunds available.\n  This is not my first trip to the farm bill rodeo. I have written \nbills in times of budget surpluses and extra spending, and I have \nwritten farm bills in the middle of deficit cutting exercises--seven of \nthem. Make no mistake about it, it is much easier to write a bill when \nwe are adding money to the baseline--a whole heck-of-a-lot easier.\n  Nutrition groups, conservation organizations, our commodity groups, \nour Members of Congress want to stand by you and take the bows when you \nare adding money to the programs. But when it comes time to make \ndifficult decisions and do what is right for the country by reducing \nspending and reforming programs, sometimes they are just not even in \nthe same room. They are hiding in the weeds.\n  American agriculture today is a modern-day miracle. Every American \nfarmer feeds you, Mr. President, and 150 other people. In America today \nour consumers spend less of their disposable income on food--and their \nmarket basket, OK?--than any other Nation in the world. America's \nfarmers and ranchers provide us with the most\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\nabundant and affordable and safest food supply on the planet. That is a \nspeech every farm organization and commodity group and farmers and \nranchers have heard over and over, but it is a speech that deserves \nrepeating to all my colleagues over and over so they get it.\n  They feed our Nation. Our producers feed our country. They feed the \nworld, a troubled and hungry world. They provide food for the food aid \nprograms that help countries around the world send young girls to \nschool. Sending those girls to school helps feed hope and a belief in \nour American ideals rather than hatred and radicalism toward our \nNation. The American farmer and rancher do provide stability in a \nchaotic world, and in doing so national security as well.\n  Show me a country that can't sustain itself in terms of food supply, \nI will show you chaos. Read about the Mideast, Syria, Libya and what is \ngoing on over in that part of the world. So the farm program is not \nonly a farm program, it is a program to achieve stability in the world \nbecause of the productivity of the American farmer, and our ability to \ndo it is also a national security program.\n  Every year America's farmers produce more on less land using less \nwater and fewer inputs with ever-stronger conservation practices. It is \ntruly a modern-day miracle what the agricultural sector in America does \ntoday.\n  I understand some are unhappy with some of the proposals put forward \nin this bill. It is a farm bill. I wouldn't expect it to be any \ndifferent. But I can assure you, however, if I thought we were in any \nway writing a bill that would make it more difficult for my State of \nKansas or for the State of Michigan or any American producer to feed \nthis Nation and this world, a bill that eliminated their safety net \nwhich destroyed their ability to protect our natural resources while \nalso feeding the most needy in our country, I would not be standing \nhere today supporting it. I would not do that.\n  If I thought it in any way could keep us from feeding 9 billion \npeople--note that, 9 billion people who will walk this Earth in just a \ncouple of short decades--I would oppose this bill. We are going to have \nto double our agricultural production to help in a humanitarian way and \nprevent chaos all around the world, 9 billion people.\n  Agriculture is the backbone of the Kansas economy, employing more \nthan one in five Kansans. More than 65,000 farms dot the Kansas \nlandscape with an average land size of 705 acres. These farmers and \nranchers do a tremendous job of feeding a troubled and hungry world. In \nfact, Kansas ranks No. 1 in the Nation in the production of wheat and \ngrain sorghum, second in cattle farms, and third in sunflowers \nproduced. We expect that, being the Sunflower State. Cash receipts from \nfarm marketings were greater than $12 billion, and farm product exports \nwere in excess of $4.8 billion.\n  Farmers and ranchers in my State truly help feed--what we have said \nagain and again--a troubled and hungry world, which is why I am proud \nof this legislation. We have worked hard to put this together. It may \nnot be the best possible bill, but it is the best bill possible given \nthe circumstances we face. We have performed our duty to taxpayers by \ncutting deficit spending while at the same time strengthening and \npreserving the programs so important to agriculture and rural America.\n  Again, we have cut mandatory spending by $23.6 billion. We have \nreformed, eliminated, and streamlined USDA programs to the tune of more \nthan 100 programs and authorizations eliminated. And we have done it on \na voluntary basis because in rural America you make the tough \ndecisions. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and you do \nwhat is right when it needs to be done. When we have done it in a \nbipartisan fashion, that is the best way to do it.\n  How many times have we heard this: What on Earth is wrong back there? \nWhy can't you join together and work together and do what is right for \nAmerica and for the people? This is what this committee has done under \nthe leadership of the chairwoman.\n  So I thank the chairwoman for bringing us to this point today, and \nlet's pass this farm bill. It is good for the country, it is good for \nthe world, it is a good bill, and we need to proceed.\n  I hope every Member could vote for the motion to proceed. If they \nhave amendments they are interested in, please come to us. It is like \nBob Barker said: Come on down. Come on down and talk to us. If you have \na problem with the bill, we will work with you. Just let us know. OK.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander, be recognized for 10 minutes when he appears \non the floor. I thought he would be here by this time but he is not. At \nthe appropriate time, I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I want to begin by taking this opportunity to thank \nthe chairwoman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee for \ntheir very strong efforts in getting this bill to the floor today. \nTheir steady hand of leadership has made vast improvements for \nAmerica's agricultural community and our economy as a whole. I know the \ntireless effort of our chairwoman and her staff undoubtedly leave \nAmerica's farm policy in a stronger position than when she found it, \nand I know she has worked with a forward-looking vision for a thriving \nagricultural economy and rural community.\n  I also thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for working with \nme and all the members of our committee throughout the process that got \nus here today. Because of this strong work, I am urging my colleagues \nto vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  When I first came to the Senate 3 years ago, I became the first \nmember from my State of New York to serve on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee in almost four decades. It is a responsibility I not only \nhonor but I take incredibly seriously. For those 3 years I traveled all \nacross our great State. I met with our farmers in their communities, \nlistened to their concerns, and I understand their needs and \npriorities.\n  New York is not home to the corporate megafarms. We are home to small \ndairy farms, specialty crops, orchards, and vineyards. As we have been \nshaping and debating this farm bill, those are the farms, the small \nbusinesses I have been fighting for.\n  I am very grateful this bill will help our specialty crop growers by \nproviding them with a dedicated funding stream as well as a better way \nto protect against disasters. I am also very proud of the good work \nwith broadband investments to make sure our rural communities have \naccess to the Internet. We also worked hard on trying to guarantee more \ntransparency and accountability on how we price milk in this country.\n  But we cannot forget this bill is much more than a number of esoteric \nfigures. What this farm bill should be about is how we protect and \ncreate a growing economy for small businesses, agricultural businesses, \nthe middle class, and those families who are desperately trying to get \nthere.\n  The farm bill is about the health of the agriculture industry. It is \nabout the health of our families with nutritious food that is actually \nwithin reach of the children who need it.\n  As a mother, I am very concerned this current farm bill cuts $4.5 \nbillion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP--\nbetter known as food stamps--over the next 10 years. I am incredibly \ndisappointed, and even troubled, that my Republican colleagues are \nseeking to cut food stamps even more from those cuts.\n  Under this bill families in New York who are already struggling will \nlose $90 a month of food that goes on their tables. Think of food for a \nfamily for a long month. It is basically the last week that a family \nwill not have\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nenough food to feed their children. Now, $90 a month may not seem like \na lot of money to some people, but I can say for those parents who are \ntrying to protect their children and feed them good, wholesome, \nnutritious foods, it means everything in the world.\n  I don't know for any parents who are watching today whether they \npersonally ever heard their child say: Mommy, I am still hungry. Well, \nimagine not being able to help your own child or future child. Imagine \nthat your child says this every single day. That is what we are faced \nwith here.\n  I have heard stories from New Yorkers who never dreamed they would \nneed food stamps in their lifetime, who never imagined they would have \nno choice but to apply for this kind of Federal assistance. I heard \nfrom one single mom in Queens. She had a job in a supermarket, but she \nstill struggled to make ends meet. She broke down in tears one day when \nher son came home from school with his school lunch in his hand and \nsaid: Mommy, I brought this home for us for dinner, and I asked my \nfriend for his sandwich.\n  Another woman in Brooklyn, incredibly well educated, went to a \nprestigious university, but lost her job. She said:\n\n       I never thought I would be getting food stamps. But \n     suddenly I was jobless and did not know where my next meal \n     would come from. Food stamps played a big role during make-\n     or-break moments in my life. They are not a handout. I worked \n     all my life, paid my taxes and food stamps helped me get back \n     on my feet again.\n\n  As a mother, as a lawmaker, watching a child go hungry is something I \nwill not stand for. In this day and age, in a country as rich as \nAmerica, it is unacceptable and should not be tolerated and should \ncertainly not be advocated. I know not every State in this country has \nas many people as we have in New York. We have 20 million people in our \ngreat State. So with these cuts, it is going to affect 300,000 \nfamilies. Imagine 300,000 families in your State or any State going \nhungry at night. These kinds of cuts hurt children and families. They \nhurt seniors who are homebound and don't know where their next meal is \ngoing to come from.\n  We are asking these 300,000 families to take a disproportionate \namount of the burden. They were not the cause of the financial \ncollapse. They were not the cause of this terrible economy, but we are \nasking them to bear the burden.\n  We know food stamps are actually a very effective investment. For \nevery dollar we put into the Food Stamp Program, we get $1.71 of \nspending back into the economy. World famous economist Mark Zandi said:\n\n       The fastest way to infuse money into the economy is through \n     expanding the SNAP/food stamp program.\n\n  This money pays the salary of grocery clerks and truckers who bring \nfood to a store from the farm. The USDA estimates that 16 cents of \nevery one of these food stamp dollars goes right back to our farmers. \nDespite widespread myths and inaccuracies, there is so little fraud in \nSNAP. It is less than 1 percent. That is a penny on a dollar.\n  I take our Nation's debt and deficit as seriously as anyone else in \nthis Chamber. I applaud the chairwoman and the ranking member for being \nable to curb spending, but families who are living in poverty, who are \njust trying to figure out how to keep the lights on and put food on \nthe table did not spend this Nation into debt, and we should not be \ntrying to balance the budget on their backs. Subsidies for large \ncorporations that don't need it--including companies based in Bermuda, \nAustralia, Switzerland--is not the right priority for America. We \nshould be helping the most needy among us, our children, our seniors, \nand our families at risk.\n\n  So today I am introducing an amendment to restore the $4.5 billion in \ncuts because it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do \nfor our families, our seniors, and our kids. It is the right thing to \ndo for our economy. It invests $500 million over 10 years in a fresh \nfruits and vegetables snack program, which connects our kids to our \nfarmers. It gives the authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to make \nadditional purchases as part of the Emergency Food Assistance Program. \nIt is useful when we have an all-time high rate of hunger and \nunemployment that puts unbelievable demands on these emergency feeding \norganizations.\n  To pay for these investments in our children's health and the health \nof the economy, my amendment makes a modest reduction in government \nsubsidies to some of the most highly profitable companies. My amendment \nlowers the subsidies to companies from billions per year to hundreds of \nmillions per year. Anyone who argues that these companies will struggle \nfrom this shift needs to meet a family who is dependent on food stamps \nto feed their children.\n  As I said earlier, this farm bill, like all legislation, is about our \npriorities. It is a reflection of our values. So I am asking my \ncolleagues, let's agree children deserve healthy meals so they can live \nhealthy lives and learn and grow and reach their God-given potential. \nLet's agree it is a worthwhile investment in our future to make sure \nchildren do not go hungry in this country.\n  I yield back my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln was no stranger to \nagriculture. He spent most of his early years on farms. Many years \nlater, he signed into law legislation that created the Department of \nAgriculture, which just recently celebrated its 150th anniversary. \nPresident Lincoln understood American agriculture.\n  He said:\n\n       The man who produces a good full crop will scarcely let any \n     part of it go to waste. He will keep up the enclosure about \n     it, and allow neither man nor beast to trespass upon it. He \n     will gather it in due season and store it in perfect \n     security. Thus he labors with satisfaction, and saves himself \n     the whole fruit of his labor.\n\n  Those timeless words ring true today, and they will ring true \ntomorrow. American farmers and ranchers are the most productive and \nefficient in the world. Their hard work creates good-paying jobs in \nMontana and across the Nation. In fact, one in five Montana jobs is \ntied to agriculture.\n  But President Lincoln's observations also apply to many other walks \nof life, including work in the Senate. Under the leadership of \nChairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Roberts, we have cultivated a \nfarm bill for tomorrow. We must not let that hard work go to waste. \nThey have worked very hard, very closely together, cooperating. It is a \ngood farm bill.\n  This legislation achieves what many thought impossible: It creates a \nmarket-oriented safety net that works for American farmers, strengthens \ncrop insurance, and streamlines conservation programs, while still \ncontributing $23.6 billion to deficit reduction. That is right. This \nreduces the deficit by about $23.6 billion. That is over 10 years.\n  Direct payments have their place in farm program history, but in \nlight of necessary spending reductions, it was clear we could not \ncontinue with the status quo. So the Senate Agriculture Committee \nworked closely with farmers and ranchers across the country to create a \nprogram for a real safety net--one that only pays farmers who actually \nexperience a loss.\n  Farming is an extremely capital-intensive industry, and our farmers \noften work with paper-thin profit margins. Even the best farmer is left \nat the mercy of chance--historic droughts, catastrophic floods, price \ncollapses, and so much more. This new revenue program will make sure \nthere is stability and predictability for our farmers from year to \nyear.\n  Our comprehensive farm policy contributes to overall security in \nAmerican agriculture. That is why we spend less on food than any other \ncountry in the world. Americans spend less than 7 percent of their \ndisposable income to feed their families--7 percent--compared with \nalmost 25 percent in 1930.\n  But it is more than just food security. As a net exporter of \nagricultural products, Montana farmers and ranchers create good-paying \njobs and quite literally grow wealth and prosperity from our fertile \nsoils.\n  The shallow-loss revenue program, combined with the same crop \ninsurance products we have fine-tuned over the decades, creates a \nfiscally sound safety\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\nnet. This is the fruit of our labor, and we must keep this intact.\n  We improved much more than just the commodity title. We saved $6 \nbillion in the conservation title without compromising the policy. We \ndid this by consolidating 23 existing programs--consolidating them all \ntogether--creating a tight network of efficient and streamlined \nconservation programs.\n  I made sure we protected the working lands programs, which contribute \nto substantial conservation improvements but still allow for productive \nuse of the land.\n  For livestock, I made sure we extended and made permanent the \nlivestock disaster programs that I worked hard to include in the last \nfarm bill. Since they were created in 2008, the three livestock \nprograms have helped over 100,000 ranchers across the country.\n  Right now, we are experiencing historic droughts in regions of the \nUnited States that also produce much of our beef. The livestock \ndisaster programs will help those ranchers stay in business until the \nrain starts falling again.\n  In the forestry title, we permanently authorized stewardship \ncontracting. This is very important. This will help the timber industry \nsustainably harvest more trees. This permanent authority is critical \nfor reducing wildfire risk and maintaining resilient landscapes and \ncommunities throughout our country. As I advocated prior to markup, \nthese returns are well worth the small investment. It can keep \ncompanies such as F.H. Stoltze, which is celebrating 100 years in \noperation in Columbia Falls, MT, in business for another 100 years.\n  I also was pleased with the inclusion of a workable approach to the \nbark beetle epidemic spreading throughout Montana and the West. My \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Tester, has also worked to remedy this \nepidemic.\n  Our loggers and small timber mills in Montana are facing the second \nworst beetle kill in the lower 48, a Forest Service tied up in \nlawsuits, and a housing market that continues to drag. Sawmills such as \nthose owned by R-Y Timber in Townsend and Livingston will benefit from \nthe approach we take in this farm bill.\n  I was also very proud of the work the committee did for veteran \nfarmers and ranchers. Not only did the committee accept my amendment to \nexpand access to conservation programs to veterans, but it also will \ndirect USDA to set up a military liaison position.\n  These strides to extend assistance to veteran farmers and ranchers \nare vital to our returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who hope to \nreturn to rural America and become involved in agriculture. Forty-five \npercent of those who serve in the military come from rural communities.\n  The farm bill provision makes it clear that both efficient \nauthorities and adequate resources are crucial for this effort, and I \nam committed to enacting legislation that enables the decisive and \nresponsible action that is urgently needed.\n  There is a lot of talk on Capitol Hill about creating jobs and \ncutting debt. The farm bill is our jobs bill. It is also responsible to \ntaxpayers. If we Senators were farmers, I would say we have produced a \npretty good crop with this bill. But that is not the final step. All \nfarmers know there is a time for harvest.\n  Now is harvest time. It is time to pass this farm bill. If we wait \ntoo long, we run the risk of compromising the stability of American \nagriculture and our food supply.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         America's Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me speak today about two recent CBO \nreports and what they portend for the economy and for policy that we \nmight want to make in the Congress. CBO, of course, is the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, and from time to time it looks at economic \nconditions and presents studies or issues reports about the state of \nour economy based upon legislation the Congress has adopted.\n  There are two recent reports that I think suggest some very dire news \nfor this country unless we in the Congress are willing to take some \naction. The first was a couple of weeks ago, and it dealt with the so-\ncalled fiscal cliff, the problem that will occur with the combination \nof two things automatically happening unless Congress and the President \nact.\n  The first is the automatic across-the-board cuts or sequestration \nthat will affect both defense and nondefense spending to the tune of \n$109 billion next year, something which the Secretary of Defense has \nsaid would be ``devastating'' and ``catastrophic'' for our national \nsecurity. That is the first problem. The Congressional Budget office \nsaid the combination of the sequestration with the second item, which \nis the automatic tax increase, which is a $4.5 trillion tax increase \nthat begins on January 1, the combination of those two will put this \ncountry back into recession.\n  CBO projected the growth rate next year to be only about one-half of \n1 percent. That, of course, is devastating for not just the economy but \nfor job creation, for businesses, for families and the like.\n  The second recent report of the CBO just came out. It is a report \nthat talks about the surging debt of the United States Government and \ntalks about the probability of sudden fiscal crisis. So we have a \ncombination of the potential for going back into recession, combined \nwith the probability of sudden fiscal crisis because of the amount of \ndebt the Federal Government is taking on.\n  Because this second report just came out, let me refer to some things \nthat have been said about that, primarily in the Wall Street Journal in \na piece on June 5 called ``Obama's Debt Boom.'' I will just quote a few \nlines from this editorial in the Wall Street Journal. It says:\n\n       The CBO's long-term budget outlook notes that Federal debt \n     held by the public--\n\n  That is the part we have to pay back--\n\n     will surge to 70 percent of the economy by the end of this \n     year.\n\n  Which is the highest in the history of the country except during \nWorld War II.\n  I think that is about $49,000 or $50,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States. They point out that under the present trend \nthe debt will hit 90 percent of GDP by 2022. Then it balloons to 109 \npercent by 2026.\n  What does this mean in practical terms? Here is a quotation from the \nWall Street Journal about the CBO projection:\n\n       We have never been deficit scolds, preferring to focus on \n     the more important policy priorities of economic growth and \n     spending restraint. But the Obama era is taking America to a \n     place it has never been. Inside of a decade the country will \n     have a debt-to-GDP ratio well into the 90 percent to 100 \n     percent danger zone where economists say the economy begins \n     to slow and risks mount.\n       CBO notes . . . that this level of debt increase increases \n     the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis, during which \n     investors would lose confidence in the government's ability \n     to manage its budget and the government would thereby lose \n     its ability to borrow at affordable rates.\n       How bad is it? In the absolute worst-case scenario, CBO \n     says debt would exceed 250 percent of GDP in 2035. At that \n     point, CBO's economic model breaks, because so much debt is \n     so far outside ``historical experience'' and the CBO's \n     ``assumptions might no longer be valid.''\n\n  That is where we are headed if we don't do something about it.\n  Interestingly, what CBO assumed in order to reach these conclusions \nis that tax collections would continue to hold to the post-1972 \nhistorical average of 18 percent of GDP. The point is we are not \ntalking about raising taxes in order to effect this. They are assuming \nwe will have revenues of a historical level of 18 percent of GDP. The \nproblem is not the tax collections; in other words, the problem is the \nexcess spending. They point out that, of course, excess spending is \nprimarily a factor of the entitlement programs--Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. They point out that the biggest of all those is \nin Medicare.\n  Then the Wall Street Journal concludes this way:\n\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\n\n       This is where the tax burden comes in, and on that score \n     CBO admits that ``to the extent that additional tax revenues \n     were generated by boosting marginal tax rates--\n\n  This is what President Obama proposed, remember--\n\n     those ``higher tax rates would discourage people from working \n     and saving, further reducing output and income.'' So even the \n     Keynesians who dominate CBO admit that there are costs in \n     lower growth . . .\n\n  If they raise tax rates as the President has proposed.\n  This is, in effect, the most predictable crisis in history. So we \nhave the combination of the CBO report talking about the fiscal cliff--\nwhat happens if both the sequestration and the automatic tax increases \ngo into effect--combined with the most recent report about the debt, \nand we can see the United States is headed for a disaster without \nintervention by the Congress and the President.\n  Just one thing. The Director of CBO put it this way:\n\n       The explosive path of Federal debt . . . underscores the \n     need for large and timely policy changes to put the Federal \n     Government on a sustainable fiscal course.\n\n  What has the President and the Democratic majority in the Senate \nsuggested? We turned to Jay Carney, who had a press conference Monday. \nHe is the spokesman for the President. He said that ``the President is \ncontinuing to work with his team on potential new ideas.''\n  I would like for him to work with the Congress because we have had a \nlot of ideas. The House of Representatives passed almost 30 bills that \ndeal with this, and they range all the way from the Keystone Pipeline, \nwhich immediately puts 20,000 people to work, easing environmental \nregulations, offshore oil exploration, and so on. So we would love to \nhave him work with the Congress, rather than this anemic to-do list he \nhas proposed, which, obviously, would not provide any relief.\n  The bottom line is that as was reported in a story by the Associated \nPress, by Andrew Taylor, I think. As he said, after talking about the \nbills passed by the House of Representatives: ``Democrats will try to \nstop Republicans from forcing a vote on it in the Senate.''\n  What he is talking about is the vote the House of Representatives \nintends to have before long that would extend the current Tax Code, so \nthere is certainty in tax rates, and businesses and families don't have \nto worry about this $4.5 trillion tax increase. The Democrats will try \nto stop Republicans from forcing a vote on it in the Senate.\n  Why would the Democratic leader not want to have a vote on whether to \nextend the current tax rates as opposed to having an increase in taxes \nof $4.5 trillion? Actually, there are a lot of folks--leaders in the \nPresident's party, people who have worked with him--who have said it \nwould be a good idea to extend those tax cuts. In fact, the President \nhimself said so when he extended them for 2 years, along with the \nsupport from Congress, on December 1 year ago. He said not to do so \nwould harm economic growth. He was exactly right then, and he is right \nnow.\n  As a matter of fact, we had a better GDP growth back then than we do \nnow. If that would have been harmful then, it would be more harmful \nnow. His belief then is adhered to by people who have worked with him \nand former leaders. For example, former Democratic President Bill \nClinton suggested Tuesday--yesterday--that Congress temporarily extend \nall the Bush-era tax cuts. That includes the tax cuts for the wealthy. \nRemember, the Bush tax cuts applied across the board. They applied to \neverybody. The President has said that is fine but not for the wealthy.\n  What President Clinton said is, no, the best thing would be for all \nof those tax cuts to be extended. I will quote what the former \nPresident said:\n\n       What I think we need to do is to find some way to avoid the \n     fiscal cliff, to avoid doing anything that would contract the \n     economy now.\n\n  He was asked if that meant extending tax cuts, and he said:\n\n       They will probably have to put everything off until early \n     next year. That's probably the best thing to do right now.\n\n  Then the President's former adviser, who is an economics professor, \nLarry Summers, said today that Congress should temporarily extend the \nBush-era tax cuts. He said:\n\n       The real risk to this economy is on the side of slowdown . \n     . . and that means we've got to make sure that we don't take \n     gasoline out of the tank at the end of this year.\n\n  He said that on MSNBC's ``Morning Joe'' program. He said: ``That's \ngotta be the top priority.''\n  So here you have Larry Summers, former adviser to President Clinton \non economic matters, and former President Bill Clinton, both of whom \nhave said we need to extend these tax policies today in order to avoid \nfurther damage to our economy tomorrow--exactly what the President \nhimself said when these tax rates were extended a year and a half ago.\n  I just note this from another Associated Press story regarding the \ncomments by President Clinton. As they say:\n\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and others have \n     warned that letting both events occur--\n\n  That is to say, the sequestration and the automatic tax increases--\n\n     would suck so much out of the economy that it could spark a \n     renewed recession next year.\n\n  That is when they refer to the statement of President Clinton that we \nneed to find a way to avoid that fiscal cliff and that would include \nextending the tax cuts.\n  The reality is we have somewhat of a consensus beginning to develop \nthat it would be a wise thing for the country to retain current tax \npolicies and not allow this big tax increase, to avoid the sequester or \nthe across-the-board cuts that otherwise would affect both defense and \nnondefense; and if we don't do those things, according to CBO, the \nnonpartisan office that advises the Congress, we are likely to go back \ninto a recession with growth that would be only one-half of 1 percent \nof our GDP next year.\n  Let me conclude by referring to another article in the Wall Street \nJournal, dated June 5, entitled ``Defense Chiefs Signal Job Cuts.''\n  Here we are talking about the employers of people in the defense \nindustries that are predicting that if we don't do something about \nsequester, they are going to have to begin laying off people. The \narticle begins with this quotation:\n\n       U.S. defense contractors are preparing to disclose mass job \n     cutbacks ahead of November elections if Congress fails to \n     reach a deficit-reduction deal by then, industry officials \n     said.\n\n  One of the people quoted is Robert Stevens, chairman of Lockheed \nMartin, a big contractor with the Defense Department. He said:\n\n       It is quite possible that we will need to notify employees \n     in the September and October timeframe that they may or may \n     not have a job in January, depending upon whether \n     sequestration does or doesn't take effect.\n\n  One of the reasons is a Federal law that requires employers to \nprovide this notice--the Worker Adjustment and Retaining and \nNotification Act, known as the WARN Act, which requires companies to \nnotify employees in advance of mass layoffs or plant closings--if they \nhave more than 50 or more employees, for example. One thing Mr. Stevens \nsaid is that it doesn't just affect the big companies such as his but \nalso all these suppliers, people who have to provide the pieces or \ncomponents of products that they end up putting together. They would \nhave to be notified because they are not going to have subcontracts \nnext year.\n  One of the industry officials said sequestration is already here. \nWhat he meant by that was the reality is that businesses are having to \nmake decisions now. This talk in the Senate about we will somehow be \nable to deal with this in the lameduck session after the election is \nsimply not true. I suggest to my colleagues in the House and in the \nSenate that if we try to wait until after the election, I think our \nconstituents, knowing what is happening--some of whom will probably \nhave gotten job notices that they may be subject to termination because \nof the automatic across-the-board cuts, known as sequester--I think \nthey may be sending a message to us this fall and, therefore, it \nbehooves us to act before rather than after the fact.\n  There has been talk today about what the Wisconsin recall election \nmeant. I think one thing it must have meant is that people may complain \nabout some of the decisions that are made when there are tough \ndecisions, but they want people who are elected to do something about \nthe problems, to act, have some courage, tackle the\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\ntough problems. Even if they don't totally agree with the solutions, I \nthink they respect political leaders who are willing to do that. Scott \nWalker, the Governor of Wisconsin, took a lot of heat, but he took the \nbull by the horns and tried to solve a problem and, as a result of the \nthings they were able to do, the fiscal situation in Wisconsin is much \nbetter than had they not taken those actions.\n  That is what we in Congress need to learn. The people understand we \nhave a big debt crisis facing us, which is confirmed by the \nCongressional Budget Office. They understand there is a huge risk of \nanother recession because of the twin problems of the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of the country coming our way January 1 and \nthis sequestration that also occurs on January 1. They would like us to \ndo something about that. I think what they resent is politicians saying \nafter the election we will take it up and begin thinking about it. \nFirst of all, that is too late for a lot of people whose jobs depend \nupon it, and it makes for a very inefficient way of running the \ngovernment.\n  Secondly, I think political leaders owe their constituents the ideas \nthey would like to put into effect. We don't wait and hide the ball \nfrom our constituents, refusing to tell them what we think until after \nthe election. The idea of a democratic republic is people stand for \noffice by saying: This is what I would do to solve our problems. Do you \nlike it or not? If the voters say, yes, we think that is a good idea, \nthey elect us and expect us to follow through on it. If they don't like \nour ideas, they elect the other person. But if we hide the ball and say \nwe are not going to take votes in the Senate because we don't want to \nput Members on record because then the voters might know what they are \nthinking and they might not like it and not elect them, that is \nobviously a lack of political courage. It also runs counter to what the \nfundamental concept of elections is all about.\n  I suggest that what we ought to do is tackle these two issues now, \nnot wait until after the election. Legislation has been introduced in \nboth the House and the Senate to find a way to save the $109 billion \nthat needs to be saved in order to avoid the sequester for next \nyear. This process will have to be undergone, undertaken, every year \nfor the next 10 years because we have promised the voters we would save \na total of $1.2 trillion.\n\n  So how will we do it next year? Well, there are any number of ways. \nSenators McCain, Ayotte, myself, Chambliss, Graham, and Cornyn, and \nsome others have introduced legislation that says, well, here is a way \nyou can save the $109 billion next year: Get half of it by simply \nextending the President's own pay freeze for many Federal employees \nthrough the middle of 2014, and the other half, instead of replacing \nevery single Federal worker who retires or leaves the Federal \nworkforce, only replace two out of the three.\n  Everybody talks about how wonderful the recommendations of the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission were. Well, the Simpson-Bowles Commission \nrecommended hiring one new Federal employee for every three who leave \nthe workplace. We double that. We say, well, let's hire two of the \nthree back. The combination of just those two things would result in \nsaving $109 billion.\n  If you don't like that way to save money, there are many other ways \nto do so, and there are revenues from the sale of Federal property, for \nexample, that could also be put on the table. So there are many ways to \ndo this. But let's get about it.\n  Why aren't we doing it? Well, the majority leader and the President \nsay the only way they would consider doing this is if we also raise a \nbunch of taxes, and their wonderful idea about raising taxes is a tax \non millionaires. Here is the problem with that. The very people we want \nto create the jobs are the businesspeople who pay these taxes.\n  According to President Obama's Secretary of the Treasury, that \nDepartment says 80 percent of the people who would be subject to this \nmillionaires' tax are business owners--the very people who need the \nmoney to hire the workers to put the economy back in good shape.\n  When Senator Lindsey Graham asked Defense Secretary Panetta: Wouldn't \nsequestration be like shooting ourselves in the foot, he said: No, \nSenator, it would be like shooting ourselves in the head.\n  I submit that raising taxes on the exact people to whom we are \nlooking to create jobs is the same thing. That is the reason \nRepublicans have said that is the wrong way to come up with this $109 \nbillion.\n  The whole idea of the Budget Control Act was to control spending, not \nto raise taxes. Since there are so many ways in which this government's \n$3 trillion-plus budget can save money, I don't think we have to turn \nto something that would itself have a negative impact on economic \ngrowth; namely, raising taxes. So that has been the reason this hasn't \nbeen taken up.\n  One side insists we have to raise taxes in order to deal with this \nsequestration problem. The other side says: No, we don't have to do \nthat at all. Let's sit down and work together and find a resolution for \nthis problem, and let's get it done before the end of the year. At that \npoint it is too late for a lot of people who will have lost their jobs.\n  By the way, some of these industry people have told us some of the \nsole-source suppliers or subcontractors would probably end up taking \nbankruptcy because their orders could not be filled due to the \nuncertainty that a contract was there. So we could have a great deal of \ndamage to the economy.\n  In fact, the estimate is--if sequestration or across-the-board cuts \noccur--in the Defense industry alone we are talking about 1 million \njobs lost. Remember how many jobs were created last month? I think it \nwas 69,000 jobs were created last month. Compare that to losing 1 \nmillion jobs, and you can see the significance of what the \nCongressional Budget Office was talking about. This is a fiscal cliff.\n  We cannot allow sequestration to occur, and we cannot allow these big \ntax increases to occur without understanding the damage that will do to \nthe economy. They said it is going to put us back in a recession. That \nis before the report they just released on the increasing debt burden \nof this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, the evidence is here. \nLeaders such as former President Clinton and economist Larry Summers \nand, of course, many other economists have said the best thing to do is \nto keep the tax rates where they are. Don't raise them. Resolve this \nsequestration issue so we don't have that hanging over our heads, and \nthen look for other ways to boost job growth and economic productivity. \nThat is the way to get out of the recession. That is the way to help \nfamilies. Ironically, at the end of the day, a growing economy, \nproducing more wealth, produces more tax revenues for the Federal \nGovernment, and that helps us deal with the big debt we have \naccumulated.\n  So I think everybody agrees economic growth is ultimately the best \nway to get out of the government's fiscal problem. But it also, of \ncourse, is precisely the way for businesses and families to prosper.\n  I hope colleagues in both the House and Senate--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--can see their way clear to respond to this crisis--this \nutterly predictable crisis--and to deal with this problem sooner rather \nthan later, exercising the courage our constituents would like to have \nus exercise and thereby representing them in the way they deserve to be \nrepresented.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the 2012 \nfarm bill and the importance of moving forward with this important \nlegislation.\n  First, I wish to acknowledge the incredibly hard work of Chairwoman \nStabenow and Ranking Member Roberts and their commitment to producing a \nbipartisan bill that cleared the Agriculture Committee this April with \na strong bipartisan vote.\n  The Agriculture Committee is a successful model of how we can work\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nacross the aisle on tough problems to get work done. It always has \nbeen. This cooperative effort was not on a small or merely symbolic \nissue but on a major piece of legislation that impacts every single \nAmerican. Throughout the process, this committee has faced \nunprecedented budget challenges, as has our country, but under \nChairwoman Stabenow's leadership, the committee has worked together on \na bill that makes tough choices, works within a budget to provide $23 \nbillion in deficit reduction, and preserves the core programs that are \nimportant for Minnesota and other States across the country.\n  I believe this carefully crafted bill finds a good balance between a \nnumber of priorities, and I urge Members of the Senate to continue to \nwork together in the same spirit that was exemplified in the \nAgriculture Committee to complete work on this bill as quickly as \npossible.\n  I have spent the last year going all around our State; I have talked \nto farmers and businesses across Minnesota. No matter where I go, I am \nalways reminded of the critical role farming plays in our State's \neconomy. We are 21st in the country for population, but we are 6th in \nthe country for agriculture. It is our State's leading export, \naccounting for $75 billion in economic activity and supporting more \nthan 300,000 jobs. It is one of the major reasons our unemployment rate \nis at 5.6 percent--significantly better than the national average--and \nthat is because we have had consistent farm policy coming out of this \nChamber, out of Washington, DC--and you can't say that in every area of \nindustry--consistent policy coming from the government over the last \ndecade. That must continue because it doesn't just help our farmers on \nthe front line, it feeds into many industries, and it certainly feeds \ninto agricultural exports.\n  Our State is No. 1 in turkeys in the United States of America--a fact \nyou might not have known. We are No. 1 for green peas and sugar beets. \nWe are also home to Jennie-O turkey and Del Monte vegetable processing \nfacilities, just to name a few. We are No. 1 in spring wheat and also \nhome to a rich tradition of milling. We are No. 3 in hogs and soybeans \nand also home to pork processors and biodiesel plants. We are No. 4 in \nthe country for corn and also home to 21 ethanol plants that produce \nover 1 billion gallons of ethanol every single year, and that is one of \nthe major reasons our country has reduced our dependency on foreign oil \nfrom something like 60 percent 5 years ago to the mid-40s now. That is \nan incredible record. It has to do with oil drilling in North Dakota, \nit has to do with better gas mileage in our cars and trucks, but it \nalso has to do with biofuels.\n\n  Minnesotans in rural communities and larger cities all benefit from a \nstrong farm economy that provides jobs on the farms, in mills, and \nprocessing plants, equipment manufacturers--another key export for the \nUnited States of America--and a diverse range of high-tech jobs in \ntoday's modern agriculture. That is why there is so much at stake in \nthis 2012 farm bill and why it is so important for us to finish with a \nstrong and effective bill that gets the job done for America's farmers \nand for our rural economy.\n  It is no secret that during each step of the process, we have been \nworking within a tough budget climate, but that doesn't mean the goal \nof maintaining a strong farm safety net or a safe, nutritious, and \nabundant food supply is any less critical. The last thing we want to do \nis be dependent on foreign food the way we are dependent on foreign \noil--even though we have seen improvement. We do not want that to \nhappen with foreign food.\n  How have we done this to get $23 billion in cuts? The first thing \nthat is important for people to understand who are not from rural \nareas, who are from metro areas--my State has both--or States that are \nmore urban focused is that only 14 percent of this farm bill is farm \nprograms. It could have had a different name, but a lot of people call \nit the farm bill. It is only 14 percent. The rest is conservation, \nnutrition programs, school lunches--you name it. While only 14 percent \nof the farm bill is farm programs, nearly two-thirds of the cuts over \nlast year are on that 14 percent. Nearly two-thirds of the $23 billion \nin cuts--nearly $16 billion--is cut from farm programs, which are only \n14 percent of the farm bill.\n  I heard from many producers in Minnesota as we dealt with how we are \ngoing to get rid of direct payments I have long advocated. We had huge \nfloor fights last time on some reform to the farm payment system. I \nthought we needed to make some changes there and get that number down \nin terms of the money that can be spent in the income, but now we have \nactually eliminated direct payments. So that is why the crop insurance \npart of this bill becomes even more important.\n  The bill also continues the Sugar Program, which is important to our \ncountry--tens of thousands of jobs across the country, tens of \nthousands of jobs in the Red River Valley in Minnesota and North \nDakota--and also helps to ensure that we have a strong domestic sugar \nindustry.\n  The bill also simplifies the commodity programs by eliminating a \nnumber of programs and replacing them with the Agriculture Risk \nCoverage Program which complements crop insurance by providing \nprotection against multiyear price declines.\n  The bill also protects the conservation programs we need. It helps \nour agricultural producers keep our soil healthy and our water clean. \nOur State is No. 5 in the Conservation Reserve Program, No. 3 in the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, and No. 1 in the Conservation \nStewardship Program. Specifically, I have worked to ensure that local \ncommunities also have the tools they need to address conservation \nchallenges. Conservation groups, from Ducks Unlimited to Pheasants \nForever, know how important the farm bill is, and that is why over 640 \nconservation groups are supporting the committee's work on the farm \nbill.\n  The committee-passed farm bill also preserves the essential nutrition \nprograms that millions of families and children rely on every day. \nImportantly, this bill avoids the radical cuts to nutrition programs \nand school lunches that would have been proposed in other budgets.\n  This bill also includes a number of amendments that I authored, \nincluding an amendment that will help beginning farmers and ranchers \nbetter manage their risk and access land as they get a start in \nagriculture. We need to make sure that we have a next generation of \nfarmers and ranchers, that it just does not end here.\n  Beginning farmers face big obstacles, including limited access to \ncredit and technical assistance and, of course, the high price of land. \nDuring committee markup, I introduced an amendment with Senator Baucus \nthat helps beginning farmers purchase crop insurance by increasing \ntheir help 10 percent for the first 5 years. I believe that people who \ngrow our food deserve to know their livelihoods cannot be swept away in \nthe blink of an eye, either by market failures or by natural disaster. \nThat is why strengthening crop insurance for our beginning farmers is a \npriority.\n  I also worked to include an amendment--with Senators Johanns, Baucus, \nand Hoeven--to allow beginning producers to use CRP acres for grazing \nwithout a penalty. I believe this will go a long way, again, in \nbuilding the next generation of farmers.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher \nOpportunity Act, which was introduced by Senator Harkin, I also fought \nfor the mentoring and outreach provisions for new farmers and training \nin business planning and credit-building--the skills they need to \nsucceed and stay on the land.\n  Homegrown renewable fuels have helped us reduce our share of \ndependence on liquid fuels. I believe we can continue this trend. As I \nmentioned, we have seen an enormous shift in our dependence on foreign \noil. Much of that has to do with biofuels, now 10 percent of our fuel \nsupply in this country, as we work to make it more and more fuel \nefficient, use less water, transition to cellulosic. What we do know is \nthat we should be focusing on the workers and the farmers of the \nMidwest and not the cartels of the Mideast. That is what helped reduce \nour foreign oil dependency in the last few years, as well as the \ndrilling I mentioned before.\n  I also cosponsored the amendment introduced by Senators Conrad and \nLugar to provide funding for the energy title. This is key in this farm \nbill.\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n  I know we have all heard from farmers and ranchers in our States \nabout the importance of passing a 5-year farm bill. Think about the \nwork that is done in Congress. Every business says: We need a longer \ntime period, we need consistency for our tax credits, and we need to \nknow what is happening. This is one area where we have actually done \nit. We have done this with the farm bill over the last decade. The last \ntwo farm bills with 5-year windows have been fairly consistent. We have \nan opportunity to do it again and still save $23 billion on the budget, \nstill make sure those nutrition programs are there for our kids, still \nmake sure the most vulnerable among us can be fed and not go hungry, \nand still make sure those vital conservation programs are there for \nthis country.\n  There is a reason agriculture has been able to keep its head above \nwater in these difficult times. A lot of it has to do with consistent \npolicies. That is one of my main messages to my colleagues. We have one \nof the stars in terms of exports coming out of this farm bill. That is \none of the main reasons it is so important, because we not only are \ngrowing food for the people of this country, we are feeding the world, \nand we are keeping the jobs in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                            U.S. Innovation\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it was a pleasure to hear the Senator \nfrom Minnesota speak on the farm bill. I congratulate Senator Roberts \nand Senator Stabenow for their hard work, as well as the Senator from \nMinnesota. I would like to take 10 minutes to speak on a related \nmatter.\n  American agriculture is an area where we lead the world with \ninnovation. I want to talk about innovation of a different type, and I \nwant to refer specifically to a May 20 column in the New York Times by \nThomas Friedman that caught my attention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Mr. Friedman's \ncolumn be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. Friedman said he had just returned from Seattle, \nwhere he saw a stunning amount of innovation. He said it filled him \nboth with exhilaration and with dread. The question is, Is the United \nStates prepared to deal with the innovation we may be seeing around the \nworld over the next decade?\n  Yesterday I heard Robert Zoellick, the retiring President of the \nWorld Bank, brief a number of us about the problems we are going to \nhave at the end of the year and whether the U.S. Congress and President \ncan rise to the challenge of governing so we can show the rest of the \nworld we are capable of that. Mr. Zoellick says he travels a lot--that \nis an understatement given his reputation and the jobs he's held over \nthe last 20 years--and he said that two-thirds of global growth over \nthe last 10 years has come from developing countries and that advanced \ncountries, such as Japan, and Europe and, to some extent, the United \nStates have been stagnant or drifting. Mr. Friedman's column says that \nwe should try to remember the things that made us great and preserve as \nmany of those as we can. He said we need a plan, and then he suggested \nwhat he called a magic combination: No. 1, immigration of high-IQ risk-\ntakers, as he called them; No. 2, government-funded research; and No. \n3, cutting-edge higher education. That was the plan. That was the magic \ncombination.\n  He said:\n\n       This is not a call to ignore hard budget choices we have to \n     make. It's a call to make sure that we give education, \n     immigration and research their proper place in the \n     discussion.\n\n  My purpose as a Senator, as a Republican Senator, is to say that I \nbelieve he is exactly right. No. 1, I believe that is the right plan--\nor at least the beginning of it; No. 2, I believe there is more going \non in the direction that he recommended than most people know; and No. \n3, I believe that finishing the work on what needs to be done to \nimplement the plan he outlined is perfectly obvious and well within our \ngrasp. Let's take the ideas one by one.\n  First, the idea, as he called it, of immigration of high-IQ risk-\ntakers--we call this ``pin the green card on the STEM graduate.'' This \nidea is supported, I would judge, by most Members of the Senate. Each \nyear 50,000 of the brightest students in the world are attracted to our \ngreat universities' graduate programs in science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics, and then each year we send 17,000 of those \ngraduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics back \nhome. We make them go home so they can create jobs in the countries \nthey came from rather than in the United States.\n  A number of us have introduced legislation to change that. It came \nfrom a recommendation from legislation called America COMPETES, which \npassed first in 2007 and was reauthorized in 2010. This was legislation \nsponsored by the Democratic and Republican leaders that had 35 \nRepublican sponsors and 35 Democratic sponsors, and it included the 20 \nthings a distinguished group told us we should do as a Congress to help \nAmerica compete in the next generation. We have done two-thirds of \nthem. One of the priorities was to double the federal funding for \ngeneral scientific research over 10 years, and we've made some good \nprogress in that direction.\n  Part of the unfinished agenda is the idea in America COMPETES of \npinning a green card on the science, technology, engineering, and \nmanagement graduate. There are at least six proposals before the Senate \ntoday--one sponsored by Senator Coons and myself, one by Senator \nCornyn, one by Senator Coons and Senator Rubio, another by Senators \nWarner and Moran. Senators Coons, Rubio, Warner, and Moran have another \none. Senator Bennet has yet another one. Many of us say: Let's go ahead \nand pin the green card on the high-IQ risk-taker and let those men and \nwomen create jobs here in the United States when they graduate.\n  What should we do about it? Stop insisting that we need to pass every \nsingle aspect of the immigration law at one time and go ahead and pass \nthis one bill; realize that we can do some things better in the Senate \nstep by step.\n  The second idea, advanced research--it is hard to think of a major \ninnovation in the biology or sciences that doesn't have some aspect--\nhas not had some support from government-sponsored research since World \nWar II. Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow tells us that half our \neconomic growth since World War II has come from these technological \nadvances. Maybe one of the best examples is unconventional gas--we call \nit shale gas. It has been around for a century. A lot of people have \nbeen trying to do it, but even Mitchell Energy, the people who stuck it \nout in advanced shale gas, said it couldn't have happened without the \nDepartment of Energy and it could not have happened without the \ninvention of 3 D drilling from Sandia National Laboratory.\n  Yesterday I visited with the head of what we call ARPA-E. Most of us \nknow about a little organization called DARPA, which has been around \nfor 50 years in the Department of Defense. Out of it has come such \nthings as the Internet, stealth technology--a whole series of major \ninnovations that affect the lives of people every day. So the idea was, \nlet's try that in the Department of Energy. That came out of America \nCOMPETES as well. ARPA-E takes promising ideas, brings them into the \ngovernment, funds them for 3 years, and then spits them out again into \nthe marketplace to see if they can survive. In other words, it is the \nkind of government-applied research that most of us can support. It had \nthe support of 35 Democrats and 35 Republicans.\n  Yesterday I was briefed on just three of their innovations.\n  One company has doubled the density of a battery, a lithium battery. \nThat means an electric car, for example, could go twice as far with a \nbattery or it could go the same distance with a battery that costs half \nas much and weighs half as much.\n  A second idea was a laser drill for geothermal. The laser drilling \nprecedes the normal drill and can do remarkable things, which will \nprobably make a massive difference in exploration for oil and gas over \ntime. Then a third, which I would describe as the holy grail of energy \nadvanced research, is\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\nthe idea of taking carbon, such as that which comes from coal plants, \nand turning it into something that can be used commercially. Think of \nthe difference that could make for our country if we were able to find \na way to do that.\n\n  There is a promising way to do that in ARPA-E, which is to take what \nthey call ``bugs,'' a biologic solution, apply it to electrodes, and \nturn it into oil. So this may work or it may not work in a commercial \nsense, but this is the kind of amazing research they are doing.\n  What do we do about that? I would suggest that all we have to do is \ndouble clean energy research, a sort of Manhattan Project for these \nkinds of ideas, and pay for it by reducing the permanent subsidies for \nother energy programs, whether they are Big Oil or Big Wind.\n  Finally, the third idea of Mr. Friedman is one I have talked about \nfor years, and that has to do with the effect of Medicaid mandates on \npublic higher education. He puts it this way, that the State \ngovernments ``medicate, educate, and incarcerate.'' The courts tell the \nStates they have to spend this much on prisons, and we in the Federal \nGovernment tell the States they have to spend this much on Medicaid. \nThere is nothing left for education, and the various orders to States \ntoday are ruining public higher education by driving up tuition, \ndriving up loans, and hurting what I believe is America's secret weapon \nin our technological future.\n  What to do about that? End the Medicaid mandates. Let the Governors \nand legislators decide how to spend money. I guarantee if they do, they \nwill come closer than when I was Governor of Tennessee and we paid 70 \npercent of the cost of a student's education and the student paid 30 \npercent. Today it is the reverse. The State pays 30 percent and the \nstudent pays 70 percent.\n  The students are protesting at the University of California because \nthe State has cut $1 billion from what is probably the greatest public \nuniversity in the world over the last 3 or 4 years. They probably have \nno idea the reason for that is Medicaid mandates from Washington that \nsoak up the money that otherwise would go to keep tuition low and the \nquality high at the University of California.\n  My purpose in coming to the Senate floor is simply to say, first, \nthat I think Mr. Friedman is right. He is right on the money. Second, I \nthink more is going on than meets eye; and, third, finishing the job is \nwell within our grasp.\n  We can pass the green card bill and pin the green card on the STEM \ngraduate. There are six different versions before us in the Senate. We \ncan double energy research and pay for it by reducing wasteful \nsubsidies, and we can end Medicaid mandates and give our colleges and \nuniversities and community colleges a chance to prosper again and \ncreate the kind of future we want. That is the plan for the kind of \ninnovation we need in America.\n  I salute Mr. Friedman for suggesting it, but I hope the rest of the \ncountry will recognize that in all three cases the Senate is headed in \nexactly that direction with legislation that we have already passed or \nintroduced. I hope that on both sides of the aisle we will work \ntogether to finish the job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following Mr. Friedman's \narticle, an article I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, which was \npublished on Wednesday, May 16, 2012, and talks about the damaging \neffects of Washington mandates for Medicaid on State governments and \nhow it is damaging public higher education, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 19, 2012]\n\n                    Do You Want the Good News First?\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       I've spent the last week traveling to two of America's \n     greatest innovation hubs--Silicon Valley and Seattle--and the \n     trip left me feeling a combination of exhilaration and dread. \n     The excitement comes from not only seeing the stunning amount \n     of innovation emerging from the ground up, but from seeing \n     the new tools coming on stream that are, as Amazon.com's \n     founder, Jeff Bezos, put it to me, ``eliminating all the \n     gatekeepers''--making it easier and cheaper than ever to \n     publish your own book, start your own company and chase your \n     own dream. Never have individuals been more empowered, and \n     we're still just at the start of this trend.\n       ``I see the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere,'' said \n     Bezos. Thanks to cloud computing for the masses, anyone \n     anywhere can for a tiny hourly fee now rent the most powerful \n     computing and storage facilities on Amazon's ``cloud'' to \n     test any algorithm or start any company or publish any book. \n     Start-ups can even send all their inventory to Amazon, and it \n     will do all the fulfillment and delivery--and even gift wrap \n     your invention before shipping it to your customers.\n       This is leading to an explosion of new firms and voices. \n     ``Sixteen of the top 100 best sellers on Kindle today were \n     self-published,'' said Bezos. That means no agent, no \n     publisher, no paper--just an author, who gets most of the \n     royalties, and Amazon and the reader. It is why, Bezos adds, \n     the job of the company leader now is changing fast: ``You \n     have to think of yourself not as a designer but as a \n     gardener'' seeding, nurturing, inspiring, cultivating the \n     ideas coming from below, and then making sure people execute \n     them.\n       The leading companies driving this trend--Amazon, Facebook, \n     Microsoft, Google, Apple, LinkedIn, Zynga and Twitter--are \n     all headquartered and listed in America. Facebook, which \n     didn't exist nine years ago, just went public at a valuation \n     of nearly $105 billion--two weeks after buying a company for \n     $1 billion, Instagram, which didn't exist 18 months ago. So \n     why any dread?\n       It's because we're leaving an era of some 50 years' \n     duration in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a \n     college president was, on balance, to give things away to \n     people; and we're entering an era--no one knows for how \n     long--in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a \n     college president will be, on balance, to take things away \n     from people. And if we don't make this transition in a really \n     smart way--by saying, ``Here are the things that made us \n     great, that spawned all these dynamic companies''--and make \n     sure that we're preserving as much of that as we can, this \n     trend will not spread as it should. Maybe we could grow as a \n     country without a plan. But we dare not cut without a plan. \n     We can really do damage. I can lose weight quickly if I cut \n     off both arms, but it will surely reduce my job prospects.\n       What we must preserve is that magic combination of cutting-\n     edge higher education, government-funded research and \n     immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers. They are, in \n     combination, America's golden goose, laying all these eggs in \n     Seattle and Silicon Valley. China has it easy right now. It \n     just needs to do the jobs that we have already invented, just \n     more cheaply. America has to invent the new jobs--and that \n     requires preserving the goose.\n       Microsoft still does more than 80 percent of its research \n     work in America. But that is becoming harder and harder to \n     sustain when deadlock on Capitol Hill prevents it from \n     acquiring sufficient visas for the knowledge workers it needs \n     that America's universities are not producing enough of. The \n     number of filled jobs at Microsoft went up this year from \n     40,000 to 40,500 at its campus outside Seattle, yet its list \n     of unfilled jobs went from 4,000 to almost 5,000. Eventually, \n     it will have no choice but to shift more research to other \n     countries.\n       It is terrifying to see how budget-cutting in California is \n     slowly reducing what was once one of the crown jewels of \n     American education--the University of California system--to a \n     shadow of its old self. And I fear the cutting is just \n     beginning. As one community leader in Seattle remarked to me, \n     governments basically do three things: ``Medicate, educate \n     and incarcerate.'' And various federal and state mandates \n     outlaw cuts in medicating and incarcerating, so much of the \n     money is coming out of educating. Unfortunately, even to \n     self-publish, you still need to know how to write. The same \n     is happening to research. A new report just found that \n     federal investment in biomedical research through the \n     National Institutes of Health has decreased almost every year \n     since 2003.\n       When we shrink investments in higher education and \n     research, ``we shoot ourselves in both feet,'' remarked K.R. \n     Sridhar, founder of Bloom Energy, the Silicon Valley fuel-\n     cell company. ``Our people become less skilled, so you are \n     shooting yourself in one foot. And the smartest people from \n     around the world have less reason to come here for the \n     quality education, so you are shooting yourself in the other \n     foot.''\n       The Labor Department reported two weeks ago that even with \n     our high national unemployment rate, employers advertised \n     3.74 million job openings in March. That is, in part, about a \n     skills mismatch. In an effort to overcome that, and help fill \n     in the financing gap for higher education in Washington \n     State, Boeing and Microsoft recently supported a plan whereby \n     the state, which was cutting funding to state universities \n     but also not letting them raise tuition, would allow the \n     colleges to gradually raise rates and the two big companies \n     would each kick in $25 million for scholarships for students \n     wanting to study science and technology or health care to \n     ensure that they have the workers they need.\n       This is not a call to ignore the hard budget choices we \n     have to make. It's a call to make sure that we give \n     education, immigration and research their proper place in the \n     discussion.\n       ``Empowering the individual and underinvesting in the \n     collective is our great macro danger as a society,'' said the \n     pollster Craig\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\n     Charney. Indeed, it is. Investment in our collective \n     institutions and opportunities is the only way to mitigate \n     the staggering income inequalities that can arise from a \n     world where Facebook employees can become billionaires \n     overnight, while the universities that produce them are asked \n     to slash billions overnight. As I've said, nations that don't \n     invest in the future tend not to do well there.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n       [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2012]\n\n                Time for a Medicaid-Education Grand Swap\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       Staring down steep tuition hikes, students at the \n     University of California have taken to carrying picket signs. \n     As far as I can tell, though, none has demanded that \n     President Barack Obama accept a Grand Swap that could protect \n     their education while saving them money. Allow me to explain.\n       When I was governor of Tennessee in the early 1980s, I \n     traveled to meet with President Ronald Reagan in the Oval \n     Office and offer that Grand Swap: Medicaid for K 12 \n     education. The federal government would take over 100% of \n     Medicaid, the federal healthcare program mainly for low-\n     income Americans, and states would assume all responsibility \n     for the nation's 100,000 public schools. Reagan liked the \n     idea, but it went nowhere.\n       If we had made that swap in 1981, states would have come \n     out ahead, keeping $13.2 billion in Medicaid spending and \n     giving $8.7 billion in education spending back to Washington. \n     Today, states would have about $92 billion a year in extra \n     funds, as they'd keep the $149 billion they're now spending \n     on Medicaid and give back to Washington the $57 billion that \n     the federal government spends per year on schools.\n       This trade would get at the heart of the problem with \n     today's rising cost of college education: the policies that \n     Washington has dreamed up and then handed off to the states \n     to implement, costs and all. Chief among them: Medicaid.\n       When I was governor and we were allotting state tax money \n     for roads, schools, state agencies and the like, we'd have to \n     choose between spending on Medicaid or public higher \n     education. When states are forced to spend more of their \n     limited tax dollars on Medicaid, that usually means they \n     spend less on education.\n       Last year in Tennessee, Medicaid funding was up 16% while \n     state support for higher education was down 15%. As a result, \n     tuition and fees at public four-year universities rose more \n     than 7%.\n       At Tennessee Tech University, state funding has dropped 30% \n     over the last three years--and the picture is not much \n     different at other universities and community colleges \n     throughout the nation.\n       In addition to saving states money, this Grand Swap could \n     help improve the quality of education, both in colleges and K \n     12.\n       Because of the funding crunch, the quality of many of our \n     higher education institutions is in serious jeopardy, and \n     that's putting our nation's future in jeopardy. America's \n     secret weapons in creating jobs since World War II have been \n     innovation, technology and a trained workforce. We not only \n     have the best colleges and universities in the world, we have \n     nearly all of the best.\n       At the K 12 level, federal involvement has done little to \n     improve quality. Federal funding for elementary and secondary \n     education programs has increased by 73% over the past nine \n     years, while student achievement has stayed relatively flat.\n       State and local leaders know best how to create an \n     environment in which students can learn what they need to \n     know to succeed in college and in careers. Decisions on \n     whether schools and teachers are succeeding or failing should \n     be taken away from Washington and given back to state and \n     local governments. While Washington has provided some \n     important advocacy and requirements for better reporting of \n     test scores, most of the initiative for higher standards, \n     better tests, more accountability and more parental choice \n     has come from the states.\n       Then there's the Grand Swap's potential for strengthening \n     Medicaid: A single manager, even if it is the federal \n     government, would operate Medicaid more efficiently because \n     it would be forced to implement the mandates it crafts.\n       So, how about it, Mr. President--a single Grand Swap for \n     the long-term stability of tuition rates, student-loan rates, \n     Medicaid and K 12 education?\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            Aid to Pakistan\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think most Americans remember where they \nwere on 9/11/2001. I was doing eye surgery in Bowling Green, KY. When I \ncame out of surgery, I walked into the patient's room and on the \ntelevision set were the planes crashing into the buildings. My first \nthought was horror. My second thought was concern for my father who was \nin Washington and is a Congressman and lives near the Pentagon. As I \nthought about this, it struck me as so bizarre and hard to believe. But \nI know exactly where I was and remember it vividly today.\n  I think Lucky Penny remembers where she was. Lucky Penny was one of \nthe first female F 16 pilots. She was here in Washington at one of the \nbases, and she was asked to scramble her F 16. After the first two \nplanes crashed, she was asked to intercept United Flight 93, which was \ncoming in from Pennsylvania and thought to be headed toward the White \nHouse. She was asked to scramble a fighter jet with no armaments. They \ndidn't have time to load the armaments and at that time we were not \nprepared and did not have jets already prearmed.\n  Her mission was to take down the plane however she could, which \nprobably meant ramming her jet into the commercial airliner and \nbringing it down. Can you imagine being given this task? She took it \nupon herself and quickly scrambled her jet. The jet had to be scrambled \nin such a fast fashion that there were still things attached to it. \nPeople were trying to dismantle and pull out the gas hose and all the \nappendages to the plane as she was taxiing down the runway. I think she \nwill never forget where she was on 9/11.\n  When SEAL Team 6 infiltrated bin Laden's compound, I think Americans \nwere proud of SEAL Team 6 and proud of our military and proud of what \nthey did to finally get this mass murderer. What happened in the weeks \nleading up to that attack and the attack on the compound by SEAL Team 6 \nwas a doctor in Pakistan who helped us. His name is Dr. Shakil Afridi. \nHe is about the same age as I, and I have a lot of sympathy for him and \nfor his bravery. Doctors are not soldiers. We are taught to heal and to \nhelp, but he thought it was important enough and that bin Laden was a \nbad enough person that he would help America get bin Laden.\n  He set up a vaccination clinic, and they did DNA testing to try to \nprove that bin Laden was in the compound. He risked his life to get \nthis mass murderer. As a consequence though, Pakistan has not treated \nhim very well. The Pakistan Government has put him in prison for 33 \nyears. I find it incredibly insulting that this is coming from an \nostensible ally.\n  I find it troubling that this man who is a hero and should be praised \nand congratulated and rewarded has been sentenced to prison for 33 \nyears. He has been in prison for the last year without trial and \nprobably being tortured. He has lost a significant amount of weight and \nnow he is told he will go to prison for the rest of his life for \nhelping America to catch the mass murderer bin Laden.\n  What I find particularly troubling is that the United States \ncontinues to fund and give money to Pakistan. Over $1 billion of U.S. \ntaxpayer money is sent to Pakistan. It troubles me that we are sending \n$1 billion to a country that imprisons the gentleman, the physician, \nwho was brave enough to help us get bin Laden. It makes no sense.\n  Recently, a committee proposed reducing our foreign aid--the $1 \nbillion--by $33 million. It is 3 percent. I think they will laugh at us \nand keep doing what they are doing. They only understand negotiation \nfrom strength. So what I am proposing, and what I will insist upon in \nthe next few days, is a vote on ending aid to Pakistan unless they free \nDr. Afridi. I think that is the very least they can do. I am also \nasking the U.S. Government to grant him emergency citizenship and to \nhelp his family get over here from Pakistan and to provide them safe \npassage. I think it is the least we can do.\n  We shouldn't reward bad behavior. That is what we have done with \nforeign aid for so many years. It is one thing to talk about aiding or \nassisting your allies, but it is another to aid and assist the people \nwho persistently persecute their own people--people who continue with \nhuman rights abuses.\n  In Pakistan there is a woman named Asia Bibi. She has been accused of \nsaying something about the prophet. She said she didn't do it. It is \ngossip. She is set to be executed in Pakistan.\n  I think Americans should be outraged that 1 billion of your taxpayer \ndollars is being sent to Pakistan, a country that is imprisoning the \nguy who helped us get bin Laden, that is imprisoning a Christian for \nsaying she said some sort of religious blasphemy, and the accusation is \nbasically gossip. I think we should be insulted, not to mention the \nfact that I don't think it works.\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n  Look at the examples throughout the last 30, 40 years of the \ndifferent dictators we have given money to. We gave over $60 billion to \nMubarak, the military dictator of Egypt. He stole a lot of it. He was \none of the richest men in the world. He had some of the largest palaces \nin the world. His kids were enriched also at our expense.\n  Look at Mobutu in Congo. He was given billions of dollars and \nentertained by American leaders. At one time he had seven of the \nlargest palaces in the world, mansions in the United States, mansions \nin Paris that were all paid for with our money. What did his people \nhave? His people didn't have running water or electricity. Even if we \nbelieve in the humanitarian nature of giving money to these countries, \nit is not going to them. We are making rich autocrats richer in Third \nWorld countries, and it is not going to the people of the country. It \nis stolen and skimmed off the top.\n  Look at Mugabe. Mugabe in Zimbabwe tortures his opposition, has \nconfiscated land, has basically run his country into the ground, and we \nhave given him billions of dollars. We can't buy better behavior and we \nshouldn't reward autocrats. Let's not reward folks who torture their \npeople. For goodness' sake, we should not send $1 billion to Pakistan \nwhen they are imprisoning a hero who helped us get bin Laden.\n  My amendment will call for an immediate halt to all aid to Pakistan \nnow. I am asking President Obama not to send one penny to Pakistan \nuntil Dr. Afridi is freed. I am asking that no more money goes there in \nthe future until Dr. Afridi is freed. I think this is the least we can \ndo. I plan on demanding a vote in the Senate, and I hope the American \npeople will pay attention to how their representatives vote. They are \nvoting to send money we don't even have. We are $1 trillion in debt. We \nborrow the money from China and send it to Pakistan. It makes no sense. \nOur infrastructure is crumbling. We have had two bridges collapse in \nKentucky this year. We are struggling for money to pay for our own \ninfrastructure, and we are sending $1 billion to a country that \nimprisons Christians for their beliefs.\n  It has to come to an end. It is going to come to an end one way or \nanother. What I ask is that the Senate step up and support ending this \nmoney being sent to Pakistan and, at the very least, not send any more \nuntil Dr. Afridi is freed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Chair remind me of the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto Calendar No. 415, S. 3240.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The farm bill; is that correct? The Agriculture bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was advised of that, and I wanted to double-check.\n  Three weeks ago we passed a milestone in U.S. agriculture. The U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture celebrated its 150th birthday. I take some \npride in that coming from Illinois because it was President Abraham \nLincoln who created the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He called it \nthe people's department. Among other things, it became a launch pad for \nthe development of the United States. It was during that same period of \nthe Lincoln Presidency that they started the land-grant college system \nas well as the Transcontinental Railroad. These things literally \nsettled and united our great Nation.\n  Since its inception, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has played an \nimportant role supporting farmers, investing in rural communities, \nresearching crops, diseases, production practices, increasing energy \nproduction, and helping to fight poverty.\n  Now the Senate is turning to the debate on the 2012 farm bill that \nwill carry forward the vision of our government's role in agriculture \nfor the next 5 years.\n  While much of the rest of the country has been struggling through a \nrecession, agriculture in America has really remained a bright spot. We \nhave seen record prices and record income in the farm sector.\n  Last year farm revenues reached $98.1 billion. Times are good, but we \ncannot afford to forget for a moment that there is inherent risk in \nfarming--risks that many other business do not face. Droughts, floods, \nwind damage, rain, and pests are just a few of the risks farmers must \ncope with on a year-to-year basis. Because of the nature of these risks \nassociated with farming and the important role farmers play in food \nproduction, the Federal Government, since the days of President \nFranklin Roosevelt, has long provided a safety net to help farmers in \nthe worst of times. But the need for a safety net must be balanced \nevery time we have a farm bill with the realistic appraisal of the risk \nfacing farmers and acknowledging the resources available from the \nFederal Government.\n  The Agriculture Committee, under the leadership of Chairwoman Debbie \nStabenow of Michigan, who has done an extraordinary job with Senator \nRoberts, the ranking Republican, in bringing this bill to the floor, \nand the broader agriculture community deserve credit for stepping up to \nfind savings in this farm bill, to cut subsidies, and to make sure \nthose savings are dedicated toward good programs and deficit reduction. \nThey make real reforms in agricultural programs. The bill on the floor \nis a huge step forward in putting our agriculture policy on the right \ntrack in light of the fiscal challenges we face. It reforms several \ntitles to help producers better manage their risk, makes key \ninvestments in energy and research, ensures programs are in place to \nhelp our rural communities grow, and assists those who need to put food \non the table. It does all this, and, to the credit of the Agriculture \nCommittee, it still manages to save $23 billion over the next 10 years \nagainst what we had projected spending before this bill was introduced.\n  Gone are the outdated direct payments that went to farmers even when \nthey were having record positive income years. To replace direct \npayments, the Agriculture Committee has proposed the new Agriculture \nRisk Coverage Program, known as ARC. ARC is a market-oriented program \nto build on the principles of the ACRE Program that I authored in the \nlast farm bill and was expanded on in the Aggregate Risk and Revenue \nManagement Act I joined along in with Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator \nThune, and Senator Lugar last year.\n  The biggest change introduced by the ARC Program is that to get a \npayment, you have to have an actual loss. That may sound odd to people \nwho are observing this from the outside, but this is a fundamental \nshift in agricultural policy and I think a very wise one. ARC does not \nguarantee a profit, and it does not make the farmer completely whole, \nbut it smoothes out the downturns and provides the producer time to \nshift to a new market condition.\n  Crop insurance protects farmers within any given year. The ARC \nProgram is designed to help manage risk when there are repeated years \nof low prices or low yields. In other words, it makes the payments when \nthey are needed. And even better, the shift to ARC saves the Federal \nGovernment about $15 billion. I congratulate Senator Stabenow for this \nextraordinary savings as well as many other changes within the bill.\n  Other portions of the bill make long-term investments that will help \nstrengthen agriculture. The bill increases mandatory spending and \nreauthorizes and expands several programs in agricultural research. It \nis a small part of the Agriculture bill but a critically important part \nof expanding agriculture in America.\n  This bill creates the new Foundation for Food and Agriculture \nResearch, which leverages public dollars to generate private \ninvestment. These investments are going to be important to Illinois \nproducers and major research institutions such as the University of \nIllinois, Southern Illinois University, and the Peoria Agriculture Lab, \nas well as several other universities across our State.\n  The energy title includes mandatory funding for programs to expand \nbio-based manufacturing, advanced biofuels, and renewable energy. These\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nprograms are going to help companies in my State, such as Archer \nDaniels Midland and Patriot Renewable Fuels. They are going to be able \nto process and manufacture products in rural America. There are many \nexamples in Illinois of new markets being developed and new jobs being \ncreated in rural areas because of the growth of the bio-based industry.\n  The bill reforms the conservation title to streamline programs and \nfinds additional savings by limiting the number of acres that can \nparticipate in the CRP or Conservation Reserve Program.\n  I have some concerns with these cuts and believe our most \nenvironmentally sensitive lands need to stay out of production, but I \nunderstand that the committee had a tough assignment to balance our \npolicies with the need to reduce the deficit. This also holds true when \nit comes to nutrition, and I would like to say a word about the \nnutrition programs in this bill.\n  You can almost argue that this is a nutrition and agriculture bill. \nBut it is the farm bill, and it includes many critical nutrition \nprograms.\n  SNAP is the old Food Stamp Program. It helps those most impacted by \nthe current recession continue to feed their families. You cannot \nreally improve your situation in life if you are hungry. The committee \nbill takes some steps to reduce fraud in SNAP, and I heartily endorse \nthat. We cannot really argue against those. But I am concerned about \nrumblings from other Members considering amendments to cut the program \nmore fundamentally and alter the way SNAP works.\n  Let's be clear. We should not be cutting food assistance at a time \nwhen we are setting record poverty levels. In 2010 the United States \nset a new record with 15.1 percent of the population living in poverty. \nThat is over 46 million people in our country. For them, SNAP, or the \nFood Stamp Program, is a lifeline.\n  I invite my colleagues who are anxious to cut these programs to go \nvisit the local pantry, whether it is run by the church or whether it \nis a food bank in your area, and watch the people coming through the \ndoor. Some of them are very poor. Some of them are very elderly. Some \nof them are coming from work or going to work; they just do not make \nenough money to feed their families. Now is not the time to cut food \nassistance for American families. If you need more savings, I encourage \nmy colleagues to look somewhere else in this bill.\n\n  While the Agriculture Committee bill makes major reforms, there is \nstill more that can be done. The bill makes no changes to the Sugar \nProgram that forces consumers in America to pay higher prices at the \nstore and costs us jobs in America. I plan to support an effort from \nseveral of my colleagues to make some relatively minor changes that \nwill benefit both consumers and businesses.\n  There is another area that needs further reform. It is the area of \ncrop insurance. Crop Insurance Program costs have risen dramatically \nover the last several years, even when farm income was rising \ndramatically. Just last year the Federal Government spent more than \n$7.4 billion in crop insurance premium support. This does not even \naccount for the amount sent to crop insurance companies--the companies \nthat actually sell the crop insurance--to simply sell the policies. \nIncidentally, by selling those policies, they get a 14-percent return--\nnot a bad deal.\n  However, the crop insurance title sees the largest single expansion \nof any title in the farm bill, without making major efforts to rein in \nthe costs. We can do better. I have joined with my Republican \ncolleague, Senator Tom Coburn, to find additional savings in this \ntitle. In our opinion, it is not unreasonable to ask the wealthiest and \nmost prosperous farmers in America to pay a little more for their crop \ninsurance. Right now the Federal Government is subsidizing 62 percent \nof premium costs for crop insurance. For those who are making over \n$750,000 a year, a slight reduction in that Federal subsidy is not hard \nto explain, at least from where I am standing.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee for sending us \nthis bipartisan bill. It is a safety net for producers, makes \ninvestments in rural America, research, and energy development, \nprotects nutrition programs, and actually cuts spending.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion \nto debate and pass the 2012 farm bill. I hope they will all join us in \nvoting for the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Senate colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Startup Act 2.0\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, entrepreneurs and new businesses are vital \nto the strength of the U.S. economy. We need to be a competitive \ncountry in which we have great success in creating jobs in America.\n  Between 1980 and 2005, startup companies--less than 5 years old--\naccounted for nearly all the net new jobs created in our country. New \nfirms create an average of approximately 3 million jobs each year. In \norder to create jobs for Americans, we need to create an environment \nwhere entrepreneurs are free to pursue their ideas, start businesses, \nand hire American workers.\n  Now, why is this important? This is important, obviously, for the \npurpose of creating the opportunity for all Americans to pursue the \nAmerican dream. It is important for us to have the ability to put food \non our families' tables and save for our kids' education and save for \nour own retirement. And it is important because at a time in our Nation \nin which the fiscal condition of the Federal Government is so serious, \nso much out of balance--we are spending so many more dollars than we \ntake in--the deficit is holding back the growth of our country. These \nfacts are important because at this point in time, because of our \ncountry's fiscal condition, we have an inability to grow the economy, \nand we have seen little evidence that the administration and Congress \nare willing to address our fiscal issues.\n  I raise these facts because we have to act now in order to create \njobs in this country. The way to do that is to create an \nentrepreneurial and innovation environment in which people--Americans--\nwho have ideas want to take a product to market. In the process of \npursuing their success, they put other Americans to work. We need to \ncreate the environment in which that can happen. In the process of \ncreating the benefits of new jobs in America, we will have a better \nfiscal condition than the one we find ourselves in today and avoid the \nchances that the United States will become another Greece or other \nsouthern European country.\n  A number of us in the Senate who believe we can work together to \naccomplish this have come together and entered into negotiations and \ncreated legislation based upon information provided by the Kauffman \nFoundation on entrepreneurship in Kansas City, as well as the \nPresident's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. On the floor with me \ntoday are several of those colleagues. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner, and I gathered together our thoughts several months ago and \nintroduced legislation called the Startup Act. Also on the floor this \nafternoon is Senator Coons of Delaware. He and the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Rubio, introduced the AGREE Act, designed to put some \nthings in place that most Members of Congress agreed upon to grow \ntechnology and create jobs. The four of us then came together with an \nidea and have now introduced Startup Act 2.0.\n  Today, Members of the House of Representatives introduced companion \nlegislation--this morning--in a bipartisan effort. So we now have a \nbipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that we believe is important \nto the country. We believe it is important to individual citizens, and \nwe believe it is important in the ability for us to have the economic \ngrowth necessary to begin the process of making our country fiscally \nsound again.\n  This legislation has a number of components related to the Tax Code, \nrelated to the regulatory environment, related to the global battle for \ntalent, related to the ability for us to take the money we spend--the \ntaxpayer dollars at universities in conducting research--and to \nencourage that money be spent in a way for research that is able to be \nused in bringing new products to market, in commercialization,\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\nand to create an environment in which States across the country can \ndemonstrate their interest and willingness in pursuing an \nentrepreneurial environment so that entrepreneurs and innovators find a \nplace to build their companies.\n  It is an honor to be here this afternoon to highlight this \nlegislation, to encourage our other colleagues to join us, and to \napproach this in a way that says we believe this is something more than \njust introducing a bill, it is something that is important not just as \na symbol that we are working together, but we are of the belief that \nthis is legislation that can follow the JOBS Act that was passed by \nthis Congress and signed by this President several months ago, that we \ncan follow on with legislation that will increase the chances that \nentrepreneurship is alive and well and America retains its competitive \nplace in a global economy.\n  Let me ask my colleagues if they would like to join in this \ndiscussion. I would yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend, the \nSenator from Kansas, for his leadership on this issue. This is \nsomething on which he and I spent a lot of time working, as have, I \nknow, the Senators from Delaware, from Florida, and we are joined now \nby the Senator from Missouri as well. We are all new Senators.\n  We said before when we unveiled this we did not get the memo that we \nshould take Presidential election years off. We still think the needs \nof our country ought to trump election-year politicking. We think this \nis one of those spaces where we can find that common ground.\n  I spent 20 years as an entrepreneur and a funder of startup \nbusinesses, and everything in my experience validates what Senator \nMoran has talked about. But, candidly, the facts show 80 percent of all \nof the new jobs created in America in the last 20 years came from \nstartup businesses. They are not all tech businesses. I think of Under \nArmour, which is right up the road in Maryland, close to our friend \nfrom Delaware.\n  There are certain key things that every startup business needs: They \nneed access to capital, they need access to talent, they need access to \nnew ideas. We need to make sure we have a stable regulatory environment \nthat is not overly burdensome in each way we move the ball in this \nlegislation, both that we passed and that we are working on right now.\n  Senator Moran mentioned the JOBS Act, which looked at access to \ncapital issues, how we can perhaps allow companies access to the public \nmarkets in a cleaner way. I want to commend the Presiding Officer as \nwell. He took the lead on a whole new area of fundraising around \ncrowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and using the tools of the Internet, in \neffect, democratizing the ability to raise capital.\n  In this legislation, Startup 2.0, we take on a series of other \nissues. One of the issues is the question of talent. Every country in \nthe world competes for talent. We attract some of the best talent in \nthe world to come to our world-class universities. Oftentimes, we then \ntrain them in science, technology, engineering, and math with graduate \ndegrees. I wish we could fill all of those slots in American \nuniversities with native-born Americans. But we do not have enough.\n  Consequently, we train the best and brightest in the world, then send \nthem home to start their businesses. I can tell you, in Virginia, where \nwe are proud to have a vibrant high-tech community, an entrepreneurial \ncommunity, literally one-third of all of our high-tech firms in \nNorthern Virginia, the founders are first-generation Americans. If we \nhad the same immigration policies 20 years ago that we have today, we \nwould not have had that kind of explosive growth particularly all \nacross America in the nineties from technology.\n  So I want to turn to my colleague, the Senator from Delaware, a State \nthat punches above its weight, a small State but a State with great \nuniversities, a State which has a rich entrepreneurial climate as well, \nwhat got the Senator involved--I know he has a background in business \nas well--on this issue. I know the Senator wants to share as well some \nof the aspects of Startup 2.0.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the good Senator \nfrom Kansas, the Senator from Missouri, and my friend from Virginia in \nspeaking today in a bipartisan colloquy that is also part of a \nbicameral process that is trying to send a signal to the American \npeople, to our markets, and to our competitors, that we understand that \njust because we happen to be in an election year does not mean our \ncompetitors in China, in India, and Russia, in Europe and other parts \nof world--in Africa and in other places where there are emerging \nmarkets or in places where we have well-developed competitors--we do \nnot take this year off.\n  The American people expect since we are still drawing a salary, we \nshould still be making progress. We should still be trying to meet the \nneeds of a growing economy that needs to grow faster. So as Senator \nMoran referenced previously, last November Senator Rubio of Florida and \nI came together to put a package called the AGREE Act before the \nSenate.\n  We were pleased that a number of the provisions in that first AGREE \nAct actually have subsequently become law: One, to ease the path for \nIPOs, initial public offerings, for high-potential, high-growth \ncompanies; another through Executive order to strengthen intellectual \nproperty protection. We are hopeful the Senate will consider another \nprovision that dealt with bonus depreciation, which is another way to \nhelp make investments in equipment for small businesses.\n  On top of that, Senator Rubio and I have now teamed up with Senator \nMoran and Senator Warner to take some of the remaining provisions of \nthe AGREE Act and add them in with your Startup Act and now make an \nimproved and broader and stronger Startup 2.0.\n  The pieces that we brought to the party were eliminating the per-\ncountry caps for employment-based immigrant visas and making permanent \nthe exemption of certain capital gains so investors can provide \nfinancial stability to qualified startups. There are a lot of good \nideas in this bill. There are a lot of different ways in which it \ntackles the issues that my colleagues have already spoken to: \nimmigration; retaining high-promise, entrepreneurial folks who come and \nlearn in the United States; moving the inventions and innovations on \nAmerican college campuses to the marketplace more predictably, more \nswiftly; providing tax incentives for startup businesses and putting \nprovisions in the Tax Code that strengthen our welcoming environment \nfor entrepreneurship and regulatory relief.\n  Senator Moran took the lead in making possible a provision in this \nbill that provides some regulatory relief for startup businesses. In \nall I think these provisions make for a terrific package, thus the \nmoniker ``2.0.'' It has already attracted some other folks to join us.\n  Before I hand the floor over to the Senator from Missouri, I just \nwant to comment on what I think that means.\n  There are trillions of dollars in capital sitting on the sidelines. \nAmerican corporations have more money sitting on their balance sheets, \nnot invested and moving our economy forward, than at almost anytime in \nmodern history. That is because they are not sure this body, the \nCongress of the United States, can tackle the very real financial and \ncompetitiveness challenges in front of us.\n  There is something about the symbolism of what is on the Senate floor \ntoday: the Agriculture bill, the farm bill, and a bill we took up and \npassed just a few weeks ago, the Transportation bill. I think that is \nat times lost. The average American sees in the news the fighting, the \ndisagreement, the inability to come together, when, in fact, two fairly \nbroad, strong important bills--the farm bill and the Transportation \nbill--were passed through committee by strong votes.\n\n  Senator Boxer of California, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, Senator \nStabenow of Michigan, and Senator Roberts of Kansas--these are folks \nfrom both parties with significant differences in their views. But they \nmanaged to hammer out these bills, the Transportation and farm bills.\n  I want to thank Senators Moran and Warner and Rubio for joining with \nme and the four of us being able to put this together and putting it on \nthe floor of the Senate today.\n  To the good Senator from Missouri, a freshman in the Senate but a man \nof\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\ngreat seasoning and experience in the House and in public service, we \nare grateful he has joined us as a cosponsor of this bill. I welcome \nhim to speak for a few minutes about how he sees this contributing to \npositive progress for our recovery.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I do think there are those things that we \ncan agree on. I am glad to join the three of you and Senator Rubio as \none of the cosponsors of this bill that you all crafted and put \ntogether. Good energy policy, good tax policy, good regulatory policy \nare important to the future. But there are things we can do right now \neven outside of these bigger debates we need to have that are in this \nbill.\n  Who would have thought--Senator Moran brought this poster to the \nfloor--Great Britain would become a real competitor for us as a better \nplace to do business? I have talked to more than one American business \nlately that has actually changed their worldwide headquarters and their \ncorporate structure to Britain instead of the United States of America.\n  Then we have another--this poster is ``Entrepreneurs are Great \nBritain.'' I think entrepreneurs are still the United States of \nAmerica. But this ad would suggest otherwise.\n  ``Your next big idea. Canada.'' Canada is a great trading partner. \nThey are a neighbor of ours. They are a friend of ours. But I do not \nthink we would have thought a decade ago that these countries would be \nrepositioning themselves, and that has happened. Also, I think we have \nnot kept up like we should and we could have with things such as the \nStartup Act.\n  These countries are putting themselves in a position where they \nunderstand that private sector job growth is critical, that government \ncan do some things to encourage that, but government does not create \nvery many private sector jobs.\n  One of the reasons I decided to cosponsor the Startup Act 2.0, the \nsecond version of the Startup Act, is I think it does some of what we \nneed to begin to do. Seventy-five percent of all U.S. engineering and \ntechnology firms in the last decade, the decade we have good numbers \non, the one that ended just a few--that ended really--the numbers I \nhave are 1995 to 2005--75 percent of the engineering and technology \nstartups were started by people who were born in another country.\n  This bill simply creates a visa program that allows entrepreneurs who \nhave good ideas and, frankly, have some money to go along with these \ngood ideas, to come to the United States of America and start these \njobs, to take advantage of our great workforce, to take advantage of \nthe position we have to be able to send products all over the world, \nand to do that here.\n  This act also requires that we have a true cost-benefit analysis of \nrules and regulations. Last year the Federal Government--of the 66 \nrules which cost more than $100 million, only 18 of them had what one \ncould describe as a cost-benefit analysis. There are lots of things \nthat would be fine to do, but if the cost to the economy, the cost to \njobs, and the cost to families is greater than the benefit, we should \nnot do them.\n  So this bill says let's go ahead. Let's not let the cost of something \noverwhelm the benefit to the economy or become a negative impact on the \neconomy. Long-term investment in this act with startups would have some \nexemption from the capital gains. People are risking a lot of money \nwith a startup. This is saying: We want to raise the reward quotient of \nthat risk so we encourage people to take the risk.\n  If someone is doing a startup, the odds are pretty high that money \nmay not ever come back. So we need to do whatever we can to encourage \nthat money be put on the table and those jobs be created. In 2009, 651 \nstartups were created with university research involved as a component. \nThis further opens the door for grant dollars that are already \navailable, of Federal research and development funds to be even more \nopen to a university partner as part of that private sector effort. So \nI think we have to be focused on the opportunity for families, the \nopportunity for individuals.\n  Who creates the jobs in America? Small business creates the jobs in \nAmerica. Startups create the jobs in America. I am pleased to be here \nstanding with Senator Moran.\n  The next big idea is the biggest idea of the last couple hundred \nyears, which is the United States of America intends to be a \ncompetitive leader in the world. What do we need to do as Members of \nthe Senate to see that happen?\n  I am glad he and Senator Warner, Senator Coons, and Senator Rubio are \nleading this effort. I am glad to join in it and glad to be here on the \nfloor today.\n  Mr. MORAN. I very much appreciate the remark of the Senator from \nMissouri and his cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  Let me highlight something he pointed out, which is in the short time \nthat those of us on the floor today have been in the Senate, about 14 \nmonths, seven countries have adopted new laws to attract entrepreneurs. \nWe have not.\n  Listen to this fact. A recent report from the World Bank shows that \nAmerica has slipped in the rankings in terms of startup friendliness \nfrom first to thirteenth. There are provisions in here about visas for \nthose who were foreign born. This is very much about American jobs. \nThis is about the opportunity for someone to start a company here and \nhire Americans. If they happen to be someone who is foreign born but \nhighly educated in science, technology, engineering and entrepreneurial \nwith money and they want to invest in the U.S. economy and agree to put \npeople to work, we are saying the doors of the United States of America \nare open for business for purposes of hiring U.S. citizens.\n  It is an important component. We do not want to lose this battle. As \nwe see, these are ads from U.S. publications in which entrepreneurs are \nbeing lured to places outside the United States to start their \ncompanies. When I visited with an entrepreneur recently, they said: We \ncould not get the person we needed to hire to work at our company \nbecause they could not get a visa. They were foreign born. So we hired \nthem, but we put them in our plant in Canada. We put them in our \nfacility in Dublin.\n  The fear is, the concern, there is more than just those number of \njobs that we are out to create in the United States. It means people \nwho are entrepreneurial are now in Dublin and in Toronto where they are \nmaking decisions not just about what they have to do today for a check, \nbut when they have an idea about starting a business, they are outside \nof the United States and we lose the benefit of that job growth.\n  Let me also say something else about this legislation. An \nentrepreneurial engineer told me to get a plane to fly, there are two \nforces at work: thrust and drag. Too many times, in my view, Congress \nspends its efforts in creating new laws, more spending, it promotes the \nthrust. What we are doing is reducing the drag, increasing the chances \nthat a new business will succeed.\n  Before our time expires, let me again return to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend the Senator from Kansas for his comments. I am \nfond of Canada. My mom's family is from Canada. It is remarkable. \nCanada, over the last 3 years, has aggressively sought out worldwide \ntalent.\n  I ask the Senator from Kansas whether he thinks it is good policy in \nwhat we do now--and, once again, I make very clear, this is about \ngrowing American jobs because we have more job openings in the advanced \nfields of science, technology, engineering, and math than there are \nAmerican citizens applying for those jobs.\n  I ask the Senator from Kansas whether it would make sense--if we \nthought about this from a national security standpoint, would it make \nsense for us to take, for example, a Chinese lieutenant and send him to \nWest Point and expose him to everything we have in terms of our \nnational security ideas and then send him home?\n  I guess I ask the Senator whether he thought that would be good \nnational security policy. Does it affect our current national \nimmigration policy on an equally important front, in terms of job \ncreation and economic activity?\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the answer to that in Kansas is that it \ndoesn't make any sense at all. There is no good judgment there. That is \na point I would make in a more broad way. The provisions of Startup 2.0 \nare mostly about common sense, things that would make sense to the \npeople of my State and to the people of the State\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nof Virginia who, if you looked at a problem said how can you solve it \nand grow the economy, they would say these things make common sense. \nThat is what this legislation is about.\n  In my view, I guess 80 percent of our colleagues in the Senate at \nleast would be supportive of the provisions of this legislation. I \nthink the Senators on the floor this afternoon and others are out to \nprove that when there is broad support for commonsense ideas, we are \nstill in a legislative body that can accomplish much and that, as the \nSenator from Virginia is fond of saying, we didn't get the memo that \nsays we don't work during an election year. The American people expect \nus to make the necessary accomplishments to grow the economy, to put \nAmericans to work, and to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Again, I ask if the Senator has any items to close with.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I hope we can get a number of our colleagues to join \nus. This doesn't fall under a traditional Democratic versus Republican \nlexicon. This is more about future versus past. This is the future of \nglobal competition for talent, for ideas, and for capital. This is \nwhere job creation will come from. I look forward to working with the \nSenator and our other colleagues to make sure we get the support here \nand in the House and get this bill passed. I thank my friend, the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to turn its attention \nto one of the most significant legislative issues on our agenda this \nyear, consideration of the 2012 farm bill. I would first like to thank \nthe chairwoman, Senator Stabenow, and ranking member, Senator Roberts, \nfor working together in a bipartisan way to advance a farm bill--the \nAgriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012--that can pass the \nSenate and become law this year. As a former chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, and having worked closely with Senator Lugar on \nmany bipartisan farm bills, I know how difficult the task can be of \nforging a comprehensive bill that addresses many competing needs.\n  Some Senators may be scratching their heads trying to understand the \nurgency of passing this bill and why it matters to constituents in all \nof our States. The current farm bill expires at the end of September. \nWe also have a serious problem with dairy policy that must be addressed \nbefore August 31; our dairy farmers will be left without a vital safety \nnet if we do not act before then.\n  I recognize that not every Senator comes from farm country or hears \nfrom many farmers in their State like I do. But this is a bill that \naffects every State and touches the lives of every American, through \nthe healthy food on our kitchen tables or in our children classrooms; \nthe clean water that is a result of critical conservation programs; \nrural businesses on Main Street receiving assistance from USDA; new \nenergy products resulting from research supported by this bill; and the \nbenefits we all receive from our local farms and food systems that \nbenefit from this bill. The farm bill also has a reach far beyond our \nborders with the international food aid that provides lifesaving \nsupport around the globe.\n  Make no mistake: Farming is part of our national security. Imagine \nwhat it would be like if we had to depend on imported food, the way we \ndepend on imported oil. Keeping American agriculture strong and vibrant \nis at the core of this bill, but this bill does much more. It will also \nhelp keep our rural communities strong, and will support those \nAmericans who are struggling to put food on the table.\n  Every Senator should know that this farm bill makes real reforms, and \nnets real savings. This bill makes long-overdue reforms to agriculture \npolicy, and consolidates and streamlines USDA programs, all the while \ncutting $23 billion in mandatory spending. The bill before the Senate \ntoday proves that when Democrats and Republicans sit down and work in a \nbipartisan manner we can make progress and accomplish something real, \nand do so with fiscal restraint.\n  Is this the farm bill that I, or any individual Senator, would have \ndrafted? Of course not. There are conservation and energy programs that \nfarmers in Vermont would like to see strengthened, many nutrition \nprograms that are vital in keeping food on the tables of millions of \nAmericans, and a wide array of rural development programs that do not \nhave mandatory funding in this bill. But I recognize that this bill is \na compromise, and I will continue to work with the chairwoman and \nranking member to make this the best farm bill possible.\n  I am especially pleased that the farm bill includes a major dairy \nreform proposal that I know will help both our producers and consumers \nmove away from the dangerous roller coaster of price swings. For our \nfarmers in Vermont, these dairy reforms are the key to our \nconsideration of a farm bill. I regularly hear from Vermont farmers \nabout this. We simply must free our dairy farmers from this destructive \ncycle of volatile price changes.\n  The current Federal safety net provides no protection for dairy \nfarmers from this roller coaster of price volatility. The 2012 farm \nbill scraps outdated price supports and the Milk Income Loss Contract \nProgram. It establishes a new risk management plan that protects farm \nincome when margins shrink dangerously, and a stabilization program to \nallow farmers to take a proactive role in easing the instability in our \ndairy markets.\n  And it accomplishes this at a lower cost than the program that it \nreplaces and contributes to the savings in this bill. It is a voluntary \nprogram and can be tailored by the farmer to fit the farmer's \nindividual needs.\n  These reforms have the support of dairy farmers across the country, \nand they have been developed to move us away from the regional dairy \nfights and the constant policy conflicts between small and large farms. \nThe 2009 dairy crisis brought plummeting milk prices and sky-high feed \ncosts that combined to force far too many U.S. dairy farmers out of \nbusiness, and saddled thousands more with losses and debt from which it \nwill take years to recover. After those dark days in 2009, dairy \nfarmers from across the country came together for a solution that will \nhelp them and consumers move away from these volatile price swings.\n  Dairy is Vermont's single most important agricultural commodity, and \ndairy products account for upward of 83 percent--or 90 percent, \ndepending on market prices--of Vermont's agricultural products sales. \nIf any Senator has questions about the dairy reforms in this bill, I \nwould welcome discussing what this farm bill does for dairy farms. \nThere has been a lot of misinformation about these provisions, and I \nwelcome the opportunity to eliminate any confusion.\n  I have tried to be supportive of programs which do not directly \nbenefit Vermont, and I intend to vote to help farmers in other \nregions--just as I hope other Senators will join me in supporting dairy \nfarmers in Vermont, and throughout the Nation. Just like corn, wheat, \nsoybean, sugar, cotton and the many other types of farmers in our \ncountry, our dairy farmers work extremely hard for a living. Dairy \nfarmers deserve a voice in the crafting of this farm bill, and I have \nbeen proud to ensure that their voices are being heard in shaping this \nbill.\n  While listening to our farmers in writing this bill, we also need to \nhear the voices of the millions of Americans struggling every day to \nput food on the table. The nutrition assistance and emergency feeding \nprograms in this farm bill are needed now more than ever. Because of \nthe greater need for services, these programs currently do not satisfy \ndemand. The numbers are staggering even for a State the size of \nVermont. In 2010 alone, an average of more than 87,000 Vermonters \nreceived Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, benefits each \nmonth. On top of that, nearly 86,000 Vermonters accessed food from our \nState's food pantries and soup kitchens. Sadly, those numbers have \ncontinued to rise in Vermont and across the country, and they reflect \nhow critically important the nutrition title of the farm bill is to so \nmany States.\n  Ensuring these programs can continue to serve Vermonters and all \nAmericans in need is a key part of enacting a strong farm bill for this \ncountry.\n  Calls to reduce food assistance as a way to solve our Nation's \ndeficit problems are misguided and shortsighted.\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nAxing tens of billions of dollars from the SNAP program would eliminate \nfood assistance for millions of Americans and deny hundreds of \nthousands of American children school meals. I am disappointed that \nthis bill includes $4.5 billion in cuts to the SNAP program, cuts that \nwill predominately come from Northeastern States.\n  Despite these cuts, the farm bill does make significant improvements \nto nutrition programs, including important funding for emergency food \nassistance and initiatives to encourage better health through improved \naccess to local foods, and better nutrition for our children and \nseniors. I am pleased that this bill also makes great advances to \nsupport self-sufficiency and food security in our low-income \ncommunities, helping to correct the ``food deserts'' that we experience \nin both urban and rural communities. At a time when more Americans than \never before are at risk of going hungry, and food pantry shelves across \nthe country are bare, I am committed to working with the chairwoman and \nranking member to find ways to make these nutrition programs even \nstronger in order to help the people who need it most.\n  I hope that the full Senate can now come together in a bipartisan \nway, just as we did in the Agriculture Committee, to pass this bill, \nwhich will have a tremendous impact on our farms, our rural \ncommunities, our kitchen tables, and our economic recovery.\n  This farm bill represents an investment in American agriculture that \nwill benefit our producers, our rural communities, our Main Street \nbusinesses, taxpayers, and consumers, and particularly the neediest \namong us. It deserves the Senate's full and focused attention, and it \ndeserves the support of every Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3768-S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF JEFFREY J. HELMICK TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Jeffrey J. Helmick, of Ohio, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 90 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the U.S. Constitution entrusts the \nSenate with one of our democracies' most important obligations--to \n``advise and consent'' to judicial nominations.\n  Yet, today, almost half of all Americans, 133 million citizens of our \ngreat country, live in districts or circuits that have a vacancy due to \nthe inaction of Members of this body.\n  We have an opportunity today to take seriously our responsibility to \ndo something about that and take one significant step by voting to \nconfirm Jeffrey Helmick to serve as a U.S. district court judge. \nPresident Obama nominated Mr. Helmick to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Ohio on May 11, 2011.\n  Based on a bipartisan commission's recommendation and based on my own \njudgment, I had no hesitation whatsoever in suggesting Jeffrey \nHelmick's name to President Obama. Let me tell you about our selection \nprocess.\n  In 2009, then-Senator George Voinovich, a Republican, and I assembled \na bipartisan commission of distinguished Ohioans in the legal \ncommunity. The commission included a former attorney general of Ohio, \nlaw school deans, and other accomplished Ohioans. In order to avoid any \nconflicts of interest, leading legal professionals from the Southern \nDistrict of the State reviewed nominations--that Northern District \nincludes Toledo, Akron, Canton, Youngstown; the Southern District \nincludes Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, and other communities. Legal \nprofessionals from the Southern District reviewed nominations for \nvacant judgeships in the Northern District and vice versa.\n  The members of the bipartisan commission for the Northern and \nSouthern District were about exactly half Republican and half \nDemocratic. They spent a substantial amount of time, as they have on \nprevious judges in the process, screening, interviewing, and discussing \nthe candidates.\n  At the end of this process, they selected Jeffrey Helmick, a native \nof Toledo, to be the nominee for this judicial vacancy. They gave me \nthree highly qualified names, suggesting that I interview them, which \nis part of the process. I then went there to advise and consent, if you \nwill, after speaking with all members of the committee, personally or \non the phone. I chose to send Jeffrey Helmick's name in to be the \nnominee.\n  Jeff Helmick continues to live in Toledo with his wife Karen, an \nattorney also, and their son Joel. Each of the members of this \ncommission I spoke with was impressed by Jeff's thoughtfulness, his \ntemperament, and his extraordinary reputation among his peers, even \namong opposing counsel.\n  The chair of the commission, Nancy Rogers, a former dean of the Ohio \nState University Moritz College of Law and former attorney general of \nOhio, said of Jeff:\n\n       He has shown a commitment to integrity and to excellence, \n     and a dedication to his community and to the administration \n     of justice.\n\n  Jeff Helmick not only has the support of this bipartisan selection \ncommittee, selected by Senator Voinovich, a Republican, and by me, he \nhas the support of the larger legal community, including all the \nFederal judges he will serve beside at the Federal courthouse in \nToledo.\n  U.S. District Court Judge Jack Zouhary, nominated by President George \nW. Bush, has been a judge in the Northern District since 2006. He is \ncurrently the sole active judge of the court in the Western Division of \nthe Northern District in Ohio, and he will be working most closely with \nthis new judge--we hope.\n  Judge Zouhary wrote to the committee recommending Jeff Helmick's \nexpedient confirmation. For some time, Judge Zouhary has asked when the \nSenate would confirm Jeff. He wrote:\n\n       You will find no better candidate than Jeff Helmick. He \n     possesses the intelligence, the passion for our justice \n     system, and the necessary temperament and people skills to be \n     an outstanding district court judge.\n\n  If that weren't enough, he also said:\n\n       In the private practice, lawyers are able to choose their \n     partners. Federal judges don't have such a luxury; we must \n     work with whomever you confirm. I would be thrilled to have \n     Jeff as my ``partner'' on the bench.\n\n  Ohio State Senator Mark Wagner, a Republican, represents much of that \narea in the State legislature in the Western Division of the court. He \nis chair of the Ohio State Senate judiciary committee and a long-time \nmember of the Toledo Bar Association. He recommends Jeff for this \nposition. State Senator Wagner, a Republican, said:\n\n       [Jeff] is someone who has stood for principles, litigated \n     honestly, and ably defended our constitutional system of \n     government. Helmick is held in very high esteem by the local \n     bar, and his support crosses partisan lines.\n\n  The bipartisan selection committee, which Senator Voinovich and I \nconvened, did its job well, and today we must do our job.\n  Jeff Helmick understands the needs and challenges facing the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio and our legal system generally. Rising costs of \nlitigation and increasing size and scope of court dockets pose numerous \nchallenges to any system of justice.\n  But it is because of his experience--and respect from fellow lawyers \nand judges he has worked with--that he is well prepared to meet these \nchallenges.\n  He is a courtroom innovator, having worked with the courts to \nintegrate cutting-edge technologies into courtrooms to ensure that the \nadministration of justice is efficient, equal, fair, and open for all \nwho seek it. I am not a lawyer, but that is what lawyering and the \njudiciary should be all about.\n  Outside the courtroom, Jeff is equally dedicated to serving the \npublic. A supporter of pro bono services, he volunteers at the Maumee \nValley Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to improve the \nprofessionalism of lawyers and access to justice for the underserved.\n  He is past president of the Pemberville Boys Ranch, which helps\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\ntroubled young men in need of a home or a safer environment to reach \ntheir potential. He will make an outstanding judge on the U.S. District \nCourt for Ohio's Northern District. I agree with Judge Zouhary that \n``we will find no better candidate than Jeff.''\n  That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides to confirm Jeff \nHelmick today.\n  The snail pace with which we have been moving on judicial nominations \nthreatens to delay justice for far too many Americans. Right now, 15 \njudicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee \nstill await a Senate confirmation vote.\n\n  Today, nearly 1 in 10 Federal judgeships is vacant. Earlier this \nyear, the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts, the \nnonpartisan agency charged with running our Federal courts, declared a \njudicial emergency for Ohio's Northern District.\n  We need to act right now, today, to confirm Jeffrey Helmick. The \npeople of Ohio have waited for too long. The result is that litigants \nin the Northern District of Ohio are experiencing delays in having \ntheir cases resolved. In too many cases, justice deferred can mean \njustice denied.\n  In June of 2010, U.S. District Judge James Carr took senior status, \ncreating a vacancy in Toledo's Federal courthouse. That is almost \nprecisely 2 years ago.\n  For these 2 years, Jeffrey Helmick--I spoke with him in August, if my \nmemory is correct, saying I wanted to send his name to the President, \nand I told him the delay may be several months, maybe even 1 year, \nnever dreaming that partisanship in this body would mean a 2-year \ndelay. For almost 2 years, Jeffrey Helmick, who enjoys the enthusiastic \nsupport of Federal judges appointed by Presidents of both parties in \nToledo, enjoys the bipartisan support of me and of Senator Portman, the \nRepublican from Ohio.\n  For these 2 years, he has had his nomination placed on hold, and this \nis at enormous political cost. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n  Jeff Helmick is not a partner at some big law firm where others can \nhelp him or take over his cases. Instead, he has had a small firm where \nthe clients are his own. As a result, his practice and his clients have \nbeen placed in limbo, not knowing when he will be confirmed.\n  Some 2 years later, we can finally ensure that the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Ohio finally has its longstanding \nvacancy filled.\n  Today, we can confirm Judge Helmick as a judge, a brilliant, \ndistinguished lawyer who was nominated by a bipartisan commission whose \nmembers were appointed by former Senator George Voinovich and me.\n  We must confirm Jeff Helmick. He has the support of his colleagues \nand from Republicans and Democrats in my home State.\n  One more brief story. I came to the Senate, as the Presiding Officer \ndid, in January of 2007. Soon after I came here, I was presented with \nthe nomination of a potential Federal judge, now Judge Lioi, from \nCanton, OH. Judge Lioi, waiting and hoping to be a judge--I believe she \nwas a common pleas judge. She had been selected by two republican \nSenators, Senator DeWine, my predecessor, and Senator Voinovich, \nneither of whom is in the Senate today. She had been selected and \nvetted by two Republican Senators in a process not nearly as \nbipartisan--or I don't think as vigorous or as rigorous as ours--\nnominated by President Bush and sent to the Senate. As a Senator from \nOhio, I had the opportunity, if I had chosen, to block the nomination \nof Ms. Lioi.\n  So the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, controlled by the \nDemocrats--my party--in considering a nominee by the Republican \nPresident, sent to the Senate by two Republican Senators, presented \nthis candidate's name to me. I sat down with Ms. Lioi for perhaps an \nhour, interviewed her, talked to others who were familiar with her and \nher background, and found her to be a woman of integrity and found her \nto be qualified. I immediately sent her name to Senator Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and said: She has my support. I \ndon't know the precise date, but within only a few weeks of my coming \nto the Senate and meeting future Judge Lioi, her nomination came to the \nfloor of the Senate and she was confirmed. Contrast that with what has \nhappened today with dozens of judges.\n  I plead with my colleagues to confirm this qualified, smart man with \ngreat integrity from Toledo, OH, who has been vetted by both parties \nand who has waited long enough. More importantly, the people of the \nNorthern District, where a judicial emergency has been declared, \ndeserve this nomination to be confirmed so that he can begin to serve \nthe people of the Northern District and the western area of the \nNorthern District of the Federal District Court in Ohio.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime during the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             D-day Invasion\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, 68 years ago today, June 6, 1944, \nsome 150,000 Americans, including many Ohioans, began what seemed like \nan impossible journey. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower \ncalled it ``the Great Crusade.''\n  At 6:30 on a fog-filled morning on June 6, 1944, our servicemembers \nmade it to France. They waded onshore--past mines landed from the air, \npast sharpened stakes--and crawled toward gunfire. General Eisenhower \ntold our sailors, soldiers, and airmen that the ``eyes of the world . . \n. the hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere'' were with \nthem. A mere 50-mile stretch of the French coast--with places named \nUtah and Omaha, Gold and Juno Pointe du Hoc and Sword--was all that \nstood between humanity's freedom and Hitler's aggression. But our \nwarriors--men such as Ohio's own PFC Frank E. Harget--did not give up.\n  Last May I had the honor of presenting Mr. Harget, of Akron, OH, the \nservice medals he earned during World War II, some 67 or 68 years \nlater.\n  Frank Harget joined the Army in September 1943 and was immediately \nsent to the European theatre. He was given the unenviable task of scout \nand was dispatched to the front lines to perform reconnaissance. His \njob was to gather intelligence on enemy forces. Many times, Mr. Harget \ntold me, he was so close to the German front, he could see German \nsoldiers eating their lunch. He served in five battle campaigns, from \nD-day to the Battle of the Bulge, and in Central Europe.\n  Mr. Harget was discharged in November 1945 after the war was over \nwithout receiving the Bronze Star he had earned. My office helped him \nfinally receive that Bronze Star and seven other medals and awards. He \nhelped our Nation and the world--think about living with this for the \nnext 60 years of your life--overthrow an evil regime.\n  Today we recognize men like Frank Harget who overcame great odds \nthousands and thousands of miles from home.\n  D-day was the largest amphibious invasion in recorded world history, \nwith 73,000 American troops, 61,000 British troops, 21,000 Canadian \ntroops, and 195,000 allied naval and Merchant Marine personnel, with \nmore than 5,000 ships involved.\n  After 24 hours, only 2,500 troops of the 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd \nAirborne Divisions were under the control of their parent units.\n  At Gold Beach, 25,000 men landed and some 400 were killed. At Omaha \nBeach, the U.S. 1st Infantry and the 29th Infantry Divisions found \ntheir sections to be the most heavily fortified of all the invasion \nbeaches. The official record stated:\n\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n\n       . . . within 10 minutes of the ramps being lowered, the \n     leading company had become inert, leaderless and almost \n     incapable of action. Every officer and sergeant had been \n     killed or wounded. It had become a struggle for survival and \n     rescue.\n\n  The 2nd Ranger Battalion had to scale 100-foot cliffs under the cover \nof night and then attack and destroy the German coastal defense guns at \nthe massive concrete cliff-top gun emplacement at Pointe du Hoc. But \ndespite these obstacles, young men such as Frank Harget from Akron, OH, \nwho participated in this invasion fought and persevered and began the \nliberation of Europe with little else besides their training, their \ncomrades, their courage, and their refusal to quit.\n  These men proved that the forces of freedom are strong. I would \nsuggest that the forces of freedom are still strong today.\n  Members of the allied forces showed us the strength of humanity over \ntyranny. Franklin Roosevelt knew our D-day warriors would not ``rest \nuntil the victory is won.'' And we did win.\n  Today we salute the Frank Hargets of the world. There are still \nthousands of World War II veterans left. Most have died. Most who \nfought and survived D-day are no longer with us. Some still are. We \nsalute them, and we salute those who went before them for running \ntoward danger in order to secure peace.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today the Senate turns to another \njudicial nomination, Jeffrey J. Helmick to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Northern District of Ohio. I want to tell the Senate why I oppose \nthe nomination and urge all Senators to do likewise.\n  We continue to confirm the President's nominees at a very brisk pace. \nJust 2 days ago we confirmed the 147th judicial nominee of this \nPresident to district and circuit courts. Let me put that in \nperspective for my colleagues. We also have confirmed two Supreme Court \nnominees during President Obama's term. The last time the Senate \nconfirmed two Supreme Court nominees was during President Bush's second \nterm. And during President Bush's entire second term, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of only 120 district and circuit court nominees. We \nhave already confirmed 27 more nominees for President Obama than we did \nfor President Bush in a similar period of time. And this is in a \nPresidential election year--typically a time when judicial \nconfirmations are limited to consensus nominees. Yet here we are \nconsidering a controversial nomination. Perhaps the Senate could better \nspend this time working on critical issues facing our Nation, such as \nour massive debt, intolerable deficit spending, an anemic economy, \nunacceptable unemployment levels, high energy costs, and national \nsecurity issues.\n  The advice and consent function of the Senate is a critical step in \nthe appointment of Federal judges. In Federalist Paper No. 76, \nAlexander Hamilton wrote this:\n\n       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attention, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  In other words, the Senate has a role in preventing the appointment \nof judges who are unfit characters or political favors of any President \nor of those who are not qualified to serve as Federal judges.\n  What did our current President, then-Senator Obama say about this \nduty? He stated:\n\n       There are some who believe that the President, having won \n     the election, should have the complete authority to appoint \n     his nominee, and the Senate should only examine whether or \n     not the Justice is intellectually capable and an all-around \n     nice guy, that once you get beyond intellect and personal \n     character, there should be no further question whether the \n     judge should be confirmed. I disagree with this view. I \n     believe firmly that the Constitution calls for the Senate to \n     advise and consent. I believe that it calls for meaningful \n     advice and consent that includes an examination of a judge's \n     philosophy, ideology, and record.\n\n  Our inquiry of the qualifications of nominees must be more than \nintelligence, a pleasant personality, or a prestigious clerkship. At \nthe beginning of this Congress, I articulated my standards for judicial \nnominees. I want to ensure that the men and women who are appointed to \na lifetime position in the Federal judiciary are qualified to serve. \nFactors I consider important include intellectual ability, respect for \nthe Constitution, fidelity to the law, personal integrity, appropriate \njudicial temperament, and professional competence. In applying these \nstandards, I have demonstrated good faith in ensuring fair \nconsideration of judicial nominees. I have worked with the majority to \nconfirm consensus nominees. However, as I have stated more than once, \nthe Senate must not place quantity confirmed over quality confirmed. \nThese lifetime appointments are too important to the Federal judiciary \nand the American people to simply rubberstamp them. This is not a pro \nforma process that we are engaged in.\n  Last year I became increasingly concerned about some of the judicial \nnominees being sent to the Senate by this administration. In a few \nindividual cases, it was very troublesome. Mr. Helmick's nomination \nfell into that category. When I apply the standard I mentioned and the \nstandards that then-Senator Obama laid out or the standards expressed \nin the Federalist Papers, I reach the same conclusion. In my judgment, \nMr. Helmick fails to meet the required standard and should not be \nconfirmed.\n  The Senate process for reviewing the professional qualifications, \ntemperament, background, and character is a long and thorough process. \nIn Mr. Helmick's case, there were some issues that needed to be fully \nexamined. At the conclusion of that lengthy process, a substantial \nmajority of my political party--the Republicans--on the Judiciary \nCommittee determined that this nomination should not be reported to the \nSenate. Nevertheless, we now have the nomination before us. Even so, \nthere are reasons sufficient to oppose the nomination.\n  In 2000 Mr. Helmick faced disciplinary action for failing to comply \nwith a court-issued subpoena. He refused to turn over an incriminating \nletter signed by a former client in the same case, which contained \nthreats to a State witness. A grand jury issued a subpoena to obtain \nthe letter, but Mr. Helmick refused to appear before the grand jury. \nThe trial court found him in contempt of court. Mr. Helmick appealed, \nwhich caused the contempt sanction to be stayed. A three-judge panel of \nthe Ohio Court of Appeals unanimously held that he was required to turn \nover the letter.\n\n  Mr. Helmick then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which held that \nhe must comply with the subpoena, although they lifted the contempt \ncitation.\n  The Supreme Court of Ohio stated that Mr. Helmick's concerns \nregarding the attorney-client privilege were not enough to ``override \nthe public interest in maintaining public safety and promoting the \nadministration of justice.''\n  I do not think we should confirm to the bench individuals who are \nwilling to put private interests over the public interest in the \nadministration of justice.\n  I am concerned about Mr. Helmick's view on national security, as \nevidenced by his handling of terrorism cases as a defense attorney. In \nlooking at the arguments he has made in court representing terrorists, \nI am concerned he may believe terrorism cases are less serious than \nother criminal cases, and that in turn causes some concern about how he \nmight handle terrorism cases that may come before him, if confirmed.\n  For example, he represented the terrorist Wassim Mazloum. This \nterrorist was convicted by a jury of a conspiracy to kill U.S. troops \noverseas and of providing material support for terrorists. Those are \nvery serious crimes. According to the sentencing guidelines, Mazloum \ndeserved life in prison. Mr. Helmick argued ``that perhaps the life \nsentence that was called for in the advisory guidelines was too severe \nor too harsh.'' In the end, this terrorist did\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nnot receive a life sentence, rather he received only an 8-year \nsentence--hardly a punishment or deterrent.\n  For these reasons and others I will vote no on this nomination and \nurge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 17 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, let me refer to the nomination that is \nbefore us. I know the distinguished senior Senator from Ohio will speak \nafter me. Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Jeffrey \nHelmick to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of Ohio. I commend Senator Brown and Senator \nPortman for their diligence in securing a vote on this nomination. Mr. \nHelmick has the strong bipartisan support of his home State Senators. \nHis nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee nearly 3 months \nago by a bipartisan majority. I thank the majority leader for his work \nin bringing this nomination up for a final vote.\n\n  This is one of the nominations that I noted on Monday had been \nskipped, when we confirmed another district court judge. I look forward \nto working with Senator Kyl and Senator McCain to secure a vote on the \nnomination of Justice Andrew Hurwitz to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit, working with Senator Menendez and Senator \nLautenberg to secure a vote on the nomination of Judge Patty Shwartz to \nfill a vacancy on the Third Circuit, and with Senator Graham and \nSenator DeMint to set a vote on the nomination of Mary Lewis to fill a \nvacancy in South Carolina.\n  I spoke on Monday about a recent Congressional Research Service \nreport on judicial nominations. The report demonstrates what I have \nbeen saying for some time, that the time that nominations are being \ndelayed from a final Senate vote is extraordinary. Pages 17 through 19 \nand figure 4 demonstrate the unprecedented obstruction. The median \nnumber of days President Obama's circuit court nominees have been \ndelayed, from Committee report to a vote, has skyrocketed to 132 days, \n``roughly 7.3 times greater than the median number of 18 days for the \n61 confirmed circuit nominees of his immediate predecessor, President \nG.W. Bush.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the CRS report be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, delay is being demonstrated again with \nrespect to the nominations of Justice Hurwitz to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Shwartz to the Third Circuit, Richard Taranto to the Federal \nCircuit, and William Kayatta to the First Circuit. These are not \ncontroversial or ideologically driven nominees. Justice Hurwitz is \nstrongly supported by Senator Kyl and Senator McCain; William Kayatta \nis strongly supported by Senator Snowe and Senator Collins. Another \npoint made by the Congressional Research Service is that fewer circuit \ncourt nominees have been confirmed than were confirmed during the first \nterms of any of President Obama's four predecessors President Reagan, \nPresident Geroge H.W. Bush, President Clinton, or President George W. \nBush.\n  Similarly, district court nominees such as Mr. Helmick are being \nunnecessarily delayed. The median time from Committee vote to Senate \nvote has gone from 21 days during the George W. Bush presidency to 90 \ndays for President Obama's district nominees. I wish Mr. Helmick had \nbeen confirmed back in March when he was first ready for a final Senate \nvote. He has been stalled for nearly 3 months. The Congressional \nResearch Service report also notes that in contrast to President George \nW. Bush's district court nominees, who were confirmed at a rate of \nalmost 95 percent, President Obama's district court nominees are being \nconfirmed at a rate below 80 percent. And it concludes that ``the \naverage time in the current Congress during which circuit and district \ncourt nominations have been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar \nbefore being confirmed has reached historically high levels.''\n  Once the Senate is allowed to vote on this nomination, we need \nagreement to vote on the 14 other judicial nominees stalled on the \nExecutive Calendar. There are five more judicial nominees who had their \nhearing back on May 9 and should be voted on by the Judiciary Committee \ntomorrow. They too will need Senate votes for confirmation. Another \npoint made by the Congressional Research Service in its recent report \nis that fewer of President Obama's district court nominees have been \nconfirmed than were confirmed during the first terms of his four \npredecessors and vacancies remain higher now than when President Obama \ntook office. Not a single one of the last three presidents has had \njudicial vacancies increase after their first term. In order to avoid \nthis, the Senate needs to act on these nominees before adjourning this \nyear.\n  Nor would that be unusual. As the Congressional Research Service \nReport makes clear, in 5 of the last 8 presidential election years, the \nSenate has confirmed at least 22 circuit and district court nominees \nafter May 31. The notable exceptions were during the last years of \nPresident Clinton's two terms in 1996 and 2000 when they would not \nallow confirmations to continue. Otherwise, it has been the rule rather \nthan the exception. So, for example, the Senate confirmed 32 in 1980; \n28 in 1984; 31 in 1992; 28 in 2004 at the end of President George W. \nBush's first term; and 22 after May 31 in 2008 at the end of President \nBush's second term.\n  The Congressional Research Service Report about the treatment of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations confirms what we already know \nthat Senate Republicans have held President Obama's nominees to a \ndifferent and unfair standard and engaged in unnecessary and harmful \ndelays of consensus nominees.\n  James Fallows, a well-respected journalist at The Atlantic authored \nan internet article dated June 5, 2012 based on his reading of the CRS \nReport, which is entitled ``American Dysfunction Watch: State of the \nJudiciary.'' In this article, Mr. Fallows notes that Mr. Obama ``is the \nonly president in the past few decades . . . to have more seats vacant \nas he began his re-election year than he inherited when he took \noffice.'' Moreover, Mr. Fallows further highlights the following: \n``During the Obama presidency thus far, fewer circuit court nominees \nhave been confirmed by the Senate than were confirmed during the first \nterms of any of the four preceding Presidents (Reagan through G.W. \nBush). Likewise, fewer Obama district court nominees have been \nconfirmed by the Senate than were confirmed during the first terms of \nthe four preceding presidents.''\n  The ranking member on the Judiciary Committee has noted that we are \ndoing better than when his predecessor was the ranking republican on \nthe Committee, and that is accurate. But we have not made up for the \nhistorically low confirmations allowed during that period or for the \nfact that in each of the last 2 years the Senate has adjourned without \nacting on 19 judicial nominations ready for final action each year.\n  Some seek to compare this first term of President Obama to President \nBush's second 4-year term, but as the Congressional Research Service \nReport demonstrates, the proper comparison is to President Bush's first \nterm. Nonetheless, I would remind the Senate that during President \nBush's second term, the Republican majority managed the confirmation of \n52 circuit and district court nominees while the Senate Democratic \nmajority worked to confirm 68 judicial nominees during the last 2 years \nof that presidency and reduced vacancies to 34 while holding hearings \nand votes on judicial nominees well into September 2008.\n  The simple fact is that the Senate is still lagging far behind what \nwe accomplished during the first term of President George W. Bush. \nDuring President Bush's first term we reduced the number of judicial \nvacancies by almost 75\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\npercent. When I became chairman in the summer of 2001, there were 110 \nvacancies. As chairman, I worked with the administration and Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle to confirm 100 judicial nominees of a \nconservative Republican President in 17 months.\n  Senate Democrats continued when in the minority to work with Senate \nRepublicans to confirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations \nwell into 2004, a presidential election year. At the end of that \npresidential term, the Senate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. In May 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to \nbelow 50 on the way to 28 that August. Despite 2004 being an election \nyear, we were able to reduce vacancies to the lowest level in the last \n20 years. At a time of great turmoil and political confrontation, \ndespite the attack on 9/11, the anthrax letters shutting down Senate \noffices, and the ideologically-driven judicial selections of President \nBush, we worked together to promptly confirm consensus nominees and to \nsignificantly reduce judicial vacancies.\n  By comparison, the vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at \nthis point in the first term of President Bush. While vacancies were \nreduced to 43 by June of President Bush's fourth year, in June of \nPresident Obama's fourth year they remain in the mid-70s. They remained \nnear or above 80 for nearly 3 years. We are 30 confirmations behind the \npace we set in 2001 through 2004. Of course, we could move forward if \nthe Senate were allowed to vote without further delay on the 15 \njudicial nominees ready for final action. The Senate could reduce \nvacancies below 60 and make progress.\n  The Judiciary Committee should be voting on more judicial nominees \nthis Thursday and we held a hearing for another three judicial nominees \nthis afternoon. With cooperation from Senate Republicans, the Senate \ncould make real progress and match what we have accomplished in prior \nyears.\n  After today, we still have much more work to do to help resolve the \njudicial vacancy crisis that has persisted for more than 3 years. Our \ncourts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are to \nreduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their day \nin court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  We need to work to reduce the vacancies that are burdening the \nFederal judiciary and the millions of Americans who rely on our Federal \ncourts to seek justice. Let us work in a bipartisan fashion to confirm \nthese qualified judicial nominees so that we can address the judicial \nvacancy crisis and so they can serve the American people.\n  Jeffrey Helmick was rated well qualified by a substantial majority of \nthe ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. In his 22-year \nlegal career as a litigator in private practice, Mr. Helmick has tried \napproximately 40 cases to verdict or judgment. Currently a principal at \nhis law firm, Mr. Helmick has the strong support of his home state \nSenators, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown and Republican Senator Rob \nPortman.\n  I join Senator Brown and Senator Portman in supporting the \nconfirmation of Jeffrey Helmick.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        [From the Congressional Research Service, June 1, 2012]\n\n  Nominations to U.S. Circuit and District Courts by President Obama \n                 During the 111th and 112th Congresses\n\n       (By Barry J. McMillion, Analyst on the Federal Judiciary)\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Recent Senate debates in the 112th Congress over judicial \n     nominations have focused on issues such as the relative \n     degree of success of President Barack Obama's nominees in \n     gaining Senate confirmation (compared with other recent \n     Presidents) as well as the effect of delayed judicial \n     appointments on judicial vacancy levels. The following report \n     addresses these issues, and others, by providing a \n     statistical overview of President Obama's nominees to U.S. \n     circuit court of appeals and U.S. district court judgeships, \n     current through May 31, 2012. Findings include the following:\n       President Obama thus far in his presidency has nominated 41 \n     persons to U.S. circuit court judgeships, 29 of whom have \n     been confirmed.\n       Of the 150 persons nominated thus far by President Obama to \n     U.S. district court judgeships, 117 have been confirmed.\n       The greatest number of President Obama's circuit court \n     nominees have been confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Fourth Circuit (6) and the Second Circuit (5).\n       The greatest number of President Obama's district court \n     nominees have been confirmed to judgeships located within the \n     Ninth Circuit (22) and the fewest to district court \n     judgeships within the First Circuit (3).\n       District court vacancies have grown in number over the \n     course of the Obama presidency, from 42 judgeships vacant \n     when President Obama took office to 59 at present. There \n     currently are 13 circuit court vacancies (the same number as \n     when President Obama took office).\n       During the Obama presidency thus far, fewer circuit court \n     nominees have been confirmed by the Senate than were \n     confirmed during the first terms of any of the four preceding \n     Presidents (Reagan through G.W. Bush).\n       Likewise, fewer Obama district court nominees have been \n     confirmed by the Senate than were confirmed during the first \n     terms of the four preceding Presidents.\n       President Obama is the only one of the three most recent \n     Presidents to have begun his fourth year in office with more \n     circuit and district court judgeships vacant than when he \n     took office.\n       During the Obama presidency, the average waiting time from \n     nomination to committee hearing has been, thus far, 69.6 days \n     for circuit court nominees and 83.2 days for district court \n     nominees.\n       During the Obama presidency, the average waiting time from \n     Senate Judiciary Committee report to Senate confirmation has \n     been 139.7 days for circuit court nominees and 105.1 days for \n     district court nominees.\n       Various factors might help explain differences or variation \n     found in judicial appointment statistics across recent \n     presidencies.\n       A President's opportunities to make circuit and district \n     court appointments will be affected by the number of judicial \n     vacancies existing at the time he takes office, as well as by \n     how many judges depart office, and how many new judgeships \n     are statutorily created, during his presidency.\n       The time taken by a President to select nominees for \n     judicial vacancies may be affected by whether the selection \n     of lower court nominees must compete with filling a Supreme \n     Court vacancy, whether the selection process itself is a \n     priority for a President, the level of consultation between a \n     President and a nominee's home state Senators, and the time \n     taken by home state Senators to make judicial candidate \n     recommendations.\n       Institutional and political factors which may influence the \n     processing of judicial nominations by the Senate include \n     ideological differences between the President and the \n     opposition party in the Senate, the extent of interest group \n     opposition to certain nominees, the presence or absence of \n     ``divided government,'' the point in a congressional session \n     when nominations arrive in the Senate, whether nominees have \n     the support of both of their home state Senators, and whether \n     the blue slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     requires the support of both home state Senators before a \n     nominee can receive a hearing or committee vote.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words and the \ninsight from Chairman Leahy and his leadership on trying to speed up \nthe confirmation process on a whole host of judges.\n  I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Iowa, but I take \nexception with a couple of things he said. No. 1, he compared the \nnumber of nominations during the second Bush 4 years with the first 4 \nObama years and said that the Senate was more cooperative now than it \nwas then. Clearly it was apples and oranges. We know--almost any \nschoolkid in America now knows--the dysfunction of the Senate in terms \nof the minority party blocking all kinds of things, from medium- to \nlow-level Federal appointments to the executive branch, to district \ncourt judges, to legislation. So I think Senator Leahy has addressed \nthat very aptly, and I don't need to go into detail there.\n  Senator Leahy also has spoken to the two public criticisms--shallow \nand vacuous that they are--of Jeffrey Helmick. The one on him \nrepresenting terrorists, I am not a lawyer, but I know that when a \nFederal judge asks a lawyer to represent somebody, the lawyer does it, \nas Jeffrey Helmick did. And, as Senator Leahy said on the ethics issue, \nthe Ohio Court of Appeals said that Mr. Helmick should be commended. \nThe supreme court agreed\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nunanimously that the letter they talked about was a client secret and \nthat Mr. Helmick acted in good faith. So those criticisms don't really \nstand the test of time in that way.\n  Again, I thank Senator Leahy and the Judiciary Committee for moving \nas quickly as they could move. This is a difficult time. At times, \nthere is Senate dysfunction and the minority party blocks or slow-walks \nsome of these nominees.\n  Jeffrey Helmick has been supported by a bipartisan, rigorous \ncommittee of 17 who come from the Southern District of Ohio and who \nhelp to choose nominees for the Northern District of Ohio. I spoke \npersonally with all but 1 or 2 of those 17 Republicans and Democrats \naround whom consensus was formed in support of Jeffrey Helmick. They \nthink he is an outstanding lawyer, jurist, and potential Federal judge. \nThe other Federal judges in the western region of the Northern District \nCourt in Ohio, which is out of Toledo--including a judge nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush--enthusiastically support Jeffrey Helmick.\n  Senator Grassley said he was a controversial nominee. He is only \ncontroversial in the Senate Judiciary Committee and among some of my \ncolleagues. He is not controversial in Ohio, where they know Jeffrey \nHelmick the best. He is not controversial in the Toledo bar. He is not \ncontroversial among people who know Jeffrey Helmick and who have \nwatched him perform his service to his community and watched him \nprofessionally and the way that he does his job as a lawyer in Toledo, \nOH, in Federal court or in State court. So the fact is, he is not a \ncontroversial nominee. He is only a controversial nominee in the U.S. \nSenate and in some places in Washington, DC. But we know he is \nqualified, and we know he is ready to serve.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote today to confirm Jeffrey Helmick to the \nU.S. Federal court in the Northern District of Ohio.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Jeffrey Helmick was rated ``well \nqualified'' by a substantial majority of the ABA's Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary. In his 22-year legal career as a litigator in \nprivate practice, Mr. Helmick has tried approximately 40 cases to \nverdict or judgment. Currently a principal at his law firm, Mr. Helmick \nhas the strong support of his home State Senators who have spoken in \nsupport of this nomination. He was also voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee nearly 3 months ago by a bipartisan majority. Given his \ndistinguished record in private practice and his bipartisan support, I \ntrust that he will be confirmed.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3773, June 6, 2012, the Record reads: . . . Northern \nDistrict of Ohio. Jeffrey Helmick . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. LEAHY. Mr. \nPresident, Jeffrey Helmick . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Some have chosen to criticize Mr. Helmick for his role as court-\nappointed defense counsel. Those who criticize him may not understand \nhow our justice system works. Our legal system is an adversary system, \npredicated upon legal advocacy for both sides. That is what Mr. Helmick \ndid at the request of the court.\n  No nominee should be disqualified for representing clients zealously. \nAt his confirmation hearing to become the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, John Roberts made the point:\n\n       ``[I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back \n     before the founding of the country that lawyers are not \n     identified with the positions of their clients. The most \n     famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the \n     British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that \n     for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution \n     in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule \n     of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.\n       Our Founders thought that they were not being given their \n     rights under the British system to which they were entitled, \n     and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that \n     what they were about was defending the rule of law, not \n     undermining it, and that principle, that you don't identify \n     the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the \n     views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is \n     critical to the fair administration of justice.''\n\n  Mr. Helmick was appointed by the court to represent a defendant and \nhe had an ethical obligation to advocate zealously for that client. \nThat was what he did, and he should not now be punished for doing his \nduty.\n  In addition, there has apparently been an objection to Mr. Helmick's \nhandling of an ethical dilemma where he refused to disclose a client \nsecret. This is particularly odd because the Ohio Court of Appeals who \nheard the case stated that Mr. Helmick ``should be commended for his \nprofessional and ethical behavior in a very difficult situation.'' In \naddition, although a divided Ohio Supreme Court ultimately ordered \ndisclosure of the letter based on a balancing test in a 4 3 decision, \nthe Court nevertheless agreed unanimously with Mr. Helmick that the \nletter was a client secret. Indeed, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \nMr. Helmick acted in good faith.\n  Let us confirm this good man and not try to tarnish his distinguished \nreputation. I join Senator Brown and Senator Portman in urging a vote \nfor confirmation.\n  I yield back the remaining time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, will the Senate Advise and Consent to the nomination \nof Jeffrey J. Helmick, of Ohio, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Ohio?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3773, June 6, 2012, the Record reads: The legislative \nclerk called . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The bill clerk \ncalled .. . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       Wisconsin Recall Election\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the results of last \nnight's recall election in the State of Wisconsin. After nearly 2 years \nof heated political debate, the people of Wisconsin made it clear last \nnight that they are not suffering from buyers' remorse. Two years ago, \nthey elected leaders committed to solving their State's budget crisis. \nLast night, they stood by those leaders for making the hard choices \nthat turned Wisconsin's deficit into a surplus.\n  Yesterday's election was very important. It was important because of \nthe example it provides to the Nation and the world of how a democracy \nshould work, with citizens who disagree vehemently about policy \nnonetheless coming together to accept the results of an open and fair \nelection.\n  It was important because of the message it sends with respect to \npublic employee unions. Last night's results serve as yet another \nreminder that the\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nAmerican people want serious answers to our Nation's fiscal problems, \nand they are tired of having labor unions dictate the terms of our \neconomic recovery.\n  Scott Walker never hid his agenda. He ran for office on a platform of \nreducing State spending, and Governor Walker immediately began \naddressing the State's problems after taking office. So what egregious \nacts did Governor Walker commit during his first months in office to \ntrigger this recall? First of all, his budget repair bill actually \nrequired Wisconsin State employees to contribute more to their \npensions. Prior to passage of the Walker budget, many State employees \ndid not contribute to their retirement benefits.\n  You heard that right. Facing a massive State deficit, Governor Walker \ndetermined that Wisconsin taxpayers should no longer foot the entire \nbill for the generous pensions of public employees. In other words, he \nasked State public employees to do what private sector employees have \ndone for a generation, contribute to their own retirement plan.\n  Next, he required that State employees pay a larger share of their \nhealth care premiums. The new law requires State employees to pay 12.6 \npercent of their health care premiums. By contrast, Federal employees \npay at least 25 percent of their health care premiums.\n  To put these reforms in terms that his liberal detractors might \nappreciate, the Governor was just asking for a little shared sacrifice. \nInstead of pitching in, however, the State's public employees pitched a \nfit. Then, most significantly, Governor Walker reformed a collective \nbargaining system for State employees. Above all else, it was this \ndecision that triggered the meltdown in Wisconsin last year and \nultimately led to the recall.\n  Facing the possibility that a State might successfully limit union \ninfluence and excesses, national labor groups turned Wisconsin into the \nfrontlines of labor agitation. I know some have tried to give me a \nreputation of being anti-union. That is ridiculous because I was raised \nin a union movement. I held a card for basically 10 years as I worked \nas a skilled tradesman in the construction industry.\n  But, in fact, I am not opposed to unionization if that is what \nemployees truly want. I simply believe workers should be free to choose \nwhether to unionize and do so in an environment that is free of \ncoercion or intimidation.\n  Once unions are formed, I do not believe they should enjoy \ndisproportionate bargaining power in their negotiations with \nmanagement. That said, unions of public sector employees present a \nunique set of issues for taxpayers and voters. Public sector unions \nhave inherent advantages in negotiations that private sector unions do \nnot. Most notably, public sector unions use their substantial influence \nin State politics to elect the very officials with whom they will be \nnegotiating their union contracts.\n  As the academic Dan DiSalvo and many others have recognized, when the \nFord Motor Company negotiates with the American Auto Workers, it is an \narm's length negotiation, with both parties having an interest in the \nongoing success of the firm. Yet public employee unions effectively \nnegotiate with themselves. There is no distance between them and the \npublic officials they helped to elect and expect payback from.\n  Franklin Roosevelt understood that because public employee unions \ncould elect their own boss, ``the process of collective bargaining, as \nusually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.''\n  George Meany, the first head of the AFL CIO, knew this relationship \nmade it ``impossible to bargain collectively with the government.''\n  These critical points are lost on today's Democratic Party, which \nincreasingly depends on the foot soldiers and largesse provided by \nthese unions. As a result, we have an untenable situation, where public \nsector unions are, in effect, negotiating against the taxpayers. After \nall, their salaries and benefits come at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  The fiscal impact of these rigged negotiations is most evidence in \nStates with the biggest budget problems. California faces a budget \ndeficit of nearly $16 billion this year alone. It has $65 billion in \nunfunded liabilities in its teachers' pension system and $136 billion \nin unfunded liabilities for its largest city and county employee \npension system.\n  The Illinois public employee pension system now has $83 billion in \nunfunded liabilities. So far, comprehensive efforts to reform these \nsystems and bring down costs have been stymied for one simple reason: \nPoliticians in those States do not have the courage of people such as \nGov. Scott Walker.\n  Our folks here who support the unions ought to be happy this is \nhappening because they themselves may not be able to accomplish this. \nThe courageous Governors, such as Governor Walker, can, and in the end \nthey are better off as Democrats because they have some reasonable \napproach toward some of these enormous problems that are affecting our \nStates.\n  Instead of reforming their systems, these States have more often \nopted to raise taxes to attempt to eliminate the shortfalls. Yet most \nof the States with the highest unfunded liabilities already have \nhigher-than-average tax rates.\n  Despite their many faults, private sector unions have a stake in the \nU.S. economy and the profitability of American businesses. Indeed, they \nhave a built-in incentive to ensure continued economic growth. True \nenough, they do not always act in accordance with that interest, which \nis probably the biggest reason why today less than 7 percent of private \nsector workers belong to a union. But, nevertheless, they need some \nlevel of continued growth in order to further their existence.\n\n  Public sector unions are an entirely different animal with a \ncompletely different set of interests. Unlike private sector \nbusinesses, State governments are not required to turn a profit. State \nofficials are accountable to voters, but, unlike stockholders, most \nvoters do not have the same expectations to see returns on their \ninvestments.\n  That being the case, public sector unions lack the same incentive to \nsee their negotiating counterparts succeed. There are no forces \nlimiting their incentive to simply maximize benefits for their \nmembership, regardless of what it might cost their employers. In order \nto succeed, even the most ambitious and shrewd private sector union \nneeds to account for its employer's ability to grow and expand.\n  Public sector unions are not subject to these sorts of limitations. \nThat is probably why they have been so successful. Today, about 37 \npercent of government employees belong to a union, which is five times \nthe unionization rate in the private sector. So it is easy to see why \nBig Labor pulled out all the stops to recall Governor Walker. Public \nsector unions are the future of the labor movement. Because of the \nlong, steady decline of private sector unions, Big Labor knows it must \nmaintain the strength of public sector unions in order to remain \nrelevant. Yet at the same time, the States that employ them face \nincredibly difficult budgetary decisions in the coming years and I \nbelieve without the ability to be able to get them under control \nbecause of the controls of the major parties.\n  Let's be clear about what it would mean if public employee unions \nprevailed in these fights. It means that instead of reducing spending, \nStates will have to raise taxes. It means that instead of eliminating \ngovernment waste, States will have to maintain the status quo, and, \nultimately, it means States will have to make a choice between paying \ntheir bills on the one hand and growing their economies on the other.\n  Going forward, it is absolutely vital that more States follow \nWisconsin's example. States should not have to choose between educating \ntheir kids and paying the full freight of public employee pensions. \nDuring such difficult economic times, they should not have to raise \ntaxes in order to keep their employees from having to pay a reasonable \nshare of their own benefits. In short, States should have the ability \nto balance budgetary priorities without being thwarted at every turn by \npublic employee unions that are only concerned with their own \ninterests.\n  Last night and this morning, the pundits were in full gear, \ndissecting the results in Wisconsin and prognosticating about the \nelection's long-term impact. To me, this exercise in democracy \ndemonstrates two things. First, the failure of the unions and the \nnational Democratic Party was not a failure of messaging or money. It \nwas a failure of ideas.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  Richard Weaver once wrote that ideas have consequences. That is \nabsolutely true. The ideas that Governor Walker proposed were \nreasonable ones that addressed a critical fiscal situation without \nundermining essential services in his State. Second, it is clear the \nDemocratic Party of Franklin Roosevelt, a party of blue-collar, private \nsector workers, has morphed into a party dominated by white-collar, \npublic workers.\n  The American people, beginning with Wisconsin, are rejecting this \nDemocratic Party and the priorities of its most influential \nstakeholders. The silent majority that gets up every day and goes to \nwork in the private sector is losing its appetite for allowing public \nemployee unions to dictate the Nation's fiscal policy.\n  There is one video going around of an opponent of Governor Walker's \nnear tears and saying that democracy was denied tonight. Au contraire. \nDemocracy is alive and well in Wisconsin and around the Nation, and the \nAmerican people are going to have their say. Last night's results \nshould serve as a reminder of the need to face our perilous fiscal \nsituation honestly and squarely.\n  It should also remind us that the American people will not punish \nleaders who stand and do the right thing, even in the face of powerful \nand vengeful opposition.\n  My hope is that the experience in Wisconsin will be replicated around \nthe country.\n  To borrow from one of Wisconsin's patron saints, Vince Lombardi, \n``Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.''\n  The unions have now had three bites at the apple since Governor \nWalker was first elected. Each time they have come up short. By \nprevailing, Governor Walker and Republicans in Wisconsin should stiffen \nthe spines of conservatives who might have been previously unwilling to \ntake on these public sector unions--public employee unions, if you \nwill. By losing, those unions have shown themselves to be increasingly \ndesperate and out of touch with the sentiments and concerns of everyday \ncitizens and taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I commend Governor Walker and his efforts to secure a \nprosperous future for the citizens of Wisconsin. His courage in the \nface of significant opposition is a model of statesmanship, and I look \nforward to working with him for many years to come.\n  Look, we all know the public sector unions have been out of control \nfor a long time. Throughout the country, benefits paid to public \nemployees have outpaced those in the private sector, and that includes \nFederal Government employees where the average pay is $80,000 a year \ncompared to $50,000 for the private sector. We all know that is \njustified in the eyes of some because it is ``so expensive'' to live in \nWashington, DC, or nearby. Why is it that expensive? Because we have \nbuilt the Federal Government at all costs, and we allow it to spend and \nspend rather than find more ways of living within our means.\n  There is a part of me that wishes we could move a number of these \nagencies out of Washington and put them out with the real people \nthroughout our country who have to live within their means, and who \ndon't have huge Washington, DC, salaries, which are huge to the average \nperson, but not always to the people who work in this very expensive \ntown. There they can mingle with the everyday people in this country \nwho are paying the freight.\n  By the way, we all know that according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the bottom 51 percent of all households don't pay any income \ntax or freight. There is a method in that madness, it seems to me. But \nit is the wrong method. Sooner or later we are all going to have to \nhelp pull the wagon and not just sit in the wagon and take advantage of \neverybody else. It ought to be done on a reasonable and decent basis.\n  But, once again, we all know the public sector unions are out of \ncontrol. The States where they have the biggest problems are the States \nwhere the public sector unions have dominated their elected politicians \nover and over and over again, so the elected politicians are afraid to \ntake them on, afraid to do the things that would straighten out their \nStates, as Governor Walker has said.\n  Instead of finding a lot of fault with Governor Walker, if I were a \nDemocrat, I would be saying: Thank God, somebody stood up. The fact is \nhe has stood up, and he should be given credit for that not \ncondemnation.\n  Frankly, I am very proud of the people of Wisconsin for standing up \nthe way they did. I think other States are going to have to do that, \ntoo, or there are going to be problems like we have never seen before. \nWe can name the States that have the problems. In almost every case \nthey are blue States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it has become sort of a personal \ntradition of mine to come to the floor each week to report on the \nstatus of the dangers to our Earth and climate from the relentless \ncarbon pollution that we have to face, and this is a bellwether week. \nThis is our first week back in session in the Senate since our break \nlast week, and during that time we have had a first. There were reports \nfrom the atmospheric measuring station that the carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere broke 400 parts per million.\n  The Christian Science Monitor has reported on this, stating \nmonitoring stations across the Arctic this spring are measuring more \nthan 400 parts per million of the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide in \nthe atmosphere. The number isn't quite a surprise because it has been \nrising at an accelerating pace.\n  Years ago, it passed the 350 parts-per-million mark that many \nscientists say is the highest safe level for carbon dioxide. It now \nstands globally at 395.\n  The story continues, saying it has been at least 800,000 years--\nprobably more--since Earth saw carbon dioxide levels in the 400s, \naccording to the climate scientists involved. They point out that the \nArctic is the leading indicator in global warming, both in carbon \ndioxide in the air and in its effects.\n  Pieter Tans, a senior NOAA scientist, says this is the first time the \nentire Arctic has been that high. He calls a 400 number ``depressing.''\n  The Christian Science Monitor also reported that global carbon \ndioxide emissions from fossil fuels hit a record high of 34.8 billion \ntons released in 2011.\n  Another report from the Sustainable Business News said readings are \ncoming in at 400 parts per million and higher all over the Arctic. They \nhave been recorded in Alaska, Greenland, Norway, Iceland, and even \nMongolia; and 400 parts per million is beyond what scientists consider \n``safe'' in terms of human society.\n  It goes on saying in reporting of a 2009 paper in the journal \nScience, researchers concluded ``the only time in the last 20 million \nyears that we find evidence for carbon dioxide levels similar to the \n[then] modern level of 387 parts per million was 15 to 20 million years \nago, when the planet was dramatically different.''\n  It also says:\n\n       How different? It says that ``Global temperatures were 5 to \n     10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today. The sea \n     level was 75 to 120 feet higher than it is today, there was \n     no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on \n     Antarctica and Greenland.''\n       According to NASA's leading climate scientist, James \n     Hanson, ``that level of heat-trapping gases would assure that \n     the disintegration of the ice sheets would accelerate out of \n     control. Sea levels would rise and destroy coastal cities. \n     Global temperatures would become intolerable, and 20 to 50 \n     percent of the planet species would be driven to extinction. \n     Civilization would be at risk.\n\n  So this was a somber benchmark to have passed. As I have said before, \nwe have had the experiences--humankind--of living within a bandwidth \nbetween 190 and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide for about \n800,000 years, which is going back into the very early days of our \nspecies--even before then.\n\n  I think the famous Lucy, the prehistoric human, was 150,000, 160,000 \nyears ago. So this goes way back before then. We started agriculture \nabout 10,000 years ago. Before then, we were picking things off of \ntrees and hunting small animals. We weren't even farming yet.\n  When we go back 800,000 years, that is basically for as long as we \ncan imagine on this planet, without going back into previous geologic \neras. That has been the bandwidth--800,000 years, 190 to 300 parts per \nmillion. We rocketed\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nout of that and blew through 350 several years ago, and now we have \ngone through 400, at least in the Arctic, and that is where we will go \nglobal-wide if this continues. There is no reason it will not continue \nbecause we keep increasing the amount of carbon pollution we emit into \nthe atmosphere.\n  I regret I have to come here every week and continue to bring grim \nnews, but that is the fact, and the day will come when we are going to \nhave to deal with it. I hope it is not too late for us when we finally \nget around to it. There is the prospect that it is too late because \nonce the carbon is up in the atmosphere, it continues to do its work.\n  The campaign that has been deployed to try to diminish the science of \nclimate change, to try to confuse the public, and try to create a \ndisabling measure of doubt has been reprehensible. It is based on \nfalsehood. It is steeped in impropriety and special influence. It is \ninhibiting the ability of the Congress to do its job for the American \npeople--not because there is any real doubt about the science but \nbecause the special interests that benefit from the status quo have \nentirely inappropriate levels of influence in this body, and they are \ninsisting either directly or through phony front organizations, such as \nthe Heartland Institute, which has recently put itself in jeopardy by \ncomparing people who think climate change is actually happening to the \nUnabomber--now, there is a responsible public debate. That blew up in \ntheir faces because they had gone too far. The lying, the phony \nscience, taking money from the polluters, and the phony operation they \nran didn't go too far. The comparison to Ted Kazinski, the Kazinski \nbillboard was that one step too far.\n  There is some pushback on that, but that doesn't lift the burden on \nthe polluting industries that are manipulating and maneuvering in \nWashington to prevent us from doing what needs to be done and doing so \nthrough false and phony organizations. Even if the Heartland Institute \nis gone, there are plenty of others, and the process continues.\n  I think it is going to be a very harsh judgment that history brings \nto bear on this generation of Representatives and Senators that, as a \nbody, we were willing to step away from our duty when the signal was \nclear. We were willing to listen to the siren song of special \ninterests. We put their money in our pockets. We put our consciences on \nhold. We put the blinders on about the facts, and we marched forward \nfoolishly when we should have been preparing.\n  I am going to continue to do this. I hope the point comes soon when \nwe can begin to realize that putting a price on carbon pollution, \ndeveloping American clean energy that creates American clean energy \njobs and begin to take care of this world as it increasingly sends us \nwarnings about the damage that we are doing is the right and wise and \nproper thing to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3776-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3776-S3777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \norganization from my home State of Nevada whose continued dedication to \nour Nation's active military, veterans, and their families is \ninspiring. As the Shine Family Foundation celebrates their first \nanniversary of becoming a recognized nonprofit organization, I thank \nthem for their commitment to assisting our country's military community \nduring times of hardship. We rely on organizations like the Shine \nFamily Foundation to ease the stress that military families face when a \nfamily member is deployed. I applaud the Shine Family Foundation for \ntheir commitment to our heroes who sacrifice so much to keep America \nsafe.\n  The Shine Family Foundation was founded to address the needs of \nmilitary personnel and their families when they are separated due to \nprolonged and often multiple deployments. As their loved ones are far \naway from home sacrificing their own well-being for the safety of our \nNation, military families often struggle with hardships while they are \napart. Having a brother who served overseas, I understand the \nsacrifices that military families make when a loved one is deployed.\n  The Shine Family Foundation is committed to ensuring soldiers \ndeployed across the globe are able to connect with their families back \nhome. Last year, the Shine Family Foundation's gifting program helped \nprovide school supplies, Christmas gifts, food, gift cards, and phone \ncards to more than 100 military families. Recognizing the changing \ndynamics of our military force, the foundation also provides assistance \nto veterans returning from Active Duty to help welcome them home. They \nalso offer a mentoring program for young children whose parents or \nsiblings are serving in war zones.\n  I commend the Shine Family Foundation's commitment to honor and give \nback to our military communities. We must always remember the brave men \nand women in uniform and their families who make grave sacrifices to \nprotect our freedom. As their organization grows, I know they will \nmaintain a commitment to touching the lives of our troops and their \nfamilies. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \nhonorable organization for all they do for our Nation's heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3777-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3777-S3778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Jan \nKarski, who, as a young officer in the Polish Underground during the \nSecond World War, was among the first to provide eyewitness accounts of \nthe Holocaust to the world.\n  Shaped by his own personal loss during one of the darkest hours in \nhuman history, Dr. Karski had the moral clarity to make distinctions \nbetween good and evil, and the personal courage to speak out and fight \nfor good and against evil. After being captured and tortured by the \nNazis, Dr. Karski escaped and became a courier for the Polish \nUnderground, smuggling information out of Poland to the Polish \ngovernment-in-exile. Among his many missions, Dr. Karski, who was Roman \nCatholic, twice infiltrated Warsaw's Jewish Ghetto through a series of \nunderground tunnels disguised as a Nazi auxiliary guard.\n  Dr. Karski showed fearlessness in the face of a regime built on fear, \nand he was not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom and take on the \nenemies of freedom. In 1943, Dr. Karski traveled to the United Kingdom \nand the United States, where he was the first credible eyewitness to \nbrief British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden and President\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nRoosevelt about the Holocaust in an effort to build international \npressure against Hitler and the Nazi regime. While his pleas did not \nlead to the quick action that they deserved, Dr. Karski persisted in \nreporting on the brutality that would ultimately prompt meaningful \ninternational intervention.\n  After the war, Dr. Karski resettled in the United States, where he \nearned his doctorate from Georgetown University and taught for 4 \ndecades, warning generations of students about the dangers of \nauthoritarianism, including one notable student: President Bill \nClinton. During his lifetime and following his death in 2000, Jan \nKarski was and has been the recipient of dozens of international awards \nhonoring his courageous work. I was proud to join my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Levin, and Cardin last year in writing to President \nObama to urge his consideration of Dr. Karski for highest civilian \nhonor--the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I am delighted that President \nObama announced at the Holocaust Memorial Museum last month that Dr. \nKarski will be honored posthumously with the award later this month.\n  The choice to confront tyranny is not an easy one, but it is \nAmerica's responsibility and purpose as a Nation. Through his decades \nof devoted service, Jan Karksi carried out this mission and lived its \nvalues. And in doing so, he was a champion of the cause that has \ndefined our country since its birth--the cause that has given us an \nenduring purpose and a national destiny: the cause of human freedom.\n  I am encouraged to know that there are efforts underway to ensure \nthat Jan Karski's story is shared widely in the years ahead and in \nparticular during 2014, which will mark the centennial of his birth. \nJan Karski's example should inspire in us the belief that courageous \nand determined people can help to shape the course of human history for \nthe better and remind us what is required to ensure that when we say \nNever Again, it will truly mean Never Again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3778-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF RICHFIELD, UTAH\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the city \nof Richfield, UT, for winning the Joining Forces Community Challenge. \nThis honor is of exceptional note as Richfield was the only \nmunicipality chosen as a finalist in the competition.\n  The Joining Forces Community Challenge was launched in July of 2011, \nseeking to encourage and promote creative ways of showing support for \nmembers of the military and their families. Citizens of Richfield have \nbeen strongly supportive of military personnel and their loved ones for \nyears, especially the men and women who are stationed in and around \nRichfield. The 2nd Battalion, 222nd Field Artillery unit of the Utah \nNational Guard is based out of Richfield, and has been deployed four \ntimes since September 11, with soldiers going to both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Nicknamed the ``Triple Deuce,'' the 222nd is beloved in \nUtah, and the extraordinary community support made for a perfect \nsubmission to the challenge.\n  Local businesses have found numerous ways to throw their weight \nbehind the unit. Many of them offer discounts and special service to \nmembers of the 222nd and their families, and include messages of \nsupport in their advertising. Richfield's newspaper, the Richfield \nReaper, sends free copies to deployed servicemembers and often prints \nphotos sent in by soldiers so that family, friends, and neighbors can \nstay connected back home. Richfield City covers utility bills in full \nfor the families of deployed soldiers.\n  In 2005, the Richfield Chamber of Commerce organized a campaign that \ncame to be known as Coins for a Camouflage Christmas. The goal was to \nthrow an extraordinary Christmas party for military families during the \nholidays while the 222nd was deployed on an 18-month-long mission in \nIraq. Participating businesses kept special containers next to their \ncash registers for donations, and asked customers for their spare \nchange. Tens of thousands of dollars were collected, and in addition to \nthe party, each child of a deployed parent received a special gift from \nthat parent delivered by Santa Claus. In 2011, when it was thought that \nthe unit would again be deployed over Christmas, Coins for a Camouflage \nChristmas was organized once again. Rather than throwing a party for \nthe families of deployed soldiers, Richfield got to throw a welcome \nhome party for soldiers who had come back earlier than scheduled as \nAmerican forces withdrew from Iraq.\n  The Richfield library has joined in the effort to support the 222nd. \nAfter discovering that one daughter of a deployed soldier was trying to \nlearn about Iraq because her father was there, the library put in a \nspecial order for books describing the places where parents in the unit \nwere deployed. When the books were received, the library held a special \ngathering to introduce the new material.\n  City and community leaders were also instrumental in creating and \nsigning onto the military's Community Covenant Outreach Program in \nRichfield. Participants promise soldiers and their families support and \nservices from Richfield. As part of the program, two large Community \nCovenant signs were built at each end of town to show visitors how much \nRichfield cares about military families.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Richfield community has contributed \nmore than a quarter of a million dollars to build a veterans memorial. \nThe memorial is currently under construction and slated to be completed \nlater this year.\n  Richfield has demonstrated over and over again that it is a community \nthat cares deeply about the men and women who fight to keep us safe and \nfree. The special love for the Triple Deuce is a shining example of how \na unit should be supported by local communities around the country. I \nsincerely thank my fellow Utahns in Richfield who continue to set a \nhigh standard of excellence in showing love and respect for our brave \nheroes. Finally, I add my grateful appreciation to all of our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3778-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3778-S3779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMERING HARVEY L. SCHWARTZ\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my \ndear friend, Harvey L. Schwartz, who passed away on April 13 at his \nhome in Harrisville, NH. While I was not able to attend Harvey's \nmemorial service on May 20, I did send a remembrance to be read, and \nwanted to share these thoughts with my colleagues on a truly remarkable \nman.\n  Harvey was born in 1929 at the start of the Great Depression into a \nfamily of modest means living in Brooklyn, NY. He graduated from \nBrooklyn College and then Columbia Law School. Harvey's career began at \nTime, Inc., where he was groomed for leadership in the company's \nexecutive training program. Later, he answered his country's call, \nserving with the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps in Japan during the \nKorean War and then in these very halls as an aide to Senator Thurston \nMorton of Kentucky. He went on to have an impressive career in \ninternational business with a focus on Latin America. It was experience \nthat, Harvey would readily admit, greatly expanded his worldview.\n  Harvey and his wife, Nell, moved to New Hampshire in 1987. \nFortunately for my fellow Granite Staters and me, they put down lasting \nroots in our State. During his later years in New Hampshire, Harvey \ncalled upon his years of experience in the public and private sectors \nat home and abroad, to find common ground and to unite when too often \nthere were calls to divide. Harvey was a proud Republican, but he was \nalso a consensus builder and a problem solver. I think my colleagues \nwould agree that we could use more people like Harvey Schwartz today. I \nask unanimous consent that my May 20 remembrance be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows.\n\n       I was very sad to hear the news of Harvey's passing, but I \n     understand he had requested this event be a celebration of \n     his life, so I will keep this reflection upbeat.\n       We were all extremely fortunate when, in 1987, Harvey and \n     his beloved Nell chose to settle down in the lovely and \n     historic town of Harrisville. From then on, Harvey had a \n     great impact on New Hampshire.\n       I first became aware of Harvey's impact on the state \n     through the critical role he played in helping block the \n     proposed Route 101 bypass through Harrisville. That was an \n     impressive feat and one that would most likely have failed \n     were it not for Harvey's involvement.\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n       Community leaders, business leaders, political leaders of \n     every stripe listened to Harvey. I was especially hopeful \n     they would listen to him when, to my surprise, he supported \n     my run for governor! Though Harvey was a staunch Republican, \n     his spirit of bipartisanship was strong, and one that I \n     admired a great deal.\n       While I was Governor, we held an Executive Council Meeting \n     in Harrisville. It was a proud day for Harrisville, and \n     therefore, a proud day for Harvey. Unfortunately, while we \n     were there, a rather challenging issue facing our state \n     government required immediate consideration. Harvey, as \n     creative and giving as always, offered up his beautiful home \n     with its breathtaking view of Mount Monadnock for a private \n     emergency meeting. Once again, Harvey was finding solutions \n     for his state.\n       Harvey's enthusiasm for public service and his community \n     were evident to all who knew him. Over the years, we worked \n     closely on the issues that matter for New Hampshire, \n     particularly how we provide economic opportunities for all of \n     our citizens, especially our state's young people. In fact, \n     right until his passing, Harvey served as director of the \n     High Bridge Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to providing \n     high school students in New Hampshire with the tools \n     necessary to thrive in a changing economy. He was doing his \n     part to prepare the next generation of Granite Staters.\n       Harvey was a great consensus builder. At a time when too \n     many focus on what divides, Harvey worked to unite.\n       Harvey, you will be missed, but your legacy will be honored \n     and remembered for generations to come because of your hard \n     work and your dedication to New Hampshire.\n       And for that, we all thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3779-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING JSI STORE FIXTURES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, manufacturing has long provided \nwell-paying jobs and economic growth for Americans, especially in my \nhome State of Maine. As co-chair of the Senate Task Force on \nManufacturing, I am acutely aware that a healthy manufacturing sector \nis essential to our Nation's economic prosperity.\n  Regrettably, our Nation's manufacturing sector was particularly hard \nhit by the recent recession, and continues to suffer through this \nunderwhelming recovery. As this is a challenge faced by many of \nAmerica's manufacturers, I would like to take the opportunity to \nrecognize a company in my home State, that despite all obstacles, has \novercome economic difficulties to become one of Maine's most successful \nbusinesses. Today, I rise to salute JSI Store Fixtures in Milo, ME, a \npremier manufacturer of high-end wood and metal fixtures for the \nsupermarket industry and a distinguished member of the Milo community.\n  Over 20 years ago, JSI was started in the Awalt family's basement \nwith just a table saw and an aspiration. Brothers Barry and Terry Awalt \nand their step-father, Clayton Johndro, rallied family support to found \nJSI Store Fixtures; which has since grown to manufacture custom \ndisplays for many of the Nation's largest supermarket chains, \nincluding: Hannaford Supermarkets, Whole Foods, Giant, Wegmans, \nSweetbay, and several others.\n  When Mark Awalt, brother to Barry and Terry, joined the company in \n1997, JSI had already outgrown the family basement. In fact, it had \noutgrown its original facility, a 30,000-square foot plant located in \nHowland. Mark sought the help of the Maine Small Business Development \nCenter at the Eastern Maine Development Corporation and the Piscataquis \nCounty Economic Development Council to receive a community development \nblock grant and a Small Business Administration guaranteed loan. This \nfunding enabled JSI to expand and relocate to the vacant Dexter Shoe \nPlant in 2000, garnering many employees who had previously worked for \nDexter Shoe. JSI now ships 95 percent of its products out of Maine and \nin 2011 generated approximately $20 million in sales--proof that small \nbusinesses are economically successful, even in the most rural parts of \nMaine. Today, JSI is the region's largest employer with 130 employees \nand has become a cherished staple in the community.\n  Additionally, the hard work and perseverance of JSI's second-to-none \nemployees cannot be overstated as they boast an incredible record in a \nkey area--safety excellence. At a time when JSI sales increased 400 \npercent, the company reached the outstanding safety milestone of over \n10 years without a lost-time accident. Owners, managers, and employees \nof JSI have implemented and nurtured a safety focus over the last \ndecade and were recognized for this momentous feat by the Manufacturers \nof Maine Group Trust's, Richard J. Haines Award for Safety Excellence \nin 2007. The award honors a member of the trust who excels in six \ndifferent areas of employee safety: commitment, persistence, \nparticipation, performance, consistency, and innovation. In 2009, JSI \nwas celebrated again by the Trust for having the most effective safety \nprogram.\n  But it is not just safety excellence that JSI employees practice, its \ndistinction in customer service, quality and industry leading on-time \nshipping that has powered JSI to become one of the largest employers in \nPiscataquis County. Their success has certainly not gone unnoticed, as \ntheir list of accolades is truly remarkable. In 1999, JSI Store \nFixtures received the Hannaford Brothers Distinguished Vendor Award for \nexceptional service and high product quality. Then in 2004, co-owner \nMark Awalt was named by the U.S. Small Business Administration as \nMaine's Small Business Person of the Year, followed by JSI receiving \nthe Governor's Award for Business Excellence in 2011. This renowned \naward honors Maine companies that demonstrate a high level of \ncommitment to their community, employees and to manufacturing or \nservice excellence.\n  At the same time, JSI is perhaps most prominently known for their \ninvaluable contributions to the local community. Their steadfast \nloyalty to the region has been demonstrated through numerous projects \nand fundraisers to benefit area children and the local school \ncommunity. For example, through the Clayton Johndro Golf Tournament \nwhich is held annually, JSI raised over $10,000 for youth programs in \n2011 alone. Once again, highlighting their extraordinary contributions, \nJSI received the 2010 Maine Education Association's Corporate Award in \nhonor of their significant impact on area youth and the Distinguished \nService Award in the same year from the Milo/Brownville Kiwanis.\n  A true asset to the state of Maine, JSI has exemplified outstanding \nleadership and a passion for helping others that is certainly worthy of \ncommendation. I am proud to extend my congratulations to the Awalt \nfamily and everyone at JSI Store Fixtures for their tremendous \naccomplishments. They are a shining example of the dedication to \nexcellence, quality workmanship, commitment to community and service \nthat Maine is known for. I offer my best wishes for continued success \nto JSI, and look forward to hearing more about their achievements in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3779-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3779-S3780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:50 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 241.

Res. 482\n\n       Whereas the United States Chamber of Commerce (referred to \n     in this preamble as the ``Chamber'') was founded on April 22, \n     1912, at the request of President William Howard Taft, \n     thereby creating a unified voice for business in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, on that date, President Taft supported the \n     creation of the Chamber by declaring before 700 delegates \n     from businesses, chambers, and associations representing \n     every State, ``We want your assistance in carrying on the \n     government in reference to those matters that affect the \n     business and the business welfare of the country, and we do \n     not wish to limit your discretion in that matter. We wish \n     that your advice should be as free and unrestricted as \n     possible, but we need your assistance and we ask for it.'';\n       Whereas, during the 100 years since its founding, the \n     Chamber has represented and advocated the interests of the \n     business community in Washington, DC, across the United \n     States, and around the world;\n       Whereas the Chamber continues to give voice to business in \n     the United States and rally the business community around \n     policies that create jobs and grow the economy;\n       Whereas the Chamber is committed to preserving and \n     advancing free market principles and the free enterprise \n     system of the United States, which has created growth, \n     opportunities, innovation, and jobs, and has empowered \n     generations of individuals in the United States to fulfill \n     the American dream;\n       Whereas, for a century, the Chamber has played an \n     instrumental role in major pieces of legislation on trade, \n     infrastructure, energy, and a host of other issues integral \n     to generating economic growth, supporting the business \n     community, and creating jobs in the United States; and\n       Whereas, for the next 100 years, and well beyond, the \n     Chamber will continue to work to restore and strengthen the \n     prosperity and competitiveness of the United States and will \n     continue to represent the interests of businesses in the \n     United States of every size, sector, and region before \n     Congress, the executive branch, the courts, and the court of \n     public opinion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the United States \n     Chamber of Commerce on its 100th anniversary.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ncongratulating the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on defending and advancing \nfree market principles for the past 100 years.\n  For a century, the Chamber has helped business owners all across the \ncountry, from the Great Depression to the current fiscal crisis our \nNation is struggling with today. The chamber and its member chambers \nand businesses have continued to find ways to help keep our economy \ngrowing and businesses hiring.\n  In 1962, marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the chamber, \nPresident Kennedy said: ``The foundation of the Chamber in April of \n1912 marked a turning point in the relations between government and \nbusiness.'' This remains true to this day.\n  When the Chamber turned 70, President Reagan joked:\n\n       I remember the day you started. And like good wine, you \n     have grown better, not older.\n\n  He then quipped:\n\n       The membership of the Chamber of Commerce of the United \n     States is the only thing that has grown faster than the \n     Federal Government--thank heaven!\n\n  The free enterprise system is the backbone of the American economy, \nand nobody embodies it more than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Res. 483\n\n       Whereas yellow corrugated stainless steel tubing (referred \n     to in this preamble as ``CSST'') is flexible gas piping used \n     to convey natural gas or propane to household appliances in \n     homes and businesses;\n       Whereas since 1990, yellow CSST has been installed in more \n     than 6,000,000 homes and businesses in the United States;\n       Whereas field reports and research suggest that if direct \n     or indirect lightning strikes a structure, the risk for \n     electrical arcing between the metal components in a structure \n     with yellow CSST may be reduced by means of equipotential \n     bonding and grounding;\n       Whereas proper bonding of CSST is defined in section 7.13.2 \n     of the 2009 edition of the NFPA 54: National Fuel Gas Code, \n     and is referenced in info note 2 in section 250.104 of the \n     2011 edition of the NFPA 70: National Electric Code;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals \n     supports the proper bonding of yellow CSST to current \n     National Fire Protection Association Code to reduce the \n     possibility of gas leaks and fires from lightning strikes;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals is \n     working to educate relevant stakeholders, including fire, \n     building, and housing officials, consumers, homeowners, and \n     construction professionals about the need to properly bond \n     yellow CSST in legacy installations and in all new \n     installations in accordance with the most recent building \n     codes and manufacture installation instructions;\n       Whereas the bonding of yellow CSST in legacy installations \n     is an important public safety matter that merits alerting \n     homeowners, relevant State and local fire, building, and \n     housing officials, and construction professionals such as \n     electricians, contractors, plumbers, inspectors, and home-\n     improvement specialists: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends efforts to promote and enhance public safety \n     and consumer awareness on proper bonding of yellow corrugated \n     stainless steel tubing (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``CSST'') as defined in the National Fire Protection \n     Association Code; and\n       (2) encourages further educational efforts for the public, \n     relevant building and housing officials, consumers, \n     homeowners, and construction professionals on the need to \n     properly bond yellow CSST retroactively and moving forward in \n     houses that contain the product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/06/senate-section/article/S3782-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3782-S3783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 484--DESIGNATING JUNE 7, 2012, AS ``NATIONAL HUNGER \n                            AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Casey, Mr. \nMoran, Mr. Brown of Ohio, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

with any other country or \n     any form of partition or secession;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey illegally occupies the \n     northern area of Cyprus with an armed force of 43,000 troops;\n       Whereas Article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the \n     Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva \n     August 12, 1949, states, ``The Occupying Power

Turkish \n     austerity measures during demonstrations in 2011, with \n     hundreds shouting and holding signs reading, ``Ankara, get \n     your hand off our shores.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, Turkey's European Union \n     Minister, Egemen Bagis, called for ``annexing northern Cyprus \n     to Turkey,'' an action that would be in direct violation of \n     the United Nations Charter,

seize and exploit the energy resources of \n     Cyprus;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has engaged in a variety \n     of provocative and bellicose actions, including sending \n     warships off the southern coast of Cyprus to escort a Turkish \n     research vessel looking for hydrocarbon deposits, conducting \n     air and naval military exercises south of Cyprus in the area \n     of exploration, declaring invalid the agreement between \n     Israel and Cyprus demarcating their maritime borders, and \n     threatening the use of military action against Cyprus;\n       Whereas the highest levels of the United States Government \n     have privately urged the Government of Turkey not to follow \n     through with its threats against Cyprus for exercising its \n     sovereign right to explore its natural resources; and\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2012, the Government of Turkey began \n     illegally drilling for oil and natural gas on the island of \n     Cyprus, within the sovereign territory of the Republic of \n     Cyprus: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n

implement all United Nations Security Council Resolutions on \n     Cyprus;\n       (3) supports the Republic of Cyprus in its plans to explore \n     and exploit energy reserves within its Exclusive Economic \n     Zone (EEZ), and praises the Governments of the Republic of \n     Cyprus and Israel for working cooperatively to develop the \n     energy holdings in the region;\n       (4) urges the Government of Turkey to cease all activities \n     and plans to further develop energy resources illegally \n     within the territory and EEZ of the Republic of Cyprus;\n       (5) opposes the Government of Turkey's threatening \n     statements and naval movements designed to prevent the \n     Republic of Cyprus from exploiting its energy resources;\n       (6) expresses serious concern about the effort by the \n     Government of Turkey to colonize the area of northern Cyprus \n     by sending hundreds of thousands of non-Cypriot Turkish \n     citizens to live in Cyprus;\n       (7) considers the Government of Turkey in grave violation \n     of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the \n     Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva \n     August 12, 1949, by transferring parts of its civilian \n     population into occupied northern Cyprus; and\n       (8) urges the President to call on the Government of Turkey \n     to end its

REPORT ON EFFECTS OF BUDGET SEQUESTRATION ON THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inability of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \n     Reduction to find $1,200,000,000,000 in savings will trigger \n     automatic funding reductions known as ``sequestration'' to \n     the Department of Defense of $492,000,000,000 between 2013 \n     and 2021 under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a).\n       (2) These reductions are in addition to reductions of \n     $487,000,000,000 already being implemented by the Department \n     of Defense, and would decrease the readiness and capabilities \n     of the Armed Forces while increasing risks to the effective \n     implementation of the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The leaders of the Department of Defense have \n     consistently testified that threats to the national security \n     of the United States have increased, not decreased. Secretary \n     of Defense Leon Panetta said that these reductions would \n     ``inflict severe damage to our national defense for \n     generations'', comments that have been echoed by the \n     Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n       (4) While reductions in funds available for the Department \n     of Defense will automatically commence January 2, 2013, \n     uncertainty regarding the reductions has already exacerbated \n     Department of Defense efforts to plan future defense budgets.\n       (5) Sequestration will have a detrimental effect on the \n     industrial base that supports the Department of Defense.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than August 15, 2012, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a detailed report on the impact on the \n     Department of Defense of the sequestration of funds \n     authorized and appropriated for fiscal year 2013 for the \n     Department of Defense, if automatically triggered on January \n     2, 2013, under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the readiness of the Armed Forces, including impacts to \n     steaming hours, flying hours, and full spectrum training \n     miles, and an estimate of the increase or decrease in \n     readiness (as defined in the C status C 1 through C 5).\n       (B) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the ability of the Department of Defense to carry out the \n     National Military Strategy of the United States, and any \n     changes to the most recent Risk Assessment of the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff under section 153(b) of title 10, \n     United States Code arising from sequestration.\n       (C) A detailed estimate of the reduction in force of \n     civilian personnel as a result of sequestration, including \n     the estimated timing of such reduction in force actions and \n     timing of reduction in force notifications thereof.\n       (D) A list of the programs, projects, and activities across \n     the Department of Defense, the military departments, and the \n     elements and components of the Department of Defense that \n     would be reduced or terminated as a result of sequestration.\n       (E) An estimate of the number and value of all contracts \n     that will be terminated, restructured, or revised in scope as \n     a result of sequestration, including an estimate of potential \n     termination costs and of increased contract costs due to \n     renegotiation and reinstatement of contracts.\n       (F) An assessment of the impact on ongoing military \n     operations, and the safety of United States military \n     personnel, of sequestration of funds in accounts for overseas \n     contingency operations.\n       (3) Assumptions.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall assume the following:\n       (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the funds \n     subject to sequester are the funds in all 050 accounts, \n     including all unobligated balances.\n       (B) Funds in accounts for military personnel are exempt \n     from the sequester.\n       (4) Presentation of certain information.--In listing \n     programs, projects, and activities under paragraph (2)(D), \n     the report required by paragraph (1) shall set forth for each \n     the following:\n       (A) The most specific level of budget item identified in \n     applicable appropriations Acts.\n       (B) Related classified annexes and explanatory statements.\n       (C) Department of Defense budget justification documents \n     DOD P 1 and R 1 as subsequently modified by congressional \n     action, and as submitted by the Department of Defense \n     together with the budget materials for the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2013 (as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code).\n       (D) Department of Defense document O 1 for operation and \n     maintenance accounts for fiscal year 2013, for which purpose \n     the term ``program, project, or activity'' means the budget \n     activity account and sub account for the program, project, or \n     activity as submitted in such document O 1.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committees on Armed Services, Appropriations, and \n     the Budget of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committees on Armed Services, Appropriations, and \n     the Budget of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2163.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 484, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 484) designating June 7, 2012, as \n     National Hunger Awareness Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in honor of National Hunger \nAwareness Day, which takes place on June 7. On this day, we focus on \nthe difficult reality that exists for millions of Americans. Hunger is \na form of poverty, and the persistence of hunger in the wealthiest \nnation in the world is both alarming and unacceptable. It is long past \ndue that we recognize the devastating impact of hunger and commit to \nprotect the anti-hunger programs that help children and families in \ntheir time of need.\n  Today, June 6, marks a sad day in America, the forty-fourth \nanniversary of Senator Robert Kennedy's death. In April 1967, Senator \nKennedy visited homes in the Mississippi Delta where he was stunned to \nsee babies with distended bellies and ice boxes and cupboards bare of \nfood. Senator Kennedy was visibly moved by those he met with on his \ntrip and went back to Washington to make hunger a national issue and to \nraise federal support for hungry children and families.\n  Today the fight continues. Hunger remains a reality in all of our \ncommunities. We see it in the long lines at our food pantries. We hear \nit from seniors forced to choose between groceries and medication. And \nwe see it in the faces of children at school who have not had a decent \nmeal since yesterday's school lunch.\n  During a visit to a food bank in Champaign, IL, I noticed a young \nwoman who I thought worked there or served on the board, but when she \nspoke with me I learned that she is a teacher's aide in a local school \nand a single mom with two kids. While she is happy to have her teaching \njob, she doesn't earn enough to keep food on the table and must rely on \nthe food bank and food stamps.\n  Her story is not unique. Millions of families live each day not \nknowing if or how they will put food on the table. Rather than thinking \nabout what the next meal will be, parents worry if there will be a next \nmeal. Today, 50 million people have trouble putting food on the table, \nand 740,000 children live in a food insecure household. Where there is \npoverty, we see a greater demand for emergency food programs and \nsupport. Fortunately, programs like the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program--SNAP--Women, Infant, Children--WIC--Program, and \nschool meal programs provide food for hungry children and families. \nThese programs have responded to the growing need by helping low and \nmiddle-class families, children, and seniors maintain a healthy diet.\n  The benefits of SNAP reach far beyond helping households maintain a \nhealthy diet. SNAP is one of the Nation's most important anti-hunger \nprograms and has provided over 46 million Americans with essential food \nassistance. In Illinois, more than 1.8 million people rely on SNAP \nbenefits. SNAP has lifted nearly 2.5 million children out of poverty, \nmore than any other government program.\n  According to the United States Department of Agriculture's--USDA--\nEconomic Research Service, $5 of SNAP benefits can generate $9 in \neconomic activity through retail demand, farm production, and jobs. \nWhen millions of Americans are struggling, food stamps meet a basic \nhuman need.\n  This week the Senate will take up the Farm bill, which provides \ncritical funding for food assistance programs, including SNAP. I am \nconcerned about possible amendments to significantly cut the program \nand fundamentally alter how the program operates. SNAP provides an \nimportant safety net for households that have fallen on hard times.\n  Throughout the country, food banks and pantries that rely on Federal \nassistance are the front line of the fight against hunger, providing \nemergency food assistance to hungry families. At a time when millions \nof middle class Americans are struggling to keep up with higher gas \nprices, grocery bills, and health care costs, more families are looking \nto federal programs for assistance. Throughout the country, federal \nhunger assistance programs have responded to this growing need by \nproviding essential support to hungry families. Over the past 2 years, \nIllinois food banks have seen a 50 percent increase in requests for \nfood assistance.\n  As Americans struggle to make ends meet, they rely on food pantries \nto fill gaps in their grocery needs. The Central Illinois Food Bank is \none of many in my State that help to meet that need. Central Illinois \nFood Bank celebrates its 30th anniversary today. In its\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\nfirst year, the food bank had one truck and a staff of three and \ndistributed 700,000 pounds of food to 85 agencies. The food bank now \nserves 150 agencies and distributes 800,000 pounds of food a month. \nLast year, the food bank helped over 100,000 families and provided well \nover 1 million pounds of fresh produce. I am grateful to the Central \nIllinois Food Bank for its work on the front lines of the fight to end \nhunger and for the safety net it provides for families having trouble \nputting food on the table.\n  The millions of Americans who rely on safety net anti-hunger programs \nmay not have the loudest voice in the debate or big public relations \nfirms, but we must protect these programs and work to improve the lives \nof vulnerable families, children, and seniors at their time of need. \nHunger in America is not something we can ignore. At a time when \nfamilies are working to make ends meet, this isn't the place we should \nbe looking to for cuts. We cannot return to the scenes that Senator \nRobert Kennedy witnessed decades ago. We should honor his legacy by \nprotecting these programs that help families out food on the table. No \nfamily should have to wonder where their next meal will come from.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 484\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of individuals in the United States and can produce \n     physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture shows that approximately 48,800,000 individuals \n     in the United States live in households experiencing hunger \n     or food insecurity, and of that number, 32,600,000 are adults \n     and 16,200,000 are children;\n       Whereas the Department of Agriculture data also shows that \n     households with children experience food insecurity nearly \n     twice as frequently as households without children;\n       Whereas 4.8 percent of all households in the United States \n     (approximately 5,600,000 households) have accessed emergency \n     food from a food pantry 1 or more times;\n       Whereas the report entitled ``Household Food Security in \n     the United States, 2010'', published by the Economic Research \n     Service of the Department of Agriculture, found that in 2010, \n     the most recent year for which data exists--\n       (1) 14.5 percent of all households in the United States \n     experienced food insecurity at some point during the year;\n       (2) 20.2 percent of all households with children in the \n     United States experienced food insecurity at some point \n     during the year; and\n       (3) 7.9 percent of all households with elderly individuals \n     in the United States experienced food insecurity at some \n     point during the year;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community in the country;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, many Americans remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food insecurity;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry individuals \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Federal Government provides nutritional support \n     to millions of individuals through numerous Federal food \n     assistance programs, including--\n       (1) the supplemental nutrition assistance program \n     established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (2) the child nutrition program established under the \n     Richard B.

Mr. President, every summer the Congressional Budget \nOffice produces a long-term budget outlook. This is the report they \nproduced yesterday, which is what they do every year. It is a grim \ndocument indeed, not a document that should give us comfort but should \nbe a call to action as to what we would need to do about the financial \nfuture of our country. It is part of their effort to produce for \nCongress objective, impartial analyses. We all will complain about this \nor that from CBO, but they are pretty objective, and they work hard to \nproduce the kind of information we can benefit from as Americans, \ncertainly that we in Congress need as we deal with our challenges at \nthis period in history. They lay out, over 25 years, what we could \nexpect to see if current policy is extended.\n  These are some of the things they find in this report that are \ncertainly disturbing to us. Actually, they are more than disturbing, \nthey are unacceptable. They are absolute proof that we are on an \nunsustainable debt course, and that means we have to get off it or bad \nthings will happen. The numbers I will give from this report, as \nFederal Reserve Chairman Mr. Bernanke indicated last year, would not \nhappen--events wouldn't occur because we will have a crisis before that \nif we continue on this path.\n  This is what they found: 25 years under the current policy, annual \ndeficits would reach $5 trillion a year or 17 percent of GDP and would \nrise steadily thereafter. In other words, we would have in 1 year a $5 \ntrillion deficit. This year we expect to spend $3.7 trillion total, \nincluding defense and Social Security and Medicare.\n  They go on to make this finding: Federal debt would reach \napproximately 200 percent of GDP; that is, the debt would be twice as \nlarge as the entire American economy. Japan has that high a debt. It is \nthe highest in the world. It is financed because of Japan's unusual \nsaving policies--financed mainly internally, but we are not financing \nour debt that way now. In fact, 60 to 70 percent of our debt now is \nbeing financed by the Federal Reserve, by buying Treasuries by the \nFederal Reserve. That is very dangerous because it is, in effect, \nprinting money. So this is an unsustainable path.\n  They go on to say annual Federal spending would rise to $10 trillion \na year or 36 percent of GDP. So 36 percent of the entire economy would \nbe consumed by Federal Government spending. We are now 18 to 20 \npercent, in that range. This is a historic alteration of the \nfundamental concept of our government being a government of limited \npowers. That is a stunning number.\n  They go on to say this: Yearly interest, what we would pay yearly, \nwould reach $2.7 trillion. That is certainly a large number. As I said, \nthis year we spent $3.7 trillion.\n  The Federal debt, according to the report, will be double the size of \nthe entire U.S. economy in 2037, 25 years from now. CBO agrees that \nhigher levels of Federal Government debt will burden American families \nand destroy economic growth. We have had studies on that. Reinhart and \nRogoff reports--I think most economists agree with this principle--that \nwhen taxes reach high levels, it pulls down the entire economy's \nability to grow.\n  They go on to say each family's share of the Federal debt will climb \nto $382,000, per family, by 2037 or an additional $287,000 over what \ntoday's family's share of the total American debt is. That is, of \ncourse, more than twice as much.\n  CBO warns that ``large budget deficits and growing debt would . . . \nlower the growth of incomes in the United States.''\n  According to CBO data, over the next 20 years, high debt levels will \nresult in $21 trillion less in economic output. This is a significant \nreduction in economic growth, and it is out of growth that we hope to \nbe able to close the deficit gap. Without growth, we can't do it. But \nif we run our debt too high, it pulls down growth and makes it even \nmore difficult for us to maintain the growth levels we need to get our \neconomy and Federal budget under control.\n  They go on to say that government debt will also slow economic growth \nnearly 1 percent a year, on average, supporting a landmark study done \nby Reinhart and Rogoff that quantified the effect of debt on advanced \neconomies.\n  I asked Secretary of Treasury Geithner about the Rogoff-Reinhart \nstudy. He said it was an excellent study. Then he added: In some ways, \nit understates our problems.\n  We were talking about this 1 percent factor. When our debt exceeds 90 \npercent of GDP, we lose 1 percent of growth. He acknowledged the \nvalidity of that, and then went on to say that it understates the \nproblem, because when we reach that high debt level, we are vulnerable \nto an economic shock--another recession, a 2007 debt crisis, a Greek-\nlike problem.\n  Government debt, the report indicates, will also slow economic \ngrowth, and that 1 percent of slowing growth, according to numbers \nreleased by the Obama administration--and I think they are pretty \naccurate--1 million jobs is 1 percent of GDP. So if we go from 2 \npercent to 1 percent GDP growth, 3 percent to 2 percent GDP growth, we \nlose 1 million jobs.\n  We don't need to be losing jobs. We need to be creating jobs, and \ndebt is a threat to economic growth. The idea some people have that we \ncould continue to borrow, borrow, borrow and spend, spend, spend and \nthis will create a healthy growing economy that could be sustained is \nabsolutely truly false, I believe.\n  CBO gave this ominous warning:\n\n       Growing debt also would increase the probability of a \n     sudden financial crisis, during which investors would lose \n     confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget \n     and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow \n     at affordable rates.\n\n  It seems to me pretty clear, if we look at the numbers, that spending \nis the primary cause of our long-term fiscal imbalance--that and a lack \nof growth.\n  Under both the baseline and current policy scenarios set out by CBO, \nspending will remain well above historical averages. So it is not as if \nthey are assuming we will cut spending and that we will reduce what the \ngovernment spends each year. They are assuming the spending levels will \nbe well above historical averages. If we return those spending levels \nto historical averages, I believe we then have a far better chance to \nget our economy under control, rather than just asking the American \npeople to send more money to Washington.\n  Under current policy, annual Federal spending will exceed $10 \ntrillion--or 36 percent of GDP--by 2037. Twenty-five years used to seem \nlike a long time to me, but as I have gotten older, 25 is a lot shorter \nperiod of time.\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\n  By 2025, the report indicates, mandatory health spending, Social \nSecurity spending, and interest costs--Medicare and Medicaid, mandatory \nhealth spending--Social Security, and interest costs will consume 100 \npercent of the revenues this government is expected to receive; the \nDefense Department, zero; the Education Department, zero; Federal \nhighway bill funds, zero. All of it would just be in those programs. \nThat reveals to us that necessity of looking at those programs, to \nthink that we can deal with our surging deficits without confronting \nthe fact that the largest, most sustained growth areas are Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt.\n  What about raising taxes? Why don't we raise taxes? There are \nproblems with raising taxes. It has consequences. It weakens the \nprivate sector. It takes more money from the private sector where the \nmoney is earned, where growth is generated, and distributes it to the \ngovernmental sector--which, I have to tell you, is not as efficient and \nproductive and hasn't proven it is and has not gone through what \nprivate business has gone through, which is to make themselves more \nefficient, more productive, and utilize technology and advanced \ntechniques to produce more widgets for less cost. The Federal \nGovernment has not done that.\n  This is what CBO said:\n\n       To the extent that additional tax revenues were generated \n     by boosting marginal tax rates, those higher rates would \n     discourage people from working and saving, further reducing \n     output and income.\n\n  There is no doubt about that. This is not some rightwing scenario. If \nwe keep raising taxes on the productive sector, we are going to have \nless of it. It will discourage people from working and saving, further \nreducing output and income. That is an economic fact. It is not a scare \ntactic. So it is not just something we can do. Why don't we just raise \ntaxes? That is the reason. It weakens economic growth. It weakens the \nprivate sector. It empowers the government, violates our heritage of \nlimited government, and is not healthy for American families and job \ncreation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office agrees we cannot wait; that we cannot \ncontinue to delay action on the deficits. This is what they say in this \nreport:\n\n       Waiting to address the long-term budgetary imbalance and \n     allowing debt to mount in the meantime would be detrimental \n     to future generations.\n\n  We don't need to do things that are detrimental to future \ngenerations. We are already leaving them with more debt than we ever \nshould, and we need to get off this path.\n  I have told this story, but back in Marion, AL, I was at a house of a \nWorld War II veteran just less than 2 years ago. Mr. Wheeler has since \npassed away, but he was the last person to speak as I was listening to \npeople's views. He said he lived through the Depression and served in \nWorld War II, he lived through the inflationary period in the 1970s and \n1980s, and the problem we face is not the high cost of living; the \nproblem we face is the cost of living too high. Frankly, that is what \nhas happened. Individually, we have lived too high. We have to \ndeleverage. Individual families are doing it. The government has lived \ntoo high. It has assumed too much debt, and there is no way out of it--\nno easy way. There is no free lunch. Nothing comes from nothing. \nSomebody pays.\n\n  To get this debt under control, we have to manage better than we ever \nhave, in my opinion. I truly believe that, and we can do it. We can \nmanage better. It is going to take leadership of the Chief Executive \nOfficer of the United States, and Congress needs to be involved in the \nprocess too.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, before the Senate Budget \nCommittee earlier this year, testified this way:\n\n       Having a large and increasing level of government debt \n     relative to national income runs the risk of serious economic \n     consequences. Over the longer term, the current trajectory of \n     federal debt threatens to crowd out private capital formation \n     and thus reduce productivity growth. . . .\n\n  It is growth we need. It is growth we need that will make America \nmore competitive, that will produce more widgets for less cost, that \nwill allow us to export and be competitive, to defeat importers by \nproducing products better and at less cost than the importers can. That \nis within our grasp. But we are getting away from that and debt is a \nthreat to us.\n  Chairman Bernanke goes on to say:\n\n       To the extent that increasing debt is financed by borrowing \n     from abroad, a growing share of our future income would be \n     devoted to interest payments on foreign-held federal debt. \n     High levels of debt also impair the ability of policy makers \n     to respond effectively to future economic shocks and adverse \n     events.\n\n  Adverse events occur periodically, and high levels of debt impairing \nour ability to react to those make us more vulnerable to serious \neconomic dislocations that would occur in the future.\n  But Mr. Bernanke also knows that on our current course, we will never \nmake it to the years where our debt is three, four, five times the size \nof our economy.\n  He also stated about the CBO outlook:\n\n       The CBO projections, by design, ignore the adverse effects \n     that such high debt and deficits would likely have on the \n     economy. But if government debt and deficits were actually to \n     grow at the pace envisioned in this scenario, the economic \n     and financial effects would be severe.\n\n  In other words, what he is saying is we are not going to get there. \nIt is not going to happen because we will have a financial crisis \nbefore then, and we can see that.\n  We had the President's fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson, and they told us, ``We are facing the most predictable \nfinancial crisis in our Nation's history.'' Both of them signed a \nstatement to the Budget Committee just last year to that effect, and \nthey said we could have an economic crisis in as little as 2 years.\n  We have not had a budget in the Senate. The Republican House has \nproduced a budget, but the Senate Democrats have determinatively \nrefused to bring up a budget in committee or bring one on the floor. We \nare now 3 years without a budget, while we have had trips to Las Vegas \nand conferences and tax credit loopholes for children of illegal \naliens. Children who don't even live in the United States are getting a \n$1,000 tax credit from Uncle Sam and we can't get that fixed. That \nseems to be too hard to do, costing $4 billion a year.\n  So these are the kinds of things Americans need to be aware of and \nneed to be focused on. If we do so, there are a number of options that \nwould allow us to get the country on a sound path. We can do some \nthings without debt, such as tax simplification that creates more \ngrowth, such as eliminating every regulation that does not serve the \nnational interest and benefit the economy but adds cost to our \nproductive capability in America and delays production of energy or \ndelays construction of factories and businesses--eliminate those \nregulations that don't make sense. We can work hard to produce more \nAmerican energy, keeping our wealth at home. We can reduce the amount \nof debt we are running up so we are sending fewer dollars, fewer \nbillions of dollars, abroad every year after year after year just to \npay the interest on the debt.\n  There are a lot of things we can do that will create jobs and growth \nand productivity gains in America that will not add to our debt, and we \nhave to find those things. We have to tighten our belt across the \nboard, in Congress and the White House and down to every agency and \ndepartment and government entity that exists in this country and around \nthe world. If everybody does that, we will surprise ourselves with how \nmuch progress we can make.
