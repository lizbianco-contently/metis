Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 467, \nS. 3412, which is the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2012.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 467, S. 3412, a bill to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief \n     to middle class families.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3420) to permanently extend the 2001 and 2003 \n     tax cuts, to provide for the permanent alternative minimum \n     tax relief, and to repeal the estate and generation-skipping \n     transfer taxes, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to this legislation at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nmeasure will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                             Tax Proposals\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Republicans claim to share Democrats' \ncommitment to keeping taxes low for the middle class, so it is very \nstrange that, if that is what they believe, they have repeatedly \nblocked votes on our proposal to cut taxes for 98 percent of American \nfamilies. Two weeks ago Republicans seemed eager to have those votes. \nThat is what the Republican leader talked about here on the floor: They \nwanted to vote on our proposal to cut taxes for families making less \nthan $250,000 a year or 98 percent of Americans, and they wanted to \nvote on their competing proposal, which would actually raise taxes for \n25 million families while handing out more tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires. Democrats have tried to give the Republicans what \nthey wanted. We have offered to skip their usual procedural delays and \nhold up-or-down majority votes on both proposals. So far they have \nrefused, but the offer still stands. If they want to vote on theirs and \nvote on ours, we will do it with a simple majority. So I hope the \nRepublicans don't insist on doing this the hard way.\n  Why are Republicans delaying votes they asked for in the first place? \nThey know a majority of Senators and a majority of Americans support \nour plan to help middle-class families. Our plan gives 114 million \ntaxpayers--again, 98 percent of American families--certainty that their \ntaxes won't go up, and it reduces the deficit by almost $1 trillion by \nending wasteful tax breaks for the rich.\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\n  The Senate Republican proposal takes a very different approach--and \nthat is an understatement--to extend tax breaks for the top 2 percent \nof Americans, but it fails to extend tax cuts to help middle-class \nfamilies. Their plan would hike taxes by another $1,000 for middle-\nclass families while handing out an extra $160,000 tax break to every \nmillionaire. Democrats will simply never agree that we should hand out \nmore tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of Americans while our economy \nis in its current situation, but that shouldn't stop us from protecting \nthe other 98 percent of Americans--and do it today.\n\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Mr. President, I have had a number of briefings lately from people in \nthe administration held in the classified facility here in the Capitol \nabout cybersecurity.\n  Over the last few days, some of my Republican colleagues have \nsuggested that the Senate should delay action on what national security \nexperts have called the most pressing threat facing this country. \nInstead of considering bipartisan cybersecurity legislation, they say \nwe should first consider the annual Defense authorization bill. I argue \nthat we need to move rapidly to address the gaping hole in our defenses \nagainst cyber attack.\n  The Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, said that cyber threats will \nsoon overtake terrorism as the most significant threat to our national \nsecurity. And in the minds of some, it is difficult to separate \ncybersecurity from what people are trying to do and have tried to do \nevery day. It is the same as terrorism, it is just a different form.\n  A bipartisan group of national security experts led by former \nSecretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, a Republican, and \nformer Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, who was \nappointed during the Republican administration, said cyber threat \n``represents one of the most serious challenges to our national \nsecurity since the onset of the nuclear age.''\n  The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, \nsaid:\n\n       We must act now and quickly develop and pass comprehensive \n     legislation to protect our electric grid, air traffic control \n     system, water supply, financial networks and defense systems \n     and much more from a cyber attack.\n\n  And he is right--we need to protect our electric grid.\n  The Presiding Officer participated in a demonstration in our \nclassified room of how cybersecurity would work, taking down the \nPresiding Officer's State in the northeast part of this country. It \ncould be done relatively easily, and it would take weeks and weeks to \nget it back up. We all watched that.\n  What John McCain said is really true. We must pass comprehensive \nlegislation to protect our electric grid, air traffic control system, \nwater supply, financial networks, defense systems, and much more. Any \none of these things would be devastating to our country if a cyber \nattack is successful. John McCain suggested this almost a year ago.\n  The threat has only grown worse in that time, and failing to act on \ncybersecurity legislation not only puts our national security at risk, \nit recklessly endangers members of our Armed Forces and our missions \naround the world. Servicemembers themselves have been repeatedly \ntargeted by cyber attackers. In one hack last year, more than 90,000 \nmilitary e-mail addresses and passwords were stolen. In another hack of \nthe TRICARE system, 4.9 million medical records from our military were \nstolen. If we are serious about protecting our troops, we must protect \nthem against cyber attacks.\n  But acting to secure our critical networks doesn't mean we won't do \nother things to help the defense, of course. There are some specific \nconcerns about the Defense authorization bill, and I have talked about \nthem. We can't allow the Defense bill to become an end run around the \nbipartisan Budget Control Act, which has been so important to this \ncountry.\n  If we are going to debate the Defense bill, House and Senate \nRepublicans need to make it clear that they are willing to abide by the \nbudget levels set by the law that they all voted for, with rare \nexception, and we must also ensure that the Defense bill is not used as \na platform to advance irrelevant partisan agendas.\n\n\n             Remembering Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to talk about Agent \nGibson and Officer Chestnut.\n  It was 14 years ago, and it is really hard to comprehend that it has \nbeen that long. Officer Chestnut I knew by saying hello. But we had an \nevent in Virginia where my wife became ill. I will never forget Agent \nGibson running from the Capitol Police headquarters and administering \naid to my wife. That was Agent Gibson, and I remember that so clearly. \nHe was a wonderful guy. I felt I knew him so well because of his \nhelping my wife.\n  Last week, this Nation was reminded how fragile life is with what \nhappened in Colorado and how quickly it can be taken away, at random, \nwith senseless acts of violence.\n  Fourteen years ago, the Capitol community was similarly reminded that \nwe must never take life for granted. On this day in 1998, two dedicated \nU.S. Capitol Police officers--Special Agent John Gibson and Officer \nJacob Chestnut--gave their lives while protecting this building and the \npeople in it. But their lives were not spent in vain. As a result of \ntheir sacrifice, we now have a Capitol that is much safer than it ever \nwas. It was a result of their having been killed that we were able to \nfinally get the Visitor Center done. We were able to speed that up, and \nwe got it done. Now people who come to this Capitol are safe in the \nbuilding, and their security is as good as anyplace in the world. It is \na much more pleasant visit now to the Capitol. So their lives were not \ngiven in vain.\n  While guarding the Capitol, Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut were \nshot to death by, really, a madman. With the facilities we have now, \nthat would not have happened. While nothing can erase the pain of \nlosing a loved one, I hope their families take some measure of comfort \nfrom knowing that Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut are not forgotten.\n  As a sidenote, I take special pride in the fact that I was a Capitol \npoliceman. I worked in this building and carried a pistol. I worked \nswing shift, as we called it, from about 3:00 to 11:00 when I was going \nto law school. So every year when we give special recognition to this \noccurrence having happened, I think of my days here and what a \ndifferent place it was. Of course there were things we had to look out \nfor, but, as I have said before, the most dangerous thing I had to do \nwas direct traffic. But that isn't the way it is now for the men and \nwomen who take care of us here in the Capitol--not just the Senators, \nnot just the staff, but all the millions of people who visit this \nfacility every year. So I honor their service and their sacrifice. And \nI reflect back on the days of my youth, for someone who came from where \nI came, walking around this facility, mostly at nighttime, a lot of \ntimes quite lonely.\n  So we are grateful for the brave men and women who safeguard the \npeople's house. They do it today. They do it every day. We take them \nfor granted, and we shouldn't. They are really gallant in the work they \ndo. The Capitol Police is a wonderful organization, and I am proud of \nthem, and every Member of the Senate is proud of them. Everyone in the \ncountry should be aware of the work they do to make this building safe.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n      Remembering Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to start this morning by \nremembering another deadly shooting, one that hit very close to home \nfor most of us.\n  It was 14 years ago today that Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective \nJohn Gibson of the Capitol Police were shot dead in the line of duty \nright here in the Capitol by a lone gunman. Their deaths serve as yet \nanother reminder not only of the reality of evil but of the precious \ngift of life. Today we honor them for their lives and the final act of \nheroism that ended them.\n  A plaque inside the Capitol commemorates their sacrifice, and the \nCapitol Police Headquarters now bears their names. It is appropriate we \nalso pause in the midst of our other duties to honor these men and \nevery member\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nof the Capitol Police Force who works so hard to ensure our safety.\n  Officer Chestnut was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force and had 18 \nyears of service to the Capitol Police. Detective Gibson also had 18 \nyears of Capitol Police service, and until the day he died had never \ndrawn his weapon. Both men left behind wives, children, and friends.\n  Today the Senate honors both of these good men once again and all of \nthose they left behind.\n\n\n                             Tax Proposals\n\n  Mr. President, as the Senate resumes its work this week, Americans \nare hungry for leadership. The national debt hovers around $16 \ntrillion. The Federal Government is on track to spend $1 trillion more \nthan it takes in for the fourth year in a row, and Democrats have not \ndone so much as pass a budget in nearly 4 years.\n  Meanwhile, President Obama is not even talking with us about what to \ndo about any of these things. The taxpayers are basically paying him \n$400,000 a year to hold campaign rallies and show up at fundraisers. \nHis latest proposal on taxes has more to do with helping his campaign \nthan in reviving the economy. If you want proof, just ask yourself why \nDemocrats don't want to vote on it.\n  Republicans will head into tomorrow's vote guided by a simple \nprinciple: Do no harm. In our view, the best approach to taxes right \nnow is to let every American and every American business know they will \nnot have a higher income tax bill at the end of the year. We think \neverybody in America should have that certainty.\n  The Democrats' guiding principle, to the extent they have one, is \nquite different. To them the goal is not so much relief for struggling \nAmericans or reviving the economy, it is sending a message. Their \nmessage is that some people deserve relief and some people don't, and \nthey will decide who those people are regardless of the effect it has \non the broader economy or on jobs. It is an approach that isn't based \non any economic outcome but on ideology. Americans are quite tired of \nit because it has been a disaster for our economy.\n  Think about it. If Democrats cared more about helping folks and \nreviving the economy, then they wouldn't be calling for a tax hike. Yet \nthroughout this entire debate Democrats have not offered a single \ncredible argument about how their tax increase targeted at job creators \nwill help struggling middle-class Americans. Surely, they don't think \nthis tax increase is the fiscally responsible thing to do.\n  Let's assume they got this tax increase. It would only generate \nenough money to fund the government for 5 days. Even if they got the \ntax increase they want, it would only generate enough money to fund the \ngovernment for 5 days.\n  The larger point is this: The Senate should be in the business of \nactually making a difference rather than just making political \nstatements. That is why we think we should have a vote on all three \nproposals tomorrow: the President's proposal, the Senate Democrat \nproposal, and ours. Show the American people what is behind their \nproposals and what we all stand for. If the Democrats believe the \nPresident's rhetoric, they will vote for his proposal, and he will work \nto get their support.\n  My guess is that Democratic leaders will not allow a vote on the \nPresident's plan, and that should tell us everything we need to know \nabout the Democratic approach to the problems we face. They are either \nout of ideas, not serious about solving the problems we face or both. \nTo them this is more about messaging or passing the buck than it is \nabout helping anybody or preventing an economic calamity at the end of \nthis year.\n  The President proposed a plan he thinks will help him on the campaign \ntrail. Democrats proposed a plan they think helps them in the Senate. \nWhat about a plan that actually helps the American people? It is all \npolitics and positioning to our friends on the other side of the aisle \nat this point, and it is quite disgraceful.\n  The time to act on the problems we face is right now. The fiscal \ncliff draws closer with each passing day. I think most people think the \nparty in power has some responsibility to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders and their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n           Remembering Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before I talk about the matter at hand, I \nwould like to remember Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. I did not \nhave a chance to know Detective Gibson. I did have a chance to know \nJ.J. and he was someone who lit up a room. He had a 1,000-watt smile.\n  I will never forget the time I was going to a meeting at the House of \nRepresentatives. I wasn't familiar with where the room was, and J.J. \ntook me right to it. He was a delightful man, and it was tragic that \nhis life was taken.\n  I will never forget the funeral. It was one of the most remarkable \noutpourings I have ever seen, and so we remember with enormous respect \nOfficer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I have to respond to the Republican leader. What a \nfountain of misinformation. He repeats this canard that no budget \naction has been taken here for 4 years.\n  What about the Budget Control Act that was passed last year with more \nthan 70 votes in the Senate? That was passed instead of a budget \nresolution. It was a law. Anybody who has had even a little bit of \ncivics knows a law is stronger than a resolution.\n  Indeed, that law cut spending by $900 billion over 10 years and put \nin place this sequester we now face that cuts another $1.2 trillion \nover 10 years for a total spending cut of over $2 trillion. It was the \nbiggest spending cut in the history of the United States, and the \nRepublican leader acts as though he never heard of it; it never \nhappened. Let's get real. We took action in the House and Senate, and \nit was signed into law by the President.\n  The last time our friends on the other side were in charge, their \npolicies brought us to the brink of financial collapse. Have we \nforgotten that the economy was shrinking at a rate of 9 percent in the \nlast quarter of the previous administration? In their last month in \noffice we lost 800,000 jobs--in 1 month. That was their record.\n  This administration has turned things around. We are no longer losing \njobs; we are gaining them. The economy is no longer shrinking; it is \ngrowing. Maybe it is not as strong as we would like, but it has been a \nremarkable turnaround after the other side and their policies led us to \nthe brink of financial collapse.\n  Let's talk about the legislation before us. It assures 98 percent of \nthe American people are not going to have a tax increase, extends \nexpiring provisions on income taxes, and income tax relief for everyone \nmaking below $250,000 a year. It includes incentives to promote work \nand support families, and it provides relief from the individual \nalternative minimum tax for 1 year, a tax that is increasingly \naffecting the middle class.\n  Our friends on the other side say: Whoa. Wait a minute. That means \nthose making more than $250,000 will have a top rate of 39.6 percent. \nThat is true. What happened the last time we had a top rate of 39.6 \npercent? That was during the Clinton administration. What was the \neconomic record then? It was 39 straight quarters of economic growth \nfrom 1991 until 2000. It was the longest period of uninterrupted growth \nin this Nation's history. There were 24 million jobs created. That is \nwhat happened the last time we had a top rate of 39.6 percent.\n  Why is it important we begin doing something about these growing \ndeficits and debt? It is because we are on an unsustainable course. \nThis is one place where the Republican leader and I would agree. We are \non an unsustainable course; we have been since the previous \nadministration.\n  Have they forgotten that they tripled foreign holdings of U.S. debt \nduring that administration, and doubled the debt? We are on an \nunsustainable\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\ncourse. We are headed for a debt that will be 200 percent of our GDP if \nwe don't act.\n  This is a spending and revenue problem. This chart shows spending and \nrevenue as a share of the economy over the last 60 years. Spending is \nthe red line, and the green line is revenue. As we can see, we are at \nor near a 60-year high in spending. We are at or near a 60-year low on \nrevenue. It is true we have a spending problem. It is also true we have \na revenue problem. Revenue is at or near a 60-year low.\n  Our friends on the other side want to just have the historic average \nfor revenue. The problem with that is it is not a useful benchmark. \nThis is spending going back to 1972, 40 years. The red line shows \nspending. The green line is the historic average for revenue. We can \nsee that if we just had the historic average for revenue, we never \nwould have balanced the budget in a single year over 40 years. That is \nwhat the other side wants to do.\n  The fact is the five times we have balanced the budget since 1969--in \n44 years--the revenue was nearly 20 percent of GDP. It was 19.7 percent \nin 1969, 19.9 percent in 1998, 19.8 percent in 1999, 20.6 percent in \n2000, and 19.5 percent in 2001. Facts are stubborn.\n  Former Republican Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg said this \nabout revenue:\n\n       We also know revenues are going to have to go up, if you're \n     going to maintain a stable economy and a productive economy, \n     because of the simple fact that you're going to have to have \n     this huge generation that has to be paid for.\n\n  It is the baby boom generation. That is not a forecast; that is not a \nprojection. They have been born, they are alive today, and they are \ngoing to be eligible for Medicare and Social Security.\n  In 2010, we saw some wealthy people paying no Federal income tax--\nnothing. People with incomes of $500,000 to $1 million in 2010, 14,000 \npaid nothing, zero. Those earning over $1 million in 2010 who paid \nnothing were 4,000. Is that fair? It is outrageous that 4,000 people \nearning over $1 million paid absolutely nothing and 14,000 earning \nbetween $500,000 and $1 million of income paid absolutely nothing and \nour friends want to defend that system. Shocking.\n  Here is what is happening to so-called tax expenditures. We are now \nspending more money through the Tax Code than through all the \nappropriated accounts. Who are the big winners? The top 1 percent in \nincome, on average, get a benefit of $255,000 a year by the so-called \ncredits, deductions, exclusions, and preferences that are shot through \nthe Tax Code. We have a little five-story building in the Cayman \nIslands that claims to be home to 18,000 companies. They all say they \nare doing business out of that little five-story building. Are they \ndoing business out of that little building or are they doing monkey \nbusiness out of that building? Eighteen thousand companies in a little \nfive-story building in the Cayman Islands evading and avoiding the \ntaxes due in the United States. Our friends on the other side say: No \nchange. Shouldn't touch that. That is fair? I don't think so.\n  Let's get real. Let's get serious. Let's take on deficits and debt. \nLet's make certain everybody has a chance to contribute, including \nthose who are at the top rungs who are now paying nothing.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Kent Conrad, who is the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. He is retiring, unfortunately, for the Senate and for this \ncountry because he has brought to this Chamber and to the national \ndebate on our deficits an insight and a knowledge of the subject that \nis unequaled. He has become a close and dear friend of mine, even \ncloser over the last couple years, while we labored shoulder to \nshoulder on the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission and bipartisan \nefforts afterwards in the Senate to deal with the deficit.\n  I am disappointed and somewhat troubled by the argument made by many \nin this Chamber that the deficit is the most serious problem facing \nAmerica and then, in the same breath, they call for extending tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in this country. What we are proposing is a \ntax cut for those making up to $250,000 in income. That will certainly \ninclude all--all--of the middle class and working families across \nAmerica. The taxes will be higher for those in the 2-percent range of \nthe highest income categories, and I think it is fair. I think those \nwho have done so well and have been so fortunate in this great Nation \nshould be willing to pay their fair share of taxes.\n  I support the middle-class tax cut the President has proposed. We \nwant to bring it to the floor for a vote. I support it with the notion \nthat we still have to keep our focus on the economy and creating jobs, \nNo. 1, and deficit reduction and debt reduction, No. 2. We can do both. \nWe have to take care that whatever we do to the Tax Code does not \njeopardize our economic recovery. We are on a positive path, with 28 \nstraight months of job creation in the private sector, and we want to \ncontinue it. But we also need to change a reality, which is that we \nborrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend in Washington. That is \nunfortunate and unsustainable. We have to make sure working families \nacross America who continue to fall further and further behind each \nyear and live paycheck to paycheck will have a helping hand from our \nTax Code. That is known as progressive taxation. I think it is fair.\n  Those of us in higher income categories should pay more. Those who \nare struggling paycheck to paycheck, trying to care for their children, \nneed a helping hand in the Tax Code. That is not only just and fair, it \nis good for the economy. Those of lower incomes are going to spend \ntheir money and do it in a fashion that invigorates the economy with \nthe production of more goods and services.\n  The Republican plan that calls for tax cuts even for the highest \nincome categories, as Senator Conrad just noted, means a tax break of \n$250,000 for millionaires across America. I am sorry. The people who \nare making $20,000 a week--that is what a millionaire would make over \nthe course of a year, $20,000 a week--do not need that tax break. They \nhaven't asked for it, they don't need it, and they should be \ncontributing toward reducing this deficit and saving America from \ndeeper cuts in Medicare, education, and other expenditures that are \ncritical to so many American families.\n  According to a recent analysis, the Republican plan would actually \nend up raising taxes on working families. If we give tax breaks to \nthose who are at the highest level of income categories and still go \nafter deficit reduction, then the working class families actually would \nhave to pay more.\n  I asked a number of my constituents to respond to this notion about \ncutting off the tax cuts at $250,000 in income and several of them \nresponded. Merry from Rockford, IL, said this:\n\n       I oppose any extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent. I \n     am a mother of a developmentally disabled adult. I have seen \n     more and more budget cuts each year for 30 years for the \n     special needs population. However, for the 30 years we have \n     been involved with this ``trickledown theory,'' there have \n     been no conclusive reports showing that this theory is \n     working.\n\n  John, a veteran living in Plainfield, IL, writes:\n\n       We fully agree with our President that the rich should pay \n     a little more for their tax share! We (the middle class) are \n     rapidly fading away. We have worked for most of our lives--\n     only to witness corporations take over and fraud in our \n     financial markets!\n\n  Jennifer from Chicago writes:\n\n       I am appalled that Congress would consider cutting food \n     stamps and other vital services for poor people and their \n     families while maintaining tax breaks for those in the upper \n     2 percent of income. Wealthy people can afford to live on a \n     little less. Poor children cannot afford to do without food \n     and shelter.\n\n  When we talk about tax policy and debt reduction, let's do it \nsensibly. Let's help working families. Let's fix the Tax Code in a way \nthat gives them a fighting chance. Let's ask the upper 2 percent--the \ntop 2 percent of wage earners--to pay their fair share. It is not \nunreasonable. Everyone must be prepared to make some sacrifice. Let's \nmake certain that working families are protected in this debate.\n  I note that Senator Murray was coming to the floor to speak on this \ntax issue, but she has been delayed, and I ask unanimous consent that \nshe be recognized to speak after I finish my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I also ask unanimous consent that if I go over the \nallotted time in morning business for the majority, that I and Senator \nMurray be given an additional period of time and a like amount of time \nbe offered to the Republican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 11 years ago, I introduced a bill called \nthe DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is a piece of legislation that would give \na select group of immigrant students who grew up in this country the \nchance to earn their citizenship if they were of good moral character \nand if they were prepared to serve in the military or complete at least \n2 years of college.\n  The young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act came to be \nknown as the DREAMers. These are young people brought to the United \nStates as children and infants. They grew up in this country overcoming \ngreat obstacles. They will be our future doctors, our engineers, our \nteachers, our lawyers, our soldiers. They will make America a better \nnation. They didn't make the decision originally to come to this \ncountry; it was a decision made by their parents. If their parents were \nbreaking the law in that decision, I don't believe their children \nshould be held responsible. That is not the American way.\n  As did the civil rights activists of past generations, the DREAMers \nare speaking out. They are telling their stories publicly, even though \nmany of them know they risk deportation from the only country they have \never known as home. They have organized rallies and marches where they \nadvocate for the DREAM Act, and they have declared their undocumented \nstatus. They wear T-shirts and carry signs that bear their slogan: \n``Undocumented and Unafraid.''\n  These DREAMers have been by my side every step of the way, fighting \nfor the DREAM Act, for 11 years, and I am proud of them.\n  In 2007, the first time the DREAM Act came to a vote on the floor of \nthe Senate, there were a few DREAMers sitting right up in the gallery. \nWe won 52 votes that day. It was a bipartisan majority. Frankly, we \nhave always had a bipartisan majority, but we have never had the 60 \nvotes we need to overcome the Republican filibuster against the DREAM \nAct.\n  Three years later, in December of 2010, the DREAM Act was again \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate. This time, it was different. The \nSenate gallery was filled to capacity with DREAMers wearing graduation \ngowns and caps. It was an inspiring sight. That day, 55 Senators voted \nfor the DREAM Act. Again, we had another bipartisan majority, but, \nagain, we fell short of the 60 votes we needed to defeat a Republican \nfilibuster of the DREAM Act.\n  I made a commitment that day, after that vote was lost, to the young \npeople who would be eligible for the DREAM Act, that I wouldn't give \nup, that I would keep on fighting for the DREAM Act as long as it takes \nto make it a law.\n  Since that vote in December of 2010, I have come to the floor of the \nSenate to tell the DREAMers' stories. I think it is the best way for \npeople to understand the DREAM Act. Today, I wish to tell my colleagues \nabout another DREAMer. Her name is Erika Andiola. Erika was brought to \nAmerica from Mexico when she was 11 years old. She grew up in Arizona \nand enrolled at Arizona State University. But then Arizona passed a new \nlaw prohibiting public universities from giving financial aid or \ninstate tuition rates to undocumented students. Hundreds of students \nwere forced to drop out of school. Erika persevered. She graduated with \nhonors from Arizona State with a bachelor's degree in psychology. She \nhas been very active in advocating for immigrants and the DREAM Act. \nShe is the founding president of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition. Her \ndream is to be a school counselor.\n  The story I have just told of Erika Andiola is the 50th DREAMer story \nI have told on the Senate floor. It is an amazing group. It includes \nDREAMers who grew up in 17 different States, from Oregon and Washington \nin the Pacific Northwest--and I see my colleague Senator Murray on the \nfloor--to Illinois and Michigan in the Midwest, to North Carolina and \nGeorgia in the Southeast. These DREAMers came from all over the world \nto America, from 19 different countries, including Europe, Asia, \nAfrica, South America, and Central America. Yet all of them have \nsomething in common: Their home is America. They are just asking for a \nchance to give back to this great country.\n  To mark the occasion of the 50th DREAMer story on the floor of the \nSenate, many of the DREAMers I featured on the floor have made a trip \nto Washington and have gathered in the Senate. They are here this \nmorning, and I wish to take a few minutes to recognize them.\n  Let me start with the person who started the DREAM Act, Tereza Lee. \nTereza was brought to the United States when she was 2 years old to the \ncity of Chicago. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees from \nManhattan Conservatory of Music, where she is currently pursuing her \ndoctorate.\n  The next person I wish to refer to is Eric Balderas. Eric came to the \nUnited States from Mexico when he was 4 years old. He was valedictorian \nand student council president at his high school in San Antonio, TX. He \nis now a student at Harvard University where he is majoring in \nmolecular and cellular biology. His dream is to become a cancer \nresearcher.\n  The next is Manuel Bartsch. Manuel came to this country from Germany \nwhen he was a child. He recently graduated from Heidelberg University \nin Ohio with a major in political science and a minor in history. He \nwants to pursue a career in government and politics.\n  The next is Kelsey Burke. Kelsey came here from Honduras when she was \n10 years old. She graduated from Florida Atlantic University with a \nmajor in public communications. She begins law school this fall, and \nshe dreams of becoming an attorney.\n  The next is Julieta Garibay. She came to America when she was 11 \nyears old. She graduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's \nand master's degree in nursing. She has been a registered nurse since \n2004. She dreams of serving in our military as a military nurse.\n  The next is Maria Gomez. Maria came to the United States from Mexico \nwhen she was 8 years old. She graduated from UCLA with a bachelor's \ndegree in sociology and a master's degree in architecture. She dreams \nsomeday of being a licensed architect in America.\n  Next is Angelica Hernandez. She came here when she was 9. She \ngraduated from Arizona State University as the outstanding senior in \nthe Mechanical Engineering Department. Someday she wants to be a \nlicensed engineer in the United States of America.\n  Next is Ola Kaso. Ola was brought to the United States from Albania \nat the age of 5. She is a pre-med student in the honors program at the \nUniversity of Michigan. Her dream is to be a surgical oncologist.\n  Next is Sahid Limon. Sahid was brought to America from Bangladesh \nwhen he was 9 years old. He graduated from East Carolina University \nwith a bachelor's degree in biology.\n  Next is Jhon Magdaleno. Jhon came to the United States from Venezuela \nwhen he was 9 years old. He is an honor student at Georgia Tech \nUniversity, where he is a biomedical engineering major.\n  Next is Tolu Olubunmi. She actually was brought to America from \nNigeria at the age of 14. She obtained a bachelor's degree in chemical \nengineering 10 years ago. She has never worked a day as a chemical \nengineer because she cannot be licensed. That is her dream: to be a \nlicensed engineer.\n  Here is Gaby Pacheco. Gaby came to the United States from Ecuador at \nthe age of 7. She has earned two associate's degrees in education and \nis now working on her bachelor's degree. She wants to teach autistic \nchildren. She has become an extraordinary leader in this movement.\n  Next is Pedro Pedroza. He came to the United States when he was 5 \nyears old and grew up in Chicago. He graduated from Cornell University \nwith a BA in Spanish literature and a minor in Latino studies. His \ndream is to be a teacher.\n  Next are two brothers who are here, Carlos and Rafael Robles. Carlos \nis majoring in education at Loyola University in Chicago. He dreams of \nbeing a\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\nteacher and may get his chance at Palatine High School. Rafael is \nmajoring in architecture at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Of \ncourse, he dreams of being a licensed architect.\n  Next is Novi Roy, who came to America from India as a child. Novi \ngraduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a \nbachelor's degree in economics and two master's degrees--one in \nbusiness administration and one in human resources. His dream is to \nhelp provide affordable health care for all Americans.\n  Next is Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez. Felipe came to the United States from \nBrazil when he was 14. He recently graduated summa cum laude from St. \nThomas University with a bachelor's degree in business studies and a \nminor in economics. His ambition is to be a teacher.\n  And last is Cesar Vargas, another good friend, who was brought to the \nUnited States when he was 5 years old. He recently graduated from the \nCity University of New York School of Law with honors. He dreams of one \nday serving in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, of being in our \nmilitary and serving the Nation he loves.\n  I thank all the Dreamers who are here today and have gathered with \nus. They have come a long way. It took an extra effort for them to come \nto Washington and to step forward and to allow me to share their \nstories again with the people who follow this debate.\n  Today I am launching ``American Dreamers,'' a new Web site featuring \nthe Dreamers whose stories I have told on the floor of the Senate, \nincluding all of those who are here today. We are going to update this \nWeb site as I tell more stories. You can find it at \nwww.durbin.senate.gov/dreamers.\n  This is a hopeful time for the Dreamers. It is better than it has \nbeen in a long time because this President, his administration recently \nannounced that we will give the Dreamers temporary legal status to be \nhere in America. This status will allow them to live and work legally \nwithout fear of deportation. The status needs to be renewed every 2 \nyears, but they get their chance. It gives these young immigrants an \nopportunity to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country \nthey have ever called home. The Obama administration's new policy will \nmake America a stronger and better Nation by giving these Dreamers a \nchance to be part of our future.\n  This policy has strong bipartisan support in Congress. My special \nthanks to Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, who joined me in \ncosponsoring this bill and asking for this status on immigration years \nago. It took extraordinary political courage for him to do that, and I \nthank him once again, as I have before.\n  According to recent polls, the American people think the President is \nright in giving these Dreamers a chance to earn their way toward legal \nstatus by a margin of almost 2 to 1. A future President could come \nalong and change this policy, so the Dreamers are still at risk, but \nthey are prepared to step up, to follow the law, and to become part of \nAmerica's future with permanent residency someday and perhaps \ncitizenship, which is our ultimate dream.\n  The President's new policy is a step in the right direction, but \nultimately it is Congress that must act--the House and the Senate--to \npass the DREAM Act and give these young people who have gathered here \ntoday and thousands more just like them the path to citizenship in \nAmerica.\n  I want to give special thanks to Majority Leader Harry Reid. The last \ntime we called the DREAM Act he took a lot of grief for it. They said: \nOh, it is just a political thing. But it is not. He believes in it, as \nso many of us do, and he was prepared to guide the Senate through a \nweek-long debate to get to a vote. We did not have enough votes to \nbreak the Republican filibuster, but we demonstrated again bipartisan \nsupport for a sound, good idea for America's future.\n  I also want to give special thanks to Joe Zogby, sitting on the floor \nhere. Joe is an attorney on my staff who for 11 years now has battled \nside by side with me to pass the DREAM Act. And Vaishalee Yeldani, who \nis on our staff as well, has been terrific in helping us prepare these \nfloor statements and to continue this battle forward.\n  I said to the Dreamers the last time it was brought to the floor and \nwe did not have the votes: I am not going to give up on you. Don't give \nup on me. We are going to do this. I am dedicated to them and to the \nfact that many of us who are the sons and daughters of immigrants--and, \nfrankly, that includes almost all of us in this country--understand \nthat the diversity of immigration has made America a stronger place. \nThese DREAM students will prove once again, as generations have before, \nthat given a chance they will make America a better country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the extension of tax cuts for 98 percent of \nworkers and 97 percent of small business owners.\n  This should be a no-brainer. Democrats do not want taxes on our \nmiddle-class families to go up, and Republicans claim they want that \ntoo. They also say they want these tax cuts extended.\n  So this should be easy. When 100 Senators agree on a policy, we \nshould be able to pass a bill. But, unfortunately, Republicans are not \nfocused on the 98 percent we agree on. They are preoccupied with the 2 \npercent we are not. They are prepared to take our country over the edge \nand into the new year in an effort to prevent millionaires and \nbillionaires from paying a penny more in taxes.\n  Republicans are so opposed to having the wealthy pay the very same \nrate they were paying during the Clinton years that if they cannot \nforce through more tax cuts for the rich, they would prefer taxes to go \nup on middle-class families. They want 98 percent of workers to pay the \nprice if millionaires are asked to pay a penny more. This is \nunbelievable and a deeply cynical position to take. It does not make \nany sense.\n  We have a fundamental difference of opinion between the two parties \nabout the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that have added \ntrillions of dollars to the deficit and debt.\n  I am not asking Republicans to set aside their values. It is clear \nthey are deeply committed to putting more money into the pockets of the \nwealthy. All I am saying is--all Democrats are saying is--we should not \nlet that disagreement on tax cuts for the rich cause taxes to go up for \nthe middle class. We can certainly have a debate about the merits of \nextending tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. I am confident \nRepublicans are ready to stand here on the floor and make their case. I \nam prepared to make mine. But I urge our Republican colleagues now to \nnot play political games with the tax cuts that both sides believe \nshould be extended. Because holding these middle class tax cuts hostage \nis bad policy, it is bad economics, and, frankly, it is bad politics.\n  Poll after poll shows the American people support ending the tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest Americans. Republicans know they are in an \nunsustainable political position. They know they cannot be seen as \nholding middle-class tax cuts hostage for more tax cuts for the rich.\n  Last week we saw how they reacted when they got called on that \nreality: stomping their feet and shaking their fists, trying to muddy \nthe water and change the subject. They do everything but admit it is \ntime for compromise.\n  In fact, just this morning, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania \ngave a speech about his plan for even deeper tax cuts for the rich--\ndown to 28 percent for the wealthiest Americans. It is stunning. While \nDemocrats are fighting for tax cuts for the middle class, Republicans \nare not only holding them hostage to continue the tax cuts for the \nrich, they are also scheming for ways to cut taxes for the wealthiest \nAmericans even more. But their rhetoric is not going to fool families \nand small business owners in America.\n  I recently heard from a constituent of mine. His name is Rob \nRobinson. He is from Walla Walla in my home State of Washington. Rob \nowns a small construction company. He just finished work on the local \npolice department. He said to me, ``I've been a small business owner \nfor over twenty-five years and it's outrageous to me that some members \nof Congress would hold up middle class tax cuts for the sake of \nprotecting the wealthy from paying their fair share.''\n  He went on. He said: ``The fact that they justify cutting taxes for \nthe\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nwealthy by invoking the name of small businesses tells me that they are \nsimply out of touch with the economic reality of the majority of small \nbusiness owners in this country.''\n  I heard from another small business owner. His name is Allan Willis. \nHe is from Kennewick, WA. Allan opened his small business, Tri-city \nMusic, in 2008. He wrote to me saying:\n\n       I'm like a lot of Main Street small business owners. I open \n     the shop in the morning and close it down at night. I vacuum \n     the carpets and clean the bathrooms. I strive to provide my \n     customers with an incredible level of customer service after \n     the sale. I work hard and am blessed that I make enough to \n     pay my fair share of taxes.\n\n  Allan told me:\n\n       When Republicans hide behind the name of small business to \n     support their agenda for lower taxes for the rich, they don't \n     speak for me. Let's call it what it is: political identity \n     theft. They are stealing the name of small business as a \n     smokescreen for tax policy that benefits millionaires.\n\n  That is a quote from Allan.\n  I also heard from a constituent of mine named Dallas Baker. Dallas is \na Seattle firefighter. He has been on the job for 15 years. He told me \nhe loves serving his community and making a difference. But he said--\nand I quote--\n\n       My daughters and I are all making sacrifices now. We are \n     comfortable but we are losing ground.\n\n  If taxes went up for middle-class families like his, it would only \nget harder.\n  Rob, Allan, and Dallas are among the 98 percent of workers and 97 \npercent of small business owners the Democrats' bill would extend our \ntax cuts for. Those are the people I am fighting for--them and millions \nacross America--middle-class families who have been struggling, who \nhave sacrificed so much, and who should not see their taxes go up.\n  But my Republican colleagues do not seem to be focused on people such \nas Rob, Allan, and Dallas. They are much more concerned about the tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans, many of whom happen to be their \nbiggest campaign and super PAC donors. They may claim to be here \ntalking for small business owners, but they are not speaking for the \nsmall business owners I hear from--not small business owners such as \nRob and Allan or the 97 percent who Democrats are here fighting to \nprotect tax cuts for--but fighting for people such as Joseph Craft. He \nis a coal industry billionaire. Mr. Craft is worth an estimated $1.4 \nbillion, according to Forbes, and Republicans are fighting to cut his \ntaxes. They are fighting for people like Harold Simmons. He made his \nbillions on corporate buyouts. Harold is worth an estimated $9 billion, \nand Republicans are fighting to cut his taxes too. And they are \nfighting for people such as Harold Hamm. He is an oil and gas \nbillionaire. He is worth an estimated $11 billion. Republicans are \ndoing everything they can to make sure their taxes do not go up a \npenny.\n  The vote on the middle-class tax cut extension is going to be very \nilluminating. It is going to highlight some stark contrasts and give \nthe American people a clear view into the priorities of our two \nparties.\n  Democrats are here focused on the middle class. We want to extend the \ntax cuts for 98 percent of our workers and 97 percent of small business \nowners, people such as Rob, Allan, and Dallas, and millions more. But \nif Republicans do not vote for our tax cut bill, it will demonstrate \nclearly they do not care about certainty, they do not care about the \neconomy, and they certainly do not care about the middle class.\n  Rather, they care about extending those tax cuts for the rich above \nall else and to use every bit of leverage they have to do it, and they \nare prepared to let taxes go up on every family if they do not get \ntheir way. I hope they change their tune.\n  They say inaction is not an option. Well, here is their chance to act \nfor 98 percent of workers and 97 percent of small business owners. All \nthey have to do is stop playing games and stand with us to pass their \nbill this week. If they do, I would be happy to have an honest debate \nabout extending the Bush tax cuts for the rich they are so passionate \nabout. If they do not and taxes go up on every American because \nRepublicans insist on protecting and extending the Bush tax cuts for \nthese guys, then they are going to have to explain that to Rob and \nAllen and Dallas and millions of families and business owners just like \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington said \nRepublicans often change the subject. That is exactly what we intend to \ndo. We intend to change the subject from raising taxes to creating \njobs.\n  In terms of taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office \nreport recently released--this is hard to believe. You have to go back \nand read it again, but 20 percent of Americans who pay individual taxes \npay 94 percent of all the taxes. Twenty percent of Americans pay 94 \npercent of the taxes. The President and his allies are about the only \nones in the country right now who are going out across the country and \nsaying: The way to solve this 5 years of recession and the bad economy \nwe have experienced is to raise taxes on the people who create millions \nof jobs. That is their argument, that the way to deal with the bad \neconomy we are in is to raise taxes on the people who create millions \nof jobs.\n  We do not believe that. We are prepared to keep the tax rates where \nthey are while we deal with what we need to deal with, which is the \nfiscal cliff that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board talks \nabout, where he says, if we do not deal with it at the end of the year, \nwe will produce, according to the Congressional Budget Office as well, \na recession in the first 6 months of 2013, which means more loss of \njobs.\n  So the subject we are here to talk about this morning is how to avoid \nthat. The question we are going ask is, why not bring up the \nappropriations bills and do our job under the Constitution to limit \nspending and get a head start on the business of putting the fiscal \nproblems we have behind us. Nothing could create jobs more rapidly than \nfor us to bring Washington into some solvency, create some certainty. \nPeople have said: We are not going to invest, we are not going to hire \nuntil we can see whether Congress can act.\n  As far as the appropriations bills, here are the basics: We have 12 \nof them that we are supposed to pass every year. A bipartisan group of \nus went to the floor a few months ago and praised the majority leader \nand the Republican leader for their agreement to try to bring them to \nthe floor and pass them. That has only happened twice in 12 years. So \nwe worked hard to do that. Nine of the 12 appropriations bills are \nready for the Senate to consider. In other words, they have been all \nthe way through the committee process. They are ready for the Senate to \nconsider.\n  Only the majority leader can bring them to the floor. Yet he said 2 \nweeks ago suddenly: No appropriations bills this year. That is 38 \npercent of the budget. That is more than $1 trillion. That is our job \nto do. It is the way we control spending. Yet we are not even going to \ndeal with it. So this morning we are going to talk about the \nconsequences of that and hope the majority leader will change his mind \nand bring these bills to the floor.\n  The House is doing its job. The House has acted on eleven of their 12 \nbills and the House has passed 7. While they may be at a different \noverall spending level than we are, we have a well-established \nprocedure for dealing with that called the conference, which is the way \nwe normally deal with differences between the two Houses.\n  So suddenly we are saying, no budget, no appropriations bills. That \nis why we are on the floor today. I wish to begin by asking the Senator \nfrom Georgia, who is a former leader of the Republicans in the Georgia \nlegislature, who has been here for a number of years, and who has been \none of the leaders in this body of working across party lines to try to \ncause the Senate to do its job, whether he can think of a good reason \nwhy we should not be dealing with appropriations bills this year.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank Senator Alexander for the recognition and for \njoining with Senator Blunt in this colloquy. As I was listening to you \ntalk, I thought back to what happened in my family Sunday night. I want \nto start my remarks with that.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  My wife Dianne and I went to my son Kevin and his wife Katherine's \nhouse to cook out hamburgers on Sunday night. Three of my nine \ngrandchildren were there: Elizabeth, Sarah Katherine, and William. \nElizabeth had arrived late, by the way, because she had been at a \nbirthday party, the theme of which was dressing their American Girl \ndolls.\n  When Elizabeth finally got home, she sat down by me and she said: \nGrandpa, I want to talk to you. She calls me ``Pops.'' I want to talk \nto you about my American Girl doll and some accessories that I want to \nbuy. So she went over with me how much money it would take to buy the \naccessories and how much money she made for her chores. We sat down and \nkind of budgeted how many chores it is going to take to make the amount \nof money she needs to buy the American Girl doll accessories. Riding \nhome that night I commented to my wife: You know, I just spent more \ntime talking about budgeting and appropriating with my granddaughter \nthan I have spent the entire year in the Senate.\n  This morning I was with Bud Peterson, the president of the Georgia \nInstitute of Technology, and you can identify with this as a former \npresident of the University of Tennessee, and Senator Blunt, the former \npresident of Southwest Baptist University. He was talking about how \ntuition has not gone up that much, but the amount of State support to \nsubsidize tuition has gone down because the States are having to live \nwithin their means, having to have balanced budgets. They are having to \ncut.\n  I thought to myself, here we are in Washington, the leaders of the \ncountry, the people who should be setting the example. Yet my State and \nmy granddaughter are doing a better job than we are. That is an \nindictment of the system.\n  I joined the Senator when he commended Senator Reid on saying he was \ngoing to bring appropriations bills to the floor. I will come to the \nfloor and cheer him again if he will bring them to the floor. We are \nrunning out of time, but we are also running out of the patience of the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Alexander's remarks about jobs--appropriations are all about \njobs. Right now we are operating for the third year in a row under what \nis known as continuing resolutions. Do you know what that means? That \nmeans we are continuing to do things just as badly as we did the year \nbefore, because we are not facing the music. We are not prioritizing \nour expenditures. We are talking about the appropriations of the \nAmerican people and their tax dollars.\n  Senator Murray was talking about taxes as one part of the equation. \nIt is only one part. Spending is the other part of the equation. You \nonly address spending by taking up appropriations bills, by having \ndebate and by moving forward.\n  By way of example, my State is having a referendum in 2 weeks, a \nreferendum on a $7.4 billion increase in sales tax dedicated for 10 \nyears to roads and improvements in infrastructure. Our State needs it. \nThe taxpayers are going to vote on it.\n  President Obama announced a couple of weeks ago a prioritization of \nthe Port of Savannah in Georgia in terms of finishing the deepening and \nthe widening of that project so the Panamax ships can come in. But if \nwe are not doing appropriations bills on WRDA, we are not doing \nappropriations bills on the Corps of Engineers, we are not doing \nappropriations bills on highways, those jobs are not going to come, or \nwe are not going to have jobs and the velocity of investment we need to \nhave.\n  It is a real indictment of the greatest democracy on the face of this \nEarth, the leader of the entire free world, that in a time when we are \nin difficulties, we are in a time with increased debt, we are in a time \nof great challenges, we are talking more with our grandchildren about \nspending and saving than we are talking to each other about the money \nof the taxpayers of the United States of America.\n  I commend the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Missouri on \ntheir dedication to this subject and the leadership they have shown on \nappropriations in subcommittee work, and Senator Cochran, all of the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. The bills are ready. All it \ntakes is for someone to drop the flag and say: Bring them to the floor. \nI hope Senator Reid will reconsider not bringing them to the floor and \ninstead bring them to the floor. Let us talk about the American \npeople's money. Let us talk about jobs. Let's talk about investment in \nthe greatest country on the face of this Earth.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his clear \nstatement about solving the appropriations problems, solving the fiscal \nproblems, creating an environment in which the private sector in this \ncountry is willing to create more jobs, and how failing to do that, in \nthe words of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, would be \n``destructive.'' In the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office, it \nwould create a recession in the first 6 months of 2013.\n  The Senator from Missouri is the former No. 2 leader in the House of \nRepresentatives and now he is a part of the Senate Republican \nleadership, so he has some special knowledge about how the two Houses \nwork together.\n  The majority leader gave as his reason why he could not bring up the \nappropriations bill, one, that it did not fit the Budget Control Act. \nWell, the Budget Control Act, which we passed, I voted for it, set a \nlimit on appropriations, and the Senate is marking up its bills to that \nnumber. The House is marking up to a number a little below. The \nmajority leader said: Well, they are at one number, the Senate is at \nanother number, so we will not do anything.\n  I would ask the Senator from Missouri, I thought it was a pretty \nnormal procedure for the House of Representatives to do what it thought \nit ought to do, and the Senate to do what it thought it ought to do. \nThere is something called a conference of the Senate and the House to \nwork out the differences.\n  Mr. BLUNT. That is exactly right. That is the way the process is \nsupposed to work. I think the observation the Senator made on the \nBudget Control Act is that is the maximum amount of money we agree to \nspend. The majority leader's view is: Well, if the House decides to \nspend less than that, somehow we cannot move forward.\n  The truth is that is the excuse for this year. In the 6 years that \nthe current majority has controlled the Senate, they have not passed a \nbudget three times and three times have not brought a single \nappropriations bill to the floor. I do not exactly know what the excuse \nwas the other times, but this year it is: Well, the House has a \ndifferent number.\n  The House is a different institution. It is the House of \nRepresentatives. They get elected every 2 years. They bring bills to \nthe floor. In fact, they have had a budget the last 2 years and we have \nnot. I think the House the last year that the majority controlled, the \nlast year Nancy Pelosi was Speaker, did not have a budget. That may be \nthe only time ever since the budget law in 1974. But the Senate has not \nhad a budget for 3 years.\n  There is that old saying: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. \nClearly the budget is a plan, and the Parliamentarian says we do not \nhave one. The Parliamentarian says the Senate has failed to obey the \nlaw for 3 years now because we do not have a budget. We are not \nprepared to tell the American people what our budget is. And even in \nspite of not having a budget, the Senate Appropriations Committee has \ngone ahead and figured out a number they could use as the number to \nappropriate to. Those bills are ready. The only problem is, those bills \nare not allowed to come to the floor. A few days ago, I cannot remember \nwhat the waste of time that week was on the Senate floor, but I said, \nin the leadership stakeout: Why are we not doing the things we are \nsupposed to be doing that give us a plan, that tell the American people \nwhat we are for? Then at the next moment, the next press opportunity, \nthe majority came out and they asked the leader: Why are we not doing \nthat? And the majority leader said: Well, because the House has a \ndifferent number, so we are not going to have an appropriations process \nuntil the election is over.\n  It is particularly interesting to me that the majority's view is that \nthey do not want to tell people until the election is over what they \nare for. The House is saying what they are for.\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\nThey have had 11 of the 12 bills ready to go to the floor, and more \nthan half of them have been voted on. They voted on a budget. But in \nthe Senate, we are not prepared to tell people what we are for.\n  Another thing, this is 38 percent of the budget. Senator Alexander \nmentioned this earlier. What about the other 62 percent? The other 62 \npercent now gets spent if we do not even show up, if nobody takes any \naction, because we have already defined the so-called entitlement part \nof the budget. A lot of that is Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity--62 percent. By the way, that was all of the money that came \nin.\n  And while we have not had a budget for 3 years, while over 6 years we \nhave only brought appropriations bills to the floor three times, our \nnational debt has nearly doubled. It went from $8.67 trillion when the \ncurrent majority leader became the majority leader to $15.87 trillion \nnow 6 years later. We have doubled the debt. We have failed to plan. So \nI guess the old adage is true: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. \nOur big failure is we have allowed the debt of the country--the debt \nthat was accumulated in over 200 years, we have now doubled in 6 years. \nDuring that 6 years, we have simply been unwilling to do our work. The \nAmerican people are upset about what is happening in Washington, and \nthey should be. I am upset about it too. We could be talking about \nspending on the floor of the Senate. That is the only way to ever get \nspending under control--the appropriations bills, the most basic work \nthe Congress is supposed to do. By the way, we ought to get to where we \nare talking about more than 38 percent of the budget when we talk about \nthe appropriations bills. We have to get that back in the right \ncategory as well.\n  We have to make the Senate work. The best way to do that is to do the \njob the Congress is supposed to do, the House and the Senate. When only \nthe House does it, there is no chance to have that conference. That is \nhow legislation works, back to the Senator's original point. The House \npasses a bill. Any of us who had the basic civic course remember how \nthat chart looked: The House passes a bill, the Senate passes a bill, \nthen you go to conference and talk about the differences.\n  But the current majority has said: Well, there are differences. We \ncould never work that out, so we will not do our part of the \nlegislative process. We will not have the debate in the Senate. We will \nnot tell the American people what we are for, and we will let them go \nto the polling place on election day guessing what we might be for, but \nwe are certainly not going to let them find that out by bringing \nlegislation to the floor.\n  The Senate is not doing its work. This is the fundamental work that \nneeds to be done. I mean, imagine when the Senator was the Governor of \nTennessee or when he was president of the University of Tennessee, if \nhe decided they were not going to have a budget, or this interesting \nargument some of our colleagues make that the Budget Control Act is the \nbudget because it sets the top line.\n  That would be like when Senator Alexander was Governor and had gotten \nhis adviser and Cabinet together and said: Here is the amount of money \nwe are going to spend. Now let's see how it works out.\n  That would be the budget? Of course that wouldn't be a budget. It \nwould be a disaster. And the 6-year deficit numbers of $8.67 trillion \nto now, 6 years later, $15.87 trillion proves the disaster truly has \nhappened.\n  I just can't imagine. How could one possibly run a State or \nuniversity or a business if their budgeting process was, here is the \ntop number we are going to spend; now let's see how it works out.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, I can't imagine how that would be. In fact, this \nis such a breathtaking assertion by the majority leader, it is hard to \ngrasp it.\n  Here we are in a fiscal mess. Everybody says that. They will say it \nis for a different reason on that side than we do, but everybody \nacknowledges it. Everybody acknowledges as well that while the rest of \nthe world is in trouble, we are just in a little less trouble and we \ncan get out of our trouble more easily than the rest of the world; that \nthe single biggest decision about whether the United States deals with \nits fiscal crisis and gets the economy moving again is whether the \nPresident and the Congress can govern. That is what everyone says, and \nwe know it is true. In other words, this isn't out of our hands. This \nisn't out of our control. In fact, it is within our hands. All we have \nto do is come to some agreement about how much money we can spend, \nreform the taxes, reduce the debt, control entitlement spending, and \nthis country will take off like a rocket.\n  The retiring head of the World Bank last month told a briefing of \nabout 35 Democratic and Republican Senators--all of whom are concerned \nabout this, all of whom are committed to working on it--that people who \nare making decisions about whether to hire people or whether to invest \nmore money in the United States have stopped. They have stopped because \nof the uncertainty. And what are they waiting on? They are waiting to \nsee whether we can function. They are waiting to see whether we can \ngovern. They have stopped to wait and see.\n  This is not an encouraging indication about whether the United States \ncan govern. We had some encouragement earlier in the year. That is why \nseveral of us from both sides of the aisle came to the floor and \ncomplimented the majority leader, complimented the Republican leader, \nand said: We applaud your agreement to do the appropriations bills.\n  It says right here in the Constitution, Section 9 of Article I, that \nno money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of \nappropriations made by law. In other words, Article I--this is our job. \nPeople say I use the Grand Ole Opry as an analogy too often sometimes, \nbut why would you join the Grand Ole Opry if you didn't want to sing? \nAppropriating money is what we do.\n  If the Senator doesn't like the Solyndra loan, then I am supposed to \ncome up here and make that argument if I agree with that. If Senator \nBlunt has a flood problem out in Missouri, he can make the argument \nthat he made last year: Put some more money in to take care of the \nflood victims; take some more money out of here to pay for it.\n  If we want less of this or more of that, the way we do that is by \ngoing through the appropriations process, coming to the floor, offering \namendments, and representing the people who elected us and sent us \nhere. What are we supposed to say when we go home and they say: We \nthink there should be more money for the Center Hill Dam on the Caney \nFork River or more money for the levees down along the Mississippi and \nthere ought to be less money for loans like Solyndra. Are we supposed \nto say: Well, sorry, we are not in business in the Senate because the \none person who can put an appropriations bill on the floor has \nannounced suddenly that he is not going to do it.\n  It is not because we don't have time to do it. Look, we could be \ndoing it today. I will bet we don't even have a vote today, much less \ndebate something interesting. We have been wasting the entire month. We \ncould have taken up almost every one--most of the nine appropriations \nbills that are ready to be enacted and put them on the floor to vote.\n  The Senator from Missouri is a part of the Republican leadership. He \nhas that honor. There is a different way to run the Senate, and maybe \nthat should be a major factor in the election this year. Maybe people \nwould like to see the Senate work on the $1 trillion that is a part of \nthe appropriations bills, bring amendments and bills to the floor in a \nbipartisan way, let Senators from every State vote on those, and vote \nthem up or down. That would be one way to run the Senate.\n  And I wonder if that kind of discussion has been going on in the \nRepublican leadership. If we were fortunate enough to have a majority \nand move a few desks from that side over to this side as a result of \nthe election, how do you think Senator McConnell and the Republican \nleadership would conduct business in the Senate?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I do think we are having that discussion, and particularly \nabout the budget.\n  There have never been 60 popularly elected Republican Senators, so \nanytime the Republicans have controlled the Senate, it was with a \nnumber that was below 60. And the budget became incredibly important \nbecause you can\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\ndo things that involve spending money or collecting money during the \n10-year budget window, and that decade can be extended every single \nyear if you wanted to. So you can always be talking 10 years in the \nfuture of solid policy. And, by the way, in a democracy, 10 years of \nknowing what the policy is is a lot of time.\n  We have to have a budget. Our friends in the majority--now there are \n53 of them--could do anything in the budget or at least set out to do \nanything in the budget that 53 of them said they wanted to do. They \ncould change tax policy for 10 years if 53 of them wanted to do it. \nThey could change how we implement the President's health care bill, if \n53 of them wanted to do it, because that is spending money, and we \nwould have to do that.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that if our side were in the \nmajority, we would have a budget because, frankly, it is the biggest \ntool our size majority has ever had. There have never been 60 of us. We \ncouldn't rely on 60.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the Senator would yield, I have heard Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, speak both in our Republican caucus \nand in meetings with Democrats in committee and publicly. I believe he \nhas made it absolutely clear that if he were fortunate enough to be the \nmajority leader, that he would bring appropriations bills to the floor, \nthat he would see that a large number of amendments from both sides of \nthe aisle were offered, and that we would be working longer, working \nlater, and getting more done.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think the Senator is exactly right. He has made that \npledge at press conferences. I think some of that has been said \nrecently on the floor of the Senate: Let's get our work done. And if we \nwere in the majority, we would pledge that we would get our work done. \nThat means Republican Senators and Democratic Senators would wind up \nhaving to take some votes they would just as soon not take, but that \nhas always been part of being in the Senate, that you are here to say \nwhat you are for, and you are here for 6 years to say what you are for.\n  The last 6 years--if you have served in the Senate and your only time \nin the Senate, as would be the case for some of our colleagues up to \nnow, has been the last 6 years, you have really never had a chance to \nsay what you are for. Half the years you didn't even have an \nappropriations bill on the floor.\n  And we have added to the legislative dialog normal phrases that \ndidn't used to be quite as normal, such as ``continuing resolution.'' \nAnd what is a continuing resolution? That means you basically can't get \nyour work done for the next year, so you decide to just put a couple of \nbandaids on whatever were the rules for last year and move forward. \nWhen you talk about a continuing resolution, that is failure.\n  We are going to have a few more days here in July and early August, \nand then, as Congress has always done, we will go home and hear a lot \nof complaints in August this year because we are not getting our work \ndone. We are going to come back in September. The fiscal year--the \nspending year--ends the end of September, and what are our choices \ngoing to be? We are not going to have good choices. We have had no \nappropriations bills. So the choice is to either let the government \nstop functioning on October 1 or continue spending money at the level \nwe decided who knows how many years ago, to spend that money in many of \nthese programs because we really have not talked about these programs. \nSo we go from no good choice to an even worse choice.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We are all good friends here. People sometimes talk \nabout lack of civility in the Senate. The fact is the Senate is \nprobably the most civil place in the United States. We are excessively \nnice to each other. We have disagreements, but we are nice to each \nother. But what is disappointing is that it is not functioning. The \nSenate is not functioning the way it is supposed to.\n  It would be as if the President announced: Well, I am not going to \nthe office for a month or two; or if the Supreme Court said: Well, it \nhas gotten to be February, and we think we will stop deciding cases and \ngo home, we will go on vacation. What would the American people say? \nWell, that is what is happening here. And it is not that we don't have \nthe time. We have it right now. We have it this minute that we could do \nbe doing it.\n  What makes it especially disappointing is that earlier this year \nthere was what I call an outbreak of good government. We had the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader saying: Let's bring all the \nappropriations bills to the floor, and people on both sides were \napplauding them. And then we had some discussions, and lo and behold, \nsuddenly we had bills coming to the floor that made a difference in the \nlives of Americans: the FAA bill, which is about airline safety, the \nfarm bill, the highway bill, and the Postal Service bill. And thanks to \nsuggestions by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and others, we \nbegan to adopt an agreement: Let's allow all relevant amendments to the \nbill be considered. So we began to vote a lot. I think one bill had 73 \namendments. And then there were even some amendments that weren't \nrelevant.\n  It began to look like the time in the 1980s when Senators Byrd and \nBaker ran the Senate. Senator Byrd or Senator Baker would come to the \nfloor and say: All right, here is a bill that is supported by the \nDemocratic chairman and the ranking Republican, or vice versa. They put \nit on the floor, and they would ask for amendments. They might get 300, \nand then they would say: I ask unanimous consent to have no more \namendments. And of course they would get it because everybody who \nwanted an amendment had offered one. Then they would start to vote, and \nthe majority leader would say: OK, we are going to stay here until we \nfinish. And they did. Now, it never was perfect. It is always a little \nmessy. That is the way the Senate is. But they got a lot of work done. \nThat is what makes this so disappointing.\n  Mr. BLUNT. It is disappointing in that, as the Senator says, it is \nnot even that hard to figure out what we could be doing or what we \nshould be doing or what is the fundamental work of what we should be \ndoing. There are things the Constitution says we can't do, such as \ninitiate a tax bill. So we are spending a lot of time on tax bills \nthat, even if we passed one, would be unconstitutional. The House has \nthe right to start those bills, and they would say: We are not even \ngoing to deal with that because it is outside of the Constitution. It \nis not as though this is a hard formula.\n  How do you get spending under control? The No. 1 domestic priority in \nthe country today should be more private sector job creation. But the \nNo. 1 priority for the Federal Government would be, how do we get \nspending under control? How do we begin to pay off debt rather than add \nto debt? And the only way we can do that is to debate the spending \nbills.\n  The Senator mentioned the former head of the World Bank a minute ago. \nI heard him mention a few days ago that several years ago after leaving \nthe governorship, he spent some time in Australia and made good friends \nthere--one of the former Prime Ministers of Australia. And I will let \nhim tell that story. Everybody in the world knows the best and \nstrongest economy and workforce in the world is ours, if we just do the \nright thing. And the right thing is not that hard to figure out.\n  The Senator from Tennessee was telling me one of the former Prime \nMinisters had just returned to the government after some time away. \nWhat about his comment about what it takes for our country to reassert \nitself as the economic place to watch and place to be and want to be. \nWhen the Senator reminded me about that story, I thought it was very \ntelling. People all over the world understand what it is we ought to \ndo, but we are just not doing it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would be happy to do that. Actually, Bob Zoellick, \nthe retiring head of the World Bank, reported this story to 35 or 40 of \nus--both parties--to find out how to do what we are talking about, \nwhich is to deal with the fiscal cliff issues coming at the end of the \nyear. He repeated Bob Carr, the new Foreign Minister in Australia, who \nsaid in a speech in Washington that the United States is one budget \nagreement away from reasserting its global preeminence.\n  All of us believe the United States is the preeminent country in the \nworld. That statement comes from a great friend of the United States \nwho wants us to succeed and who knows we can.\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\n  If we want to get our economy moving again and help the world get its \neconomy moving again, the main thing we need to do is make this fiscal \nagreement, deal with the debt, deal with tax reform, deal with the \npayroll taxes, deal with the sequester, and deal with the \nappropriations bills. This is the single most important thing we can do \nto get our economy moving again instead of heading into a depression. \nHe put it that way to reassert, establish, claim, renew--whatever \nadjective or verb we want to use. The way to maintain America's global \npreeminence is to get a budget agreement at the end of the year. We \nwere off to such a promising start this year and now we slid backwards.\n  I will let the Senator from Missouri make the final remarks in the \ncolloquy. It is my hope the majority leader will decide to use the rest \nof our time this week and next week to deal with appropriations bills, \nand then when we come back in September we could deal with more. It \ndoesn't take long. Let's just put them on the Senate floor and get to \nwork. We can agree on a reasonable number of amendments. We showed we \ncould do that before, and the American people would appreciate us doing \nour job.\n  Remember, 9 of the 12 are ready to go. It affects 38 percent of the \nbudget. That is more than $1 trillion in spending. That would be one \nmore indication we are capable of governing ourselves, which is the \nsingle most important signal that those who invest and create jobs in \nAmerica need to see and hear from Washington, DC.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his leadership and for coming \nto the Senate floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. My only thought, as we are standing here finishing up this \ndiscussion, is that as people hear this, they may wonder if Senator \nAlexander and Senator Blunt are talking about how the Federal \nGovernment can spend the money, and that being the most important \nthing. If we are going to get spending under control, of course, it is \nthe most important thing. It is not a desire to spend money, it is a \ndesire to debate how we spend the money, to plan how we spend the \nmoney, and give as much notice as we can to the country, to the States, \nand to the people who are trying to make job-creating decisions. We \nwant to show them the American government is going to do the right \nthing and is going to plan for a future that makes sense rather than \nfail to plan and stumble into a future that continues to just do the \nwrong things.\n  We have seen the debt of the country almost double in 6 years. \nSurely, that is enough indication that what we are doing is not working \nand more of the same is not the answer. Getting back to the real \nresponsibility of the Senate to do its job--the House is doing its job. \nThey are going to take some criticism about the programs they said \nshould be cut or redefined. We need to do our job. That is the way this \nprocess has to work. It is disappointing that it is not working.\n  We are going to come back in all likelihood in September with bad \nchoices that will be made. One is to shut the government down. One is \nto just somehow continue to spend money as we have been spending it as \nthe debt of the United States of America doubled in about 6 years.\n  I yield back to my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  I see the Senator from Nebraska is here. I wonder if he is here to be \na part of our colloquy or to make another statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I am here to make another statement, but \nI do want to associate myself with what the two Senators had to say, \nthe Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Tennessee. I look at our \nassignment between now and the end of the year, and we have some \nmonumental issues to tackle. In fact, they are so monumental that many \nare referring to the work that needs to be done as a fiscal cliff. Some \nare talking in the vein that we are going to cause another recession \nunless we come to grips with these issues.\n  I look at this week and so many weeks that have passed this year and \nnothing has been done. I am going to guess when this week is all said \nand done, we will probably take three votes. That seems unbelievable \nfor the Senate. It doesn't have to be this way at all. We could be \naddressing the important issues that face our Nation. There isn't any \nreason we should not be addressing those issues. Let's debate bills, \nvote on them, and do the right thing for our country.\n  I thank the two Senators for their comments and I am pleased to be \nable to associate myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise this morning in strong support of \nthe Middle Class Tax Cut Relief Act that would extend tax cuts for 98 \npercent of the American people while letting the Bush tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest 2 percent expire at the end of this year.\n  I also want to express my strong opposition to the McConnell-Hatch \nbill that would provide tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks next \nyear to millionaires and billionaires who today are doing phenomenally \nwell.\n  Really, this is not a complicated issue. The United States now is \nseeing growing wealth and income inequality. The middle class is \ndisappearing, poverty is increasing, the people at the top are doing \nvery well at the same time that the effective tax rate of the \nmillionaires and billionaires is the lowest it has been for many \ndecades.\n  This country has a $16 trillion national debt. We have a $1 trillion \ndeficit this year. I believe to give huge tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires makes no sense, and I believe it makes no sense to the \nAmerican people.\n  Our Republican friends have made it very clear that when they say \nthey don't want to raise taxes on anyone, that is just code for saying \nthey don't want to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. I \nshould add that if Governor Mitt Romney becomes President, he has \nproposed even more tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country \nwhile at the same time cutting Social Security, ending Medicare as we \nknow it, and slashing investments in education, transportation, child \ncare, nutrition, and a variety of other programs that benefit working \nfamilies and the middle class.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  This morning I want to say a few words about Social Security. Let me \nbe very clear. When we talk about Social Security, it is imperative \nthat we understand that Social Security has not contributed one nickel \nto our deficit or our national debt. So when people say we have a \nnational debt problem and that we have Social Security and they fuse \nthe two together, that is simply incorrect.\n  As all Americans know, Social Security is independently funded \nthrough payroll tax contributions from workers and employers. Up until \nlast year, it has received no funding from the Federal Treasury.\n  Despite the rhetoric we hear from Republicans and those on Wall \nStreet, Social Security is not in financial crisis. Social Security has \na $2.7 trillion surplus. According to the Social Security \nAdministration, Social Security will be able to pay out 100 percent of \npromised benefits to every eligible recipient for the next 21 years.\n  Although the American people now take Social Security for granted, we \nshould never underestimate the incredibly positive impact Social \nSecurity has had on our country. Sometimes we do forget it, especially \nwhen those people come up and say: Let's cut Social Security. Let's cut \nSocial Security. But let's talk about what Social Security has \naccomplished.\n  Since its inception over 75 years ago, through good economic times \nand bad, through terrible recessions, Social Security has paid out \nevery nickel owed to every eligible beneficiary with minimal \nadministrative cost. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Nobody \nhas ever received a letter from the Social Security Administration \nsaying: Sorry. We are in the middle of a recession. We have had to cut \nyour benefits in half. Every eligible beneficiary has received 100 \npercent of the benefits owed to him or her.\n  During this 75-year period, Social Security has succeeded in keeping \nmillions of senior citizens, widows, orphans, and persons with \ndisability out of poverty. Before Social Security existed, almost half \nof America's senior citizens lived in poverty. Today, that\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nnumber is still too high, but it is 10 percent not 50 percent.\n  More than 55 million Americans now receive Social Security benefits. \nI would contrast that record to the situation we recently saw on Wall \nStreet when millions of Americans lost significant or all of their \nretirement savings because of the collapse of Wall Street and the \nfinancial crisis we went through. Despite this success, despite this \nincredibly strong record, my Republican friends, and too many \nDemocratic friends, are calling for cuts in Social Security.\n  For example, we know where Mitt Romney stands on Social Security. Mr. \nRomney wants to begin the process of privatizing Social Security. I \ndisagree with him because I think that would benefit primarily his \nfriends on Wall Street, because if we privatize Social Security, where \nare people going to get their retirement benefits? From Wall Street. \nThose guys on Wall Street will end up making huge amounts of money by \ncharging the average American a significant commission for their \nservice.\n  Mr. Romney wants to gradually increase the retirement age to 68 or \n69. I don't agree with that. At a time when 23 million Americans remain \nunemployed or underemployed and when the long-term unemployment for \nsenior citizens is skyrocketing, tell me how many employers out there \nare going to say to a 68-year-old person or a 69-year-old person: We \nhave a great job for you, especially if someone is in the construction \ntrades or is a nurse or is somebody who stands on their feet 8 or 9 \nhours a day, such as a waiter or a waitress. I don't think those jobs \nare going to be there if we raise the Social Security retirement age. I \ndon't know what those folks are going to be doing for income.\n  Finally, the Romney campaign has put on his Web site the following:\n\n       Mitt believes that [Social Security] benefits should \n     continue to grow but that the growth rate should be lower for \n     those with higher incomes.\n\n  What does that mean in English? While Mr. Romney has been somewhat \nvague about his intentions and has not spelled out the exact details of \nthis proposal, some of my Republican friends in the Senate have \nprovided what I believe is the roadmap Mr. Romney is talking about. \nLast year, Senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee introduced \na bill that would, among other things, reduce the future growth rate of \nSocial Security benefits for the top 60 percent of earners--60 percent \nof earners--by establishing what they call a progressive price index.\n  Who are these so-called higher income individuals whom my Republican \nfriends are talking about? Under this Republican bill, a worker making \nabout $45,000 a year today, retiring in 2050, would receive 32 percent \nless in annual Social Security benefits than under the current formula. \nHow much is a 32-percent cut for this middle-class wage earner? It is \nabout $7,500 a year, and that, my friends, is a lot of money for a \nretiree.\n  It should come as no surprise that Republicans in Washington and \nGovernor Romney want to slash Social Security. The truth is, \nRepublicans have never liked Social Security, and they have been \nattacking Social Security since its inception. That is not news. The \nquestion that millions of Americans are asking themselves today, \nhowever, is where President Obama stands on Social Security. \nUnfortunately, he has been largely silent on this issue since he has \nbeen in the White House and during the current 2012 campaign. He made a \nvery strong statement recently, incorrectly attacking the Republican \nproposal--the so-called Ryan proposal--to move Medicare toward a \nvoucher program. But unless I am mistaken, I did not hear a word from \nhim on the future of Social Security, and that is a shame.\n  That is a shame because candidate Barack Obama, when he was running \nfor President in 2008, made it very clear to the American people he \nwould be a strong defender of Social Security. Let me remind the \nAmerican people exactly what Barack Obama said on the campaign trail in \n2008.\n  On September 6, 2008, Barack Obama told the AARP the following:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost of living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear: I will not do either.\n\n  That was then-candidate Senator Barack Obama. On April 16, 2008, \nSenator Barack Obama said:\n\n       The alternatives, like raising the retirement age, or \n     cutting benefits, or raising the payroll tax on everybody, \n     including people making less than $97,000 a year--\n\n  Which today would be $110,000 a year--\n\n     those are not good policy options.\n\n  On November 11, 2007, candidate Barack Obama said:\n\n       I believe that cutting [Social Security] benefits is not \n     the right answer; and that raising the retirement age is not \n     the best option.\n\n  In order to address the long-term financial challenges of Social \nSecurity, candidate Barack Obama came up with an idea that I believe \nhit the nail on the head. It was exactly the right approach, and I have \napplauded him for coming up with that idea. What he said is that he \nwould apply the Social Security payroll tax on income above $250,000 a \nyear to make sure a millionaire and a billionaire pay the same \npercentage of their income into Social Security as someone who today \nmakes $110,000 a year.\n  The bottom line is we lift the cap on taxable income so billionaires \nand millionaires and those making above $250,000 a year start \ncontributing into the Social Security trust fund. Recent reports have \nconfirmed this would ensure Social Security would remain solvent for \nthe next 75 years.\n  In 2008, candidate Barack Obama was exactly right. That is the \nsolution to the long-term financial needs of Social Security, and that \nis why I introduced candidate Obama's concept into legislation. It was \nthe right approach. I have introduced it into legislation and it now \nhas 10 cosponsors.\n  Here is how the Economic Times reported on the subject back on June \n14, 2008:\n\n       Barack Obama would apply the Social Security payroll tax to \n     all annual incomes above $250,000, which would affect the \n     wealthiest 3 percent of Americans. The Presidential candidate \n     told senior citizens in Ohio that it is unfair for middle-\n     class earners to pay the Social Security tax ``on every dime \n     they make,'' while millionaires and billionaires pay it on \n     only ``a very small percentage of their income.''\n\n  That is what Barack Obama said when he was running for President in \n2008. I agreed with him. He was very clear. I suspect millions of \nAmericans voted for Barack Obama because of the strong stand he made in \ndefending Social Security. Unfortunately, since he has been in office, \nhe has been much less clear about his position on Social Security. \nThere were reports last year he was considering cutting Social Security \nas part of a grand bargain with the Speaker of the House John Boehner.\n  What I simply want to know, and I think what the American people want \nto know, is where does the President stand on Social Security? Is he \ngoing to keep faith with the American people? Does he continue to \nbelieve what he believed when he ran for President? Is he going to say \nto the millions and millions of seniors out there who are struggling \nevery single day to keep their heads above water that we are not going \nto balance the budget on the backs of the elderly and the children and \nthe sick and the poor; that we are not going to continue to give tax \nbreaks to millionaires and billionaires who are doing phenomenally well \nand cut Social Security as part of some grand bargain when, in fact, \nSocial Security has not contributed a nickel to the deficit situation?\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, in terms of Social Security, \nthere is a lot of discussion in the Senate about moving toward a \nchained CPI--a chained CPI. Nobody outside this room understands what a \nchained CPI is, but I will tell you what it is. A chained CPI is \nsignificant cuts in Social Security COLAs, and it rests on the theory, \nif we can believe it, that COLAs for seniors on Social Security are too \ngenerous.\n  When I tell this to the seniors in Vermont, I say: Please, don't \nlaugh, but they always laugh. They say: Bernie, in the last 2 out of 3 \nyears, while our health care costs have been going up, while our \nprescription drug costs have been going up, we haven't gotten a COLA at \nall. How could they possibly believe the formulation for coming up with \nthese COLAs is too generous?\n  But that is what the billionaires and the millionaires want, that is \nwhat our\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\nRepublican friends want, and that is what some Democrats want. They \nwant to come up with a formulation which will cut Social Security \nbenefits. It will mean, if someone is 65 today, that when they become \n75, they will receive $500 a year less; and when they are 85 and are \ntrying to get by on $15,000, $16,000 a year, they are going to cut \n$1,000 from their Social Security benefits.\n  I think--when this country has the most unequal distribution of \nincome and wealth, when the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of the wealth \nof this country, when in the last study I saw 93 percent of all new \nincome in 2010 went to the top 1 percent--we shouldn't balance the \nbudget by cutting Social Security for people who are trying to survive \non $14,000 or $15,000 a year. That is not the right formulation or the \nway we should go.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks by simply saying I am going to do \neverything I can to defend Social Security. I am going to do everything \nI can--given the fact our deficit is largely caused by unpaid wars and \ntax breaks for the rich and the recession, which was created by Wall \nStreet greed--to fight any effort to cut Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid.\n  Today, I think the American people know where the Republicans stand \non Social Security. They know where Governor Romney stands on Social \nSecurity. But now is the time for the President of the United States to \ntell us where he stands on Social Security. Is he going to keep faith \nwith the promises he made in 2008? Is he going to stand with the senior \ncitizens of this country and say: No, we are not going to balance the \nbudget by cutting Social Security?\n  I look forward to hearing what the President has to say. This is an \nenormously important issue to the seniors and the veterans of Vermont, \nand I am going to continue dealing with it.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about a bill that \nwill reduce taxes for 97 percent of all small business owners. I wish \nto talk about a bill that will keep $2,200 in the pockets of the middle \nclass next year. I wish to talk about a bill that will extend tax cuts \nfor those making less than $250,000 per year. I wish to talk about the \nMiddle Class Tax Cut Act and why it should pass with overwhelming and \nbipartisan support.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have said they want to get our country \nback on its feet. Well, I know our prosperity has always stemmed from \nand been measured by the success of the middle class. They are the ones \nwho get in early and stay late. They take on a second job to make it \njust a little bit easier to pay for college. They wait to retire to \nsave more to help their children and grandchildren. Under no \ncircumstances should middle-class people be worried about their taxes \ngoing up, particularly at a time when median income, middle-class \nincome is declining in America.\n  To raise taxes at a time when the middle class is struggling makes no \nsense whatsoever. Under no circumstances--no circumstances--should the \nmiddle class have to worry about their taxes going up.\n  So we are proposing a 1-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts on \nall Americans on the first $250,000 of income they make. Let it be \nknown that tax break will go to everybody. A person could be making $10 \nmillion and they will get the same tax break on the first $250,000 as \nsomeone making $200,000 or $220,000 or someone making $80,000. So it \ndoes not discriminate.\n  By the way, we are lucky in America that we have people who have made \na whole lot of money by starting businesses and employing people. We \nrevel in the fact that America does that, and we admire well-to-do \npeople. The difference is we don't think they need a tax break when \nthat money could go to deficit reduction instead. Well, we can't say \nthat for the middle class because the middle class, obviously, has less \nmoney and is struggling. So that is why we choose $250,000 as the line.\n  In addition, there were three more very important tax cuts signed \ninto law by President Obama that working families across America rely \non. They are the American opportunity tax credit, the expanded child \ntax credit, and the earned-income tax credit. Our proposal would extend \nthese tax cuts as well. So under our plan the middle class will be \nsecure in the knowledge that their taxes aren't going to go up over the \nnext 5 months while we all debate the fiscal cliff and all the things \nwe have to do to prevent our deficit from growing. This should be \npriority No. 1--to secure the middle class while we have this debate.\n  I wish to focus for a moment on a glaring difference between our plan \nand the Republican plan. We all know how hard it is to pay for college. \nWe all know how important a college degree is. Study after study after \nstudy has shown if a person gets a college degree, they will make more \nincome and a person will have a better life. Some of the recent studies \nshow people even live longer. Having a college degree is so important \nto American families. Yet, at the same time, the cost of college is \nrising. Whether a person goes to a private school, a religious school, \nor a public university, the cost is going up and up and up. So it has \nbeen a passion of mine since I have come to the Senate, and even \nbefore, that we give middle-class people a tax break to go to college.\n  We help the poor already with Pell grants and things such as that. \nThat is a very good thing, and I am proud we do it. But a person or a \nfamily can be making $50,000, $70,000, $90,000, $110,000, and if a kid \nis going to college and it costs $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 or \n$40,000 a year, they can't afford it. As a result, we have millions of \nparents stretching and stretching and stretching to help their kids, \nand millions more students are taking on huge debt loads because they \nknow college is so important. It is vital for us to help them.\n  When a young man or a young woman who deserves to go to college \ndoesn't because they can't afford it, they lose, their family loses, \nand our country loses as well. When a young person goes to the college \nthey shouldn't go to because they can't afford the college they deserve \nto go to and want to go to, they lose, their family loses, and America \nloses. So it has been a passion of mine that we give the middle class--\nnot just the poor but the middle class as well--help in paying for \ncollege because it is so expensive but it is also so important.\n  So we have a law now called the American opportunity tax credit. It \nis legislation I wrote. It helped 9.1 million families get a tax break \non their children's college tuition last year. Because of the American \nopportunity tax credit, more parents and students now qualify for tax \nrelief to pay for college expenses not just for 2 years but for a whole \n4 years of study. It gives a $2,500 tax credit right off a family's \ntaxes to families whose income is up to $180,000 a year. So it goes \nwell into the middle class and even a little higher in many States. But \nit is needed. It is vital.\n  If this tax credit expires, families who rejoiced--I have talked to \nthem across my State of New York in every corner of the State. Moms and \ndads are sitting around the kitchen tables Friday night after dinner, \nthe kids are out, saying: How are we going to pay for college for Mary \nor Jane or Tom or Bill? They have sleepless nights about it. So why, \nwhy would our colleagues on the other side of the aisle let this tax \nbreak expire? Why does their proposal, which continues tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest of Americans, kick these tax incentives to the curb? To \nlet this tax break expire is a dagger to the heart of the middle class, \nand that is just what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ndoing.\n  It is more than clear Republicans are going to hold up the middle-\nclass tax cuts, including this needed and significant help to pay for \ncollege, to insist that we provide those at the highest income levels--\npeople who make over $250,000 a year--with a tax cut at the same time. \nThey are holding the middle-class tax cuts hostage.\n  Now, I will be the first to congratulate people who are very wealthy, \nas I\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\nmentioned. They have been successful. They are living the American \ndream. God bless them. They create jobs. They do. But today's debate is \nnot about them or their taxes. We can have a rigorous debate about \nwhether they deserve another tax break or whether that money should go \nto deficit reduction or maybe for education or infrastructure or \nscientific research. That is a debate for another day, and I look \nforward to it.\n  Today's debate is about the middle class. Letting these tax cuts \nexpire would generate serious problems for our middle-class families \nand businesses.\n  It could prevent them from being able to pay for their kids' \neducation or buy a new house or a new car. It could mean they put off \nretirement a little bit longer or cancel a vacation. That would have \nrepercussions across the entire economy. So extending the tax cuts for \nthe middle class is a no-brainer and the American people are on our \nside.\n  I hope, I pray, I beseech our friends on the other side of the aisle \nto listen to the middle class, saying: Look, you guys fight over what \nyou should do for the highest income people but come together on \nhelping us.\n  That is what we can do. If our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle want to get this country back on track, they will join us in \nsupporting this critical legislation, including the tax credit to help \npay for college education, to help the families and businesses that are \nthe real job creators and prosperity makers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Good afternoon, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Good afternoon.\n\n\n                         Remembering Sally Ride\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of a dear friend, someone whom I admire, and someone whom the \nwhole world cheered on, Dr. Sally Ride.\n  Dr. Ride was the first American woman in space. When she went out \nthere, she blazed a trail out into the stars for women in science and \nwomen in technology, inspiring not only American girls but girls around \nthe world.\n  Last night, we got the very sad news that Dr. Ride passed away after \na brave fight against pancreatic cancer.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to speak about her. We all know the \nbiography. Dr. Ride became an astronaut after answering an ad in her \ncollege newspaper. She had earned a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford. She \nalso earned a graduate degree in Shakespeare. She joined the first \ngroup of women in the astronaut corps and trained to be a mission \nspecialist.\n  I knew Sally Ride both professionally and personally. I have had the \ngreat honor in my years in the Senate to be on the committee that funds \nthe American space program. I have important space assets in my own \nState of Maryland: the great Goddard Space Flight Center and Wallops \nIsland, from where we hope to do some new launches later this summer.\n  But for me, my journey into space, my love for space began not only \nwhen John Glenn went into space, and when we walked on the Moon, but I \nwill never forget that day Sally Ride, in 1983, boarded that shuttle, \nstrapped herself in, put on her helmet, the rockets roared, and out she \nwent. The whole world had signs, cheers saying: Go Sally. Go Sally. \nWow, I will never forget it.\n  I was in the House of Representatives. I was down there. We were \nwaiting. We were excited. There was nothing like it. Mr. President, if \nyou have not seen a shuttle launch, it is the most amazing thing. The \nground shakes. You feel it. You feel it in your body. You feel it in \nyour heart. Then, as that rocket took off, we cheered her on. It was an \nenormously patriotic moment. Once again, our shuttle flew high into the \nsky. It was the Challenger, and later on it would have its own \nrendezvous with destiny.\n  I was so proud of Dr. Ride. But I was proud of my country. I was \nproud of its vision, of its innovation, and I was proud of the fact \nthat we live in a country where women can follow their dreams, to take \nthe talents God has given them and be able to pursue them.\n  When I saw Dr. Ride go into space, another barrier was broken for \nwomen. Even though Sally was the first, she did not want to be the \nonly. When she launched into space, yes, she broke a barrier; yes, she \ntook with her the hopes and dreams of many girls, but she wanted more \nto come. She had a characteristic of many of us who are the first. She \nsaid though she was the first American woman, she did not want to be \nthe only American woman. She devoted her career to encouraging young \nwomen to go into science and to also come into the space program. Now \nmore than 50 women have gone into space, and it has been an \nastounding--an astounding--accomplishment.\n  Dr. Ride and I talked about what it is like to be the first. When I \nwas elected to the Senate, I became the first Democratic woman elected \nto the Senate in her own right. Among the first 10 phone calls I got \nwas from Sally Ride, congratulating me. She said: Hey, you broke a \nbarrier and you are going to go into new space. It is called Senate \nspace. After we joked and laughed, and so on, we said: Gee, we \n``firstees'' ought to have a club that should meet on the first Monday \nof the first month, the first of the year. We had Sandra Day O'Connor. \nThere was Sally Ride. President George Bush was to go on to appoint \nBernadine Healy as the first woman to head NIH.\n  As we talked about it, she said: We who are the first cannot be the \nonly. Another characteristic of ``we the first'' was where she said--\nand we would agree--that you do not get to be a ``me'' without a whole \nlot of ``we.'' She was a firm believer in public schools, public \neducation, public libraries--those opportunities that enable you to go \nto school, that enable you to go get a Ph.D. at Stanford, that enable \nyou to get out there and compete, to be an astronaut, that when we \nthink about ourselves, we think about our families, we think about our \nteachers, we think about our coaches.\n  We are so indebted to them, and she was too. She was so indebted that \nthat is the way she wanted to devote her life. Sally Ride knew she was \nfamous, but she had no desire to get rich. She did not capitalize on \nher big name, her big iconic international brand. She wanted to use her \nname, her reputation, the Sally Ride brand, to be inspirational and \nmotivational. She did not seek profit. She sought to inspire others.\n  After retiring from NASA, she dedicated her entire life to \nencouraging young women to study science, math, and technology, to love \nthat which she loved and wanted to do. She continued to do that all the \nway up to the last months of her life.\n  I recall in 2008 I invited her to Baltimore to celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of her going into space. We had this great afternoon. After \na wonderful lunch of crab cakes and talking things over, we went to the \nMaryland Science Center. There were these girls there, Girl Scouts \nworking on badges about science and technology. There was this great \nglobe that showed planet Earth, and she talked about what it is like to \nstudy the planet. She talked about what it is like to go into space. \nWhat she said was, when you are busy looking out there in space, and \nyou look back, you see this great planet, and you want to do all you \ncan to help it and save it.\n  Those young girls were mesmerized. Well, wow, that was 4 years ago. \nMany of them have now finished their Girl Scout badges, many have \nfinished middle school and are in high school. But, hopefully, they are \nnot finished their great interest in science.\n  That is what her work was.\n  She also had a great impact on the space program itself.\n  When Al Gore was here as a Senator, he was on the authorizing \ncommittee, and I, of course, was an appropriator. She worked with NASA \nand us on a new strategic vision for NASA. Then, what did she say about \nwhat we should study? Planets, galaxies, asteroids, you name it; rings \naround Saturn, yes. But you know what else she said? She said: Let's \nstudy this planet where we suspect there is intelligent life. She had a \ngreat sense of humor. Al Gore and I leaned forward in our chairs and \nsaid: What would that be? What did Sally know that had been dreamt \nabout for ages--intelligent life? She said: Yes, it is called planet \nEarth. Let's see if we can find it.\n\n[[Page S5279]]\n\n  Dr. Ride, after we had our laughs that day, suggested that we study \nour own planet as if it were a distant star so that we would get to \nknow it, we would know its climate, we would know its weather, and also \nwe would take the time to know its people, and that we would do it to \nsave the planet and save the people who are on the planet.\n  I regret that our own science is not yet advanced to have saved Dr. \nRide. She died of pancreatic cancer. I know the gifted and talented \npeople at NIH and those who benefit from the funding of NIH are working \nall over this great country to find cures for that dread ``C'' word. \nPancreatic cancer is deadly and it is fast and it is painful. She died \nsteadfast and true to herself and true to her mission.\n  I think the entire world owes a debt of gratitude to her. The way we \ncan honor her memory is to encourage students to search for the stars, \nbut let's search here for the problems that hurt our own people. Let's \nfind a cure for pancreatic cancer. And let's continue to be a great \ncountry that innovates and also educates and believes in educating its \nwomen and girls in the same way.\n  God bless Sally Ride. And God bless America, the kind of country that \nmade Dr. Ride's life possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think \nit is a travesty of justice that Pakistan is holding this man for the \ncrime of helping America, and I think we should not tolerate it.\n  We send Pakistan $2 billion a year, and recently, instead of \nwithholding that, President Obama has given them an additional $1 \nbillion--exactly the wrong thing to do. I have a bill that will \nwithhold all further foreign aid to Pakistan unless this doctor is \nreleased.\n  There are reports now that his life has been threatened. There are \nreports coming from the Information Minister in the province where he \nis being held that his life has been threatened by fellow inmates and \nthroughout the community.\n  My concern is that Dr. Alfridi may well be killed before he comes to \ntrial. He was scheduled for an appeal on July 19. They have rescheduled \nthis, and it will be on August 30.\n  I have a bill, and I have the votes necessary to demand a vote in the \nSenate. No matter what the leadership wants, we will have a vote on \nending all of Pakistan's aid if this political prisoner, Dr. Shakil \nAlfridi, is not released. We will have this vote. I had threatened to \nhave the vote this week, but I am going to delay it for one month to \nsee if the appeal works, to see if he is still safe in 1 month. But I \nhate to think of what might happen to him while we are waiting here and \nthat we have not used every bit of the leverage of this money that we \ngive to Pakistan. It is our money, it is your money, and we should not \nbe sending it to a country that disrespects us.\n  If Pakistan wants to be our ally, they should act like it. If \nPakistan wants to work with us in the war on terrorism, they should act \nlike it. And imprisoning the man who helped us get one of the world's \nworst mass murderers is not a way to encourage cooperation between our \ncountries.\n  This episode of imprisoning this man is driving a wedge between \nAmerica and Pakistan. So if Pakistan wants to help us, good. Can we \ncooperate with them? Yes. But we should not continue to send good money \nafter bad while they are imprisoning this man. This doctor deserves our \nrespect.\n  I have also introduced legislation that would allow him to come to \nthe United States if there is a threat to his safety in Pakistan and if \nhe wishes to come here as a reward for helping us get bin Laden.\n  This vote will happen either in early September or late August, \ndepending on what happens with his appeal. I hope some common sense \nwill intervene and they will let him go. But at the very least, \nAmericans need to know that Pakistan needs to cooperate with us, \nPakistan needs to help this man, and that we all should be proud of \nwhat he did to help us get bin Laden. I will do everything possible, \neverything I have within my limits, to get this vote to occur, and this \nwill happen within the next month when his trial comes forward on \nAugust 30.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5279-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the tax issues the \nSenate is facing this week. There is clearly a tremendous need for \ncomprehensive tax reform. Americans worked from January 1 to April 17 \nthis year, 107 days, to earn enough money to pay their share of \nFederal, State, and local taxes. Americans also spent nearly 8 billion \nhours preparing their tax returns this spring. This amounts to 1 \nmillion people working full time for an entire year. There is no reason \nthat paying taxes should be so confusing and so complicated, so time-\nconsuming.\n  The burden this process places on individuals and small businesses \nmust be relieved. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the \naverage American taxpayer will spend more on taxes in 2012 then they \nspend on food, clothing, and housing combined.\n  It is time for tax freedom. We need to replace our deeply flawed tax \nsystem with a commonsense system that is simpler and more growth \noriented. The Tax Code matters when it comes to growing the economy. It \nis for these reasons that I am a sponsor of S. 13 and a long time \nsupporter of the Fair Tax, which I see as a step in the direction of \nliberty and prosperity. The Fair Tax eliminates payroll, estate, and \nmany other taxes, to be replaced with a national sales tax levied on \npurchased goods, placing all Americans on equal footing. The Fair Tax \nallows our businesses to thrive while generating tax revenues to be \nsimilar to our current 3-million-word-long Tax Code.\n  The process of tax reform has major consequences for every citizen of \nour country. But it is a process that must be started because the \nconsequences of inaction are too costly. The truth remains that \nAmericans want and need some sort of tax-filing relief. The need for \ncommonsense reform becomes more obvious each and every tax season.\n  Over the course of the last several years, American taxpayers have \nbecome much more attentive to what is and is not happening in the \nNation's Capital, and they have made their choices clearly heard. They \nhave a message Congress should be willing to listen to, and that \nmessage is: Simplify the Tax Code.\n  In doing so, we will create an opportunity for economic growth and \nnew prosperity while increasing personal freedom and liberty. By \nreforming this broken process, the Tax Code we have today, Americans \nwill once again be more in charge of their lives and their money.\n  This coming January, as we know, our Nation faces a fiscal cliff. On \ntop of the tax increases included in President Obama's health care law, \nif the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire, a tax increase of $494 \nbillion will strike the economy. For Kansans, that is an average tax \nincrease of $3,000 per tax return, money they should be using to put \nfood on their family's table, save for their children's education, and \nprepare for their own retirement. It is estimated that 70 percent of \nthe looming tax increases will fall directly on low- and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  This week, Congress will consider a tax proposal from the majority \nleader that increases taxes, unfortunately, the exact opposite of what \nour economy needs. S. 3412 that we are debating\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\nthis week raises the death tax on family farms, small businesses and \nranches and estates to a level over a decade old, when they were \nbrought down in a bipartisan basis.\n  This proposal would increase the death tax from its current rate of \n35 percent to 55 percent. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee \non Taxation, the number of estates hit by this tax will rise from 3,600 \nto nearly 47,000.\n  Nothing hinders the transfer of a family farm to the next generation \nmore than the estate tax. It is an unfair, unjust burden on our \neconomy, and it punishes Kansans who want to continue their family \nbusiness. I have long sought a permanent repeal of the estate tax and \nhave pursued opportunities to increase the size of the estate tax \nexemption and lower the rates. Now we have a proposal to increase the \nburden of this tax. That will only create less certainty for farmers \nand small business owners as they plan for their future.\n  Under this massive tax increase, 20 times more family farming estates \nwill be hit by the death tax and 9 times more small businesses. This \ntax increase comes on top of significant small business tax increases \nalready in the legislation. According to Ernst & Young, these tax \nincreases on the top two marginal rates would shrink the economy by 1.3 \npercent and reduce by over 700,000--reduce by over 700,000--jobs from \nthe American workforce.\n  This tax increase legislation will only add more uncertainty to our \nNation's convoluted, ever-changing tax system. Common sense tells us it \ndoes not have to be Republicans and Democrats, common sense tells us a \nsimplified Tax Code will help boost the economy.\n  The revenues we need to balance our books are not increases in taxes; \nin fact, the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the \nworld. Revenues we need to balance our books will come from a strong \nand growing economy, where more Americans are working and therefore \npaying taxes.\n  Government must get out of the way and reduce the drag on the private \nsector so entrepreneurs and small business owners can put Americans \nback to work. Americans know that when our economy is strong, when our \ntax laws are fair, simple, and certain, they can provide for their \nfamilies. We will have the opportunity to see once again our children \nand grandchildren pursuing the American dream.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is a terrible time in our country. \nThe entire country is in mourning for the 12 innocent people who were \ngunned down in Aurora, CO, last week. Our thoughts and our prayers are \nwith dozens more still recovering from their wounds. We are mourning \nwith people we never knew, with unfamiliar names, but we have seen \npictures of grief-stricken parents, friends, neighbors, and our hearts \nbreak with them. We wish we could reach across the country and offer \nthem some comfort while we mourn.\n  We know our mourning alone will not be enough to prevent a future \ntragedy unless we do something. We in Congress have an obligation to \nturn grief into action, as we have often done when faced with tragedy. \nSo I come to the floor today to ask a question: When will we wake up? \nHow many of our sons and daughters have to die before we go to work? It \nis time to sound the alarm on gun violence in our country. It is time \nfor us to gather to talk about commonsense solutions. And I am talking \nabout all of us--all 100. It should not matter which side of the aisle \nwe are on. All of us who serve here have someone we love, someone we \nknow, someone with whom we are in contact, whether it is our child, our \nsister, our brother, our father, or our mother. The lives of our loved \nones depend on us and we should not let them down.\n  Right now, our Nation's lax gun laws make it far too easy for \nmurderers to commit incomprehensible acts of violence and terror. Very \nearly last Friday morning, we witnessed a massacre, and it has become \nsomething we have seen far too often. A tragedy with even less deaths, \nwith less wounded, with less hurt is a tragedy of enormous proportion \nwhen something like this happens in this great country of ours. There \nis so much to live for, so much to enjoy, but here innocent people \ndied.\n  This guy arrived at a movie theater in Aurora, CO, and he had an \nassault rifle with a 100-round magazine, a shotgun, and two handguns. \nHe unleashed a barrage of bullets murdering 12 innocent people and \ninjuring 58 more in a matter of minutes. In the theater at the time \nthere was a total population of 200 people, and 70 of them were wounded \nor killed in a matter of minutes. Even though the police responded \nrapidly--within 90 seconds--with his high-capacity magazine, the gunman \nhad more than enough time to carry out his reign of terror.\n  Among those who lost their lives were parents, mothers, fathers, \nservicemen, a veteran, a recent high school graduate, a college \nstudent, and a 6-year-old-girl named Veronica Moser Sullivan. She was \nthe youngest to be murdered in Colorado that night and someone whose \ntragic death reminds us all too well of the time 9-year-old Christina \nTaylor Green was murdered in Tucson last year because she wanted to \nknow more about her government. She was part of a group who greeted \nRepresentative Giffords.\n  The victims of these horrible tragedies deserve more than words of \nsolidarity and mourning. They deserve our attention, our action. What \nwe do to prevent these tragedies in the future will be the real test of \ncharacter of this body. The best way to prove we are concerned is to \ntake the action necessary to protect young lives because on that score \nnow we lose.\n  I have been in the Senate a long time, and I have seen too many \nAmericans murdered by guns, too many lives cut short because of the \neasy availability of guns, and too many times Congress has sat back, \ncowered before the gun lobby and done nothing to prevent these \ntragedies from happening in the future. We can't wait any longer, Mr. \nPresident, without the public at large challenging our effectiveness, \nwanting to know what it is we are doing to protect the next group of \nchildren and parents and loved ones.\n  The murderers in Colorado and Arizona both had something that enabled \nthem to bring about the mayhem they did. They had a mega-magazine \ncapable of shooting dozens of rounds without having to reload. They \nbought them legally. Here we see a picture of what this man had--a \nsemiautomatic rifle and a 100-round drum magazine.\n  These magazines were originally designed for law enforcement and \nmilitary people. These magazines were banned from 1994 to 2004, a \nperiod of 10 years, but under pressure from the gun lobby, Congress let \nthat ban expire in 2004. It wasn't an accident. It didn't happen \nwithout complicity.\n  Just think about it. The Colorado shooter carried a 100-round \nmagazine, and if he hadn't had that magazine, maybe the shooting toll \nwould have been substantially lower. Maybe more lives would have been \nsaved. Maybe more loved ones--husbands, wives, and children--would be \nalive today. Maybe there would be fewer people suffering from bullet \nwounds.\n  In the Arizona shooting, the shooter was only subdued when he paused \nto change his 30-round magazine, and if he had to stop sooner, \nobviously precious lives could have been saved.\n  These magazines are the tools of mass murderers. No matter what the \ngun lobby would have you believe, nobody needs a mega-magazine to go \nduck hunting. These high-capacity magazines put all of our families in \ndanger, and they endanger our law enforcement officers as well. We send \nthem into the line of fire to defend us against mass murderers such as \nthe Colorado shooter, who legally bought 6,000 bullets and a gun \nmagazine that holds 100 bullets over the Internet. The safety of our \nfamilies is too important to let this continue. There are too many \nbullets, too many deaths, and too many funerals. But not enough people \nare saying: Stop it. Do your job. Protect my family. Protect my kids. \nProtect my parents.\n  Here are the facts. Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in \nrecent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. More\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\nhave been murdered on the grounds of the United States than have died \nin far-off battlefields. It is shocking. More than 6,500 American \nsoldiers have died in the service of our country in support of the wars \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. During the same period, guns here were used to \nmurder about 100,000 people.\n  Americans deserve a Congress that makes the safety of our families a \npriority. That is why I urge my colleagues today to help our people. \nBring back the ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines such as the \none used in Colorado on Friday and the one used in Arizona last year. \nThat was the law from 1994 to 2004. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. \nEven former Vice President Dick Cheney has suggested that it may be \nappropriate to reinstate this ban. It is time to work together, all of \nus, to ban high-capacity magazines. Don't do it for me. Do it for your \nfamily. Do it for your constituents. Stand and say: I don't want your \nfamily hurt. I don't want your children to fall prey to a gunman.\n  It is time to begin a national conversation once more about taking \ncommonsense measures to prevent gun violence in America. And to those \nwho are fearful about the power of the NRA, understand that we bested \nthem before and we will do it again. We beat them in 1996 when an \neffort that I began to ban the sale of guns to domestic abusers passed, \nwe have stopped over 200,000 of those people from getting gun permits \nsince that time, and a lot of lives could have been saved in there. We \nstood up to them again in 1999 when the Senate came together after \nColumbine and passed legislation to close the gun show loophole. \nUnfortunately, after passing in the Senate, the House refused to do \nanything about it. If we show resolve and if we stand with courage, I \nknow we can do the right thing once more. There are no more excuses for \ninaction.\n  I say to my colleagues, look at your children. Look at the pictures \nthat may be on your mantelpiece. Think about the happy days with your \nkids, think about the enjoyment you share together, and think about \nwhat we want to do to be able to continue those lives we enjoy so much. \nThe stakes are just too high. We have to intervene while the memory, \nunfortunately, is still fresh.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am still trying to wrap my head around \nPresident Obama's recent remarks that small business job creators \nsomehow owe their success to the Federal Government. His comment wasn't \njust wrong, it was actually kind of embarrassing. It showed that the \nPresident does not understand the enormous challenges and financial \nrisks entrepreneurs and job creators deal with every day. It also \naffirmed that the President is going to continue pushing the same \nmisguided big-government economic policies that have helped keep our \nunemployment rate well above 8 percent for some 41 consecutive months.\n  I wish to highlight a few of the success stories from my home State \nof Texas that epitomize what the American dream is all about and to \nreassure my listeners that the American dream is still alive and well \nand thriving in the great State of Texas. But first I would like to \nmake a brief point about tax policy because as mundane and boring as \ntax policy may seem to a lot of people, it actually has a very real \nimpact on the people I am talking about.\n  There is now an emerging bipartisan consensus that tax reform should \ninvolve lowering rates and broadening the base so that our tax system \nbecomes simpler, fairer, and more conducive to strong economic growth. \nDon't just take my word for it. Look at the President's own bipartisan \nfiscal commission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which reached that \nsame conclusion.\n  Unfortunately, the President's own fiscal commission's report is \ninconsistent with the President's current demand that we have to raise \ntaxes. That would mean a large tax increase for many people who are the \npeople we are depending upon to create those jobs. The reason is that \nmany small businesses pay their business income on individual tax \nreturns. They are not major Forbes 500, multinational corporations; \nthey are the mom-and-pop operations that are sole proprietorships, they \nare partnerships, and they are even sometimes subchapter S \ncorporations. That is just a reference to the Tax Code that means you \ndon't pay corporate taxes, you pay flowthrough business income on your \nindividual tax return. So many people who are small businesses who may \nreach that threshold of $250,000 or above are businesspeople paying on \nan individual tax return. If this is an effort to soak the rich, well, \nthe middle class and small businesses are part of the collateral \ndamage.\n  I would like to remind the President that Americans will spend about \n$350 billion this year alone just to comply with the Tax Code. That \nmeans hiring accountants and that means hiring lawyers just to try to \nfigure out what they owe to the Federal Government. Small business \nowners face a particularly heavy burden because they can't afford the \narmy of lawyers and accountants to help them figure out what their tax \nobligations are. Yet these are the folks we are depending upon to get \nAmerica back to work and to get our economy growing again. But we \neffectively have a tax system that punishes them for their success. We \ncan and we should do better.\n  When it comes to dealing with the IRS, small businesses don't enjoy \nthe same resources that large multinational corporations do. According \nto the World Bank, it is now more difficult to pay business taxes in \nthe United States than in many Western European countries. When heavily \ntaxed, heavily bureaucratic countries such as France make it easier to \ncomply with their tax code than America does, we know we have a \nproblem.\n  If the President doesn't believe me, perhaps he should spend some \ntime chatting with some of my constituents, people such as Steve Mayo, \nthe owner of Mayo Furniture in Texarkana, TX. Steve's company is a \nfamily business that was established about a half century ago. It now \nemploys 130 full-time workers and sells furniture in 25 different \nStates. When I visited with Steve and his employees last year, they \nwere worried about how in the world they were going to comply with the \nfinancial burdens of the new health care law, along with other taxes \nand regulations. They told me it would affect their business and their \nability to create jobs and stay competitive. These are the same \nconcerns I have heard about from countless constituents and small \nbusiness owners all across my State.\n  We are one of the lucky States. About half the jobs in America have \nbeen created in my State in the last 5 years or so. We are fortunate \nbecause when it comes to small businesses we are depending upon to \ncreate jobs, we asked this very simple question: How can we make it \neasier for them to create jobs? How can we make it easier for them to \nstart a business? Unfortunately, the message emanating from Washington \nseems to be--in so many words--how can we make it harder? How can we \nincrease the unpredictability of their investment?\n  After talking to Steve Mayo, maybe President Obama would like to talk \nto Diane LaBleu. Diane is a breast cancer survivor in Austin, TX. Diane \nwas creative enough to invent a clothing accessory to help women \nrecovering from a mastectomy. The accessory is known as a Pink Pocket, \nand it is now being used by women around the world from Austin to \nAustralia.\n  The story of Pink Pockets demonstrates the power of a great idea. \nDiane identified a problem facing breast cancer survivors. She came up \nwith a brilliant solution, something nobody else had thought of before. \nThe remarkable success of her invention is a testament to her \ncreativity and her hard work.\n  The government was not responsible for the success of Pink Pockets or \nMayo Furniture. Far from it. Many times all these small businesses want \nis for government to get out of their way, off their back, and out of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\npocket so they can do what they do best.\n  The government was also not responsible for the success of STS \nCoatings, a construction company based in the San Antonio area. The \nfounder of STS Coatings, Cayce Kovacs, reports that she and her husband \ncashed in their savings to launch their business, which now has annual \nsales totaling more than $3 million. As Ms. Kovacs recently said:\n\n       We were the ones sweating bullets over processing orders \n     and paying our bills, making payroll--not the government. The \n     government did nothing to help my business.\n\n  You know who else can say that? Another extraordinary Texan named \nFrank Scantlin, who founded Sunbelt Machine Works in Stafford, TX, near \nHouston, some 34 years ago. Frank tells a story that as a child he was \nso poor he sometimes couldn't even afford to buy shoes, and he had to \nquit school in the ninth grade in order to support his family. This is \na quintessential American success story. Frank persevered and went on \nto create a business that now has almost 60,000 square feet of \nworkspace and employs 90 people.\n  All these stories epitomize the American dream that has enticed \nimmigrants from around the world to take a risk, leave everything they \nhad behind, and come and make America their home. We were the one place \nin the world where they knew if they were willing to work hard and \nsave, that hard work could be rewarded by success.\n  In the meantime, those of us who depend on those small businesses to \ncreate those jobs and prosperity could benefit as well. The owners of \nSunbelt, STS Coatings, Pink Pockets, and Mayo Furniture understand \ntheir success was not inevitable, and it sure was not guaranteed by the \nFederal Government. They had to take the hard risks, they had to work \novertime, and they had to overcome challenges that many times the \ngovernment put in their way. In the end, as in so many great American \nsuccess stories, their hard work and ingenuity paid off. They can, not \ngovernment, declare with confidence that ``I built this.''\n  My office has received more than 250 of these stories since President \nObama gave his speech in Roanoke. They are the type of stories that \nhave made our country the beacon of prosperity and entrepreneurial \nenergy for so many years. As one Texas business owner put it: ``Rugged \nindividualism is alive and well in the United States.'' I hope we \nremember that, and I hope the President of the United States remembers \nthat as well.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Even \nour generals say the greatest threat this Nation faces is not a foreign \npower or a terrorist organization but the debt we have created \nourselves.\n  We are staring down the barrel of insurmountable obligations for \ndecades to come, and we are passing up a key opportunity to put this \ncountry in better shape for the next generation.\n  As you can see, and as West Virginians know, we urgently need to put \nour country's financial house back in order, and the people of West \nVirginia are tired of temporary solutions to our long-term problems.\n  As I have said so many times, I will work with both sides of the \naisle, Democrats and Republicans, on a comprehensive solution that \nlowers tax rates, broadens our revenue base, closes loopholes, cuts \nspending, and reduces our debt, like the framework proposed by the \nBowles-Simpson plan.\n  Unfortunately, neither of the proposals on the Bush tax cuts will \nsolve our long-term debt and fiscal problems. At the same time, with \nour debt problems getting worse every year, we must come together to \ntake responsible action and fair steps toward reducing our debt, even \nif they are only temporary.\n  Let's look at the two proposals that have been offered, one from my \nRepublican colleagues in the House that, unfortunately, kicks the can \ndown the road entirely and extends these tax cuts at a cost of $400 \nbillion. What people do not know is that even though it would extend \ntax cuts for the wealthiest--and this is what they do not know--it \nwould actually get rid of some tax reductions for middle- and low-\nincome Americans, such as the expanded child tax credit. That is \ntremendously unfair.\n  Another proposal from the Democrats here in the Senate, our side, \nwould cost about $250 billion, which is at least starting to move in \nthe right direction to reduce our deficit, and it keeps the tax cut for \nmore than 99 percent of all West Virginians and a high percentage in \nevery State such as the Presiding Officer's.\n  When considering these two proposals, I kept two priorities in mind--\nputting our fiscal house back in order and restoring fairness to the \nTax Code. So while I would prefer a bipartisan comprehensive solution, \nI will support the plan to keep taxes low on families that make less \nthan $250,000. According to the latest available figures from the West \nVirginia Department of Revenue, more than 99 percent of all West \nVirginians will get a break on their taxes under this proposal. And the \nwealthiest among us will pay the rates they did during Bill Clinton's \nPresidency, which was the greatest era of prosperity I can remember in \nmy lifetime.\n  On the other hand, the proposal that includes extending the tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans carries a heavy price for this Nation. It \nis about $150 billion more than the Democrats' proposal. Given our dire \nbudget situation, this country cannot afford that. We simply have to \nprioritize and close the gap. The fact is we cannot keep trying \ntemporary solutions to our serious budget problems. And the truth is,\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\nthese tax cuts will not restore confidence in our government or our \neconomy to create good jobs or keep the ones we have. They certainly do \nnot put our fiscal house back in order. What they will do is be used as \nfodder in political ads in the next 100 days against both sides. I \ncannot understand why we continue to take votes that are more about \nmaking one side look bad or worse than the other, or taking cheap \nshots, than actually solving the problems we have before us.\n  I will continue to work across the aisle on a comprehensive \nbipartisan plan, because when it comes right down to it these tax cuts \nsimply will not fix the financial problems our country faces. I have \ntalked to countless business leaders and laborers all over the State of \nWest Virginia and all over the country. When I asked them what will \nencourage them not only to create the good jobs we need but to keep the \njobs we already have, the answer is simple: Certainty. They need to be \nable to plan their next steps. They need to know their government is \nworking as a partner, an ally, not as an adversary.\n  We did not pull these stunts in West Virginia when I was Governor. We \nwere willing to get our hands dirty, to come to the table, to have a \ngenuine and respectful discussion on the right direction for our State, \nand sometimes that led to respectful agreement to disagree. But in the \nleast, we moved forward and made a decision. It has been nearly 2 years \nsince the bipartisan commission on reducing our debt recommended a plan \nthat people of all political stripes support. It is time to go back to \nthat framework and provide this country with an honest solution.\n  In fact, the only thing that seems to be holding our feet to the fire \nright now is the sequester, which is becoming quite the scary term \naround here. For people who do not live and work in the Beltway, here \nis what the sequester is: If those of us in Congress cannot agree on a \nreal, substantial plan to fix our finances, we will have to make some \nvery painful cuts in some very important areas--our Department of \nDefense, our schools, and our domestic priorities such as veterans \nservices and Head Start. Both Democrats and Republicans care about \nthose issues.\n  So both Democrats and Republicans have some skin in the game when it \ncomes to finding an agreement, because, let me tell you, the reason the \nsequester was put in place almost a year ago was in case we could not \ncome up with an agreement on a big fix, one the so-called \nsupercommittee was tasked to put forward. Well, they did not agree on \nthe superfix and this is our penalty. I believe the greatest mistake we \ncould make would be to walk away before the end of the year and not \nvote on a clear direction to fulfill the commitment and promises we \nmade to the American people, which were that we would fix the country's \nfinancial problems or the sequester would go into effect. That is the \nbiggest mistake we can make as a Nation, letting the American people \ndown.\n  So now a year after Congress has failed to reach an agreement, I am \nsurprised to find some of my colleagues who voted for the sequester, \nknowing full well that Congress needs the threat of painful cuts before \nwe can get anything done, are complaining about something they \nsupported. I stand with those, including the President, who are drawing \na hard line in the sand on our finances.\n  Like it or not, this painful sequester is the linchpin to a better \ngovernment and a better agreement. It is the only way we are going to \nget something bigger. A better agreement will look a lot like the \nbipartisan comprehensive Bowles-Simpson framework, not the Bush tax \ncuts, because this country needs a real solution, because this country \nneeds to come together on that solution, because if we cannot come \ntogether, there will be dire consequences for this country with or \nwithout the cuts in the sequester.\n  I sincerely hope and pray and will work for a compromise. But I \nbelieve the threat of a sequester might be the only thing that will \nforce Congress to get its job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n            Tribute to Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks with respect to \nthe current debate, let me pay tribute to Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and \nDetective John M. Gibson of the Capitol Police, and to all of the \nCapitol Police officers, men and women who protect us each day.\n  I was here on that somber day when these gentlemen sacrificed their \nlives to protect innocent people in this building. Their example \ncontinues to sustain us and inspire us. They continue to sustain and \ninspire the Capitol Police officers who today are protecting us. We \nthank them all.\n  As my colleague from West Virginia commented, we are in the midst of \na very serious debate with huge consequences for our country, our \neconomy, our future. That is why I rise today in support of the Middle \nClass Tax Cut Act. This bill will extend the 2001, 2003, and 2009 tax \ncuts for the middle class through 2013. It will provide tax relief to \nevery American, especially to those families who have struggled through \nthis recession and this weak recovery, and restore some fairness to the \nTax Code by letting the top marginal tax rates return to the Clinton-\nera levels.\n  If we do not extend these tax cuts for the middle class, the typical \nRhode Island family of four could see their taxes raised by an average \nof $2,200 in 2013. This is not fair to middle-income Rhode Islanders, \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  Unfortunately, I fear many, if not all, of my Republican colleagues \nwill block this bill because it does not extend additional tax cuts for \ntaxpayers who make over a quarter of a million dollars. Instead, they \nwill continue to press for a proposal that doubles down on the failed \neconomic policies of the Bush era for a plan that gives more tax cuts \nto the wealthy, while eliminating middle-class tax breaks for families \nwith children. Indeed, one of the astounding things about the \nRepublican proposal is it will, if you look closely, actually increase \nthe tax burden on middle-income Americans.\n  In contrast, the bill Democrats propose will benefit every single \ntaxpayer in America. It is only when someone exceeds a quarter of a \nmillion dollars in income that their income in excess of the quarter of \na million dollar threshold will be subject to the top two Clinton-era \nrates.\n  The Democratic plan will extend tax cuts for the vast majority of \nAmericans. Only the top 2 percent of earners, approximately 2.1 million \nout of more than 100 million households, households that have \ndisproportionately benefited from the Bush tax cuts for more than a \ndecade, will see their top rates revert to Clinton era levels. They \nwill get to maintain their benefits up to $250,000, but after that, \nthey will see an increase. This is the nature of our progressive tax \nsystem, one which for generations has spread the burden across income \nlevels, making sure that middle-income Americans do not shoulder a \ndisproportionate burden of the taxes that support this government.\n  One of the key facts we have observed, now for more than a decade, is \nthat these Bush tax cuts have been very costly. They have been a \nprimary driver of this deficit, in addition to unpaid conflicts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and a prescription drug program that was not paid \nfor.\n  At least with this proposal, we are beginning to try to reverse that \ntrend in a principled way. The wealthiest, those who enjoy the greatest \neconomic privilege in the country should shoulder some of the \nresponsibility, and should shoulder some of the effort in order to help \nus begin to repair the deficit, which has grown as a result of these \nmassively costly and ineffective tax breaks the wealthiest have enjoyed \nsince 2001.\n  The Democratic bill will cost the Federal Government $249 billion in \nlost revenue for a 1-year extension. The Republican bill will cost $405 \nbillion. So, again, if you are talking about trying to get a handle on \nthe deficit, compare a bill for $249 billion, which is expensive but \nsignificantly less than $405 billion Republican plan that would do \nvirtually nothing to restore fairness to our tax code or create jobs. I \ndo not think our Nation can afford this $405 billion Republican \nalternative. There has been a promise or a mantra that has been offered \nover the last decade that these Republican tax cuts create jobs, and \nthat they would contribute to our prosperity. But what we have seen,\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nparticularly over the 8 years of the Bush administration, is that these \ntax cuts for the wealthy did not create jobs. I believe the evidence we \nhave shows that there is very little correlation between these tax cuts \nfor the wealthy and job creation or economic prosperity.\n  Additionally, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans constrain our \nability to pursue policies that will boost growth in the near-term.\n  Indeed, if we do not have the resources to invest in the country, in \nour infrastructure, in our education, in the health of our people, we \nwill not have the economic dynamism needed to be competitive and give \nour children the future they deserve. Frankly, like the future our \nparents gave to us. A future that previous generations were able to \nprovide for because of Federal tax policies which were fairer, which \nwere more progressive, and which allowed for significant investment and \njob growth.\n  In my State, with a 10.9-percent unemployment rate and a national \nunemployment rate above 8 percent, it is imperative that we embrace \nfiscal policy that creates jobs in the short-term but also recognizes \nthe need for long-term deficit reduction.\n  Democrats have offered plan after plan that would preserve and create \njobs in a fair and fiscally responsible manner. We press for policies \nthat will provide more of an economic bang for the buck, policies such \nas the continuation of unemployment benefits and policies that provide \nrelief to middle-class households. What we have to do is go forward, \nsupport this effort, begin the hard and difficult task of not only \ncontinuing to support middle-income families but begin to address the \nissue of long-term deficit reduction.\n  I hope my colleagues do not block this effort. I hope my colleagues \ndo not once again decide that doing nothing is a viable alternative to \nhelping middle-income Americans and helping our economy overall. \nUnfortunately, they have done that in the past. Earlier this month, the \nRepublicans blocked a bill that cut taxes for small businesses that \nhired new workers. The bill was estimated to create 1 million jobs \nnationally and could have created about 3,500 jobs in my State, but \nRepublicans filibustered.\n  Just last week, the Republicans blocked a bill that would have given \ntax cuts to businesses that brought jobs to the United States and \nclosed tax loopholes for companies that send jobs overseas. Republicans \nblocked that also. I believe the record is clear. Democrats have been \ntrying week in and week out to create jobs here at home, to make our \ntax system fairer, to give middle-income families a break, and to do so \nin a fiscally responsible manner. The vote on the Middle Class Tax Cut \nAct will be upon us shortly. I hope it will be a vote on which we \nprevail and go forward together and provide tax relief to middle-class \nAmericans. I think it will be a first step toward the larger issues \nthat were alluded to by my colleague from West Virginia dealing with \nthe potential of sequestration at the end of this year, advancing \npolicies that will grow our economy while beginning to restrain our \ndeficit and provide a more stable, more sustainable economic \nenvironment for all Americans.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it has been more than 30 years since I \nwas in medical school, but I still remember the day my classmates and I \nstood to recite the Hippocratic Oath. That is an oath which has guided \ndoctors for centuries. At its simplest, it can be boiled down to a \nsingle phrase: First, do no harm.\n  I was reminded of that last week when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke testified before the Senate Banking Committee, speaking about \nthe approach Washington should take toward healing our sick economy. He \nsaid: Do no harm. Well, that is good advice for Senators and for \nPresidents, just as it is good advice for doctors. The problem is that \nwe have a President in the White House and Democrats in Congress who \ndon't believe it and don't act that way.\n  Day after day, as the President makes one policy decision after \nanother, his policies do harm to the American economy and to the \nAmerican people. Just look at how sick our economy has gotten since \nPresident Obama took office. The Federal Reserve projects that the \ngross domestic product will grow by as little as 1.6 percent this year. \nThat is not nearly good enough to give us the healthy economy we need.\n  The other night, ``CBS Evening News'' opened with this summary: \n``This is the worst economic recovery America has ever had.'' That is \nwhat they said--the worst.\n  Every other President has been able to bounce back from tough \neconomic times. Not President Obama. Why is that? Why is our private \nsector economy sicker today than it was when the President took his \noath of office? The Economist magazine put it this way. It gave a \ncharacterization of the President as someone ``who has regulated to \ndeath a private sector he neither likes nor understands.'' And I agree. \nLook at the President's own words. He said that while government \nbureaucrats were struggling, the private sector is doing just fine. \nDoing just fine? It has gotten worse. Because of President Obama's \nfailed economic policies, more than 23 million Americans are now either \nunemployed or underemployed. I think those 23 million people would say \nto President Obama: Do no harm. We have now had 41 straight months of \nunemployment above 8 percent. Our economy created just 80,000 jobs last \nmonth--just 80,000 jobs. More people last month signed up for Social \nSecurity disability benefits than got a job. That is not doing just \nfine.\n  Look at what else the President said recently about small business \nowners. He said:\n\n       If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody \n     else made that happen.\n\n  I know a lot of small business owners who would say they worked \nextremely hard to build their own businesses. Farmers and ranchers work \nfrom sunup to past sundown, and everyone in the family works to keep \nthe operation going. The corner drycleaner is trying to keep his doors \nopen in tough economic times. The florist is trying to avoid laying off \nanother salesperson in the shop.\n  Where I live, in Casper, WY, most of the businesses we have are small \nbusinesses. They were started by men and women with dreams and with \ndetermination. These people aren't looking for a government handout, \nbut they don't think their government should be hostile toward them. \nThey work hard every day. They have worked hard to build their \nbusinesses and have tried to expand and create jobs in the community. \nPresident Obama doesn't seem to grasp that. That is why, instead of \ndoing all he can to help small businesses, he is burying them under \nmore regulations, under more redtape, and under threats of increased \ntaxes.\n  Democrats here in Washington like to say they are in favor of \ncreating jobs, but then they turn around and do the very things that \nhurt the people who create the jobs in this country. Washington has \nalready put out more than 36,000 pages of new regulations just since \nJanuary of this year. If small business owners could talk to the \nPresident, I think they would tell him they do not need more paperwork. \nThey would tell him: Mr. President, do no harm.\n  The damage President Obama's policies have done to our economy so far \nis terrible, and it is likely to get worse. We know the President's \npolicies are holding back our economy from the type of normal recovery \nwe have had from other recessions in the past. Even worse, he is paying \nfor his failed policies by piling an unprecedented amount of debt on \nfuture generations. Today, our national debt is $16 trillion. In just \n3\\1/2\\ years, President Obama has managed to waste more taxpayer money \nthan any other President, in my opinion, in American history.\n  Previous Presidents understood the danger of spending more than we \ncan afford. President John Kennedy said: Persistently large deficits \nwould endanger our economic growth and our military and defense \ncommitments abroad. President Kennedy made that statement 50 years \nago--in 1962. At the time he made that statement 50 years ago, \nWashington's budget deficit that year was $7 billion. So we have gone \nfrom $7 billion 50 years ago to a projected deficit of $1,200 billion \nthis year--from $7 billion to $1,200 billion.\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nThat is 170 times greater. Has anything else increased that fast in the \npast 50 years in terms of expenses on anything--a daily newspaper or a \nbottle of Coke, which would have cost 10 cents in 1962? Using this \nmultiplier of 170 times, that would be $17 today if it had increased at \nthe same rate as our Nation's deficit. And gasoline was about 30 cents \na gallon back then. It would have to be more than $50 a gallon today.\n  Look at it a different way. The share of Washington's total debt that \nis owed by every man woman and child in America today is almost \n$51,000. The President is saddling our children with debt to pay bills \nwe can't afford for policies that don't work and for goals the American \npeople don't support.\n  The President demonstrates no sincere interest in cutting government \nspending, even as the Federal Government has grown less efficient, less \neffective, and less accountable. The American people look at \nWashington's out- of-control spending and debt, and their message to \nPresident Obama is this: Please, Mr. President, stop doing harm.\n  Remember, President Obama has been quite clear. He doesn't respect \nsmall businesses, and he thinks the private sector is doing fine. He \nhas increased redtape, increased bureaucracy, and he has mortgaged \nAmerica's future to give taxpayer dollars to his campaign \ncontributors--to companies such as Solyndra.\n  When he has borrowed all he can--lots of it from China--he still \ndoesn't slow down his spending. He says he needs to raise taxes to \nspend even more. The President already raised taxes through his health \ncare plan. He pushed through $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes and fees. He \npushed his individual mandate tax to force people to buy insurance. Now \nhe is pushing again to impose massive new tax hikes on millions of \nsuccessful families and small businesses.\n  The additional damage President Obama would do to our economy with \nhis proposals to raise additional taxes would be enormous.\n  Now, that is not only my opinion; others agree. The accounting firm \nof Ernst & Young did a study of the President's plan and found it would \nwipe out 710,000 jobs. Middle-class workers who keep their jobs would \nsee their wages go down. And 2.1 million business owners would be hit \nwith higher taxes. That means less money left to expand and less money \nleft to hire additional workers. Again, you can't be for jobs and \nagainst the people who create the jobs.\n  In short, as weak as our economic recovery has been these past 3 \nyears--the worst ever, as reported in the news--the President's tax \nincreases would make matters worse. Just look again at the difference \nbetween President Obama and a different Democratic President--John \nKennedy. John Kennedy said:\n\n       The largest single barrier to full employment of our \n     manpower and resources, and to a higher rate of economic \n     growth, is the unrealistically heavy drag of Federal income \n     taxes on private purchasing power, initiative, and incentive.\n\n  This lesson from President Kennedy is lost on President Obama. The \nonly solution President Obama seems to see is to raise taxes and to \nraise them most on the very people and businesses we need to lead us to \nprosperity and economic recovery. Remember the words President Obama \nused when he was running for President in 2008. He said that even if \nhis tax increases led to less revenue for the government--that is what \nhe said, even if his tax increases led to less revenue for the \ngovernment--he would raise taxes anyway as a matter of fairness. \nFairness? Fairness? What about doing what is best for the country? As \nan orthopedic surgeon, when someone came to me with a broken leg, I \nwould try to fix it. You don't break someone else's leg so the two \npeople would then be equal and both would have broken legs. The \nPresident is promoting his vision of fairness over good common sense.\n  The American people know those who work hard and take risks should be \nfree to enjoy the fruits of their labor. They should not have to suffer \nmore angry attacks by the President and by Democrats in Washington. The \nAmerican way should be to promote success, not to punish it.\n  President Obama should abandon his misguided agenda to replace the \nlong-held American value of equal opportunity with the President's own \ndesire for equal outcomes regardless of effort. Before he makes things \neven worse, he should stop and he should do no harm.\n  Finally, I would like to address one last issue where I think the \nDemocrats in Congress and the White House need to reverse course. Our \ncountry faces what has been called a fiscal cliff. Unless Washington \nacts in January, taxes will increase across the board--not just on \nsmall businesses but on middle-class families and even low-income \npeople. Republicans in the House have already voted to approve long-\nterm spending cuts. This month they will vote to stop the tax \nincreases. And Republicans have a plan to create a healthier economy by \nmaking our Tax Code simpler, flatter, and fairer for all Americans. \nWhat happens next is in the hands of the Democrats in the Senate.\n  Financial experts have warned that if Senate Democrats do not act by \nthe end of this year, they could create a worldwide recession. This is \nvery serious harm. Democrats appear to be ready to do it. The Senate \nDemocratic leadership has made clear that they would let the country go \nover the fiscal cliff rather than compromise on tax hikes. President \nObama recently said the same thing. He said that if Congress passes \nreasonable regulation that keeps tax rates where they are--even \ntemporarily, he said, while we sort out long-term tax reform--he would \nveto that. He would raise everyone's taxes and risk another worldwide \nrecession. I ask the President to look at what he is saying and stop \nthreatening grave damage to America in reckless pursuit of his \npolitical agenda.\n  Mr. President, do no harm.\n  Those words that sum up the Hippocratic Oath ring true for so many \npeople across America today, for people who believe, as Ronald Reagan \nsaid, that government should stand by our side, not ride on our back.\n  It is time for Washington to change direction, to lower taxes, not \nraise them; to reduce redtape, not increase it; to control our \nspending, not rack up more debt; to free the entrepreneurial spirit, \nnot stifle it.\n  First, before all else, if we are to heal our sick economy, it is a \ntime for Washington to do no harm.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas if in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise to speak about the need to \nextend middle-class tax cuts.\n  We have a broad bipartisan consensus that middle-class families \nshould not see their taxes increase on January 1. We know that if \nCongress does nothing, then the taxes will increase for the broad \nmiddle class on that date. We have a broad bipartisan consensus that \nshould not happen.\n  So while we have this moment of agreement, we should act swiftly to \nextend tax cuts for 98 percent of American families--about 99 percent \nof the people in my State--right now, today, this week, soon. But we \nwill not because special interests and their allies in Congress are \nholding middle-class tax cuts hostage. Why? It is the same old song: In \norder to protect the interests of millionaires and billionaires. It \nseems the default button--certainly in the majority of the House of \nRepresentatives and far too many in the Senate--is, no matter what, \nprotect the interests of millionaires and protect the interests of \nbillionaires.\n  Let's be clear. Whether it is our plan where we immediately--today, \nthis week, as soon as possible--grant tax relief for people who are \nmiddle class, every American will get a tax cut on their first $250,000 \nworth of income. If someone is making $1 million a year, they still get \na tax cut on their first $250,000. If someone makes $10 million a year, \nthey still get a tax cut on their first $250,000. They are only paying\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\nroughly 4 percent on every $1 above $250,000. So we have bipartisan \nagreement. Let's lock that in so the middle class will get a tax cut.\n  There is an old cliche that the definition of insanity is doing the \nsame thing over and over, expecting different results. We have been in \nthis policy shop before, when they sold us the same flawed economic \npolicies based upon tax cuts to the wealthy trickling down to the \nmiddle class. I was in the House of Representatives in the first part \nof the last decade when President Bush came to us. We had a huge budget \nsurplus. In fact, in 2001, we had the largest budget surplus in \nAmerican history--surplus, not deficit. Look what we are dealing with \nnow.\n  So what happened? Two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a bad idea \nto go into Iraq, a contentious issue. The intelligence wasn't right \nthat Congress was given. Many of us voted against it.\n  But put that aside. Nobody paid for the war in Iraq. Then there were \nthe tax cuts that went overwhelmingly to the wealthiest people in our \nsociety. Nobody paid for those tax cuts. Then there was the Medicare \npartial privatization prescription drug bill. Nobody paid for that. So \nwe went from the biggest budget surplus in American history to the \nbiggest budget deficit. At the same time, the economic geniuses of the \ntime that were running the government didn't use the words ``trickle \ndown,'' but that is what it is. They said: If we cut taxes on the \nrichest people of our country, all that wealth will trickle down to the \nmiddle class and to working families and the poor and everybody will \nget richer and the economy will take off.\n  We had 8 years of that experiment. What happened? Between 2000 and \n2010, we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs under those economic \npolicies of giving huge tax breaks to the rich. The fundamental tenet \nand central core of that policy was huge tax cuts for the rich. What \nhappened? We lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs. It is only since \nwe have begun to bring some more fairness with the Recovery Act, with \nWall Street reform, with the auto rescue--especially important in my \nState--and other things we have done did we see the economy grow from \n2010. The unemployment rate in my State in 2009 was 10.6 percent. Now \nit is 7.3 percent. That is not good enough, but it is certainly \nprogress. There were 5 million manufacturing jobs lost between 2000 and \n2010. Since 2010, almost every single month we have gained, in the \naggregate, some 450,000 to 500,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  So this policy of cutting taxes on the wealthy was going to create \nprosperity. It didn't work that way. We went from a surplus at the end \nof the Clinton years to massive deficits at the end of the Bush years.\n  Let's be clear. We are talking about returning the tax rates for the \ntop 2 percent of the Americans to the 1993 level, the same year \nPresident Clinton balanced the budget. Opposition to our bill to extend \nthe middle-class tax cuts says that if millionaires have to pay the \nsame top marginal tax rate they did in the Clinton years, then job \ncreation will suffer. But it doesn't make sense. We want to go back to \ntax rates for the richest people in our country to what they were under \nPresident Clinton. During that 8 years, jobs increased by 22 million in \nthis country. During the Bush years, with low tax rates for the rich, \nwe lost 5 million manufacturing jobs and had absolutely anemic economic \ngrowth. One doesn't have to be an economist to make this comparison. \nLook at tax rates during the Clinton years and the Bush years.\n  I don't want to blame everything on President Bush. That doesn't get \nus anywhere. It makes people quit listening. But I do want to learn \nfrom history. Look at the tax system we had during the Clinton years \nand the tax system we had during the Bush years and make the contrast \nabout what happened: 22 million jobs created; not so good during the \nBush years, with very anemic job creation.\n  For too many people in my home State, the recession didn't mean they \nhad to delay buying a new yacht. Workers in Steubenville, in Norwood, \nand Norwalk were struggling to stay afloat. They struggled to make ends \nmeet. Too many are still struggling. That is why we have a \nresponsibility to the people in New Hampshire and the people of Ohio \nand all over to pass the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2012.\n  The median household income in Ohio is $47,358. For those families, a \n$2,000 tax cut means a whole lot. We know that 98 percent of Americans \nwho would benefit from this tax cut are going to put that money back \ninto the economy. This isn't trickle down. This is, someone gets a tax \ncut like that and maybe they can put a downpayment on a car, maybe they \ncan help pay their son or daughter's way to community college, maybe \nthey can do some remodeling in their house, maybe they can do some \nthings around the house that they need to do or take their kids to a \nmovie or go out to dinner once in a while. But that $2,000 truly means \na lot for a family with an income of $47,000. That is why this \nlegislation is so important.\n  We can't afford to stall on this important middle-class tax cut for \nthe Americans who need it most. The middle class in our society has \nbeen beat up long enough, for 10 years, where wages have been stagnant, \nwhere people are too anxious about layoffs, where people simply haven't \nhad the opportunity to do what they need to do to build this great \ncountry.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, tomorrow we will have the \nopportunity to deliver a little bit of tax certainty to the American \npeople by advancing the Middle Class Tax Cut Act. This legislation \nwould prevent tax rates from increasing for the vast majority of \nAmerican families and would preserve an important tax credit that \ncurrently helps millions of students and families afford the costs of a \nhigher education.\n  The Middle Class Tax Cut Act is the right thing to do for the middle \nclass, and I intend to vote for it. The question is, Will it be \nfilibustered--a tax cut for millions of hard-working Americans, \nfilibustered simply to protect the wealthiest Americans from paying a \nfair share? We will find out.\n  This is not a new story. In 2001, when President George W. Bush \ndecided to spend a large portion of the surpluses he inherited from \nPresident Clinton to cut tax rates across the board, many Democrats \nopposed it because the tax cuts were unfairly weighted toward the \nhighest income Americans. As a result of this opposition, Republicans \nwere forced to set the tax cuts to expire at the end of 2010.\n  As 2010 drew to a close, President Obama and many Democrats in \nCongress, including myself, supported extending the tax cuts for \nmiddle-class families but letting the lower rates on income above \n$200,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a family revert to the \nClinton-era levels as was scheduled. Senate Republicans filibustered \nthat effort, refusing to allow the middle-class tax cut without a tax \ncut for America's wealthiest. Not wanting tax rates to go up on middle-\nclass families still struggling during the recovery, the President and \nSenate Democrats reluctantly agreed to extend all the tax cuts through \nthis year, which brings us to now. Once again, these tax rates are set \nto expire.\n  I would like to keep rates low for middle-class families. Families in \nRhode Island are still struggling in the aftermath of the mortgage \nmeltdown on Wall Street, and this is not the time to raise their taxes. \nBut I agree with President Obama that for reasons of fairness and to \nbegin to address our deficit, it would be wise not to extend the Bush \ntax cuts for high levels of income.\n  Bear in mind in this discussion that the Middle Class Tax Cut Act \nwould benefit even high-end taxpayers. When we protect the rates for \nthe first $250,000 in income, it is the first $250,000 for somebody \nmaking $1 million; it is not just the first $250,000 for a family who \nmakes $100,000 or $185,000. Whether someone makes $100 million or $185 \nmillion, they still get the first $250,000 tax cut. If a family, for \ninstance, makes $255,000, they would only see an increase on the $5,000 \nand only to the Clinton-era rates that were in effect during the 1990s \nwhen our economy was thriving. A family earning $255,000 would pay an \nextra $150 as a result of this bill. Extending the lower tax rates for \nincome above $250,000 for 1 year, as the Republicans have proposed, \nwould\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\nadd over $49 billion to our deficit. Even in Washington $49 billion is \nsignificant money, money that would have to be borrowed and would add \nto our deficit problem.\n  Many of the same Republicans who voted in the name of deficit \nreduction to end Medicare as we know it--deficit reduction was so \nimportant to them that they voted on the Ryan budget to end Medicare as \nwe know it and would put thousands of dollars in costs on our seniors--\nwould support deepening the deficit with high-end tax cuts. There is a \ndouble standard here, and for most Rhode Islanders these are exactly \nthe wrong priorities when it comes to deficit reduction.\n  In addition to the deficit concerns, we should let the tax cuts at \nthe top expire just for fairness reasons. Loopholes and special \nprovisions allow many super high-income earners to pay lower tax rates \nthan many middle-class families. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, 65 percent of individuals earning $1 \nmillion or more annually pay taxes at a lower rate than median-income \ntaxpayers making $100,000 or less.\n  Let me say that again so it sinks in. Sixty-five percent, nearly two-\nthirds, of individuals earning $1 million or more a year--the vast \nmajority of individuals earning $1 million or more annually--pay taxes \nat a lower rate than median-income taxpayers making $100,000 or less. \nBecause of the loopholes, because of what the special interests have \ndone, our supposedly progressive tax system is upside down to the point \nwhere 65 percent of those earning over $1 million pay a lower tax rate \nthan the median-income taxpayer making $100,000 or less.\n  Earlier this year we voted on my Paying a Fair Share Act, legislation \nthat would implement the so-called Buffett rule and ensure that \nmultimillion-dollar earners paid at least a 30-percent overall \neffective tax rate. During debate on my Buffett rule bill, I cited an \nIRS statistic that the top 400 taxpayers in America in 2008 who earned \nan average of $270 million each in that 1 year paid the same 18.2-\npercent effective tax rate on average that is paid by a truckdriver in \nProvidence, RI.\n  The single biggest factor driving this inequality is the special low \nrate for capital gains, 15 percent under the Bush tax cuts. The special \ncapital gains rate allows hedge fund billionaires to avail themselves \nof that so-called carried interest loophole and pay taxes at lower \nrates than their doormen, secretaries, or chauffeurs. If we let the tax \ncuts at the top expire, these rates revert to 20 percent instead of 15 \npercent. Now 20 percent is still a pretty low rate for someone making \n$100 million a year, but more like what a family making $100,000 a year \npays.\n  Let's also be very clear about one thing: The proposal that \nRepublicans prefer, the tax cut bill introduced by Finance Committee \nranking member Orrin Hatch, would raise taxes. It would raise taxes on \n25 million lower and middle-income Americans. It would raise taxes on \nthose 25 million Americans still struggling in these challenging \neconomic times. Republicans claim not to want to raise taxes, but the \nRepublican tax bill would let very popular lower and middle-income \nprovisions expire that would cost 25 million Americans an average of \n$1,000 each. Under the Republican bill, 12 million families would lose \npart or all of their child tax credit, 6 million families would lose \npart or all of their earned income tax credit, and 11 million families \nwould lose their American opportunity tax credit which helps pay for \ncollege. It provides a $2,500 tax credit for higher education. That \npopular tax credit has already helped millions of students and their \nparents pay for college, along with Pell grants, another subject of \nRepublican attack.\n  Extending the American opportunity tax credit, the college tax \ncredit, through 2013 would cost about $3.2 billion. Republicans believe \nwe cannot afford a $3.2 billion investment in higher education for \nmiddle-class Americans, but we can afford $49 billion in continued tax \ncuts for ultra high-income earners. A $2,500 tax credit might seem \npretty small in comparison to the $92,000 average tax break that \nmillionaires, or people earning $1 million a year, would receive from \nanother year of high-end tax cuts, but that $2,500 may make a much \nbigger difference in the life of that middle-class family with that \nchild trying to get into a college they can afford than that $92,000 \nwould make in the life of somebody earning well over $1 million a year.\n  Once again, look at the priorities here. Republicans fought to \nprotect the tax loopholes and taxpayer subsidies for big oil. They \nfought to protect the carried interest tax loophole that lets hedge \nfund billionaires pay lower tax rates than their chauffeurs and \ndoormen. They want to go after the child tax credit, they want to go \nafter the earned income tax credit, and they want to go after the \ncollege tuition tax credit. Those are priorities that, like our Tax \nCode, for too many Americans are upside down.\n  I hope Republicans will join us tomorrow in voting to advance a \nmeasure that would keep taxes low for the vast majority of Americans, \nand I urge them to reexamine their proposal to raise taxes on 25 \nmillion low- and middle-income Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, many of our Republican colleagues argue \nthat we can't extend tax relief for middle-class families unless we \nalso extend tax cuts for the wealthiest. They argue without tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest 2 percent, we will harm job creators and slow the \neconomy. Their arguments rely on faulty assumptions, mistaken beliefs, \nand misleading statements. Let's get to the facts.\n  It is a fact that every American taxpayer would receive a tax cut \nunder our bill on the first $250,000 of their income. It is a fact that \ncompared to the middle-class tax cut act now before us, the plan the \nRepublicans have put forward would increase the deficit by $155 \nbillion. It is a fact that the bill Republicans have put forward, \ndespite their professed support for tax cuts, would raise taxes on the \nmiddle class by failing to extend the 2009 tax cuts for middle-class \nfamilies, including the American opportunity tax credit and credits \nthat help families with children.\n  What is unfolding on the Senate floor now is the culmination of a \nrigid Republican adherence to tax cuts for the wealthy as the supreme \ngoal of public policy. Republicans have demonstrated a willingness to \nrisk government shutdowns. They have demonstrated a willingness to risk \ngrave economic damage, to risk rising taxes on the vast majority of \nAmericans in pursuit of their highest priority: lower taxes on the \nwealthiest 2 percent of us. They want to risk all of that in service to \nan idea that has already proved a failure.\n  When historians look back at the Republican dedication to the tax \ncuts for the wealthy, they will find it remarkable that so many fought \nso long and so hard to go back to a failed policy. Income for the \ntypical American family peaked in the year 2000, not coincidentally \njust before the Republican tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy mania reached its \nzenith.\n  A June study by the Federal Reserve found that the average middle-\nclass family's net worth had fallen by 40 percent from 2007 to 2010. In \n2010, the bottom 99 percent of income earners reaped just 7 percent of \ntotal income growth while 93 percent of all growth flowed to the top 1 \npercent.\n  As David Leonhardt of the New York Times reported on Monday:\n\n       The top-earning 1 percent of households now bring home \n     about 20 percent of total income, up from less than 10 \n     percent 40 years ago. The top earning 1/10,000th of \n     households--each earning at least $7.8 million a year, many \n     of them working in finance--bring home almost 5 percent of \n     income, up from 1 percent 40 years ago.\n\n  Perhaps this vast accumulation of wealth would arguably be acceptable \nif it had resulted in faster economic growth that produced new jobs and \nhelped average Americans prosper. Indeed, since the time of President \nReagan, America has been told that the rising tide lifting up the \nwealthy would lift all boats, and that the benefits would trickle down \nto all Americans. Our Republican colleagues today argue that we must \ncontinue the President Bush tax cuts for the wealthy or risk harm to \nthe ``job creators.''\n  But the Republican emphasis on policies that are more and more \ngenerous to the wealthiest have utterly failed to spark economic growth \nor create the jobs we need. Their experiment failed.\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nThe Bush tax cuts coincided with the slowest rate of job growth in \nAmerican history. Economic growth, even before the financial crisis, \nnearly sent our economy into depression and was woefully short by \nhistoric standards.\n  The failure of the Bush policies to spur economic growth and job \ncreation underlies the failure of another promise from supporters of \ntax cuts for the wealthy, the promise that those cuts would pay for \nthemselves. Republicans backing the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 painted \nthose grand scenarios that grow so rapidly that it would yield \nincreased tax revenue. But instead of growing Federal coffers, we got a \nflood of red ink.\n  So the policy of tax cuts for the wealthy failed as a fiscal policy. \nIt added to our deficit. It failed as an economic policy, coinciding \nwith weak growth and economic output and job creation, and it failed as \na vital test of public policy in a democratic society because it failed \nthe fairness test. Instead, it facilitated massive accumulations of \nwealth for a fortunate few while most Americans have struggled just to \ntread water.\n  Yet our Republican colleagues persist in their pursuit of their \nfailed policy--persist, in fact, to the point that they are willing to \nforce a tax increase on more than 90 percent of taxpayers and \npotentially send our economy tumbling back into recession in adherence \nto that failed policy.\n  We are not arguing against this policy of tax cuts for the wealthiest \nbecause we seek to denigrate success or to stoke class warfare, as some \nRepublicans allege. We are arguing against these policies because they \nare broken, they have failed, and they are unfair. We should reject \nthem lest they do even more harm. We should reject the Republican \npursuit of tax cuts for the wealthy at all costs, every other \nconsideration be damned. We should allow middle-class families to keep \na few of their hard-earned dollars and pass the Middle Class Tax Cut \nAct. At a minimum we should vote tomorrow to overcome the filibuster \nthreat and proceed to debate this singularly important issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam President. I come to the floor this \nafternoon to talk about a very important bill, the Violence Against \nWomen Act. It is hard for me to believe it has actually been months now \nsince we first came to the floor to talk about this important \nlegislation, which is why we are here again this afternoon: to try and \npass a bill into law that has consistently received broad bipartisan \napproval. It is a bill that passed the Senate now almost 3 months ago \nby a vote of 68 to 31.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has successfully helped provide \nlifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women and their \nfamilies. Every time we have reauthorized this bill we have included \nbipartisan provisions to address those who are not being protected by \nit. But here we are back on the Senate floor urging support for a bill \nthat should not be controversial.\n  So, today, the women of the Senate and the men who support the \nViolence Against Women Act have come to the floor with a simple, \nstraightforward message for our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives: Stop the games and pass the inclusive, bipartisan \nSenate bill without delay.\n  In the coming weeks we are going to be making sure this message \nresonates loudly and clearly both in the Nation's Capital and back home \nin our States because we are not going to back down, not while there \nare thousands of women across our country who are currently excluded \nfrom the law. In fact, for Native and immigrant women and LGBT \nindividuals, every moment our inclusive legislation to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act is delayed is another moment they are left \nwithout the resources and protection they deserve.\n  The numbers are staggering: 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in \ntheir lifetimes--1 in 3--and 2 in 5 of them are victims of domestic \nviolence. They are killed at 10 times the rate of the national average.\n  These shocking statistics aren't isolated to one group of women: 25 \nto 35 percent of women in the LGBT community experience domestic \nviolence in their relationships, and 3 in 4 abused immigrant women \nnever entered the process to obtain legal status, even though they were \neligible, because their abuser husbands never filed their paperwork.\n  This should make it perfectly clear to our colleagues in the other \nChamber that their current inaction has a real impact on the lives of \nwomen across America who are affected by violence--women such as \nDeborah Parker.\n  Deborah is the vice-chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribe in my home State \nof Washington. Deborah was repeatedly abused starting at a very young \nage by a nontribal man who lived on her reservation. Not until the \nabuse stopped around the fourth grade did Deborah realize she wasn't \nthe only child suffering at the hands of that assailant. At least a \ndozen other young girls had fallen victim to that same man.\n  He was a man who was never arrested for his crimes, never brought to \njustice, and still walks free today, all because he committed these \nheinous acts on the reservation and is someone who is not a member of \nthe tribe. It is an unfortunate reality that he is unlikely to be held \nliable for his crimes.\n  Reauthorizing an inclusive VAWA is a matter of fairness. Deborah's \nexperience and the experience of other victims of this man do not \nrepresent an isolated incident. For the narrow set of domestic violence \ncrimes laid out in the Violence Against Women Act, tribal governments \nshould be able to hold accountable defendants who have a strong tie to \nthe tribal community.\n  I was very glad to see Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert and \nseveral of her Republican colleagues echo these very same sentiments \nlast week. In a letter to Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor, the \nRepublican Members explicitly called on their party leadership to end \nthis gridlock and accept ``Senate-endorsed provisions that would \nprotect all women of domestic violence, including college students, \nLGBT individuals, Native Americans, and immigrants.''\n  So today we are here to urge Speaker Boehner to listen to the members \nof his own caucus and join us in taking a major step to uphold our \ngovernment's promise to protect its people. I was so proud to have \nserved in the Senate back in 1994 with Senator Boxer, who is here with \nme today, when we first passed this bill. Since we took that historic \nstep, VAWA has been a great success in coordinating victims' advocates, \nsocial service providers, and law enforcement professionals to meet the \nchallenges of combating domestic violence. Along with this bipartisan \nsupport, it has received praise from law enforcement officers, \nprosecutors, judges, victim service providers, faith leaders, health \ncare professionals, advocates, and survivors.\n  VAWA has attained such broad support because it works. Where a person \nlives, their immigration status, or whom they love should not determine \nwhether perpetrators of domestic violence are brought to justice. These \nwomen across this country cannot afford any further delay--not on this \nbill.\n  Today the New York Times ran an editorial on this bill that gets to \nthe heart of where we are. It began by saying:\n\n       House Republicans have to decide which is more important: \n     Protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the \n     harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their \n     party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.\n\n  But the editorial pointed out, it doesn't have to be that way. It \npointed out:\n\n       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's \n     Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill.\n\n  Finally, it ends with what we all know we need to take this bill \nforward: Leadership from Congressman Boehner.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2012]\n\n                       Delay on Domestic Violence\n\n       With Congress just days away from its August break, House \n     Republicans have to decide which is more important: \n     protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the \n     harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their \n     party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\n       At issue is reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, \n     the landmark 1994 law central to the nation's efforts against \n     domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.\n       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's \n     Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill. \n     Instead of embracing the Senate's good work, House \n     Republicans passed their own regressive version, ignoring \n     President Obama's veto threat. The bill did not include new \n     protections for gay, immigrant, American Indian and student \n     victims contained in the Senate measure. It also rolled back \n     protections for immigrant women, including for undocumented \n     immigrants who report abuse and cooperate with law \n     enforcement.\n       Negotiations on a final bill are in limbo. Complicating \n     matters, there is a procedural glitch. The Senate bill \n     imposes a fee to pay for special visas that go to immigrant \n     victims of domestic abuse. This runs afoul of the rule that \n     revenue-raising measures must begin in the House. Mr. \n     Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that, of \n     course, would also require his Republican colleagues to drop \n     their narrow-minded opposition to stronger protections for \n     all victims of abuse.\n       Unless something changes, Republicans will bear \n     responsibility for blocking renewal of a popular, lifesaving \n     initiative. This seems an odd way to cultivate moderate \n     voters, especially women, going into the fall campaign.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Today the effort we are beginning in the Senate is an \neffort that will continue for as long as it takes. It is a call for the \nsame thing: Leadership. It is time for Speaker Boehner to look beyond \nideology and partisan politics. It is time for him to look at the \nhistory of a bill that again and again and again has been supported and \nexpanded by Republicans and Democrats. It is time for him to do the \nright thing and pass our inclusive, bipartisan Violence Against Women \nAct because the lives of women across the country literally depend on \nit.\n  I am delighted my colleague from California is here with me. She has \nbeen with us every step of the way in this bipartisan bill that we have \nmoved forward. With the women and men who support us, we are going to \ncontinue to be loud and strong. We need to pass the bill, and Speaker \nBoehner needs to take it up for the women who are watching and waiting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am proud to follow Senator Murray in \nher call to pass the bipartisan Senate bill which would reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act. The Leahy-Crapo bill is the only bill that \nwill protect all of the women in our country.\n  I well remember when Vice President Biden was then-Senator Biden, and \nin 1990 he wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I was in the House at \nthe time. He asked if I would carry the House version of his bill. I \nwas extremely honored to do that. We were able to pass small portions \nof the bill early in the 1990s.\n  But it wasn't until I came to the Senate that we actually passed the \nentire bill, and I think it was Senator Schumer, who was then in the \nHouse, who picked up the ball on the bill in the House. It got passed. \nSince then we have seen a decline in domestic violence of 53 percent. \nBut even so, even while the law is working, we have to strengthen it \nbecause, as the Presiding Officer knows because she is a leader in this \ncause, every day three women are killed by their abusive partners. Let \nme say that again. Every single day, three women are killed by their \nabusive partners.\n  So in order to change this terrible statistic, we need to reauthorize \nthe Violence Against Women Act, and we need to improve it to protect \nmore victims of domestic violence. That is what the Senate did. I am \nvery proud of the Senate. We passed the bipartisan bill with a vote of \n68 to 31, with 15 Republicans voting in favor.\n  The Presiding Officer also worked hard to get the Transportation bill \ndone. It was a very similar situation. The Senate had a bipartisan \nbill; it was a very popular bill. It had over 70 votes. The House was \nvery slow to take up the measure, and we kept saying: Pass the Senate \nbill. Finally, they passed a small bill, and we got to conference, and \nwe hammered it out.\n  But here is the thing: We don't have time on this bill. We need to \nask the House to take a look at our bill and to understand how \nimportant it is that everybody be included in the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  I am going to put up a chart that shows us how many people are left \nout of the House Violence Against Women Act.\n  (Mr. CASEY assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now, I say Mr. President, we can see that 30 million \npeople are left out of the House Violence Against Women Act. That is \nwhy we have seen a number of colleagues in the House call for passage \nof a bill such as the Senate's bill, because we include everybody. It \nisn't fair to leave entire groups out of the protections of the \nViolence Against Women Act, and that is exactly what they do in the \nHouse.\n  The House bill ignores the wishes of law enforcement and excludes key \nprotections for 4 million immigrants. It excludes 16 million LGBT \npersons from critical legal protections and services. More than 44 \npercent of LGBT victims who seek shelter are turned away.\n  The House bill would also prevent Indian tribes from protecting \nalmost 2 million Native American women from their abusers. This is \noutrageous. It is an extremely outrageous omission, given that nearly \nhalf of all Native American women have been victims of domestic \nviolence. Let me repeat that: Almost half of all Native American women \nhave been victims of domestic violence. Yet among the 30 million left \nout of the House Violence Against Women Act, we see the exclusion of \nthe Native American community.\n  Despite the epidemic of sexual assault and dating violence on our \ncollege campuses, the House bill leaves out improved protections for \nmore than 11 million college women.\n  The House bill would deny vital protections to women such as an \nimmigrant woman who is my constituent who had been stabbed by her \nboyfriend 19 times while she was 3 months pregnant. During her ordeal, \nher boyfriend drove her from one part of town to the other, refusing to \ntake her to the emergency room, even though she was losing \nconsciousness and bleeding profusely.\n  Thankfully, the woman received medical attention, the baby was not \nlost, and she made a full recovery. This brave woman, despite her \nphysical and emotional scars, fully cooperated with police and the \nprosecutor to eventually bring her abuser to justice. A women's shelter \nhelped her get a U visa based on her cooperation with law enforcement, \nand she and her child were able to move on with a new life.\n  If we look at some of the most vulnerable people living in America \ntoday, in addition to our children--and I know what the Presiding \nOfficer is dealing with in Pennsylvania, with an unbelievable, \nhorrific, violent crime that took place on a college campus over a \nperiod of years--we know our children are vulnerable, and our immigrant \nwomen are extremely vulnerable, too, because they are scared they are \ngoing to be kicked out of the country and, therefore, their abuser \nknows that and puts them in a horrific situation, where if they go to \nthe police to report the abuse on themselves and their kids, they may \nbe kicked out of the country.\n  That is why we have the U visas. The U visas say: If someone \ncooperates with law enforcement, they will not be kicked out. So we \nhave to include immigrant women and, by extension, their children in \nthe 30 million who are left out. We have to add them back in.\n  The House bill fails to ensure that people such as Jonathon, a gay \nman who was abused by his partner of 13 years, receives full protection \nunder the law and cannot be discriminated against.\n  When Jonathon did seek shelter from his abuser, he was refused by \nthree L.A. area domestic violence shelters, none of which could give \nhim a reason for excluding him. But he was left out because this \ncommunity was not mentioned in the Violence Against Women Act. It is \nnot mentioned in the House act, and Jonathon falls among the 30 million \nwho are left out of the House act.\n  The House bill also leaves out students such as Mika, who was \nphysically assaulted by her ex-boyfriend while she was in college in \nSan Francisco. Her ex-boyfriend broke her phone, broke into her home, \nstole her belongings, stalked her at school, and severely beat her.\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\n  She got a restraining order against him but struggled to get her \nschool to enforce that restraining order. She should not have had to \nstruggle. She should have had the school on her side.\n  Sadly, only the Senate bill would help her, not the House bill. The \nHouse bill does not protect these women. Only the Senate bill ensures \nthat all women, LGBT individuals, and college students are protected \nequally under the law, as well as Native American women.\n  The consequences of denying anyone the critical protections in the \nViolence Against Women Act are too great. When someone is bleeding on \nthe floor, we need to help them in this great country. We do not want \nto start asking them questions. Are you gay? Are you straight? Are you \nan immigrant? Are you a college student? Are you a Native American? If \nsomeone is bleeding on the floor, we help them in this country. That is \nwhat America is about.\n  We see the compassion and the love every day in our country, and we \nsaw it pour out in Aurora, CO, for an unspeakable situation. When there \nis violence, we have to help the victims. Only the Senate bill, the \nSenate Violence Against Women Act, the Leahy-Crapo bipartisan Senate \nbill, affords protection to all our people.\n  So what we are saying to Speaker Boehner is: Please hear our plea. \nThis is not about the Senate saying it is any better than the House. \nWhat we are saying is, in a bipartisan way, we figured out a bill that \nwill protect everybody, and we are asking Members to pick up that bill \nand pass it.\n  There are some technical issues--a blue-slip question. We have \nstudied that. What did we find out? Those technical problems can be \novercome in 5 seconds. So there is no reason why the House cannot pick \nup and pass the Senate bill.\n  The safety of women across the country, the safety of all our \ncommunities, is at stake, and it is time we pass it.\n  In closing, I would say this: Vice President Biden is a wonderful \nhuman being, and he could not sit back when he was in the Senate and \nsee violence against women go on and on and on without any way to \nensure that women could get into shelters, that women could get \ncounseling, that law enforcement could be trained, that doctors could \nbe trained, that nurses could be trained, and that we enhance the \npenalties for those who would harm another in a domestic violence \nsituation.\n  He had tremendous foresight. In this bill, Senator Leahy and Senator \nCrapo have amazing foresight because they have strengthened this. We \nhave cut back domestic violence by 53 percent. But we have a long way \nto go when three women a day are killed--killed--by their abuser.\n  Again, we have a very clear message for the House: Please join hands \nwith us. Please, with all the politics and all the fighting and all the \nproblems, there are certain times when we should reach out to one \nanother and protect the American people. This is one of those times. We \nhave the bill. It is bipartisan. It works. Please accept it, and let's \nget on with our work.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague \nfrom California for her leadership over many years and her steadfast \ncourage and vision on this issue; likewise, my colleague from the State \nof Washington who spoke before her, Senator Murray, for her leadership, \nas well and others in this body who passed VAWA, the Senate's version \nof that measure, S. 1925, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, in \nfact, 68 to 31, back in April.\n  This measure truly is bipartisan, and it has commanded overwhelming \nsupport in this body and, more important, from across the American \npublic.\n  In Connecticut, I hear again and again from men and women, members of \nall communities, that the Violence Against Women Act is an idea whose \ntime came 18 years ago but continues to demand the kind of respect and \nsupport the Senate has given it.\n  Now is the time for the House to adopt the Senate bill because it is \nmore inclusive and more effective. For a bill that works, as this \nmeasure truly does, to include more potential victims, to provide more \ntools of enforcement is absolutely appropriate and necessary at this \npoint in our history.\n  Of course, I hear from Connecticut constituents such as Hillary from \nFairfield, who tells me:\n\n       One in four women, worldwide and in the U.S. is at risk for \n     violence at some point in her life. Men are at risk too, and \n     VAWA supports provisions for men to be safe and healthy in \n     their relationships as well. VAWA supports programs for both \n     men and women perpetrators of abuse to get the help they need \n     to stop the violence, and it ensures that women and their \n     children have a safe place to go when in danger.\n\n  Susan from New Haven:\n\n       Reauthorizing VAWA sends the message that survivors of \n     sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and \n     stalking must have the tools to heal and reclaim their lives; \n     that women and girls, our communities and our families, must \n     be safe; that the next generation must be engaged in this \n     effort--and that the evolution of our collective thinking on \n     how to break the cycle of violence is a national priority. To \n     send any other message is unconscionable. Congress must act \n     swiftly. Renew VAWA now.\n\n  Renew VAWA is the message we carry to the House: Renew VAWA with the \nimprovements and reforms we have wisely adopted in this body and \ncontinue a measure that has benefited 54,000--let me repeat that, \n54,000--domestic violence victims in Connecticut alone, millions across \nthe country, and has provided organizations in Connecticut nearly $5 \nmillion in just the last fiscal year from VAWA programs.\n  These measures make a difference in people's lives. So often we can \nspeak and think in this Chamber without the kind of connection to \nindividual lives, where we see legislation, our acts here, making a \ndifference. This measure offers us the opportunity to make a difference \nby broadening and making more inclusive this measure.\n  It makes it more effective. I am proud it makes it more effective \nwith an amendment I offered to prosecute criminals who use the Internet \nto intimidate, threaten, harass, and incite violence against women and \nchildren.\n  The use of the Internet is increasingly prevalent for these kinds of \ncrimes. The legislation I introduced, included in the Senate's bill, \nenhances current law for the Internet age. That section of the bill is \nnot in the House version. It should be. That is a reason I am urging \nthe House to adopt the Senate version.\n  But it is also more inclusive in including lesbian, gay, bisexual, \nand transgender constituents--whom all of us have--in these \nprotections.\n  LGBT Americans experience domestic violence at the same rate as the \ngeneral population, but they often face discrimination in accessing \nservices. In fact, a survey found that 45 percent of LGBT victims were \nturned away when they sought help from a domestic violence shelter. \nThere is a real need--an unquestionable and immediate need--to improve \nthe access and availability of services for LGBT victims, and our \nmeasure does it; the House version does not.\n  Over 800 constituents--and I welcome them in contacting me--have \nwritten me to urge that we preserve the LGBT provisions of the Senate \nbill as VAWA moves forward.\n  S. 1925 also includes protections for Native Americans that are \nabsolutely vital. One of the invisible, unknown, unrealized, \nunacknowledged facts about this community is that nearly three out of \nfive Native American women are assaulted by their spouses or intimate \npartners. One-third of all American Indian women will be raped during \ntheir lifetime. Those numbers alone should dictate the result. The \nmembers of the Tribal Council of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation \nand others across the country--the Mashantucket Pequots happen to be \nfrom Connecticut--have appealed to me to protect the tribal provisions \nin the Senate measure, not to waiver, not to relent to the House \nversion.\n  Again, I urge the House to adopt our measure.\n  Protecting immigrant populations ought to be a given for the Senate. \nThe House version of VAWA would ``endanger the safety of noncitizen \nvictims and society as a whole.'' That is a quote from the \nInternational Institute of Connecticut, which has urged me to hold firm \nto support the provisions of the Senate bill and not surrender to the \nHouse and relent on protecting immigrants who need this help.\n  Again, I quote. The House version would ``endanger the safety of \nnoncitizen victims and society as a whole.''\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\nVAWA symbolizes for our immigrants, those who come to this country, \nwhat makes America great. We protect everyone who needs it. We enforce \nthe laws equally without discriminating against people as to their \nnational heritage or origin or ethnicity or race or other background. \nEqual protection of the law is one of the unique constitutional \nprinciples of the American democracy and the American Constitution. Our \nlandmark measure enhances and enforces equal protection of the law.\n  I hope this body stands firm. I hope the House understands that it is \nnot one body being better than another. We are way beyond that kind of \ncomparison at this point. It is one version of the same legislation, \none set of provisions seeking a common goal, doing it better, more \ninclusively, and more effectively in the great tradition of the \nlegislative process.\n  I urge the House of Representatives to put partisanship aside, to put \naside any kind of cameral personal differences and take immediate \naction to support all in America who are victims of domestic violence \nand sexual abuse.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the need to \nextend the current tax rates and to reject the tens of billions of \ndollars in higher taxes the President and Senate Democrats want to \nimpose next year. I believe the upcoming vote or votes will be some of \nthe most important votes the Senate holds this year.\n  As early as tomorrow, we will hopefully vote on tax plans that \nrepresent two competing philosophies. One plan, introduced by Majority \nLeader Reid and supported by Senate Democrats and the President, \nproposes higher taxes on American entrepreneurs, investors, and small \nbusiness owners.\n  The Democratic plan represents the philosophy that if only the \ngovernment could raise enough money, Congress could somehow spend our \nway to prosperity. It is a viewpoint that holds that the Federal \nGovernment can spend hard-working American tax dollars better than they \ncan. Rather than leaving the money in the private economy where it can \nbe invested or spent by private citizens, this view holds that the \ngovernment should instead bring these dollars here to Washington, DC, \nto redistribute them through the Federal bureaucracy. This philosophy \nwas probably best articulated by the President recently when he said, \n``If you've got a business--you didn't build that. Someone else made \nthat happen.'' In other words, no one is extraordinary by virtue of \ntheir hard work and accomplishments. When someone works hard and \nsucceeds, we should not celebrate that person as an example to others, \nwe should instead take from him or her in order--again, as the \nPresident said--to ``spread the wealth,'' to quote another of his \nlines.\n  I am hopeful that the tax-and-spend philosophy of the Reid tax plan, \nhowever, will not be our only option. I hope we will also have the \nopportunity to vote on legislation introduced recently by Senator Hatch \nand Minority Leader McConnell. This plan takes a very different \napproach by following the view that now is not the time to raise \nanyone's taxes. This view holds that our American free enterprise \nsystem works best when government gets out of the way, leaving \nAmericans free to pursue their hopes and dreams. One way we can leave \nAmericans free to pursue their dreams is by not raising their taxes \nnext year. And we especially should not raise taxes when Americans are \nstruggling to get by.\n  Ironically, the view that we should extend current tax policy at a \ntime when the economy is weak was articulated, interestingly enough, by \nthe President just 2 years ago when he signed an extension of all of \nthe tax rates. At that time, President Obama said that raising taxes \nwould have ``been a blow to our economy just as we're climbing out of a \nrecession.'' Interestingly enough, real GDP growth when he made that \nstatement was around 3.1 percent. That was the average when the \nPresident made the statement that if we raised taxes, it would have \n``been a blow to our economy.'' Well, real GDP growth this year is on a \npace to average 2 percent and possibly less. Those numbers are \nconsistently being revised and being revised downward. If it did not \nmake sense to raise taxes when our economy was recovering, why does it \nmake sense now to raise taxes as our economy is slowing? How does it \nmake sense to raise taxes in an environment where over 23 million \nAmericans are out of work or underemployed, when the unemployment rate \nhas been stuck at over 8 percent now for 41 consecutive months?\n  The votes tomorrow are incredibly important--not because either plan \nis likely to become law immediately but because Americans deserve to \nknow where their Senators stand when they go to vote this November. Do \nyou stand for stable tax rates that encourage work and investment or do \nyou stand for increasing taxes on the very businesses we rely on for \njob creation? Do you stand for a free enterprise system that rewards \nhard work and innovation or do you stand for making it more difficult \nfor small businesses to grow and succeed? These are the important \nchoices that will have a real impact on hard-working Americans and on \nour economy at large.\n  Consider the Reid tax plan. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, this plan will impose a tax increase on nearly 1 million \nbusiness owners. Proponents of this increase are going to argue that it \nwill only affect a small segment of our economy. Yet the Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates that the President's tax increase in the Reid plan \nwill hit more than 50 percent of all income earned by businesses that \npay their taxes at individual rates. These are so-called passthrough \nbusinesses, and they apply to S corporations, partnerships, sole \nproprietorships, and LLCs. They are the ones who are going to see their \ncost of business go up next year for no other reason than the desire by \nthe Senate Democrats to ``tax the rich.''\n  Small businesses, which accounted for two-thirds of the net new jobs \nover the last decade, will be particularly impacted by these tax \nincreases. According to a survey of small businesses by the National \nFederation of Independent Business, 75 percent of small businesses are \norganized as passthrough businesses. NFIB also found that the \nbusinesses most likely to be hit by the Reid tax increases are those \nbusinesses employing between 20 and 250 employees. According to the \nU.S. census, the data that they collect, these businesses employ more \nthan 25 percent of the workforce. So the million small businesses that, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, will see their taxes go \nup under this proposal employ 25 percent of the American workforce and \naccount for over 50 percent of all passthrough income. So you are going \nto see taxes go up dramatically on over 50 percent of passthrough \nincome and on small businesses that employ 25 percent of the American \nworkforce.\n  Does that make sense in this economy? It should be no wonder that the \npolitical party advocating this kind of tax policy has also presided \nover the weakest economic recovery literally since the end of World War \nII.\n  The impact of the Reid tax increase on small business will be bad \nenough, but unfortunately these tax increases will have significant \nramifications for our entire economy. According to a study released \nearlier this month by Ernst & Young, the Reid tax plan would hurt our \neconomy in the long term. According to Ernst & Young, the tax increases \nin the Reid plan would reduce economic output by 1.3 percent. This \nwould mean $200 billion less in economic activity if translated into \ntoday's economy. The Ernst & Young study estimates that the tax \npolicies in the Reid plan would reduce employment by one-half percent, \nmeaning roughly 710,000 fewer jobs.\n  The study estimates the Senate Democrats' approach will reduce the \nNation's capital stock by 1.4 percent and investment by 2.4 percent, \nand this approach will reduce aftertax wages by 1.8 percent. So we will \nbe reducing investment, costing the economy over 700,000 jobs, and \nreducing aftertax wages for hard-working Americans in this country. Yet \nhere we are talking\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\nabout a tax increase that would do dangerous damage and harm to our \neconomy.\n  I would say, these aren't partisan statistics compiled by Senate \nRepublicans. These are the estimates by a respected accounting firm as \nto what will happen if we follow the tax policies proposed by Senate \nDemocrats and the President. We will have less economic growth, fewer \njobs, and a lower standard of living in the long run. These numbers \nsimply confirm common sense. If we want individuals and businesses to \nspend and invest more, we shouldn't raise the amount of the income they \nhave to pay to the Federal Government, and that is what this does.\n  We have major tax policy decisions to make, decisions reflected in \nthe votes we will take tomorrow. Do we want to encourage capital \nformation in this country? In other words, do we want to encourage \ninvestors to put their capital at risk so that businesses will have \nmoney to make new investments? Well, by raising the capital gains tax \nrate from 15 percent to 20 percent for some investors, the Reid bill \nwill make it less attractive to invest in our economy. According to an \nErnst & Young study from February of this year, the top rate of capital \ngains will rise from 56.7 percent on January 1 of next year, after \ntaking into account corporate, investor, and State taxes. This will be \nthe second highest combined capital gains tax rate in the world among \nOECD and BRIC nations. America already has the highest corporate tax \nrate in the developed world. It appears as if the Senate Democrats are \ngoing for No. 1 when it comes to capital gains taxes as well.\n  If there is anything I can say that is positive about the Democrats' \ntax increase plan, it is that at least they rejected the President's \nproposal to nearly triple the tax on dividends paid by upper income \nAmericans. Even Senate Democrats, who are not shy about raising taxes, \nunderstand the President's proposal to impose a top rate of over 40 \npercent on dividend income would be terrible for millions of seniors \nwho rely on dividend-paying stocks and for those American companies \nthat rely on dividends to raise capital.\n  Instead, the Reid bill would increase the top rate on dividends from \n15 percent to 20 percent. I believe this tax increase is bad policy, \nbut it won't be nearly as harmful as the President's approach would \nhave been.\n  On another issue of critical importance, however, the Senate \nDemocrats have decided to run to the left of this liberal \nadministration, and this is on the issue of the estate tax, better \nknown as the death tax. The Reid plan would impose a huge new death tax \non family farms and businesses next year. Under current law, businesses \nand farms are exempted from the death tax on the first $5 million of \nthe value of an estate. Values above this amount are taxed at a top \nrate of 35 percent.\n  I believe we ought to completely eliminate the death tax, and I have \nintroduced legislation, with 37 of my colleagues, to do so. But the \ncurrent death tax treatment exempts the large majority of family farms \nand businesses from the tax. The Reid plan, however, would allow the \ndeath tax to revert to the provisions in effect before 2001.\n  This means, under the Reid plan, that family farms and businesses \nwill face a top death tax rate of 55 percent on estates above $1 \nmillion in value.\n  This is a massive death tax increase on tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses and family farms across America. In fact, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, the Reid plan will increase the number of \nestates subject to the death tax in 2013 from 3,600 estates under \ncurrent law to 50,300 estates under the Reid proposal.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Reid plan will \nsubject 20 times more farming estates to the death tax in 2013--a \n2,000-percent increase. The Reid plan will subject 9 times more small \nbusinesses to the death tax--a 900-percent increase.\n  If the death tax policy in the Reid plan were made permanent over the \nnext 10 years, the number of small businesses subject to the death tax \nwill increase from 1,800 to 23,700, and the number of family farms \nsubject to the death tax would increase from 900 to 25,200. That is all \ndata put together and reported out by the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The reason for this massive expansion of the death tax is because the \n$1 million exemption amount is much too low, given the value of \nsuccessful farms and small businesses today. I will use my State of \nSouth Dakota as a good example. Take family farms in South Dakota. \nAccording to the Department of Agriculture, the average size of a farm \nin my State is 1,374 acres. According to the USDA, the average value \nper acre of cropland in South Dakota is about $1,810. This means the \naverage value of a farm in my State is nearly $2.5 million. So if you \nhave a death tax law that only exempts $1 million and has a 55-percent \ntop rate on everything above that, imagine what that is going to do to \nthe average farm in a State such as South Dakota. And South Dakota is \nnot unique in that regard. We have seen land values rise across \nAmerica's heartland, from Nebraska to Missouri to Montana.\n  Let's be clear: The Reid bill would subject many more families to a \npunitive double tax--the death tax--when a loved one passes away. It \nwill make it much more difficult to pass family farms and businesses \nfrom one generation to the next. And we should never forget that most \nfamily farms are land rich and cash poor. Lots of assets, land values, \nand those sorts of things, but what you don't want to see happen is a \nfamily farm that can be passed on to the next generation have to be \nliquidated to pay the IRS because of a punitive death tax. That is \nprecisely what this policy, as proposed by the Democrats' plan, would \ndo.\n  The USDA estimates 84 percent of farm assets are comprised of farm \nreal estate. That is where most farm and ranch families have their \nassets. That means family farms don't have extra cash on hand to pay \nthe death tax. Instead, they will have to sell off land or take on \nadditional debt in order to pay these higher taxes. That is exactly \nwhat we don't want to see happen in this country.\n  I don't believe the President's proposal--which is a $3.5 million \nexemption and a 45-percent top rate--is adequate, but it is much better \nthan what Senate Democrats in the Reid plan have proposed.\n  Let me summarize, if I might. Tomorrow we are going to vote on the \nReid proposal to raise taxes at a time when Americans are hurting and \nour economy is fragile. The Reid proposal will impose higher taxes of \nmore than $50 billion on successful small business owners and families. \nIt will hurt our economy, reducing economic growth and job creation at \nthe same time it lowers wages for hard-working American families. It \nwill impose a new death tax of $31 billion on 43,100 family farmers, \nranchers, and small businesses.\n  We will also vote, I hope--I hope--on the Hatch-McConnell alternative \nplan to keep tax rates where they are, to prevent a tax increase on any \nAmerican next year. In addition to keeping tax rates where they are, \nthe Hatch-McConnell proposal provides instructions to the Finance \nCommittee to report out fundamental tax reform legislation by 12 months \nfrom the date of enactment of the bill. The Hatch-McConnell approach is \nthe correct approach: Prevent a tax increase now and move to \nfundamental tax reform next year.\n  Of course, extending current tax law temporarily is only a short-term \nfix. What is needed is comprehensive tax reform, much like the Tax \nReform Act of 1986. Real tax reform will drive economic growth higher, \nwill lead to robust job creation, and will result in more revenue to \nthe Federal Government.\n  But real tax reform is going to require Presidential leadership, \nsomething that has, unfortunately, been lacking over the past 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. Perhaps next year we will have a President truly willing to \ncommit to tax reform, a President who is not content with simply \nreleasing a 23-page framework for corporate tax reform.\n  But until we get to comprehensive fax reform, the least we can do now \nis to ensure Americans do not face a massive new tax hike during a weak \neconomy. I hope we will get that vote tomorrow. I hope Senate Democrats \nwill find their way to give us a vote on extending the tax rates for \nall Americans so that small businesses aren't whacked with a big tax \nincrease next year, so that our economy doesn't get\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\nplunged perhaps into a recession, and we don't see that unemployment \nrate tick even higher.\n  Those are the results, those are the outcomes, those are the types of \nthings that are going to happen, according to all the independent \nanalysis, with the tax proposal that is before us today.\n  Remember, there is always this idea that somehow, if we raise more \ntaxes, we will be able to pay down more of the debt. Well, I have to \nsay, it has been my experience that when there is money around \nWashington, DC, it gets sucked up and it gets spent. I think a lot of \nAmericans would welcome the idea of seeing their taxes going to pay \ndown the debt, but what we will see is a massive tax increase on \nAmericans used to grow government here in Washington, DC. That is not \nwhat the American people want, and that is not what we in the Senate \nshould be for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying:\n\n       I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, \n     they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The \n     great point is to bring them the real facts.\n\n  There have been a number of inaccurate claims over the past several \nweeks accusing Democrats of proposing tax hikes. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. So let me set the record straight, as Lincoln \nsaid, and bring them the real facts.\n  Democrats are proposing to extend a tax cut for 100 percent of \ntaxpayers. Under the Democratic proposal, all taxpayers get a tax cut. \nThose lower income, those middle income, and those upper income all get \na tax cut. Everyone does. Millionaires get a tax cut under the \nDemocratic proposal, billionaires get a tax cut under the Democratic \nproposal, and all taxpayers who pay ordinary income tax are going to \nget a tax cut.\n  Why is that? It is very simple. Because even if your income is above \n$200,000 for an individual or $250,000 for a family, you are still \ngetting a tax cut for your first $200,000 of income or the first \n$250,000 of income. So you are getting a tax cut. Everybody is getting \na tax cut. I want to make that clear: All Americans get a tax cut under \nthe Democratic proposal.\n  Even though the most wealthy are also getting a tax cut under the \nDemocratic proposal, those on the other side of the aisle want to give \nan even greater tax cut to those earning above $200,000 as individuals \nor $250,000 as a couple. So let me repeat: Everyone gets a tax cut \nunder the Reid bill. The other side of the aisle says: Okay, maybe that \nis so, but they want to give an even greater tax cut to those earning \nover $250,000. That is the fact.\n  An awful lot of people think the Democratic bill does not cut taxes \nfor those above $200,000 and $250,000. It does. It does. The facts are \nclear. The numbers don't lie. It does. Everyone gets a tax cut. So \nthere should be no question about that.\n  As I said, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nthreatening to oppose a middle-income tax cut, which actually is a tax \ncut for everybody. They say, oh, no, don't do that. They say, do that, \nbut then add a greater tax cut for those top 2 percent of the \nwealthiest of Americans.\n  But let's go back and ask ourselves why are we here, in part? These \ntax reductions were instituted in 2001, at a time when our country had \nrecord surpluses. I think the total tax cut in 2001 was projected to be \nabout--I may be off a little here--$1.5 or $1.6 trillion over 10 years, \nat a time when our Nation had a projected surplus of about $3 trillion \nor up to $5 trillion. I have forgotten exactly, but it was way above \nthe 2001 tax cut. That is why, in large part, the 2001 Congress \ndecided, well, we have these big projected surpluses, so let's give \nsome of it back to the people. I voted for it.\n  That is why I voted for it. It made sense to me--with the great \nprojected surpluses--to take a little less than half of that and give \nit back to people in terms of tax cuts.\n  But times have changed. In the wake of two wars that have cost over \n$1 trillion, unpaid for--Iraq and Afghanistan--and also the 2008 \nfinancial collapse that very much hurt our economy, times have changed \nsince 2001. As a consequence, our Nation now is faced with record debt, \nand we cannot continue to spend money we don't have. We have to put our \nNation back on solid fiscal ground. So a lot has happened since 2001.\n  In addition, something else has happened, regrettably. Today, the \naverage household income indexed for inflation is lower than it was \nwhen the tax cuts for the wealthy were put into effect. This means more \npeople are making less money now than they were when these cuts were \nsigned into law. Today, American families have less money to spend on \ntheir mortgages, gasoline, and groceries, for example. Actually, \nincluding benefits, Americans are not as well off as they were 10, 15 \nyears ago.\n  These cuts were enacted in 2001 for all Americans. Those top two \nrates for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans has cost future \ngenerations nearly $1 trillion. I think it is bad economics to continue \nthese highest income tax cuts without evidence they actually solve \nAmerica's economic woes. They don't. It is especially bad economics \nwhen our Nation's debt has increased by $10 trillion since they were \nfirst enacted.\n  Hard choices need to be made as we work to get our debt back to \nsustainable levels. We are all going to be asked to contribute. We need \nto make sure the most fortunate pay their fair share to deficit \nreduction as well. Again, they are already getting a tax break under \nthe Democratic proposal. Everyone gets a tax cut under the Democratic \nproposal, but it is wrong to go further and say those making above \n$250,000 should be getting an even greater tax cut.\n  With a greater contribution from them, we could more easily work to \nget our Nation's debt down to manageable levels.\n  Some have argued we cannot let the tax rates expire for the \nwealthiest Americans--the top 2 percent--because they are ``small \nbusiness owners.'' Let me address that and marshal the facts, as \nAbraham Lincoln would ask us to do.\n  Being wealthy is not the same as being a small business owner. One \ncan be very wealthy in America but not be a small business owner. Some \nmight have us believe there are 1 million small business owners earning \nover $200,000 a year. How do they get that number? They get that number \nfrom an estimate prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a \nbipartisan group that gives us accurate data--both Republicans and \nDemocrats, Senators and House Members.\n  The Joint Committee predicts that in 2013 there will be about 940,000 \ntaxpayers with some business income in the upper two tax rates. But \nthat Joint Committee estimate isn't the number of small businesses. \nThat is a different number. Instead, it is the number of all \nindividuals in the top two rates who receive any amount of income, from \na passthrough business or from rental real estate, royalties, estates \nor trusts. That number of 940,000 taxpayers does not tell us whether \nthe taxpayer spent any amount of time actually working in the business \nor if that taxpayer is merely an investor sitting on the sidelines. In \naddition, that number does not tell us whether the income is from a \nlarge business or from a small business. It can be a large business \npassthrough. So that number of 940,000 doesn't tell us is it large or \nis it small. It does not tell us if the business actually even employs \nanybody. We don't know that. There are a lot of taxpayers at that \nbracket who don't employ anybody. They are not small businesspeople.\n  So that 1 million number being thrown around includes taxpayers who, \nfor example, invest in publicly traded partnerships which can be \npurchased on the New York Stock Exchange similar to any other stock. \nThey are not small businesses as ordinary Americans think them to be. \nThe 1 million number also includes celebrities and sport stars who \nreceive income from speaking engagements. They are not small \nbusinesspeople, but yet they are lumped into that same number. \nAmericans wouldn't regard sports celebrities as a small businessperson. \nThat is not right.\n  That 1 million number also includes best-selling authors receiving \nroyalties for book sales. That 1 million number includes partners in \nlaw firms and hedge funds who receive their income as a share of a \npartnership distribution. They are not a small business. The 1 million \nnumber also includes\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nwealthy individuals who rent out their vacation homes for just a few \nweeks a year.\n  Both President Obama and Governor Romney would be considered small \nbusiness owners in 2011 under this definition. I wouldn't think they \nare small businesspeople, Americans don't think they are small \nbusinesspeople, but they would be included in the definition the other \nside bandies about.\n  In reality, only a very small fraction of the top earners actually \nown or control or manage a business that is small and has hired anyone. \nI have forgotten the exact number, but it is a small number. It isn't \nsound fiscal policy to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of \nAmericans just because a small portion of them have income from a \nbusiness and a tiny portion of them manage a small business. But that \nis what some would have us believe. I don't have the number with me, \nbut it is very small. There aren't very many at all.\n  Finally, the argument that higher taxes on the wealthiest hinders job \ncreation is tenuous at best. Why do I say that? I say that because even \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that extending the \nhigh income tax cuts for those in the top two rates was the least \neffective way of creating jobs among a list of alternatives commented \non by the Congressional Budget Office. As I recall, the top of the list \nwere items such as payroll tax. If we cut the payroll tax, that is a \nbig job creator. If we extend unemployment insurance benefits, that is \na big job creator. Down at the bottom of the list of job creation on a \ndollar-for-dollar basis is extending the 2 percent top rates. That \ncreates very few jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Actually, it hurts job creation, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. Why? It found that extending the high income tax cuts \nactually reduces the gross domestic product and the number of jobs over \n10 years. Why? Because doing so increases the deficit. The CBO said \nthat actually extending the top two rates is a job reducer, not a job \ncreator--a job reducer--because it would add to the deficit and, in \ndoing so, all things being equal, would lose jobs.\n  So despite efforts to hide behind small businesses, the fundamental \nquestion is, What is fair? What is best for our country? Should we \ndrive up deficits further, reducing growth as a result by extending the \ntax cuts for the top 2 percent? Don't forget, we are already reducing \ntheir taxes under the Reid bill. Should we tame our deficits by ending \nMedicare as we know it and cutting important social programs to the \nbone? The more those top two rates are extended, the more we have to \ncut someplace else. It is just mathematics. It is a choice we have to \nmake in our country. There is no free lunch. We know that. We can't \nhave our cake and eat it. Life is choices. Our fiscal situation needs \nchoices. We have to decide what makes the most sense or should we \ncontrol our deficits through a balanced approach that thoughtfully cuts \nspending and ask the wealthiest 2 percent to contribute no more than \nthey did 11 years ago? Clearly, as we reduce our debt and try to cut \nspending, there is no question about that. There is also no question \nthat there has to be some combined income tax increase along with the \nspending cuts to be able to reduce our budget deficit.\n  The answer is clear: We should vote for Leader Reid's bill and \ncontinue down the path toward responsible deficit reduction. I wish to \nmake the point again, if it wasn't clear. The Reid bill reduces tax \nrates for all Americans, middle income and upper income, because we \nhave a marginal rate system. The most wealthy have to pay in the 10-\npercent bracket, then they pay in the 15-percent bracket, then they pay \nin the 25-percent bracket, then they pay in the 28-percent bracket, all \nthe way up to the top bracket today which is 35 percent. They pay in \nall brackets. So what we are saying is we are going to reduce your \ntaxes; we are going to make sure you stay at those low rates for the \nnext year so you, therefore, are going to pay less in income taxes, \neven if one is a billionaire.\n  Let's go with the Reid bill. It is fair. It is the right course. I \nhope the Senate adopts it and we get enough votes--60 votes--to get \nthis passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I have filed an amendment to extend \nfor 1 year the individual income tax provisions of the 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief acts for all Americans, but with a surtax of two percent on \nthose earning $1 million or more, coupled with a ``carve-out'' to \nprotect our nation's small businesses.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has warned us that the ``fiscal \ncliff'' created by the expiration of current tax rates on December 31, \ncoupled with ill-advised and deep cuts in defense spending that would \nresult from ``sequestration,'' would likely result in a recession in \nthe first half of next year. It makes no sense and should be \nunacceptable to all of us to allow our country to go over this ``fiscal \ncliff.''\n  I have long urged that we begin the debate on comprehensive tax \nreform aimed at creating a simpler, fairer, pro-growth tax code. I also \nbelieve that multimillionaires and billionaires can afford to pay more \nto help us deal with our unsustainable deficit.\n  My amendment would, therefore, impose a 2 percent surtax on \nmillionaires, with a carve-out to protect small business owners who pay \ntaxes through the individual income tax system. Our Nation's small \nbusinesses must not be lumped-in with millionaires and billionaires. \nThe ``carve-out'' I am proposing would shield small businesses owners \nfrom tax increases intended to fall on the very wealthy.\n  These small business owner-operators are on the front lines of our \neconomy, and of the communities in which they live. The income that \nshows up on their tax returns is critical to their ability to create \njobs, finance investment, and grow their businesses. Left in their \nhands, this income will lead to more jobs and buy the tools that help \nAmerican workers compete.\n  Congress still could tackle tax reform this year but, unfortunately, \nthis is not likely. That is why, in my amendment, I propose extending \nthe current individual tax rates for all Americans through 2013, to \ngive us the time we need to consider and adopt comprehensive reform \nthat results in a simpler, fairer, pro-growth Tax Code. The surtax on \nthe very wealthy, combined with protection for small businesses, will \nhelp us begin to deal with the deficit without harming the job creation \nengine of our economy--small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                  Honoring Ghana's President John Atta\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to express my \nsympathy and condolences to the people of Ghana and to the family of \nits President, John Adam Mills.\n  President Mills died in a military hospital today in Accra, Ghana, of \nthroat cancer. Four hours after his death, the Vice President was sworn \nin as the new President of Ghana, a testimony to the democratization of \nthat country and its leadership on the continent of Africa.\n  Ghana has been one of the shining beacons of light in Africa for its \ntransition to business, trade, prosperity, and economic development. \nJohn Adam Mills deserves the credit for taking Ghana to the height it \nhas gone to today.\n  Senator Coons from Delaware and I traveled to Ghana last year to meet \nwith President Mills. We saw firsthand how he has developed a large-\nscale oil-producing country in Ghana, making that wealth come back to \nbe reinvested in the people of that country. We visited the Millennium \nChallenge Compact that Ghana made with the United States of America to \nhelp her pineapple plantation producers be able to extend the life of \ntheir pineapple and export them into Europe for increased trade and \nagriculture in Ghana. We visited hospitals, where money from the oil \nand petroleum the country has discovered is now being reinvested in \nthat country and in her people.\n  Today, with his tragic death, we also saw the light of democracy as \nthe government made its transition, the Vice President ascended to the \nPresidency, and elections will be held later in the year for the next \nPresident of Ghana.\n  But it is important to pause as a tribute to President Bush and \nCondoleezza Rice, to President Obama and Hillary Clinton, our Secretary \nof State, who have worked tirelessly during the past decade and a half \nto work with the countries of Africa to develop. Americans have \ninvested in PEPFAR, and we have reduced the growth of\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\nAIDS. We have invested in malaria prevention, and we have reduced the \ngrowth of malaria. Nigeria is the last place on Earth where polio \nexists, and it is about to be eradicated because of the investment of \nthe American people.\n  I have said oftentimes as the ranking member of the African \nSubcommittee that Africa is the continent of the 21st century for our \ncountry, and I think it is. I think the investment our taxpayers have \nmade and the investment our last President and our current President \nand both Secretaries of State have made are paying great dividends.\n  But it is important for us to pay tribute to those bold, brave \nAfrican leaders who ran for office to promote democracy, who served and \nreinvested the profits they made in their country's wealth and their \npeople and shine as beacons of light for hope on what has been known in \nthe past as the Dark Continent.\n  In this sad moment for the people of Africa, and particularly the \npeople of Ghana, it is time for us also to rejoice on what democracy \nhas made in that country, and what John Adam Mills did to produce that \ndemocracy and to make it work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Honoring the Life and Legacy of Dr. Sally Ride\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Dr. Sally Ride, the first American woman to enter space and \nwho passed away, sadly, this week.\n  A truly extraordinary woman and an American icon and hero, Sally was \na trailblazer who, with a steadfast fortitude and an insatiable spirit \nof exploration, accomplished what no other female in American history \nhad before. When she rocketed into the heavens aboard the Space Shuttle \nChallenger on June 18, 1983, she also soared into the hearts of \nmillions of Americans, including myself. Indeed, we recognized in her \nlandmark achievement the realization of the quintessential American \ndream--that anyone, regardless of their gender, can succeed to even the \ngreatest of heights, even if it is the stars.\n  I was fortunate enough to have been present at Cape Canaveral--along \nwith my good friend and colleague then-Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski--\non that historic June morning when Sally took to the skies. I can \nvividly recall the palpable optimism and unabated excitement that \nsaturated the air. At that point, I had been a member of the House of \nRepresentatives for 4 years and was 1 of only 23 women in Congress. You \ncan imagine the tremendous amount of pride we all felt in witnessing \nsuch a watershed moment.\n  Indeed, it was a triumphant pinnacle in the fight to topple gender \nbarriers and a progressive stride in the movement to shatter oppressive \nsocial norms. It was a bold response to those who could only see so far \nas to ask her before the flight, ``Will you wear makeup in space? Do \nyou cry on the job?'' It was a bright beacon of hope to millions of \nyoung girls across the country, and indeed the world, who would come to \nrecognize Sally Ride as the embodiment of their most fervent hopes and \ndreams.\n  I was very proud to be able to participate in a tribute at the Air \nand Space Museum as cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Women's \nIssues a month later to pay tribute to Dr. Sally Ride and the entire \nChallenger crew, where I expressed to them that ``their achievement is \nAmerica's achievement.''\n  In fact, in a testament to the depth of her remarkable character, \nSally Ride lamented the unprecedented nature of her trip when she said:\n\n       It's too bad this is such a big deal. It's too bad our \n     society isn't further along. It's time people in this country \n     realized that women can do any job they want to.\n\n  She recognized rightly that while her excursion was extraordinary, it \nshould not have been. Today, we nonetheless recognize that through her \nwords she gave voice to countless women, and through her actions she \ngave the vision and courage to seize their dreams. That is the message \nSally Ride engendered as an astronaut, as a professor, and as the \nfounder of Sally Ride Science, her namesake company which strives \ntirelessly to inspire and inform students by providing them with \ninnovative science programs and resources.\n  I had the opportunity to see Sally Ride last year. She was recounting \nwith enthusiasm the work she was doing in working with so many young \npeople across this country and sharing her commitment and her passion \nfor education and for space. I was also privileged to have Sally as a \nneighbor of mine during her time working in Washington, DC.\n  Indeed, she was a pioneer and a true American icon whose \ninspirational journey into space will long serve as an example that we \ncan accomplish anything we put our minds to. Perhaps even more \nimportantly, she bequeaths to future generations a legacy that \ntranscends her time unbounded by earthly ties. She leaves to us the \nomnipotent notion that we can and will do what is hard and that we will \nachieve what is great, regardless of who we are, and it will \nindisputably resonate for generations to come.\n  Leonardo da Vinci once observed:\n\n       When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the \n     Earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, \n     and there you will always long to return.\n\n  Well, today we fondly remember a woman who had her eyes turned \nskyward not only for herself but for the women of future generations \nwho would follow in her example and in her footsteps. We take comfort \nin knowing that the stars are now indeed where she rests, and we \ncontinue to firmly keep her family and friends in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues who \nhave been to the Senate floor earlier this afternoon to emphasize the \nimportance of getting the House to act to pass the Violence Against \nWomen Act. We have passed a bipartisan reauthorization in the Senate \nand now it is time for the House to do the same.\n  There are provisions in the Senate version of the bill that offer \ncritical protections for survivors, Native Americans, immigrants, the \nLGBT community, and for students, young women on college campuses. It \nis that importance of protecting those victims on college campuses that \nI want to specifically address this afternoon.\n  According to the Department of Justice, 25 percent of college women--\nthat is 1 in 4--will be victims of rape or attempted rape before they \ngraduate within their 4-year college period. The Rape, Abuse, and \nIncest National Network reports that college-aged women are four times \nmore likely than any other age group to face sexual assault. In \naddition, experts believe that rape and sexual assault are among the \nmost underreported crimes, so that one in four could be even greater.\n  In the Senate-passed legislation, the Leahy-Crapo bill, there are \nprovisions to address the challenges that young women face on college \ncampuses. The legislation we passed here in the Senate requires schools \nthat receive VAWA funds to do the following: State the policies and \nprocedures that are in place to protect victims and provide prevention \neducation for all incoming students. Many young girls arrive on a \ncollege campus to live on their own for the very first time. They are \nstruggling to orient themselves in a new environment, and this makes \nthem vulnerable. They need to be given clear guidance about what to do \nin case they become victims.\n  The legislation also requires institutions to implement a coordinated \nresponse both internal and external to the campus. This means that \nsurvivors are helped if they want to hold their attackers accountable, \nwhether through a process that the university has set up or by bringing \ncriminal charges and working with the police. This provision tells \nyoung women they are not alone; they are supported and their school \nwill help them.\n  The third part of the provision that is very important in the Senate-\npassed bill is that it would require schools to provide training on \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking for \ncampus law enforcement\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\nand to members of the campus judicial boards.\n  Last week in New Hampshire my office spoke with Forrest Seymour, the \nsexual assault prevention coordinator at Keene State College, which is \na small college with about 6,000 students in the western part of New \nHampshire. Forrest said that all of these provisions in the Senate-\npassed bill are very important and necessary because universities need \nmore guidance about how to best serve students who are victims of rape, \ndating violence, and stalking. This is especially important at small \nuniversities such as Keene where they have limited resources.\n  Training for campus law enforcement is critical because they are the \nfirst responders. School administrators who serve on campus judicial \nboards also need special training because word spreads very fast on \ncollege campuses about whether survivors should feel comfortable going \nforward. These processes need to be handled with appropriate \nsensitivity, and the training that is required by the Senate Violence \nAgainst Women Act will help make sure these young women feel safe.\n  The Senate-passed version of the bill will help young women like \nHarmony, who began her first year in college at Plymouth State \nUniversity in New Hampshire in 2006. She was excited to be there. She \nmade new friends, and she quickly became comfortable in her new \nsurroundings.\n  Unfortunately, one night someone she thought was a friend took \nadvantage of that trust and sexually assaulted Harmony. Harmony was \nashamed and confused. She felt violated. She began to question all of \nher new relationships. She was scared all of the time, and she was sure \neveryone could tell she was a victim, so Harmony didn't tell anyone. \nShe didn't know where to turn. She was scared that she would not be \nbelieved, and she even considered dropping out of school.\n  Fortunately, Harmony did finally reach out and found support. She \ngraduated from Plymouth and now she works as a case manager for \nsurvivors of domestic violence in an emergency shelter helping other \nsurvivors through the most difficult periods in their lives. Harmony \nshares her story all over the country, encouraging victims to come \nforward, promising them they will be believed, they will be supported.\n  If Harmony has the bravery and the courage to make these promises to \nsurvivors, so should we. We owe it to the young and vulnerable women on \ncollege campuses across this country to pass the Violence Against Women \nAct now. It is time for the House to act. The session is running out. \nWe need to see this legislation reauthorized. We need to see the Senate \nversion reauthorized so we can guarantee to young women such as Harmony \nacross this country that they will get the support they need.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as does the Presiding Officer, \nI come to the floor this evening with a heavy heart. I know that as \nSenators and leaders we are expected to have words for every occasion, \nbut what happened last Friday morning makes it very difficult to bring \nforth words that are appropriate. However, as I think of the Coloradans \nwho were there whom we are so lucky to represent, their actions spoke \nlouder than words. Their actions spoke very loudly on Friday morning in \nthe city of Aurora.\n  I wish to focus on the actions of those brave, decent Coloradans who \nwere victims in a variety of ways at the horrific movie theater \nshooting that took place there in Aurora. It cut short the lives of 12 \npeople. It injured approximately 58 others. I rise to pay tribute to \nall of those people as well as to their families and their loved ones. \nI think I know the Presiding Officer, my colleague and my fellow \nSenator from Colorado, knows that, most importantly, we are here to \nstate emphatically that Aurora will triumph over adversity in our State \nof Colorado to emerge stronger than ever.\n  From the time I awoke to the news of the movie theater shootings in \nAurora early Friday morning, July 20, I, along with the rest of \nColorado and our country, have experienced emotions ranging from deep, \nprofound sadness to, frankly, utter outrage. Our State was just \nstarting to recover from the devastating wildfires that destroyed \nhundreds of homes, forced tens of thousands to evacuate their \ncommunities, and scorched thousands of acres in our beautiful State of \nColorado. With that in mind, none of us could have been prepared for \nthe news of these mass shootings in one of our communities.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has three beautiful daughters. I have \ntwo children. I know that having loved ones stolen from us in such a \ntragic and violent fashion is something for which one can never be \nprepared. But it is during these times we are also reminded to cherish \nthose all-too-brief moments we have with the people we love.\n  Although this heinous crime may have shaken us, it did not break us, \nand it will not break us. We will mourn those we have lost and those \nwho were injured, and with them in mind we will heal and we will become \nstronger.\n  Sadly, this kind of tragedy is not new to Colorado. It was 13 short \nyears ago that we learned of another mass shooting at Columbine High \nSchool on the western side of Denver. As a nation, we are reminded of \nmore recent shootings at Virginia Tech; Fort Hood, TX; and Tucson, AZ. \nThese incidents may occur in one city or in one State, but they are \nnational tragedies that tear at us all and then cause us all to tear up \nand cry together.\n  Like all Americans, my heart goes out to the victims and their \nfamilies. I also remain hopeful--the Presiding Officer and I went to \none of the hospitals--that the survivors are going to defy the odds on \ntheir road to recovery. We have been truly inspired by their stories.\n  I wish to take a moment and applaud the leadership shown by \nColorado's public servants, from Governor John Hickenlooper, Aurora \nMayor Steve Hogan, and especially Chief of Police Dan Oates and the \nAurora Police Department. There are also other metro area law \nenforcement professionals who came to the scene almost immediately, \nincluding first responders, and medical professionals on site and at \nthe number of hospitals where the victims were taken.\n  I think what is most notable is that they worked seamlessly to carry \nout the city's disaster plan and protect the victims from further harm. \nThe police and firefighters arrived a mere 90 seconds after the first \n9-1-1 call was placed. There is no question that lives were saved by \nthe swift and coordinated action of Aurora's first responders.\n  I have to say that this incident shows what similar tragedies have \nbefore: that America shines brightest when the night is darkest, and \nthat was literally the situation at midnight on Friday morning in \nAurora.\n  We had the uplifting experience of hearing the stories of bravery \ncoming out of Aurora. We marveled at those stories on Sunday. We start \nwith the fact that at least four young men demonstrated the heights of \nheroism when they sacrificed their lives to protect their girlfriends \nfrom the hail of this gunman's bullets. One young woman had the courage \nto remain by the side of her wounded friend, calmly applying pressure \nto her friend's bleeding neck wound while dialing 9-1-1 with her other \nhand as the gunfire continued around her. Let me put it this way: Lives \nwere saved Friday morning by those who did not let fear override their \ncapacity to care for one another.\n  These experiences have underlined for me and our entire Nation that \nwhat makes us great and will help us endure this tragedy is our people. \nI saw that Sunday night, as did the Presiding Officer, while \nparticipating in a moving vigil in Aurora where our community not only \nmourned together but also held together during this most difficult \ntime. Although the West is known for its rugged individuals, Colorado \nis also known for its rugged cooperators--people who help their \nneighbors in times of adversity. We saw that after the recent \nwildfires, and we see it again now.\n  President Obama's visit with victims and families on July 22--just \nSunday--2 days ago in Aurora, provided comfort\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\nand support to those in need and again reminded us that the sanctity \nand strength of family and community is what unites us in the face of \nadversity. Coloradans have seen that in the wake of this tragedy, our \nNation has come together for Aurora and our State, and to my colleagues \nand anyone listening today, let me say humbly that we are grateful.\n  I wish to take a moment to say the names of the 12 people who were \ntaken from us too soon. I know that later my colleague will share even \nmore of their stories with us and with the Nation. Their families and \nfriends have my commitment that we will, to honor these good people, \nthese Coloradans, never forget them as the healing process goes on.\n  The 12 Coloradans, the Americans whom we lost Friday morning are \nJonathan T. Blunk, Alexander J. Boik, Jesse Childress, Gordon Cowden, \nJessica Ghawi, Micayla Medek, Matthew McQuinn, John Larimer, Alex M. \nSullivan, Alexander Teves, Rebecca Wingo, and I think the hardest name \nfor all of us to say is that of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. I \nsmile in my sadness because I think the Presiding Officer has seen the \nphoto of her with an ice cream cone in hand, delight on her face, ice \ncream on her nose. I guess maybe what we could do is take the time to \nenjoy an ice cream cone, maybe leave that ice cream on our nose for a \nlittle bit, and remember her.\n  In honor of these victims, I have submitted a resolution--S. Con. \nRes. 53--along with my colleague, the Presiding Officer, Senator \nBennet. Congressman Perlmutter has filed an identical resolution in the \nHouse of Representatives. The resolution, among many things, strongly \ncondemns the atrocities which occurred in Aurora; offers condolences to \nthe families, friends, and loved ones of those who were killed in the \nattack and expresses hope for the rapid and complete recovery of the \nwounded; applauds the hard work and dedication exhibited by the \nhundreds of local, State, and Federal officials and others who offered \ntheir support and assistance; and last but certainly not least, honors \nthe resilience of the community of the city of Aurora and the State of \nColorado in the face of such adversity. I ask all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to support Aurora and support this resolution.\n  As we pay tribute to our fallen fellow Americans and the heroes \naround them, here is what I hope will come out of what can only be \ndescribed as a senseless tragedy: We must harness the sense of \ncommunity we feel this week and use it to create a lasting sense of \ncollaboration in America and use it to solve our shared challenges in a \nmeasured, respectful, and thoughtful way. We can truly learn from those \nwho selflessly gave of themselves during the chaos of the Aurora \nshootings and draw from it the strength to be better people, better \nfamily members, and, yes, even better legislators.\n  In Roman mythology, Aurora is the goddess of the dawn who renews \nherself each morning. At dawn on Friday, the chaos and the pain and the \ntragedy of the night before still lingered over that wonderful city of \nAurora, but by dawn on the second day, signs of heroism, of recovery, \nof community began to shine through the darkness of the great Colorado \ncity called Aurora.\n  As each dawn signals a new day, we owe it to the victims to rise to \nthe occasion and renew our commitment to make this a better, stronger, \nand more perfect Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to first thank my friend--and \nI do not mean that in the political sense, I mean it in the real \nsense--the senior Senator from Colorado, the Presiding Officer from \nColorado, for his incredibly thoughtful remarks about the tragedy last \nweek in Colorado. I cannot think of any more fitting place to be than \nhere with the Senator tonight to have this conversation. So I thank the \nSenator very much for his words.\n  In just a few dark moments last week, in Aurora, CO, 12 innocent \nlives were taken from us--12 people, full of life and aspirations, \nloved by family and friends, and now 12 people remembered by an entire \nnation.\n  As the Presiding Officer said, thousands of Coloradans attended a \nvigil hosted by the city of Aurora on Sunday evening. We shared tears \nand prayers. We also resolved to support one another, to heal, and to \nalways remember those who lost their lives on July 20, 2012. It is for \nthat purpose that the Presiding Officer and I come to the floor this \nevening.\n  The first is Jonathan Blunk, age 26. Jon was a father of two who \nmoved to Colorado in 2009, after three tours in the Persian Gulf and \nNorth Arabian Sea for the U.S. Navy. He was a certified firefighter and \nEMT. Jon lost his life protecting his friend Jansen Young from the \ngunman's line of fire. Jon shielded her from gunfire by pushing her to \nthe ground while shots were fired. He was supposed to fly on Saturday \nto Nevada to see his wife Chantel Blunk and his 4-year-old daughter and \n2-year-old son. Instead, his wife had to put up the dress her daughter \nhad picked out to wear to the airport. She told her daughter that they \nwould not see their dad anymore but that he would still love them and \nlook over them. His daughter Hailey is comforted by calling her \nfather's cell phone and hearing him on voice mail.\n  This is Alexander Jonathan ``A.J.'' Boik, age 18. A.J. recently \ngraduated from Gateway High School. He enjoyed baseball, music, and \nmaking pottery. A.J. was to start art classes at the Rocky Mountain \nCollege of Art and Design in the fall. He was described ``as being the \nlife of the party. AJ could bring a smile to anybody's face.'' He was a \nyoung man with a warm and loving heart.\n  This is Jesse Childress, age 29. Jesse was an Air Force cyber systems \noperator based at Buckley Air Force Base. He loved to play flag \nfootball, softball, and bowl. He was a devoted fan of the Denver \nBroncos, for which he secured season tickets. He was described by his \nsuperior officer as an invaluable part of the 310th family who touched \neveryone with whom he worked.\n  This is Gordon Cowden, age 51. Gordon was originally from Texas and \nlived in Aurora with his family. He was ``a quick witted world traveler \nwith a keen sense of humor, he will be remembered for his devotion to \nhis children and for always trying to do the right thing, no matter the \nobstacle.'' Gordon took his two teenage children to the theater the \nnight of the shooting, both of whom, thankfully, made it out unharmed.\n  This is Jessica Ghawi, age 24. Jessica was an aspiring journalist, \nmost recently interning with Mile High Sports Radio in Denver, and went \nby the nickname ``Redfield.'' She was hard working and ambitious, with \na generous spirit and kind heart. When numerous homes were recently \ndestroyed by Colorado wildfires, Jessica decided to start collecting \nhockey equipment to donate to the kids affected because she wanted to \nhelp.\n  This is John Thomas Larimer, age 27. John was a cryptologic \ntechnician with the Navy based also at Buckley Air Force Base--a job \nthat requires ``exceptionally good character and skills.'' Originally \nfrom Chicago, he was the youngest of five siblings and had joined the \nservice just over a year ago. Like his father and grandfather, John \nchose to serve in the U.S. Navy. John's superior officer called him \n``an outstanding shipmate, a valued member of the Navy and an extremely \ndedicated sailor.'' Colleagues were drawn to his calming demeanor and \nexceptional work ethic. He was also known as an extremely competent \nprofessional.\n  This is Matthew McQuinn, age 27. Matt died while protecting his \ngirlfriend Samantha Yowler by jumping in front of her during the \nshooting. Matt and Samantha moved to Colorado from Ohio last fall and \nworked at Target. He and Samantha were very much in love and planning \ntheir life together. Because of Matt's bravery, Samantha was only \nwounded in the knee and is expected to make a full recovery.\n  This is Micayla ``Cayla'' Medek, age 23. Cayla was a graduate of \nWilliam C. Hinkley High School in Aurora and a resident of Westminster. \nShe worked at Subway and was a huge Green Bay\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\nPackers fan. Cayla would plan weekend activities around watching the \ngames with her brother and father. She is remembered as a loving and \ngentle young woman.\n  This is Veronica Moser-Sullivan, age 6. Veronica had just learned to \nswim and attended Holly Ridge Elementary School in Denver, CO. She was \na good student who loved to play dress-up and read. Veronica's mother \nAshley Moser remains in critical condition at Aurora Medical Center. \nShe was shot in the neck and abdomen. We pray for Ashley's recovery and \nstrength in working through the passing of her daughter Veronica.\n  This is Alex Sullivan, age 27. Alex was at the movie celebrating his \n27th birthday and first wedding anniversary. He loved comic books, the \nNew York Mets, and movies. Alex was such a big movie fan that he took \njobs at theaters just to see the movies. Alex stood 6 feet 4 inches and \nweighed about 280 pounds. He played football and wrestled before \ngraduating high school in 2003 and later went to culinary school. Alex \nwas known as a gentle giant and loved by many.\n  This is Alexander C. Teves, age 24. Alex received an M.A. in \ncounseling psychology from the University of Denver in June and was \nplanning on becoming a psychiatrist. He also competed in the Tough \nMudder, an intense endurance challenge, and helped students with \nspecial needs. Alex was at the theater on the night of the shooting \nwith his girlfriend Amanda Lindgren. When the gunman opened fire, Alex \nimmediately lunged to block Amanda from the gunfire, held her down, and \ncovered her head.\n  This is Rebecca Wingo, age 32. Rebecca, originally from Texas and a \nresident of Aurora, joined the Air Force after high school, where she \nbecame fluent in Mandarin Chinese and served as a translator. She was a \nsingle mother of two girls and worked as a customer relations \nrepresentative at a mobile medical imaging company. Rebecca was also \nenrolled at the Community College of Aurora since the fall of 2009 and \nhad been working toward an associate of arts degree. She was known to \nfamily and friends as a ``gentle, sweet, beautiful soul.''\n  Here is a photo of the gathering we had last Sunday night in Aurora. \nI believe, like you, Mr. President, that the early morning hours of \nJuly 20, 2012, will not be remembered for the evil that happened.\n  Scripture tells us ``not to be overcome by evil, but overcome evil \nwith good.'' That is what the people of Aurora and Colorado have been \ndoing since the first moment of this tragedy, and that is what we will \ncontinue to do.\n  In time, we will not remember the morning of July 20 for the evil \nthat killed 12 innocent and precious people. Instead, we will remember \nthe bright lives of those we lost and the families they leave behind. \nWe will remember the 58 wounded survivors, whose recovery bears witness \nto humanity's strength and resolve. And tonight, knowing that some are \nstill in critical condition, we pray for their recovery. We will \nremember the heroic acts of everyday citizens, our first responders, \nand medical personnel who saved lives that otherwise surely would have \nbeen lost. We will remember the continuing generosity of those \nColoradans and Americans who are donating blood in record numbers and \nraising funds to support the families in this trying time. And in time, \nbecause we are all Aurora, we will draw strength from the example set \nby one great American city and the faith of her people in one another.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5298-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Marine Corps LCpl Hunter H.D. Hogan. Lance Corporal Hogan was \nkilled in action while supporting combat operations in Afghanistan on \nJune 23, 2012.\n  Lance Corporal Hogan cultivated a desire to serve our Nation at an \nearly age, and he followed in his father's footsteps when he enlisted \nin the Marine Corps on October 26, 2009. He, like so many young \nmarines, could have pursued other opportunities outside of the \nmilitary, but he instead chose to take an oath of service to our great \ncountry. He was rightfully proud of this oath and remained faithful to \nthe mission and to his brothers in arms.\n  The Hogan family laid their marine to rest in York, NE, on July 6, \n2012. Lance Corporal Hogan served with honor and valor having been \nawarded the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Hunter is mourned by his wife Brittney, his father, mother, \ngrandparents, and so many others. I know his family is proud of him and \nwill always remember his spirit and his quick wit. His sense of \nadventure and his enthusiasm for rodeo, hunting, and fishing will also \nbe fondly remembered. Hunter's passion for life and those around him \nallowed him to be the best marine he could be.\n  Strong marines are not possible without the support of family. \nHunter's family chose a quote by Senator Paul H. Douglas to describe \ntheir young marine's passion for the Corps.\n\n       Those of us who have had the privilege of serving in the \n     Marine Corps value our experience as among the most precious \n     of our lives. The fellowship of shared hardships and dangers \n     in worthy cause creates a close bond of comradeship. It is \n     the basic reason for the cohesiveness of Marines and for the \n     pride we have in our Corps and our loyalty to each other.\n\n  We hold our heads high when we speak of the strong tradition of \nmilitary service in our great State of Nebraska. We are honored to call \nhim one of our own, and I know Nebraskans across the State will provide \nhis family with care and love during this very difficult time.\n  May God bless the Hogan family and all of our service men and women \nboth home and abroad. LCpl Hunter Hogan, forever a marine, forever a \ncowboy, Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5298-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5298-S5299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING OFFICER CHESTNUT AND DETECTIVE GIBSON\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the nation is mourning the senseless \nloss of 12 people in Aurora CO, and the wounding of 58 people.\n  Today, we mark the sad anniversary of another tragedy that took place \nin the Capitol on July 27, 1998.\n  We remember Officer Jacob J.J. Chestnut, from Ft. Washington in my \nhome State of Maryland and Special Agent John Gibson, of Woodbridge, \nVA, who gave their lives to protect the U.S. Capitol, all the people \nwho work at and visit the Capitol, and to protect this building that is \nthe symbol of freedom and democracy the world over.\n  Today, we honor the lives and heroism of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson. We also commend all the Capitol Hill police officers \nwho put their lives on the line to protect democracy.\n  These two fine men were part of one of the most unique police forces \nin the country. They are excellent Federal law-enforcement officials \nwho protect Members of Congress from crooks, terrorists, or anyone else \nwho would want to harm us, and they also protect all the people in the \nbuilding, whether it is a foreign dignitary or a Girl Scout troop from \nIowa.\n  Second, they are also ``Officer Friendly''--welcoming people and \nanswering questions; and many have taken special language training to \nhelp visitors from around the world.\n  Third, many are also trained for other possible emergencies: to \nprovide basic paramedic help in the case of an ill tourist, or to \nprovide basic fire-fighting and help evacuate buildings in the case of \nfires.\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n  These police are like our own ``Cops on the Beat.''\n  Finally, so many of the Capitol Hill Police Officers are my Maryland \nconstituents, just like J.J. Chestnut.\n  Officer Chestnut was always one of the stars: trained as an MP in the \nmilitary, he was with the Capitol Police for 18 years and was known for \nhaving a unique touch with tourists and constituents. We were very \nproud of him, and he was even nominated at one time for Capitol Police \nOfficer of the Year.\n  And I know how proud we were of Detective Gibson as well: he was from \njust across the river in Virginia. He was a true hero--stopping the \ngunman from entering the building.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in the Senate in marking this sad \nanniversary and in paying respect to the families of Officer Chestnut \nand Detective Gibson. They were heroes that sad day in 1998, and they \nare heroes for today and all eternity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5299-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FDA SAFETY AND INNOVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I rise to say a few words about \nthe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, legislation \nCongress passed with strong bipartisan support just before we returned \nhome to our States for the Fourth of July.\n  This bill was a big one. It was a big bill with complex provisions \nand an essential purpose: to safeguard the public, to protect patients \nand encourage innovation and invention, which are so important to \ntreating and curing diseases in this country as well as other problems. \nAnd this measure was revolutionary in many ways. It contained complex, \nnew provisions, provisions that we must make sure are implemented as \nCongress intended.\n  I was proud to work on many parts of this bill with my colleagues, \nincluding title VIII of this legislation, to generate new antibiotics \nto treat emerging serious and life threatening superbug infections. I \nwant to clarify two points for the record on this legislation: I want \nto be clear that pathogens identified in this title are illustrative, \nnot all-inclusive. There are many deadly pathogens that we may not even \nknow of yet; title VIII is intended to spur innovation against all \nsuperbug infections as soon as they arise. And, I want to be clear, \nlanguage in section 801(b) is not intended to prohibit or preclude \ninnovative drug products that will spur the antibiotic pipeline, so \nlong as they meet the definition for a qualified infectious disease \nproduct.\n  FDA approval of new antibiotics has decreased by 70 percent since the \nmid-1980s, yet reports from the CDC suggest that resistant MRSA \ninfection deaths are now at more than 17,000 lives lost in the United \nStates each year--more than AIDS. Resistant infections have now been \nelevated to one of the World Health Organization's top three threats to \nhuman health. It is my sincere hope that title VIII will spur \nproduction of the weapons we need to fight this threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5299-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FISCAL YEAR 2013 APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of Senate debate and passage of the fiscal year 2013 \nappropriations bills.\n  I want to begin by commending both Chairman Inouye and Vice-Chair \nCochran for their leadership on the Appropriations Committee. In what \nhas been largely a bipartisan process, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has approved 9 of the 12 funding bills so far. A lot of hard \nwork on both sides has gone into putting these bills together.\n  As ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development, Senator Murray and I \nworked closely together to craft a truly bipartisan fiscal year 2013 \nappropriations bill. The T-HUD bill strikes a balance between \nthoughtful investment and fiscal restraint. In fact, this bill honors \nan allocation that is nearly $14.5 billion below fiscal year 2010 \nlevels, a 22-percent reduction. These deep cuts reflect an even deeper \ncommitment to getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I am proud of the work that went into this bill and the strong \nbipartisan vote this past April to report it out of committee. Like the \nT-HUD bill, the Agriculture; Commerce, Justice, and Science; Energy and \nWater; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; State and Foreign \nOperations; and Department of Homeland Security bills have all been \nreported with overwhelming bipartisan support. In putting together \nthese bills, the Appropriations Committee functioned the way committees \nare supposed to: we worked together to develop thoughtful and \nresponsible bills that could be recommended for the full Senate for \nconsideration.\n  As such, I was very disappointed to hear the majority leader's recent \nannouncement that not one of the 12 appropriations bills would be \nbrought to the Senate floor until after the election, virtually \nguaranteeing that we end up with a continuing resolution or catch-all \nomnibus that the full Senate has not had an opportunity to properly \nvet. I hope he will reconsider in light of our commitment to work with \nhim to develop a workable and fair process for considering these bills.\n  Given the immense workload that we have before the end of the year--\nincluding enacting appropriations bills and preventing the so-called \nfiscal cliff, when enormous tax hikes and indiscriminate cuts to \ndefense spending are set to kick in--I am disappointed that we have \nspent much of July haggling over proposals that never really stood a \nchance of going anywhere.\n  I understand that the majority leader has said that he doesn't want \nto bring the bills to the floor because the House is writing its bills \nto a lower level, but we have a process to deal with disagreements. It \nis called a conference. The Senate Appropriations Committee has \nreported several bipartisan bills that are ready for floor \nconsideration. Why not bring them to the floor, allow Senators to offer \namendments, and let the Senate work its will on this important \nconstitutional responsibility?\n  As our Nation's economy struggles to recover, it is important that we \ncomplete appropriations bills on time and through regular order. It is \nimportant for the Senate as an institution that we proceed. It is also \nimportant for the American people to see that we can work together in \nan open and bipartisan manner to establish priorities, make hard \ndecisions, and complete the work that the Constitution requires of us.\n  Last November, I joined Chairman Murray as well as Chairmen Kohl and \nMikulski and Ranking Members Blunt and Hutchison to usher the first \ngroup of fiscal year 2012 spending bills to final passage, avoiding a \nlong-term continuing resolution for fiscal year 2012. It is my hope \nthat we will build on last year's success and bring the fiscal year \n2013 appropriations bill to the floor to be considered through a \nsimilarly open and transparent process.\n  These bills make investments that not only create jobs now when they \nare needed most but also establish the foundations for future growth. \nJust as important to our economic future, however, is reigning in \nFederal spending; we must strike the right balance between thoughtful \ninvestments and fiscal restraint, thereby setting the stage for future \neconomic growth. Uncertainty only makes matters worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5299-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5299-S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHRIS BOHJALIAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont boasts many talented artists, \ncreators, composers and authors. Not least among them is Chris \nBohjalian of Lincoln, an accomplished writer whose recent novel, The \nSandcastle Girls, is drawing the praise and accolades of critics and \nreaders alike. Marcelle and I were inspired by the story Chris has \ncommitted to the printed page; it is a novel that I believe will secure \nhis place among the most accomplished writers of the 21st Century.\n  I read with interest an interview with Chris published in Vermont's \nBurlington Free Press on July 15. Like many artists and authors, Chris \ndrew from his own heritage in his case, Armenian--to pen a moving story \nof compaslion and perseverance amid horror and tragedy. Perhaps this is \nwhy he has called The Sandcastle Girls the ``most important book'' he \nwill ever write.\n  Chris is a longtime friend, and I have always enjoyed reading his \nworks. The Sandcastle Girls is an achievement that stands apart and \nwill deeply affect its readers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article, \n``The\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nMost Important Book I Will Ever Write.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 15, 2012]\n\n ``The most important book I will ever write''--Bohjalian talks about \n                         `The Sandcastle Girls'\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       Chris Bohjalian is a novelist who lives in Lincoln. \n     Bohjalian, 51, writes a Sunday column for the Burlington Free \n     Press. ``The Sandcastle Girls,'' his 14th novel, comes out \n     Tuesday. In a recent conversation with Free Press reporter \n     Sally Pollak, Bohjalian said ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is the \n     most important novel he will ever write. He said, as well, he \n     thinks it's the best book he's ever written.\n       ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is set in Aleppo, Syria, during \n     the Armenian genocide, nearly a century in the past. The \n     story centers around a young American woman, Elizabeth \n     Endicott, who travels to the Middle East to assist Armenian \n     refugees. She befriends (and aids) a group of interesting \n     people, and falls in love with an Armenian engineer who has \n     suffered devastating losses.\n       The book is narrated by a contemporary American novelist of \n     Armenian heritage, Laura Petrosian. Bohjalian says Petrosian \n     is a female version of himself.\n        BFP: What compelled you to write this book?\n       CB: This is the second time I've tried to write about the \n     Armenian genocide. I tried to write about it when I finished \n     ``Water Witches,'' prior to writing ``Midwives.'' I wrote an \n     entire novel called ``Sugar Daddy.'' Terrible book, never \n     published.\n       Not only was it a terrible, terrible book, but about this \n     time Carol Edgarian wrote ``Rise the Euphrates'' about the \n     Armenian genocide.\n       And I remember thinking to myself, Why does the world need \n     my book when it has ``Rise the Euphrates?''\n       Rather than try to save the novel I went onto my next \n     project, a novel about a midwife who dies in childbirth, and \n     wrote that book instead.\n       I was about 100 pages into the manuscript about the \n     Sandcastle girls when Mark Mustian published his interesting \n     and marvelous novel about the genocide, ``The Gendarme.'' \n     Once again I thought the world doesn't need my novel.\n       But I was so emotionally invested in these characters, I \n     cared so much about the story, that I soldiered on and \n     finished it. I'm really glad I did. I love this novel. \n     Elizabeth Endicott, Nevart and Hatoun are my three favorite \n     female characters, along with Sibyl Danfroth in ``Midwives,'' \n     that I've ever written.\n       BFP: ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is a mystery, a love story \n     and a narrative of war. How do you approach writing a novel \n     that weaves together these themes?\n       CB: Those elements are woven together through the \n     characters. I know when I read a novel, I'm interested in \n     characters I care about. And so when I began this book I \n     began with the people, I began with the characters. And I do \n     care so deeply about the characters in this book, especially \n     those women.\n       BFP: How did you come up with ``the compound'' in your \n     novel, the setting for much of the action and the place where \n     many of your characters live?\n       CB: Partly, I was simply after historical authenticity: \n     Where would Elizabeth Endicott, an American, be living? Then, \n     however, I saw the importance of the juxtaposition of where \n     Elizabeth lays her head at night compared to where the \n     refugees who are coming from the desert are sleeping. The \n     square of the citadel is an innermost ring of Dante's \n     inferno, compared to the compound.\n       BFP: Did you know when you started writing the book how you \n     were going to resolve it?\n       CB: I never know where my books are going when I begin \n     them. I depend upon my characters to take me by the hand and \n     lead me through the dark of the story. I didn't know this \n     novel was even going to have a component that was mysterious \n     when I began it. All I knew was that I wanted to examine what \n     my narrator calls the ``Slaughter You Know Next to Nothing \n     About.''\n       BFP: Can you describe the sense of responsibility or \n     obligation you might have felt writing a novel that would \n     tell people something about this mass killing, now a century \n     in the past?\n       CB: I know in my heart this is the most important book I'm \n     ever going to write. I'm telling a story that is not known \n     but was precedent-setting for some of the most horrific \n     tragedies and crimes of the last century. There's a direct \n     line between the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, the \n     killing fields of Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda. It's a long list.\n       In 1915, there were roughly two million Armenians living in \n     the Ottoman empire. By the end of the First World War, 1.5 \n     million would be dead, three out of every four of them. In \n     1915, I had four Armenian great-grandparents. By the end of \n     that year, at least one would be dead. Both of my Armenian \n     grandparents are genocide survivors.\n       My family history is a part of that horrific global \n     narrative. So when I started this book, I began with the \n     personal. My narrator, Laura Petrosian, is a female version \n     of me. That's my grandparents' house in the novel.\n       Elizabeth Endicott and Armen Petrosian (central characters \n     in the book) are not my grandparents. They are completely \n     fictional.\n       BFP: When did your grandparents, Leo and Haigoohi \n     Bohjalian, come to this country?\n       CB: There were two points of arrival. I believe my \n     grandfather, Leo, first arrived here in 1920 but he didn't \n     stay. He went back to get my grandmother and they lived in \n     Paris until late 1927, or very early 1928.\n       BFP: What do you know about your own Armenian ancestors? \n     And how does your family's history figure into this work?\n       CB: I know almost nothing about my Armenian ancestry; I \n     know even less about my (maternal) Swedish ancestry.\n       I don't know what demons dogged my mother and father, but \n     they never talked to me about their childhoods. That's why \n     perhaps ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is a novel and not a memoir. \n     I couldn't tell you enough about my Armenian and Swedish \n     ancestors to write a memoir. I have wondered if I am going to \n     learn a lot about my (Armenian) ancestors when this book \n     comes out, which would be great.\n       My aunt believes that Haigoohi's father (Bohjalian's great-\n     grandfather) was murdered by Turkish soldiers because he \n     supplied horses to the army. They killed the Armenian and \n     took the horses.\n       The history of ``The Sandcastle Girls'' is accurate. I did \n     my research and I did my homework. I believe that Aleppo of \n     1915 (where the novel is set) is the real thing.\n       I knew so little about the Armenian genocide as a child, \n     and what my grandparents must have endured, that I saw no \n     irony in the fact that my first serious girlfriend when I was \n     13 and 14 years old was Turkish. I understood as a child that \n     my grandparents were from Armenia and were magnificently \n     exotic, by the standards of both grandparents. My mother \n     really did call their house the Ottoman Annex of the \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art. Their English, up to as late as \n     1970, was heavily accented.\n       BFP: Your father, Aram Bohjalian, died last summer, about a \n     year before the publication of ``The Sandcastle Girls.'' Did \n     you get a chance to talk to him about the book? What were his \n     feelings about the novel?\n       CB: My father's eyesight had been diminished by macular \n     degeneration for so long, he was not able to read even large-\n     print books. That photograph (of Bohjalian's father and \n     grandparents) is one of many photographs that my dad and I \n     pored over the last two years of his life. Because he was so \n     ill, I was visiting him a lot. The way I would try to take \n     his mind off the pain he was in was to get out family photo \n     albums and ask him to tell me stories, ask him to tell me \n     about the different people in the photographs. A lot of it he \n     didn't know.\n       My father, as a first generation son of immigrants, in many \n     ways distanced himself as much as he could from his Armenian \n     ancestry. He grew up in a house in Westchester County in \n     which everyone spoke Armenian or Turkish. When he started \n     kindergarten, he spoke not a single word of English. He \n     didn't even know how to ask where the bathroom was. In terms \n     of distancing himself from his Armenain ancestry, he became \n     as American as possible.\n       He was not as handsome as Don Draper in ``Mad Men'' but he \n     was a Mad Man. He was an advertising executive at large New \n     York City ad agencies.\n       I think my father knew more than he wanted to share with \n     me. He had mixed emotions about it. On the one hand, he was \n     always really proud of me; even when his eyesight was gone, \n     he loved listening to my books on audio, even the bad ones.\n       But I think he also felt that this story was too painful \n     for a novel. I remember once reminding him when we talked \n     about this that I had written novels about a woman dying in \n     childbirth, a couple who had their twin daughters washed away \n     in a flood, the Holocaust, and a domestic abuse murder-\n     suicide. And I also told him that as an Armenian-American, I \n     felt an incredible desire to write this story because it \n     feels so much a part of me.\n       BFP: Can you tell us something about your recent trip to \n     Armenia and Lebanon?\n       CB: The principal driving force that led me to Armenia was \n     the death of my father, and not simply his death but his \n     illness. The more time I spent looking at old family \n     photographs, the more time I spent seeing images of Leo and \n     Haigoohi, the more I felt this profound desire to see Mount \n     Ararat.\n       I have never in my life been outside Vermont and felt less \n     like a stranger in a strange land, than when I was in \n     Yerevan, Armenia. I was so happy there in ways I hadn't \n     expected.\n       BFP: ``The Sandcastle Girls'' will be released Tuesday. Are \n     you nervous as publication approaches?\n       CB: I've never been as emotionally invested in how people \n     respond to a book as I am with this one. Because this is the \n     most important book I will ever write. And I think it's the \n     best book I've ever written. And the reason why it's the most \n     important book is pure and simple: because it's about the \n     ``Slaughter You Know Next to Nothing About.''\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5301-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            STENNIS CENTER PROGRAM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INTERNS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, for 10 years, summer interns working \nin Congressional offices have benefitted from a program run by the John \nC. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership. This 6-week program is \ndesigned to enhance their internship experience by giving them an \ninside view of how Congress works and a deeper appreciation for the \nrole that Congress plays in our democracy. Each week, the interns meet \nwith senior congressional staff and other experts to discuss issues \nsuch as the legislative process, separation of powers, balancing \ngoverning and campaigning, political polarization, and more. My office \nhas had the benefit of hosting Stennis interns over years and I know it \ncontributes to a richer experience for all who participate.\n  Interns are selected for this program based on their college record, \ncommunity service experience, and interest in a career in public \nservice. This year, 28 outstanding interns, most of them juniors and \nseniors in college who are working in Republican and Democratic offices \nin both the House and Senate, have taken part.\n  I congratulate the interns for their involvement in this valuable \nprogram and I thank the Stennis Center and the Senior Stennis Fellows \nfor providing such a meaningful experience for these interns and for \nencouraging them to consider a future career in public service.\n  I ask that a list of 2012 Stennis Congressional Interns and the \noffices in which they work be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows.\n\n       Nick Briggs, attending Brown University, interning in the \n     office of Rep.

LOWENBERG\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Major \nGeneral Timothy J. Lowenberg for his exemplary record of service to the \nWashington National Guard, Washington State, and the United States of \nAmerica.\n  MG Timothy J. Lowenberg will retire on July 31, 2012 after a \ndistinguished career with the Washington National Guard and 44 years of \nmilitary service to this country. General Lowenberg has been the \nAdjutant General for Washington State since September 1999 and in this \nrole he has served as the commander of all Washington National Guard \nforces, Director of Washington State's Emergency Management programs, \nand Homeland Security Advisor to the Governor of Washington. Beyond \nthese already extensive responsibilities, General Lowenberg is \nrecognized nationally for his work on Homeland Security policy. In a \ndefining mark of General Lowenberg's forward-leaning leadership, he \nestablished the Washington State Domestic Security Infrastructure in \n1999, prior to the events of 9/11. This collaborative effort to \nestablish a Statewide system capable of responding to major disaster \nevents preceded the establishment of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity by several years.\n  While his list of titles would be a strong credit to any individual, \nan equally impressive aspect of General Lowenberg's career has been his \nability to provide this leadership during one of the most dynamic \nperiods of Washington State's history. During his tenure, General \nLowenberg has led Washington State in the response to 53 Governor \nEmergency Proclamations, 10 Presidential Major Disaster Declarations, \nand one Presidential Emergency Declaration. Beyond the sheer volume of \nemergencies General Lowenberg has addressed during his time as Adjutant \nGeneral, he has displayed great flexibility and a talent for adapting \nto the needs of any given situation. One of his signature \naccomplishments was working with me and others toward the establishment \nof the 2010 Olympics Security Committee and the construction of the \n2010 Olympic Coordination Center. In the years that led up to the 2010 \nVancouver Winter Olympics, General Lowenberg recognized the need for \nlocal, State, Federal, and international cooperation to ensure an \neffective and smooth response to the games. He managed to operate this \ncommittee without the benefit of a National Security Special Event \ndesignation, achieving the desired outcome without the benefit of \nadditional funding.\n  Had General Lowenberg spent his time as Adjutant General only \nresponding to emergencies and planning for disasters, he would still \nhave been able to retire as one of the most accomplished Adjutant \nGenerals in the country, but he also commanded the Washington National \nGuard during a time of war. Though it is easy to forget, our world \nlooked quite different in 2001. The servicemembers who initially \ndeployed to Afghanistan and Iraq didn't have Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected vehicles, up-armored Humvees, or even the kind of extensive \nbody armor we see today. Some National Guard members deployed to war \nzones without body armor, necessary equipment, or even vehicles. In the \nface of these hardships, General Lowenberg and the Washington National \nGuard stood fast and persevered. Over the last decade Washington Guard \nmembers have deployed and sacrificed alongside the Active-Duty military \nagain and again, and in the words of former Secretary of Defense Robert \nGates, the Washington National Guard and all State Guard members have \nchanged from, ``a strategic reserve to an integral part of the \noperational force.''\n  While these brave servicemembers were deployed, General Lowenberg \nworked with me to modernize Cold War-era benefits that no longer \nsufficiently supported the post-9/11 Guard members and their families. \nGuard members deploying in the early half of the last decade were doing \nso without the promise of adequate veterans' benefits, without \nappropriate TRICARE\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nbenefits for their families, and without the skilled behavioral health \nresources to keep pace with the toll that repeated deployments would \neventually take. General Lowenberg pushed for improved Guard member \naccess to TRICARE and VA benefits, and to make sure that Guard members \nand members of the Reserve component have improved access to the \nbehavioral health specialists they need while they are on inactive duty \nor on annual training.\n  When these Guard members came back from deployment, they came home to \na country that was well intentioned but not well prepared to receive \nthem. When Washington Guard members began returning from their first \ndeployments to Iraq, unemployment for some units was extremely high. I \nhave never accepted the premise that it is acceptable for \nservicemembers who have sacrificed so much to return home from \ndeployment and struggle to find work to support their families, and \nneither has General Lowenberg. General Lowenberg fought for funding for \nthe Yellow Ribbon Reintegration program and to expand efforts such as \nthe Washington State Joint Services Support Directorate, J9, program to \nhelp more Guard members find employment. The positive impact from these \nprograms helped the men and women of the Washington Guard find stable \nwork and these efforts became such a success that the lessons from \nthese programs have spread throughout the country. Members of the \nWashington Guard now boast an unemployment rate below the national \naverage and the work that General Lowenberg put into reducing Guard \nunemployment laid the foundation for my VOW to Hire Heroes Act and \nother efforts to help veterans access secure employment, including \noverhauling the Transition Assistance program for the first time in 20 \nyears and making it mandatory.\n  These changes to National Guard since 1999 have been historic, but \nGeneral Lowenberg has always maintained the ability to understand what \nis important. Out of all the memories I have of General Lowenberg, the \nones that will stay with me the longest are from the catastrophic \nflooding that hit Washington in January 2009. The Washington State \nflood of 2009 caused the biggest urban evacuation in the history of the \nState, and I cannot begin to describe the scene that I witnessed out of \nthe back of a Chinook as General Lowenberg and I surveyed the damage. \nThat flood broke levees, shut down Interstate 5, and compromised the \nintegrity of Howard Hanson Dam. Through all of that chaos and the \nlengthy effort to move Federal funding to repair the Howard Hanson Dam, \nGeneral Lowenberg directed relief, recovery operations, and \npreparedness efforts with an unparalleled understanding of emergency \nmanagement that didn't ignore the effects that flood and damaged dam \nhad on small communities and individuals. Under General Lowenberg, \nWashington State had the best possible leadership for these and other \ndemanding situations.\n  I join the people of Washington State in congratulating General \nLowenberg on an impressive career, and I look forward to seeing what he \nwill accomplish in what I know will be an active retirement.\n  General Lowenberg, thank you for your service. You will be missed. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/24/senate-section/article/S5302-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13441 WITH RESPECT TO LEBANON--\n                                 PM 59\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to permanently extend the employer-provided child \ncare credit under section 45F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we know taxes are scheduled to increase for \nall Americans next year, and we know an across-the-board tax increase \non all Americans would be very bad for our economy. What we disagree on \nis which tax cuts should be continued.\n  Unfortunately, this has become a highly partisan debate. Someone \nwatching this debate would assume we cannot agree on anything when it \ncomes to taxes, but they would be wrong. We do agree on far more than \nwe disagree. We agree that middle-class tax rates should not go up. We \nagree that the alternative minimum tax should not affect middle-class \ntaxpayers. We agree on a variety of tax breaks that help families raise \nchildren and invest in their education. Our disagreements elsewhere \nshould not stop\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\nus from acting where we do agree. We should cut through the partisan \ngridlock and pass the policies we all support.\n  One policy we can all support is a tax credit for companies that \nprovide childcare to their workforce. This is a powerful and proven \nincentive for business--especially small business--to arrange onsite \nchildcare for their employees.\n  I originally introduced this tax credit after we passed welfare \nreform in 1996. The purpose of welfare reform was to move recipients \noff benefits and into jobs--a path of financial freedom that is too \noften blocked by the lack of quality and affordable childcare. After \nyears of work, we finally passed the employer-provided childcare tax \ncredit in 2001. Since then, it has offered businesses a tax credit for \nbuilding and maintaining a childcare center. Businesses can also \nreceive a smaller tax credit for helping their employees find childcare \nelsewhere in the community.\n  Childcare is a good investment for employee and employer alike. \nBusinesses get employees who miss less work to deal with family issues \nand stay at their jobs longer. Parents know their children are safe, \nsound, and close by while their mom or dad is at work. They do not have \nto choose between putting food on the table and caring for their \nchildren.\n  Now is not the time to add another stress to overstressed working \nfamilies struggling to survive in a down economy. That is why today I \nam introducing a bill to continue the tax credit for employer-provided \nchildcare. We all agree the employer-provided childcare tax credit \nshould not expire. It is included in both tax bills we are considering \nthis week and we should extend it now.\n  But support for childcare isn't the only thing the Republican and \nDemocratic tax bills agree on. In fact, these two bills offer the same \nexact tax cut extension for the first $250,000 earned by every American \nfamily. If a family makes $1 more than that, they still get the same \ntax cut extension on their first $250,000. Even millionaires get the \nsame tax cut extension as everyone else. Everybody, including the \nwealthiest Americans, benefits from the tax cuts we all can and do \nsupport.\n  Bipartisan policies, such as a tax credit for employer-provided \nchildcare or middle-class tax cuts, should not be held hostage because \nof a partisan debate about other tax cuts. When we all can agree on \nsomething, we should vote for it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 3428. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to partially waive the \nrenewable fuel standard when corn inventories are low; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nRenewable Fuel Standard Flexibility Act. I am introducing this bill \nbecause I have grave concerns about the impacts the Federal mandate for \ncorn ethanol production is having on the price of food in this country \nand the cost of domestic food production.\n  Corn is a staple of the modern American diet that has become a \nubiquitous ingredient or additive in most of our food and it is fed as \nfeed to nearly all livestock animals. The fact is, most meals Americans \nconsume either has corn as an essential ingredient or consist of \ningredients that required corn to produce. From milk, to eggs, to beef \nto poultry, to bread, to soft drink, and most prepared frozen meals \ncorn--is essential to American food.\n  The first section of Michael Pollan's 2006 Best Seller The Omnivore's \nDilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is titled ``Industrial Corn'' \nand it explains just how omnipresent corn, in some form or another, is \nin American diets. For better or for worse, the vast majority of the \nfood found on American supermarket shelves is made from processed corn. \nWhen it comes to the animal proteins Americans consume most of these \nanimals were raised on corn diets.\n  For decades, America's corn growers were out producing demand for \ncorn and food producers, and consumers benefited from relatively low \ncorn prices that ranged around $2 a bushel. While consumers may have \nbenefitted from these prices, American corn and grain growers were \nhurting badly.\n  Since 2007, the tides have been turning significantly. National \ndemand for corn is at an all-time high and corn futures project corn \nreaching $8 a bushel in the near future. A growing and hungry nation \ncombined with new demands for corn that are the result of technological \ninnovations have created new uses for corn in the form of ethanol as \nboth a motor fuel additive and in plastics. These new uses, combined \nwith expanded traditional uses have fueled the upward spike in corn \nprices.\n  Corn growers have benefitted tremendously from the increased demand \nand high corn prices. Ethanol producers have enjoyed a variety of \ngovernment supports mandating levels of ethanol production which have \nhelped them weather high corn prices paying a high price for corn \nfeedstocks is relatively easy when you have enormous production tax \ncredits and a federally mandated market for your product.\n  Food producers, including livestock and poultry producers, who use \ntremendous amounts of corn to raise their livestock and produce food, \ndo not have the luxury of a mandated market for their products.\n  In Maryland, our number one agricultural product is poultry. Poultry \nproduction is far and away the top employer on Maryland's Eastern \nShore. Maryland poultry is hurting and it is because they are competing \nwith big oil, and other non-traditional users, for corn. Corn is \nvitally important to raising chickens. Unlike other livestock, like \ncattle or hogs which are ruminants that can eat a variety of different \ntypes of feed, chickens' diets are limited to corn. Feed makes up more \nthan 73 percent of the cost of raising poultry and when corn reaches \n$6.50 or $7.00 or even $8.00 a bushel that cost goes even higher.\n  I understand the important role domestic ethanol production will play \nin helping our nation achieve greater energy security. However, the \nnurturing and growth of our domestic biofuels industry must not come at \nthe expense of our domestic food supply. In other words, we cannot \nsacrifice U.S. food security for energy security. That is why I do not \nsupport the use of food based feedstocks like sugar and corn to be \ncommercially produced into ethanol.\n  I also believe that as global demand for oil increases, driven by \nincreased mobility and affluence spreads in the developing world, \nrenewable biofuels will compete well with oil and that the government \nsupports we have in place will not be necessary because pure market \ndemand for less expensive and cleaner burning fuels like ethanol will \ndrive growth in biofuel production, not government mandates.\n  Because domestic food production is reaching a state of crisis driven \nby the increasing cost of inputs, like corn, that the food producers \nhave to unfairly compete with industries that are operating with under \ngovernment production mandates I am introducing legislation today that \noffers a simple change to the Renewable Fuel Standard that will help \nprovide our domestic food producers access to corn.\n  This legislation will link the amount of corn ethanol required for \nthe RFS to the amount of U.S. corn supplies. This legislation sets up a \nprocess so that when the USDA reports on U.S. corn supplies towards the \nend of each year, based upon the ratio of corn stocks- to expected use, \nthere could be a reduction made to the RFS mandate for corn ethanol. \nThis is a common sense solution to make sure that we have enough corn \nsupplies to meet all of our corn demands.\n  Once a year, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nwill review the current corn crop year's ratio of U.S. corn stocks-to-\nuse ratio in making a determination of the RFS.\n  By the end of November the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency will make an official determination of the Renewable \nFuels Standard, RFS, corn ethanol mandate for the following calendar \nyear, based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's November World \nAgricultural Supply and Demand Estimate report to determine the U.S. \ncorn stocks-to-use ratio. The administrator shall provide for a waiver \nfor the RFS for the following calendar year according to the calculated \nstocks to use ratio as directed. Such a waiver, if required, shall be \nincluded in the Environmental Protection Agency's Federal Register \nnotice regarding the RFS for the following calendar year. The required\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nwaiver, if any, will take effect January 1 of the new calendar year.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Waiver to the Renewable\n        Stocks-to-Use Ratio Percent            Fuels Standard for Corn\n                                                       Ethanol\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbove 10.00...............................  no adjustment\n10.00 to 7.50.............................  10 percent reduction\n7.49 to 6.00..............................  15 percent reduction\n5.99 to 5.00..............................  25 percent reduction\nBelow 5.00................................  50 percent reduction\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  I believe the future of biofuels must be in the development and \nproduction of cellulosic and advanced biofuels that are not derived \nfrom feedstocks that are part of essential food sources. As a supporter \nof bringing cellulosic and advanced biofuels to market, my legislation \nexplicitly states that it ``shall not affect the volume of advanced \nbiofuels required under'' the Renewable Fuel Standard. This will leave \nintact the advanced biofuels production mandate which I believe is \ncritical to growing this still nascent and beneficial fuel product to \ncommercial viability.\n  Because of corn's many uses it has become a commodity that is in high \ndemand. Assuring our domestic food producers' access to this valuable \nand increasingly scarce crop is so important to controlling the cost of \nfood in America and maintaining the economic viability of our U.S. food \ncompanies. I urge my colleagues to support U.S. food producers and \nfamilies working to put food on the table by co-sponsoring the \nRenewable Fuel Standard Flexibility Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 527\n\n       Whereas the members of the airborne forces of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States have a long and honorable history \n     as bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of \n     the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, \n     project the ground combat power of the United States by air \n     transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the \n     far corners of the world;\n       Whereas the experiment of the United States with airborne \n     operations began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute \n     Test Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, \n     and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump, which took place on August 16, \n     1940, to test the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of \n     a parachute;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II validated the airborne operational concept \n     and led to the creation of a formidable force of airborne \n     formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and \n     101st Airborne Divisions;\n       Whereas, included in those divisions, and among other \n     separate formations, were many airborne combat, combat \n     support, and combat service support units that served with \n     distinction and achieved repeated success in armed \n     hostilities during World War II, and provide the lineage and \n     legacy of many airborne units throughout the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne units during World \n     War II prompted the evolution of those units into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the members of the United States airborne forces, including \n     members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) \n     of the 25th Infantry Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, \n     special operations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, \n     and Air Force, and other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     demonstrated bravery and honor in combat, stability, and \n     training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne forces also include other \n     elite forces composed of airborne trained and qualified \n     special operations warriors, including Army Special Forces, \n     Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and Air Force \n     combat control and para-rescue teams;\n       Whereas, of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, thousands have achieved the \n     distinction of making combat jumps, dozens have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished \n     Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and \n     awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and \n     valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     tradition that, together with the special skills and \n     achievements of those members, distinguishes the members as \n     intrepid combat parachutists, air assault forces, special \n     operation forces, and, in the past, glider troops;\n       Whereas individuals from every State in the United States \n     have served gallantly in the airborne forces, and each State \n     is proud of the contributions of its paratrooper veterans \n     during the many conflicts faced by the United States;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the United States airborne forces warrant \n     special expressions of the gratitude of the people of the \n     United States;

Res. 527\n\n       Whereas the members of the airborne forces of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States have a long and honorable history \n     as bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of \n     the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, \n     project the ground combat power of the United States by air \n     transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the \n     far corners of the world;\n       Whereas the experiment of the United States with airborne \n     operations began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute \n     Test Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, \n     and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump, which took place on August 16, \n     1940, to test the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of \n     a parachute;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II validated the airborne operational concept \n     and led to the creation of a formidable force of airborne \n     formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and \n     101st Airborne Divisions;\n       Whereas, included in those divisions, and among other \n     separate formations, were many airborne combat, combat \n     support, and combat service support units that served with \n     distinction and achieved repeated success in armed \n     hostilities during World War II, and provide the lineage and \n     legacy of many airborne units throughout the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne units during World \n     War II prompted the evolution of those units into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the members of the United States airborne forces, including \n     members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) \n     of the 25th Infantry Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, \n     special operations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, \n     and Air Force, and other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     demonstrated bravery and honor in combat, stability, and \n     training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne forces also include other \n     elite forces composed of airborne trained and qualified \n     special operations warriors, including Army Special Forces, \n     Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and Air Force \n     combat control and para-rescue teams;\n       Whereas, of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, thousands have achieved the \n     distinction of making combat jumps, dozens have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished \n     Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and \n     awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and \n     valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     tradition that, together with the special skills and \n     achievements of those members, distinguishes the members as \n     intrepid combat parachutists, air assault forces, special \n     operation forces, and, in the past, glider troops;\n       Whereas individuals from every State in the United States \n     have served gallantly in the airborne forces, and each State \n     is proud of the contributions of its paratrooper veterans \n     during the many conflicts faced by the United States;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the United States airborne forces warrant \n     special expressions of the gratitude of the people of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne forces, past and present, \n     celebrate August 16 as the anniversary of the first official \n     jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is an \n     appropriate day to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2012, as ``National Airborne \n     Day'';
