Mr. President, I remember Tuesday, September 11, very \nclearly.\n  Room 219 is where Senator Daschle held his Tuesday morning leadership \nmeeting, which started at 9 o'clock. I was the first Senator in that \nroom. John Breaux of Louisiana came in a short time later, and he said: \nSomething is going on in New York. Flip on the TV. And we did, and \nthere was a tower burning, and we were thinking, how could an airplane \nrun into that tower?\n  We basically didn't pay any attention to that TV. We turned it off \nbecause there was a meeting there. We assembled for a meeting, Senator \nDaschle called it to order, and just a short time after the meeting was \nstarted, he got a note. Somebody came in and took him out, and he came \nin and said: We have to vacate the building. There is an airplane \nheaded toward the Capitol. So of course we all hurriedly left 219.\n  I remember that day so very clearly. Senator Nickles was my \nRepublican counterpart, Senator Trent Lott was Senator Daschle's \ncounterpart, and the four of us were taken off the west front of the \nCapitol to a secret location, where we spent most all the day. The Vice \nPresident was there and kept us informed as to what was going on. As we \nleft 219, Mr. President, you could look out the window and see the \nsmoke billowing out of the Pentagon.\n  It was a very difficult day for all of us. Yesterday, we observed the \n10th anniversary of those attacks, but the truth is I remember that day \nas if it were only yesterday. That day, Osama bin Laden and his radical \nfollowers didn't just launch an attack on planes or buildings. They \nlaunched an attack on the American spirit. They launched an attack on \nour freedom and our democracy.\n  Rather than being crippled by the terrible acts of those madmen, \nrather than allowing uncertainty and fear to rule us, this Nation was \nagain stronger than ever. And we really did it in one way, and that was \nby coming together. The darkness that day reminded us of our collective \nstrength and power. It reminded us that there is nothing we cannot \nachieve together, as one Nation under God, indivisible, and, of course, \nwith liberty and justice for all. So we pledged to bring justice to the \nperpetrators of those terrible acts, and we followed through on that \npledge with an unfaltering campaign to dismantle al-Qaida and its \nsupporters. This year, our brave Navy SEALs and others gave Osama bin \nLaden his due. We also pledged to rebuild, and I am very happy to see \nthe proud towers of the new World Trade Center rising from the ashes of \nGround Zero.\n  That doesn't mean the memory of that day is not painful, because it \nis, especially to those who lost loved ones.\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nThousands of people lost loved ones. Nothing could ever make up for the \nloss of a mother or father, son or daughter, brother or sister, friend, \nor a spouse who was just catching a plane, going to work, or at work on \nthat horrific day. They are the reason we will never forget--ever.\n  So today, as yesterday, I honor the memory of the thousands of \ninnocent people who died at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, on \nthe hijacked planes in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. I honor \nthe memory of the firefighters who knew the danger they faced when they \nentered those buildings but went in anyway. I honor the police and \nrescue workers who rushed to the scene and combed through the debris, \nsome of whom died that day. I honor the many dedicated members of our \nArmed Forces, our State Department, the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, and our intelligence community who have sacrificed their \nlives to keep us safe and keep September 11 from ever happening again.\n  Today, at approximately 6 o'clock, we will gather on the east front \nof the Capitol. In looking at the program, I see the final thing that \nwill happen there is one of the military bands and choir will sing \n``God Bless America.'' That happened on September 11. Senator Daschle \nand I had come back, and we gathered on the front of the Capitol. We \nreally were there not knowing what to do; we just wanted to be \ntogether. As I remember, Senator Mikulski said in her usual voice, \nwhich demands attention, ``Let's sing `God Bless America.' '' And we \ndid. I don't know how well we sang it, but it was a memorable event. So \nI will remember that very clearly tonight when we close our recognition \nceremony out there on the east front of the Capitol singing ``God Bless \nAmerica''--something we did 10 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I honor America's spirit of perseverance and \ncommitment to freedom. May we never forget.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5482-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we all heard the President speak to a joint \nsession of Congress last week about his jobs bill, which was released \nthis morning. The President indicated he wanted to take his case to the \npeople. I am glad he is doing so. As he travels about the country, I \nthink he will be hearing what many of us heard during the August work \nperiod when we were back at home.\n  As I traveled across the State of Indiana and talked to people from \nall different categories of industry--small to medium to large \nbusinesses--homeowners and other constituents, one thing came through \nloudly and clearly: I needed to listen to them more than they needed to \nlisten to me. What was on their minds is what I think the President \nwill be hearing about as he travels across the country to talk about \nhis jobs plan because, clearly, on the minds of the American people are \njobs and the lack of jobs for many who are struggling through a very \ndifficult time of unemployment. There are students who graduated from \ncollege with no place to go. People in middle age are being laid off or \nterminated, unable to find new work. Clearly, we have a jobs crisis in \nthis country. It has lasted now for some time. We have been in a deep \nrecession. Hopefully, we are coming out of it, but the latest \nindicators show that things are pretty stagnant. In fact, the latest \nfacts that came forward in the August reports were that job growth is \nzero. So we have some work to do. We also need to look carefully at the \nproposal the President brought before us.\n  Getting back to the central point I am trying to make, what he will \nhear, I believe, from the American people--at least he will hear it if \nhe stops in Indiana--is there is a great cloud of uncertainty hanging \nover the future and, because of that, people are holding back on \nspending and businesses are holding back on hiring. There certainly is \nnot the confidence we have seen in the past. We have seen that \nconfidence indicator drop and drop and drop--confidence in the future \nthat we have our act together, that we are pulling out of this \nrecession, and that we can look forward to a brighter tomorrow because \nour economy will be growing and we will be adding more jobs. That \nuncertainty results from a number of factors. Clearly, we have been in \na downturn, and we are trying to climb out of that, but there is also \nuncertainty about what policies will be coming out of Washington that \nwill affect the job creators and will affect consumers as they \ncontemplate decisions regarding how to go forward.\n  One of those key indicators is the uncertainty over what the Tax Code \nwill bring regarding the taxing of profits or income or revenue that \ncomes into America's companies. I wish to highlight one of those \nbecause it is important to the State of Indiana, but I think it also \nmakes the larger point. There are industries that can be an essential \npart of our future and that can and are providing for essential \nemployment, at higher than average wages with good skill levels, and \nthat hold a lot of potential for our exporting successfully overseas as \nwell as providing necessary products here at home.\n  One of those industries is centrally located in Indiana--in fact, it \nis one of our top industries and an industry with significant growth \nover the last decade or more; that industry is the medical device \nindustry. Yet the medical device industry, because of its success, was \ntargeted during the formation of the health care plan that was proposed \nby the President and passed by this Congress in the last session. That \nbill imposed a tax increase on the medical device industry, even though \nthey did not have a direct relationship with what was trying to be \naccomplished in the ObamaCare medical plan. Here is an industry that is \na world leader, where the United States is a world leader, an industry \nthat brings in substantial revenue, has seen a significant increase in \ngrowth, and holds great potential for the future. Yet because there was \na search for pay-fors for the health care plan, the administration \nlooked at this industry and basically said: We can draw some taxes and \nprovide some revenues. Their proposal was to achieve $40 billion over a \nperiod of time, all of which would go to help pay for the health care \nplan. That was reduced through an amendment--or through negotiations--\nto $20 billion. Nevertheless, it should have never been included in the \nfirst place. It was there for a revenue raiser, and it didn't have \nanything to do with the particular plan.\n  Indiana is one of the world leaders in the development of medical \ntechnologies that enhance and save the lives of Hoosiers and patients \naround the world. We have more than 300 FDA-\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nregistered medical device manufacturers, employing 20,000 Hoosiers \ndirectly and another 28,000 indirectly. There are more than 400,000 \nworkers employed nationwide by this industry. These are jobs that pay, \non average, 41 percent higher wages than the State wage rate in \nIndiana.\n  Medical device manufacturing has been a thriving industry. It is \ncritical to our State economy and many States' economies, and I will \nlist some of those. States such as California, Florida, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Wisconsin, and including my State of Indiana could suffer more \njob losses if this tax is allowed to go into effect. In fact, a study \nthat has come out produced by the Advanced Medical Technology \nAssociation analyzed the potential effect of the health care law's \ndevice tax on employment and the medical device industry, and I quote \nfrom that report:\n\n       . . . under reasonable assumptions, the tax could result in \n     job losses in excess of 43,000 workers and employment \n     compensation losses in excess of $3.5 billion. That would be \n     a devastating blow to the industry and, of course, to many \n     local economies.\n\n  Beyond that, I have met with these device manufacturers on numerous \noccasions. Essentially, what they have said to me is: We like working \nin Indiana. We like the productivity we are getting. But if we continue \nto be taxed and regulated to the point where we are no longer \ncompetitive in selling our products worldwide, we are going to have to \ntake a serious look at moving our production overseas. They said: We \ndon't want to do this. We want to stay here. But we need to be \ncompetitive because you have to understand that a lot of our revenue \ncomes from exporting overseas.\n  Of course, this is what we want to encourage. Our trade balance is in \ndeficit and the more we can export and the more we have cutting-edge \nindustries that export enhanced products to overseas customers, the \nbetter our own economic situation will be here at home.\n  At a time when 14 million Americans are looking for work and at a \ntime when our country has suffered through 31 consecutive months of \nunemployment above 8 percent, I think we need to take a close look at \nthe job creators in our country and determine whether the taxation or \nregulation that is being imposed on them is having a dramatic impact on \nour ability to provide more jobs. The people I have talked to said it \nis having the opposite effect.\n\n  Senator Hatch has introduced a bill to repeal this tax. It was \ncontroversial when it was first brought forward. I think the Congress \nought to take a look at this legislation. If we want to provide some \njob-creating opportunities in America, we need to look at the taxes and \nregulations that are stifling growth and the ability to hire more \npeople.\n  I am a proud sponsor of Senator Hatch's legislation to repeal this \nexcise tax. It will, as I said, benefit many States and provide many \njobs and prevent jobs from leaving American soil. So I encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join this commonsense legislation and \nrepeal the tax on medical devices. If we want to spur economic growth, \nit is time we take a closer look at the harmful impacts of policies \nthat are stifling growth. This is one industry--and I hope to highlight \nmore in the future--but one industry that clearly is being penalized \nfor being successful. It is hurting our economy, and it is hurting our \nability to provide job growth.\n  I wish the President well. I hope he listens intently. I hope he \nhears the same sentiment I heard as I traveled around the State of \nIndiana. I believe the conclusion is inevitable; that is, taxation, \nregulation, and the policies coming out of Washington bring uncertainty \nto the marketplace, and uncertainty to the marketplace affects consumer \nconfidence and affects the confidence of those job creators and \nemployers who are frozen in time waiting to see how all this is going \nto turn out. They are fearful of hiring more employees because they do \nnot know what the impact is going to be on their payroll and on their \nexpenses, and they are waiting for the next regulation to come down \nthat might impact their business in a negative way.\n  We need certainty coming out of Washington, not uncertainty. I am \nhoping over the next 2 or 3 months, as Congress works to come together \nwith a sensible plan to deal with our deficit, we can enact a good plan \nfor the future in terms of how to deal with our deficit and we can \nbring some certainty to the future and get our economy back on the \nright track.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5483-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5483-S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thoughts and \nmy concerns about an issue of the utmost importance; that is, the \nIsrael-Palestinian peace process.\n  Tomorrow, September 13, 2011, the General Assembly of the United \nNations will commence with its 66th session in New York. Every year, \nmember nations come together to debate and discuss the important issues \nfacing the world at the United Nations General Assembly. While there \nwill be a variety of issues on the agenda this year, I am extremely \nconcerned about one issue specifically.\n  Over the last several months, Palestinian Authority President Abbas \nhas repeatedly voiced his intention to formally request statehood \nrecognition and full membership in the United Nations. In July, the \nArab League endorsed this irresponsible ploy. Regrettably, President \nAbbas intends to make the formal request during this session of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly.\n  I oppose the decision of the Palestinian Authority to seek a \ndeclaration of statehood by the United Nations. The unilateral action \nof the Palestinian Authority is intended to circumvent the peace \nprocess. It is not a good-faith effort to achieve peace in the Middle \nEast but, to me, rather it is a political maneuver.\n  The United Nations should not be interfering or intervening in this \ncomplex process and should refrain from passing unilateral declarations \non issues that are part of ongoing direct negotiations by the parties. \nThe decision about borders and statehood should be achieved through a \nfinal agreement, an agreement between the Government of Israel and the \nPalestinians.\n  The United Nations should refrain from dictating and imposing a final \ndecision on statehood for a territory of one of its own current member \nnations. To me, this will only make matters worse. It will make this \nsituation worse because the consequences to the peace process are \ngrave.\n  The ability to move forward with an agreement is weakened and greatly \ndiminished by these types of tactics. The best path to peace is through \ndirect negotiations between the two parties, not through a manipulation \nat the United Nations. The United States continues to support a two-\nstate solution as a means to ending the conflict. It is based on the \nbelief that it is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace \nbetween these two parties.\n  Instead of embarking on the time-consuming campaign to gain support \nin the United Nations General Assembly, the Palestinian leadership \nshould be working directly with Israel on creating a real and \nsustainable peace agreement.\n  The request for recognition by the United Nations is part of a \nterrible emerging trend from the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian \nAuthority continues to engage in troubling behavior that is contrary to \npeace.\n  On May 4, the Palestinian Authority reached an agreement with the \nterrorist group, Hamas, to create a unity government. It is outrageous \nthat the Palestinian Authority would be willing to unite with a known \nterrorist group that is infamously recognized for its destructive acts \nof violence.\n  Since 1997 Hamas has been designated by the U.S. Department of State \nas a foreign terrorist organization. Hamas\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nterrorists are responsible for the murders of American citizens. It is \nalso important to note that the agreement between Hamas and the \nPalestine Authority does not require Hamas to recognize Israel's right \nto exist, to accept the previous Israel-Palestinian agreements, or to \nrenounce terrorism.\n  Hamas continues to be fundamentally opposed to a lasting peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It is apparent there is \nno path to a peaceful resolution when part of the Palestinian unity \ngovernment is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.\n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made this point very clear when he \naddressed the joint session of Congress on May 24 of this year. He \nstated, ``Peace can only be negotiated with partners committed to \npeace.''\n  Furthermore, it is completely unacceptable for U.S. assistance to go \nthe Palestinian Authority when it includes Hamas. The Palestinian \nAuthority received approximately $500 million in U.S. foreign \nassistance in fiscal year 2010. Hard-earned U.S. taxpayer funds must \nnot be funneled into the pockets of terrorists.\n  History shows this is not the first attempt by the Palestinians to \nuse the United Nations to circumvent peace negotiations and declare \nstatehood. The Palestinians sought to change their status at the United \nNations through the World Health Organization. At that time, Secretary \nof State James Baker publicly warned that he would recommend that the \nUnited States stop funding any international organization that changed \nthe Palestinian status as an observer organization.\n  Americans are keenly aware that a significant portion of the United \nNations' budget is paid by the United States. As the biggest financial \ncontributor to the United Nations, the United States contributed almost \n$7.7 billion in fiscal year 2010 to the United Nations system. The \nUnited States should not be providing funding for an international \ninstitution that circumvents an established peace process and that \nthreatens the security of our allies.\n  The United States and Israel share a long and deep alliance. Israel \nis a friend and ally and a strategic partner to the United States. Both \nIsrael and the United States understand the values of life, liberty, \nopportunity, security, and freedom.\n  Throughout Israel's history, the country has worked to build a \ndemocratic nation in the face of severe obstacles. Israel is a shining \nexample of democracy in the Middle East. As Israel faces real danger \nfrom its neighbors, the people of Israel continue to show great \nstrength and perseverance as they seek peace.\n  On May 22, President Obama explained that no vote at the United \nNations would create an independent Palestinian State. On May 25, the \nPresident expressed his concern about the efforts of the Palestinian \nAuthority to seek statehood at the United Nations and referred to it as \na ``mistake.''\n  The Department of State continues to reiterate that Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority need to work out the differences between \nthemselves in direct negotiations. The United States has been very \nclear that we will use veto power in the United Nations Security \nCouncil to block any attempt by the Palestinians for state recognition \nor United Nations membership.\n  The Obama administration must use all of its resources to block \nsimilar actions in the General Assembly and other United Nations \norganizations. President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton must \npress the Palestinian Authority to abandon its erroneous decision and \nreturn to the negotiating table with Israel.\n  It is also imperative that other international leaders understand the \nimplications of these efforts and join the United States in opposing \nthem. Nations must stand together to decry the attempt to circumvent \ndirect peace process negotiations.\n  The Palestinian Authority must also understand that its actions will \nhave serious implications to the U.S.-Palestinian relations and U.S. \nassistance. The recent actions of the Palestinian Authority indicate to \nthis Senator that the United States has no choice but to suspend \nfunding assistance to the Palestinian Authority.\n  Today, I call on Congress to terminate funding assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority. I believe Congress must also evaluate and \nsignificantly cut funding to the United Nations if any change to the \nstatus of the Palestinian Authority is approved by the General \nAssembly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5484-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5484-S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, President Obama is about to roll out another \njobs plan. He talked about it last week. This is 2\\1/2\\ years after the \nfirst stimulus bill, which, with interest, amounted to about $1.2 \ntrillion. His economic advisers have confirmed the fact that this \nstimulus concept is actually based on the Keynesian economic theory. As \nour Republican leader noted last week, there are now, unfortunately, \n1.7 million fewer jobs in America, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, than there were before the President's first stimulus bill. \nSo the question, obviously, is whether this theory is better in theory \nthan it is in practice.\n  I wanted to talk today a little about the two different basic \ntheories of economic growth and what you do in a situation of economic \ndownturn, as we have today. How should we be looking at stimulation of \njob creation and economic growth? The two competing theories, of \ncourse, are the Keynesian theory, which I mentioned, and what some have \ncalled supply-side economics.\n  There is no question that the Keynesian theory has been one to which \nthe President's economic advisers generally adhere. It was used to \njustify the 2009 stimulus program and other programs. For example, the \none that sticks out in my mind is the so-called cash for clunkers, but \nthere were other transfer payment government programs, temporary tax \ncredits, and others. But the theory in the cash for clunkers is a good \nexample, which is that in recessionary times, if the government spends \nmoney and gives it to people so that they can spend it, that will \ntherefore stimulate consumption; that business will respond by \nincreasing production, and that will create jobs.\n  Recently, for example, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that \nbecause of a theoretical multiplier effect under this model, food \nstamps--government money taken from taxpayers and given to people who \nare entitled or eligible for food stamps--would actually stimulate the \neconomy by a factor of 1.84; in other words, that $1 of food stamps \nwould actually generate $1.84 in economic activity. There are a lot of \nproblems with that theory. The first is that the multiplier effect \nitself has been discredited as not something that, in fact, actually \nhappens.\n  A Harvard economist by the name of Robert Barro has explained this, \nand I will quote from one of his writings:\n\n       Theorizing aside, Keynesian policy conclusions, such as the \n     wisdom of additional stimulus geared to money transfers, \n     should come down to empirical evidence. And there is zero \n     evidence that deficit-financed transfers raise GDP and \n     employment--not to mention evidence for a multiplier of two. \n     If [Secretary Vilsack's claim] were valid, this result would \n     be truly miraculous. The administration found the evidence it \n     wanted--multipliers around two--by consulting some large-\n     scale macroeconometric models, which substitute assumptions \n     for identification.\n\n  In other words, economists can prove the multiplier in theory with \nthese models, but there is no empirical evidence that it has ever \noccurred. It is a bit like money growing on trees. The money has to \ncome from somewhere, and, of course, it comes out of the pockets of \ntaxpayers or the government borrows it and it eventually has to be \nrepaid with taxpayer tax dollars.\n  The second problem is that to the extent one assumes the problem is \nthat Americans are too broke to spend money, the question then is, How \ncan the government make that up for us? Aren't the people the \ngovernment? Doesn't the government get its money from the people in the \nform of taxes or,\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nif it borrows, the people's taxes eventually have to pay back the \nborrowed money. In other words, we have to pay it back later.\n  Third, people tend to change their spending habits when they know \nthey will have greater consistent income over time, such as when they \nreceive a raise at work. If you give people a one-time payment, the \nevidence has shown they either save that or they shift future \nconsumption forward. In other words, they may buy something now they \nwere going to buy later. That is where the Cash for Clunkers Program \nfailed. But it doesn't permanently increase their work effort or their \nincentive to invest, which, of course, is exactly what is needed to \njump-start economic growth. The job creators themselves tend to hire \nwhen they know they are going to have permanent tax relief or \nregulatory relief, not just when they receive a one-time payment for \nsomething. That is only good for as long as it lasts, but it doesn't \nprovide the consistent, long-term prospect for income, for example, \nthat they need in order to take the step of actually hiring a person \nand committing to paying that person over time.\n  Fourth, the Keynesian theory assumes the government has the foresight \nto determine or, as President Obama's former National Economic Council \nchief Larry Summers said of the stimulus, to target which spending \nprograms would best create economic growth, but that rarely happens. \nThe obvious problem with this assumption, of course, is that Congress \ndoes not spend taxpayer money wisely. We see time and time again how a \nwell-intentioned piece of legislation gets loaded up with special \nprojects, frequently which are costly to the public and very \nquestionable in their value. That was one of the things that was wrong \nwith the stimulus package itself.\n  There is an eye-opening new set of working papers that reveals the \ntruth about this. Mercatus Center scholars Garett Jones and Daniel \nRothschild took a look at, among other things, whether Congress did a \ngood job of targeting the stimulus funds at unemployed workers and weak \nsectors of the economy. They surveyed hundreds of firms that received \nstimulus funding and gathered more than 1,000 voluntary, anonymous \nresponses from employees and managers to help shed more light on what \nhappened to organizations that received stimulus funds. Here is what \nthey wrote:\n\n       Our survey finds no evidence of such [Keynesian] targeting \n     occurring, at least not successfully.\n\n  For example, one city was given $4 million to improve energy \nefficiency even though a budget shortfall had just forced it to lay off \n185 public workers. In another case study, a Federal contractor was \ninstructed to purchase more expensive tiles than he needed for a \nparticular project. The theory was, in that way the government could \nclaim the stimulus money was getting out the door faster. This isn't \nthe way to spur economic growth. And I believe most Keynesians believe \nthat what the government spends its money on matters.\n  Moreover, the study I referred to also found that less than half of \nthose hired with the stimulus funds were unemployed--about 42.1 \npercent. Jobs were simply moving from one place to another. The authors \nof the study wrote:\n\n       Hiring is not the same thing as net job creation. This \n     suggests just how hard it is for Keynesian job creation to \n     work in a modern, expertise-based economy.\n\n  In other words, while an employer might steal an employee from \nanother employer, that is not the same thing as creating a net new job.\n  So the bottom line here is there is a major misconception that \nconsumption fueled by government spending actually creates jobs. It \nturns out that it doesn't. It just inefficiently moves borrowed money \naround with a bill that has to be repaid later.\n  I believe it is also important to remember that economic growth stems \nfrom combining three inputs: labor, capital, and technology. These \nthree factors of production result in output we can then consume. This \nis the beginning of the difference between the Keynesian philosophy and \nthe supply-side philosophy, which focuses on productivity. And what is \nrequired for society to be more productive? Labor, capital, and \ntechnology. Properly applied, when these three aspects of an economy \nare well-aligned, the economy can grow, jobs can be produced, and \npeople will consume, but they will be consuming things that have been \nproduced by the businesses of the country. Without labor, capital, and \ntechnology, there can be no consumption. I mean, that is obvious. \nFocusing on policies that stimulate consumption targets the wrong side \nof the equation. In order to get the economy going, you need to focus \non the inputs.\n  There is an incidental problem here. Stimulating consumption also \nraises prices, which is exactly what we don't need. When you stimulate \ninput or productivity, you produce more of the quality goods people \nwant, and the prices of those products are down if there is enough \nproductivity. But when you try to stimulate consumption for a fixed \nnumber of goods, obviously the price of those goods goes up. There is a \nfear of inflation in our society today, and that is precisely what this \nkind of Keynesian stimulus will produce.\n  This matter of focusing on inputs, as I said, is where the second \nphilosophy of economic growth comes in--supply-side economics, which \nfocuses on productivity. The fundamental principle of supply-side \neconomics is that people work harder and take more risks when there are \nmore opportunities for economic gain and less government intrusion.\n  Translating this economic philosophy into policy means several \nthings--first of all, reducing government consumption by cutting \nspending, thus leaving resources in the private sector.\n  I mentioned food stamps before. The government can only give money to \nfood stamp recipients by taxing the money of someone else or borrowing \nthe money. Eventually, that borrowed money needs to be paid back. How \nis it paid back? It is paid back by taxpayers paying money to the \ngovernment, which can then repay its debt. In either event, eventually \nthe money the government spends to stimulate the economy has to come \nfrom somewhere, and the only place it can come from is the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The bottom line is, with Keynesian stimulus spending, there is no \nfree lunch. The money doesn't materialize out of nowhere. It is not \nfree for the government to inject this money into the economy by giving \nit to favored groups or to redistribute it to people within our society \nso they can spend it. That is why this factor some people talk about \nthat we actually get more money back than we put in is wrong in two \nways.\n  First, as I pointed out before, there is no empirical evidence that \never happened. Secondly, eventually, the money has to be repaid or, if \nit was taxpayer money to begin with, that is $1 less taxpayer money \nthat that taxpayer has to invest or to consume or, if it is a \nbusinessperson, to hire someone in the private business.\n  The bottom line is, government money isn't free. So the whole premise \nof Keynesian economics that we get a free dollar someplace and that \nproduces benefits by people then spending it is wrong. How about \nleaving it in the pocket of the person whom we want to spend it in the \nfirst place? Chances are that person can make a more intelligent \ndecision about what he or she needs than the U.S. Government.\n  Second, as I said here, we are talking about incentives in the \nmarketplace which are based, by every economic study, on long-term \npolicies: long-term tax policies, long-term regulatory policies. An \nindividual small businessman, for example, wants to know what the law \nwill be 2 and 3 and 4 years out before he decides to hire a new \nemployee he is going to have to pay taxes for, whom he is going to have \nto provide potentially a health benefit for, certainly a salary. If he \ndoesn't think that government policy over that long term is going to \nenable him to continue to employ the individual, he is not going to \nhire him in the first place.\n  Another thing that supply-side economics means is that the worst \nthing we could do, especially in economic down times, is to raise taxes \non anyone but certainly not on the very employers we count on to hire \nmore workers. Who is the first to hire coming out of a recession? It is \nsmall business.\n  So the very people we are asking to hire more Americans to put them \nback to work are the people who would be impacted by the taxes the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\ntalked about the other night. He is talking about taxing ``wealthier \nAmericans.'' What does that mean? It means people who make incomes \nabove $200,000, and that happens to be the group that represents the \nbulk of the small business entrepreneurs in America. Fifty percent of \nall small business income is paid in those top two income tax brackets \non which the President would raise taxes.\n  So the very people we want to hire more workers, we are going to \nimpose more taxes on; and then we are going to expect them to hire more \nto reduce unemployment so we can have greater economic growth? It \nsimply doesn't work that way.\n  The final point has to do with regulations. More and more, the \nPresident seems to be acknowledging that the runaway regulations of his \nadministration are actually beginning to harm business and job \ncreation. This is why he has announced his effort to try to streamline \nthe regulations and get rid of any that don't work; why he withdrew a \nproposed regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency recently \nthat would have had a very negative impact on business. He is beginning \nto recognize that his administration is a big wet blanket over \nbusinesses these days because of their burden of regulations. We cannot \nstimulate the economy or job growth with the government imposing more \nand more costly regulations on American business every day.\n  The President set up a false choice in his speech the other night. He \nsaid: We have to do away with these job-killing regulations. But, he \nsaid, I will not do away with the regulations which protect the \nAmerican people from--and then he named a litany of things he wants to \nprotect the American people from.\n  Nobody is talking about eliminating all regulations or having unsafe \nfood or unsafe products for little babies and the like. We are not \ntalking about that. We are talking about the issuance of thousands and \nthousands of pages of new regulations every month by this \nadministration at an extraordinary cost on American business with very \nlittle regard for a cost benefit--in other words, how much society \nbenefits versus the cost of these regulations imposed on business.\n  By the way, when I say the cost imposed on businesses, who pays? \nBusinesses are the people in the business. The consumers end up paying \nthe cost of the regulations which obviously are passed on. So this is, \nagain, another indirect tax on the American people. That is why I said \nbefore, no tax--but especially in a time such as this--whether direct \nor indirect, is a good idea because of the negative impact it has on \njob creation.\n  The bottom line of all this is, there are two basic theories. The one \ntheory basically says we can get something for nothing. The government \nwill get money, forget where it gets it. But when it gives it to \npeople, they will spend it. When they spend it, then whatever they \nspend it on, that producer has to produce more of those things so they \nwill have to hire somebody to make more of them. But that is exactly \nbackward. It doesn't work that way.\n  The supply-side theory says, first of all, the money didn't come to \nthe government free. It had to be taken out of the private sector. The \ngovernment either had to tax somebody, so they have $1 less to spend, \nor it gives an IOU, which means eventually the taxpayers have to pay \nthe taxes to repay the IOU. In either case, that is $1 taken out of the \neconomy. It is $1 not there in the private sector for an entrepreneur \nto hire someone or to produce something.\n  So the supply-side economics says, let's look at the other side of \nthe equation. Rather than focusing on consumption, let's focus on \nproductivity where technology, labor, and capital can produce more, can \nmake a society more productive, more wealthy, where more people can \nhave work, they can have better paying jobs. What they produce has \ngreater value, and people are willing to buy it, as a result of which \nthey put more money back into the economy. That is the cycle that \nproduces wealth, and it is the cycle that has caused economic growth \nand job creation and wealth generation in this country now for over 200 \nyears.\n  It begins with the proposition that job growth starts in the private \nsector, that government doesn't create jobs, that money starts with the \npeople, the taxpayers. They generate the income, and the government \ngets a piece of that in the way of tax revenue. But the money belongs \nto the people, not the government. Third, there is no magic when the \ngovernment somehow gets $1 in order to redistribute it so somebody can \nbuy something with it. We have to remember where the dollar came from. \nIt didn't materialize out of thin air. It started with a hard-working \ntaxpayer who earned the dollar and then either paid it to the \ngovernment in taxes or is paying it in taxes to repay a debt that the \ngovernment incurred in order to borrow money for a stimulus package.\n  As we think about the President's proposed third or fourth stimulus, \nhowever we count it now, I hope we can keep these economic theories in \nmind: There is no free lunch. There is no free money. Eventually, the \ntaxpayers are who create the wealth and the job creators create the \njobs. If we keep those principles in mind, I think we will look a \nlittle bit more skeptically on the notion that we can somehow target \njob creation with yet another stimulus bill and that is going to get us \nout of our economic woes.\n  If my colleagues will keep these principles in mind, I think we will \nmake wise decisions and prevent the country from going even deeper into \ndebt and try to focus on the long term so businesses can actually make \ndecisions based upon long-term thinking rather than based upon the \nephemeral effects of short-term stimulus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5486-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5486-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, yesterday marked 10 years since the \nhorrendous attack of Americans on American soil, but it led to a lot of \npatriotism and a lot of flags being displayed all over the country.\n  Over the weekend, I noticed my 3-year-old granddaughter and my 4-\nyear-old granddaughter, when they saw a flag hanging anywhere, said \n``God bless America.''\n  Throughout the history of the United States, each generation has had \nat least one iconic moment, one moment in time that served to galvanize \nthe Nation and call each and every American to take on a cause much \ngreater than themselves. Ultimately, the results they were able to \nachieve served to define who they were as a generation and what they \nwere capable of, both as individuals and as a nation.\n  For my father, that moment was the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As we \nwatched with growing concern, a terrible evil had taken the whole world \nto the brink of war. We found we no longer had a choice as to whether \nwe would get involved. We were forced to take action and bring our \nmilitary might to bear against an enemy that had set its sights on \nworld domination.\n  As soon as the call went out, brave men and women from all across the \ncountry volunteered to serve in our military and to take up arms to \ndefend the rights and liberties we cherish as Americans. They soon \nproved to be worthy of the task as we once again showed that ours was \nthe greatest fighting force the world has ever known. Thanks to them, \nthe tyranny and oppression that threatened to overwhelm Europe was \nhalted and peace and freedom was once again restored to a war-weary \nworld.\n  Returning home from the battlefields on which they had served with \ndistinction, our service men and women took up another great challenge \nand that was to rebuild our Nation and to restore its greatness. Their \ncommitment and dedication to that great mission helped to make the \nUnited States what it is today. Thanks to them, their sons and \ndaughters received the greatest gift they could possibly receive, our \nAmerican way of life. Their actions made it clear that the American \ndream belongs to everyone, and it can come true, if we are willing to \ndo whatever is necessary to make it happen.\n  For me and my generation, our iconic moment came with the news that \nthe Soviet Union had launched Sputnik into space. In that brief moment \nin time, we were once again filled with that same determination as we \nrealized we were in second place in the race for space and in other \nthings. That would never be acceptable or accepted.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  In the days after that startling announcement, people of all ages \nfound themselves looking to the skies, wondering if we could answer \nthis daunting challenge. Our curiosity and our ingenuity would again be \nput to the test as we all tried to help in the effort to bring about \nthat ``one giant step for mankind'' that wasn't to come for several \nmore years.\n  My friends and I in junior high banded together--although we were all \nvery young--to help. We wanted to learn all we could about rockets so \nwe could become rocketeers or at least we tried our best to be worthy \nof the title. Once again, we had a difficult goal to reach for, and we \nwere proud to think of ourselves as part of that call to action.\n\n  Of course, President John F. Kennedy then issued the challenge to the \nNation that we would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to \nEarth. It sounded impossible, but with American know-how we were able \nto develop and put into action a plan that made it happen.\n  When the time came, the world watched with wonder and amazement as \nNeil Armstrong took those first steps on the Moon and proved once again \nthat whatever goals we set, we always seem to find the tools and talent \nwe need to get the job done.\n  For my children, their generation's iconic moment came on September \n11, when we were once again cruelly attacked by terrorists who had \nhijacked several planes and used them to destroy the World Trade Center \nand part of the Pentagon. It was a moment in time that everyone will \nlong remember for the impact that day and the events surrounding it had \non the world and our lives, an impact that continues to be felt.\n  Even though it was 10 years ago, for almost all of us, the images of \nSeptember 11 are still fresh in our minds. We can remember where we \nwere when we first heard the news that our Nation was under attack. We \ncan remember how we felt as we watched the Twin Towers fall and the \nsense of loss as the harsh reality of all the lives that were lost that \nday became all too real.\n  There are many lessons learned as we watched the rescue crews, along \nwith our police and firemen, attempt to save as many as they could from \nthe building and then from the wreckage. It was a harsh reminder of how \ndelicate and precious our lives are and how the gift can be taken from \nus at a moment's notice.\n  Yet out of all that was lost, there was the birth of something even \ngreater, something more powerful and enduring. It was the sense of \ncommunity, this sense of country that bound us together as one Nation, \nas one American. We stood side by side with our neighbors, our \nfamilies, and even complete strangers, looking out for one another and \nhelping those in need.\n  Terrorists thought we were a weak nation that would crumble in the \nface of violence. Those who wanted to hurt us sent a clear message. Yet \nwe sent another. American flags sprung up in every yard, flew from \nevery building, and even hung from our overpasses. The powerfully \nsimple message of the Stars and Stripes was our message: We are America \nand we stand together.\n\n  Like those moments before, the morning light the next day brought \nwith it the firm resolve that we would, once again, come together as \none to address that attack. Political differences would no longer \nseparate us. Concern for our shared future was so strong it would unite \nus to face this threat to our well-being. Together, we resolved we \nwould do everything we could to ensure that terrorism would never again \ntake such a terrible toll from our Nation or any other nation.\n  I remember during that time being at events where ambassadors from \naround the world offered an outpouring of sympathy and comfort for our \ngrieving Nation. I was touched by their sympathy and care for America. \nI was also pleased so many countries helped us to follow the money \ntrails which led to the arrest and prosecution of countless terrorists.\n  In the years since that terrible day, justice has also been delivered \nby our brave service men and women who have once again answered the \ncall to duty and taken up arms to rid the world of the network of \nterror wherever it is found. Thanks to their efforts, nations that had \nnever known freedom before now dare to dream of a better tomorrow for \nthemselves and for their children. People who had lived in fear under \nthe tyranny of oppression will now have a say in their shared future as \ncitizens of the world. Those who had known nothing but anguish and \ndespair now have a reason to hope for a better life. The Middle East is \nstill in turmoil as the people reach for freedom and individual \nprosperity.\n  C.S. Lewis once said:\n\n       God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks to us in our \n     conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to \n     rouse a deaf world.\n\n  I think it is clear that the pain we felt that day was sufficient to \nrouse us to all the action as it opened our hearts and our minds to God \nand each other.\n  In the days to come, the memories of all we witnessed on September 11 \nwill stay with us and serve as a constant reminder that freedom isn't \nfree. It often comes to us at all too great a cost. In that spirit we \nwill never forget those who lost their lives that day, their loved ones \nand all who knew them and called them their friends. For this \ngeneration and those who follow, their memory will continue to inspire \nus to be ever vigilant and constantly on guard at the gates of freedom \nto ensure that this ``one nation, under God, indivisible'' will \ncontinue to be the home of ``liberty and justice for all,'' for \nourselves, for our children, and for many generations to come.\n  Let's remember September 11 and the feelings we had for our country \nand each other. May we rekindle the sense of community, country, and \nworld we felt then. May lasting good come out of chaos.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Mr. President, if we would pause a few minutes and think \nabout what has gone on in America this year: We have had flooding on \nthe Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and other rivers in the Midwest. To \nshow the power of this flood, on the Mississippi River alone there are \n3 million acres underwater--farmland. We have had devastating tornadoes \nin the South. These tornadoes don't have names but they have a \nviciousness that is hard to comprehend. In Joplin, MO, about 200 people \nwere killed. There was devastation. It is believed those winds reached \nnearly 300 miles an hour. Some say they are the highest recorded winds \never. They eliminated everything in their path.\n  Wildfires in the South and the West have been extremely harsh. Take \nTexas alone. Fires have been burning in Texas for the last month. Two \nthousand homes have been destroyed, burned to the ground. The fires are \nstill present. I heard today that they are about 50 percent controlled.\n  We now have had Hurricane Irene. The wake of damage from Hurricane \nIrene hit numerous States, States that usually have no damage, all up \nthe coast. Vermont has no coastline but they were devastated. Hundreds \nof bridges were washed out in Vermont. Vermont is a sparsely populated \nState. There are about 600,000 people, I understand, in the whole \nState, but it has been really hurt. The largest office complex in the \nwhole State, with some 1,700 employees, is out of operation, \nunderwater.\n  Tropical Storm Lee quickly followed Irene. Tropical Storm Lee has \nleft damage in lots of places. We haven't been hurt real hard here in \nthe metropolitan area of the District of Columbia. I have been here \nquite a while and I can never remember it raining for a week at a time, \nbut that is what we just had. It rained basically all last week. The \nPotomac River is very high, but other States have been hurt worse by \nTropical Storm Lee. I don't remember the exact number of deaths because \nof Lee, but it is approximately 20. Here in Virginia a 12-year-old boy \nin his backyard was washed away.\n  Since the first of this year, President Obama has issued disaster \ndeclarations\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nfor 48 States and the hurricane season is not over yet. The Commerce \nDepartment said this year we have had 10 disasters, each with more than \n$1 billion in damage, and $1 billion is an understatement when you talk \nabout what happened with Irene. They say that will reach $25 billion, \nthat one storm. That is the most we have had in decades--probably the \nmost ever.\n  No one should be surprised that the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency is about broke. As of today, they have a few hundred million \ndollars left, probably in the $300 million range. In just the last 2 \nweeks, FEMA spent almost $400 million out of the fund for Hurricane \nIrene and other disasters. That should not be out of that fund. That \nshould be forward funded. So FEMA is dangerously close to running out \nof money.\n  To make sure FEMA will have enough money to meet the immediate needs \nfor food, water, and emergency housing for victims of new disasters, on \nAugust 28 FEMA stopped approving funding for disaster recovery projects \nfrom past disasters. This means funding is on hold to rebuild schools, \nhospitals, roads, public utilities from past disasters like Katrina, \nRita, Gustav, and Ike, the Mississippi River flood of 2008--they are \nstill doing work there to renovate that area--the Tennessee flood of \n2010 and tornadoes in Missouri and Alabama of days past. So we have \nhundreds of millions of dollars that need to be spent in places such as \nJoplin, MO. They are not spending money there in Joplin, MO. After all \nthey have been through there, no money.\n\n  The need is urgent. That is why we are seeking to move to the House-\npassed revenue measure to serve as a vehicle for disaster relief. The \nHouse insists, as they should, that because of our Constitution's \nOrigination Clause, all appropriation measures have to originate in the \nHouse. So we had to take a bill--the House bill we have here on the \ncalendar--and that is why we have to move to the Burma revenue measure \ntonight to allow the Senate to address this disaster assistance.\n  The Burma sanctions bill is a bill that the Republican leader has \nbeen out in front of for ages. He has been the watchdog of this \nterrible war and adverse nature that is taking place in Burma. He has \nbeen out front on this issue, and I appreciate that very much.\n  Every year we pass these Burma sanctions unanimously. No one opposes \nthem. The only reason anyone might be holding up this Burma sanctions \nbill is because my friends on the other side of the aisle, the \nRepublicans, do not want to allow the Senate to vote on disaster \nassistance. Why do we need to do that? How much more specific do I need \nto be? We need to help communities hit hard by flooding, tornadoes, \nhurricanes, and other acts of God. I would think twice if I were one of \nmy Republican friends. I have gone over some of the areas where these \ntornadoes and these fires and other natural disasters have occurred and \nthis is our only hope of getting help for these States.\n  The House is indicating they are going to send us a bill, but they \nare playing around the edges of what needs to be done. We have a bill \nthat was reported basically out of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee--from Democrats and from Republicans--supporting it. What is \nneeded is about $9 billion. We want to be in keeping with the Budget \nDeficit Reduction Act because in there we are allowed $7 billion. That \nis the number we are going to put forward tomorrow on this bill. It \nwould be a real shame if we are not allowed to move to this Burma \nsanctions bill because everyone voting no to proceed to this is voting \nno on assistance to these States. There is no other way to do it. We \nare not going to accept some small number the House sends over. We \ncannot do that. The House is planning on doing some of its usual \nstuff--I will say that in a positive sense--in sending us a continuing \nresolution that we must enact by the end of this month, and they want \nto stick in the funding for FEMA, which is very low. We cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  I hope everyone tonight at 5:30 will vote to allow us to go forward \non this most important piece of legislation.\n  I would ask that the quorum call begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, our country is in a very serious \neconomic crisis. We are told by Mr. Erskine Bowles and Senator Alan \nSimpson--Erskine Bowles was chosen by President Obama to head his debt \ncommission. They gave a statement to the Budget Committee, on which I \nam ranking member, that this Nation has never faced a more predictable \neconomic crisis based on the size of our debt. All of us know that.\n  The American people are angry with us. They cannot believe it is \npossible we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. We are \nspending $3.7 trillion this fiscal year ending September 30. We will \ntake in $2.2 trillion, give or take a few hundred billion. This is not \nacceptable. We cannot continue.\n  How did it happen? How is it possible we are borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar that goes out the door, increasing the permanent debt of \nthe United States? Well, one way is what is happening now before us on \nthe bill that is being moved today by Majority Leader Reid. It would \nadd $6.9 billion to the FEMA account for emergencies. We just saw the \nlegislation less than an hour ago, maybe 30 minutes ago. Has anybody \ngiven any serious thought to that? Seven billion dollars? The general \nfund budget of the State of Alabama is $2 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, $7 billion is a lot of money, and we have not looked \nat it, we have not thought about it. It is above the budget, I guess \nabove our budget numbers. We do not have a budget. Senator Reid said \nearlier this year it would be foolish to have a budget--foolish to have \na budget. We are now well over 860 days in this Senate without having \npassed a budget. Is that another reason we are spending the country \ninto bankruptcy?\n  Well, I do not think this is an appropriate thing. I strongly oppose \nadding another emergency debt spending bill where we have not carefully \nexamined every penny of it to make sure it is all necessary and \nappropriate. No one has seen those numbers and the analysis that would \njustify it.\n  I come from a State that was hammered with the worst series of \ntornadoes we have ever suffered in Alabama. I have been to those \ncommunities and towns and seen those families who have lost all they \nhad, who have lost loved ones and have injured family members. I know \nwe are going to need to have emergency spending for those programs. We \nhave fires in Texas and we also have flooding. We know that.\n  We have certain money set aside for emergencies already. How much \nmore do we need to spend? I do not know yet.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nI wish to have some very careful expert analysis done before we \nannounce another $7 billion.\n  Forgive me if I am frustrated. I think the American people are \nfrustrated. We went through a continual battle for weeks, months, \nreally, over the debt ceiling. I did not like the way that bill was \nwritten. I know we had to face up to it, though, and do some things. So \nwe finally reached an agreement. I did not vote for it in the end. But \nit was supposed to save $2.1 trillion to $2.5 trillion--$2,500 billion, \n$2,000 billion--over 10 years.\n  Next year--the fiscal year beginning October 1--it would reduce the \nspending for next year by $7 billion--the very same amount now the \nmajority leader wants us to throw in on top of that as emergency \nspending, not within our spending limits, not controlled by our \nspending limits, wiping out that entire saving for next year.\n  Add on top of that, the President has now announced he wants to spend \n$450 billion more. And do not worry, it will be paid for, he told us in \nthe speech Thursday night. How would it be paid for? Well, we will have \nthis debt committee--I will send them a note and say: You cut another \n$450 billion over 10 years. Just promise that you will cut another $450 \nbillion over 10 years, and I will spend $450 billion now. That is the \nway we are heading down the road to uncontrollable debt.\n  I understand the President has announced he wants to raise taxes on \nbusinesses and all by $450 billion, and we may get a proposal on how to \ndo that today. I do not know. We will see how it turns out. I expect to \nread it. I would expect the President, if he is serious, would tell us \nprecisely what taxes he intends to increase and how much they will \nbring in. We have to pass it now, we are told, but we have not seen the \nlegislation, to my knowledge, yet. They promised it today.\n  This is not, in my humble opinion, sound management. The President of \nthe United States has an Office of Management and Budget. Four hundred, \nfive hundred people work there. He is the superintendent of every \nCabinet department in our country. They all work at his pleasure. The \nsubcabinet people work for him. He has the entire agencies he can call \non to help produce proposals--the Commerce Department, the Treasury \nDepartment--on what taxes to raise and what taxes not to, how much \nshould be brought in.\n  We have opportunities. The President has the staff to send us a \ndetailed proposal about what kind of emergency spending we ought to be \nundertaking. I do not know if Senator Reid conjured this up among his \nstaff or whether he has gotten a detailed proposal from the House, from \nthe President.\n  Suffice it to say, I hope my colleagues will not move forward to a \nbill that contains $7 billion in new spending above our statutory \nlimits that were passed in this debt ceiling--why? Basically to obviate \nthe need of having a budget.\n  We need not to be moving to legislation and rushing through that kind \nof new spending program because that is precisely how it is that day \nafter day, week after week, we have increased spending in this country \nto the point that it cannot be sustained.\n  Every witness before the Budget Committee has told us we are on an \nunsustainable path. I just had occasion to go over the food stamp \nnumbers. I knew the food stamp numbers had been going up. When \nPresident Bush left office, we were spending $31 billion, I believe it \nwas, on food stamps. This year we will spend $79 billion. President \nObama will have doubled spending on food stamps--doubled it--in 3 \nyears, not 4. His first year in office, food stamp spending increased \n46 percent.\n  We need to look under the hood of the engine of this program. We want \nto be sure poor people have food. We are willing to do that. Everybody \nis. But at a time of fiscal challenge for our Nation, a time of the \nlargest debt we have ever seen, we have to examine all of our programs. \nCan we justify those kinds of increases? Can we justify emergency \nspending that is unthought out and not carefully accounted for? I do \nnot think so. I think we should not go to legislation that seeks to do \nthat, and I would oppose cloture on this legislation if that is what is \nhappening, as I believe it is.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, as the Senate votes on H.J. Res. 66, a joint \nresolution to renew the sanctions in the 2003 Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act, it is important to acknowledge that over the past year \nBurma has undergone a series of changes that may have the potential to \npoint toward a new direction for the country, after years of isolation \nand repression. On November 7, 2010, Burma held its first election in \n20 years. With limited international observation, most will argue that \nthe election was neither free nor fair. Yet it cannot be denied that \nthe election process initiated a new political dialogue in the country, \nwith candidates participating from more than 37 political parties.\n  The election resulted in a new governmental system and opportunities \nfor engagement. Burma is now in the midst of a key transitional period \nthat has yielded greater opportunities for interaction with government \nleaders and civil society, and restructuring of government and military \ninstitutions. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest after \nthe election has also been an important benchmark in this process. Her \nrepeated interactions with government leaders are a significant step \nforward in encouraging a democratic process and reconciliation within \nthe country.\n  There are clear indications of a new openness from the government, \nand the United States should be prepared to adjust our policy toward \nBurma accordingly. In reauthorizing this legislation, it should be \nnoted that the 2003 Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act gives the \nPresident the authority to waive the prohibitions on any or all imports \nfrom Burma if doing so is in the national interest of the United \nStates. I am hopeful that there will be opportunities to closely \nexamine any substantive improvements in our relations during this \ntransitional period, and to take advantage of all of the tools at our \ndisposal to facilitate Burmese economic development, political \nreconciliation, and ultimately greater progress toward democratic \ngovernance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe joint resolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year.\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort once again by Senator \nMcConnell, a true champion for democracy, human rights and the rule of \nlaw in Burma.\n  The House passed this resolution unanimously on July 20 and I urge \nthe Senate to begin action on it now by supporting the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed.\n  These sanctions expired on July 26 and we should extend them as soon \nas possible.\n  We must send a message to the people of Burma that we continue to \nstand with them in their struggle for a truly representative \ngovernment.\n  I have been involved in the struggle for freedom and democracy in \nBurma for over 10 years.\n  In 1997, former Senator William Cohen and I authored legislation \nrequiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma if he \ndetermined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, re-\narrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale repression \nor violence against the democratic opposition.\n  President Clinton issued the ban in a 1997 Executive order and the \nban remains on the books today.\n  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, \nSenator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003 which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It \nallowed that ban to be renewed 1 year at a time.\n  It was signed into law and has been renewed one year at a time since \nthen. A renewal of that ban is now before us today.\n  Since we last debated the import ban on the Senate floor, we have \nreceived one piece of good news.\n  On November 13, 2010, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the \ndemocratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, was released from house \narrest.\n  Her latest detention lasted more than 7, and in total she has spent \nthe better part of the last 20 years in prison or under house arrest.\n  Her release was wonderful news for those of us who are inspired by \nher courage, her dedication to peace and her tireless efforts for \nfreedom and democracy for the people of Burma.\n  Yet our joy was tempered by the fact that her release came just days \nafter a\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nfraudulent and illegitimate election for a new parliament that was \nbased on a sham constitution.\n  The regime's intent was clear: keep the voice of the true leader of \nBurma silent long enough to solidify their grip on power using the \nfalse veneer of a democratic process.\n  Neither I, the people of Burma, nor the international community were \nfooled.\n  We all know that the last truly free parliamentary elections were \noverwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy in \n1990, but annulled by the military junta, then named the State Law and \nOrder Restoration Council or SLORC.\n  In 1992, this military government announced plans to draft a new \nconstitution to pave the way for a return to civilian rule.\n  Yet the human rights abuses and the suppression of Suu Kyi and the \ndemocratic opposition continued and no constitution emerged.\n  In 1997, the junta changed its name to the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, SPDC, in a vain attempt to put a more positive \nspin on its oppressive rule and lack of democratic legitimacy in the \neyes of its people and the international community.\n  Again, nothing changed.\n  The new constitution was drafted in secret and without the input of \nthe democratic opposition led by Suu Kyi and her National League for \nDemocracy.\n  It was approved in an illegitimate referendum held just days after \nCyclone Nargis devastated the country in May 2008 setting up elections \nwhich eventually took place in November 2010.\n  It set aside 25 percent of the seats in the new 440 seat House of \nRepresentatives for the military.\n  That is in addition to the seats won in the November, 2010 elections \nby the Union Solidarity and Development Party, which was founded by the \nmilitary junta's Prime Minister Thein Sein and 22 of his fellow cabinet \nmembers who resigned from the army to form a so-called ``civilian'' \npolitical party.\n  The constitution barred Suu Kyi from running in the parliamentary \nelections.\n  And it forced the National League for Democracy to shut its doors \nbecause it would not kick Suu Kyi out of the party.\n  It should come as no surprise that the military-backed party won \nnearly 80 percent of the seats in the new parliament.\n  In addition to preventing Suu Kyi and the National League for \nDemocracy from competing in the elections, the regime ensured that no \ninternational monitors would oversee the elections and journalists \nwould be prohibited from covering the election from inside Burma.\n  President Obama correctly stated that the elections ``were neither \nfree nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted \nstandards associated with legitimate elections.''\n  The National League for Democracy described the elections and the \nformation of a new government as reducing ``democratization in Burma to \na parody.''\n  Indeed, the new parliament elected Thein Sein, the last Prime \nMinister of the junta's State Peace and Development Council, as Burma's \nnew president.\n  He is reported to be heavily influenced by Burma's senior military \nleader and former head of state, General Than Shwe.\n  The names change--the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the \nState Peace and Development Council, the Union Solidarity and \nDevelopment Party--but the faces, the lack of democracy, the human \nrights abuses and the lawlessness remain the same.\n  So while we celebrate the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, we recognize \nthat Burma is not free and the regime has failed to take the necessary \nsteps to lift the import ban.\n  As called for in the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we \nmust stand by the people of Burma and keep the pressure on the military \nregime to: end violations of internationally recognized human rights; \nrelease all political prisoners; allow freedom of speech and press; \nallow freedom of association; permit the peaceful exercise of religion; \nand bring to a conclusion an agreement between the military regime and \nthe National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic minorities on the \nrestoration of a democratic government.\n  By every measure, the regime has failed to make progress in any of \nthese areas.\n  We cannot reward the regime for 2,100 political prisoners, the use of \nchild soldiers or the persecution of ethnic minorities. We can't reward \nthe use of rape as an instrument of war or the continued use of \ntorture. And we can't reward the use of forced labor or the wholesale \ndisplacement of civilians.\n  Until the regime changes its behavior and embraces positive, \ndemocratic change, we have no choice but to press on with the import \nban as a part of a strong sanctions program.\n  This must include tough banking sanctions.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to once again urge the \nadministration to put additional pressure on the ruling military junta \nby exercising the authority for additional banking sanctions on its \nleaders and followers as mandated by section 5 of the Block Burmese \nJunta's Anti-Democratic Efforts Act.\n  Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the effectiveness of the \nimport ban and other sanctions on Burma and the impact on the people of \nBurma.\n  I understand their concerns. I am disappointed that we have not seen \nmore progress towards freedom and democracy in Burma.\n  But let us listen to the voice of the democratic opposition in Burma \non the efficacy of sanctions:\n  A paper released by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for \nDemocracy in February 2011 argues that sanctions are not targeted at \nthe general population and are not to blame for the economic ills of \nthe country.\n  Rather, the economy suffers due to mismanagement, cronyism, \ncorruption and the lack of the rule of law.\n  The best way for the Burmese government to get the sanctions lifted, \nthe paper argues, is to make progress on democracy, human rights, and \nthe rule of law. It concludes:\n\n       Now more than ever there is an urgent need to call for an \n     all inclusive political process. The participation of a broad \n     spectrum of political forces is essential to the achievement \n     of national reconciliation in Burma. Progress in the \n     democratization process, firmly grounded in national \n     reconciliation, and the release of political prisoners should \n     be central to any consideration of changes in sanctions \n     policies.\n\n  I agree.\n  So, let us once again do our part and stand in solidarity with Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and the people of Burma.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and vote \nyes on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5490-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5490-S5493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, Americans across the country \ngathered to remember the thousands of innocent lives that were taken so \ncruelly and indiscriminately in the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001. Although a decade has passed, I vividly remember that tragic day. \nI was right here in Washington when American Airlines flight 77 struck \nthe Pentagon. It was a defining moment for our country. Congress acted \nswiftly to create a fund to aid victims of the attacks, and we worked \nin a bipartisan manner to update our laws to counter these new enemies. \nIn the years since September 11, 2001, the threat that violent \nextremists pose to America has endured, if not increased. Fortunately, \nthe increased attention to preventing terrorist attacks by both the \nBush and Obama administrations has prevented another large scale \nattack, and foiled numerous plots.\n  As we remember the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the \nsoldiers and National Guard members who we have lost in the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, we should also reflect on the lessons we have \nlearned. In the aftermath of this tragedy, it became clear that turf \nbattles between Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and \na resulting lack of information sharing between these agencies, \ncontributed to the failures that allowed the hijackers to enter the \ncountry and evade authorities. In addition,\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, possessed deficient and \noutdated technology. It suffered from a woeful lack of skilled \ntranslators in key languages, and did not have sufficient numbers of \ncounterterrorism analysts to swiftly absorb and comprehend intelligence \ninformation. Each of these factors contributed to the Government's \nfailure to connect the dots prior to the attacks.\n  Faced with these issues and a new type of threat, our law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies were forced to adapt. Over the past decade, I \nhave worked to ensure that our Federal agencies have the tools they \nneed to make our borders more secure, improve our intelligence \ngathering, track down terrorists, and bring them to justice. Having \nexpedited the hiring of translators and armed with upgraded technology, \nthe FBI can now operate and communicate more efficiently. I have also \nsupported efforts to refine government surveillance authority to allow \nagencies to gather the information they need to prevent additional \nattacks.\n  However, along with these expanded authorities, I have also worked to \ninclude essential oversight and accountability measures to ensure that \nthese new powers do not go unchecked. The most intrusive surveillance \nauthorities of the USA PATRIOT Act are subject to sunsets, which \nrequire Congress to revisit how the authorities have been used. \nCombined with inspector general audits and public reporting \nrequirements, the American people and Congress can regularly scrutinize \nthe use of these surveillance tools. The importance of oversight and \nsupervision of Government powers to protect civil liberties was \nimportant before September 11, 2001, and even more critical after. \nWhile I firmly believe in keeping our Nation safe, relinquishing our \nfreedoms and values will only weaken our ability to fight terrorism.\n  Ten years after September 11, 2001, the ability of our intelligence \ncommunity to collect and analyze information has drastically improved. \nHowever, despite these improvements, we have vast amounts of \ninformation that can become overwhelming and lead to lapses in national \nsecurity, such as the shootings at Fort Hood and the attempted \nChristmas Day bombing in 2009. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I remain committed to ensuring that we continue to adapt and \nrespond to evolving threats in order to keep this country safe from \nanother terrorist attack, while upholding the rule of law and \nprotecting critical civil liberties and privacy protections.\n  Although some of the national security policies and tactics of the \npast decade have caused divisiveness and controversy, President Obama \ndelivered news on May 1, in which all Americans could take comfort. \nJustice had finally been served to Osama bin Laden for his atrocities. \nWhile the death of Osama bin Laden will never bring all of his victims \nback, we hope that it may help bring closure to all those who still \ngrieve over their loss. The hard work of our brave American service \nmembers, who have sacrificed so much, made this mission a success for \nthe benefit of an entire country.\n  As we commemorate the sacrifices of so many that took place 10 years \nago and in the wars since, we must continue to dedicate ourselves to \nupholding and strengthening the principles and values that define our \ndemocratic Nation. That is what distinguishes us from those who \nattacked us on September 11, 2001, it is what ultimately enable us to \ndefeat them, and it is what people around the world expect from us.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, throughout this past week, Americans \nare observing the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks on our Nation. As we have properly done so many times since \nthat horrific day, we remember and honor the innocent who perished in \nthe Twin Towers, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, PA. We remember \nand honor the many brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives \nto defend this great country, from the heroes of flight 93, to the \nfirst responders and members of our military and intelligence \ncommunity. We share in the grief still endured by so many families \nwhose lives were permanently changed by this attack, and we resolve \nthat their sacrifices will not be in vain.\n  In the wake of 9/11, one question has been asked repeatedly, but has \nyet to be answered completely: how can we better protect our homeland \nfrom another attack? As with so many difficult questions, finding an \nanswer must begin with the acknowledgment that something went terribly \nwrong. Many experts, within and outside the government, have studied \nthe intelligence failures leading up to 9/11. Certainly, there were \nclear warnings that our national security was at risk, including the \nfirst World Trade Center attack, the East Africa Embassy bombings, and \nthe attack on the USS Cole. We all know those warnings were not heeded, \nmistakes were made, intelligence was not connected as it should have \nbeen, and our policies simply did not reflect the serious threat we \nwere, and indeed still are, facing.\n  We often hear that, as a government, we have made a lot of progress \nin preventing another attack. The operation that killed Osama bin Laden \nshowcased the progress that our military and intelligence community \nhave made in working together to neutralize terrorists. Just as the \ndisruption of the plot to attack the New York subway system in 2009 \ndemonstrated the continuing transformation of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation from a criminally-focused law enforcement agency to a \nfull member of the intelligence community.\n  But, our record in preventing terrorist attacks here at home has not \nbeen perfect. In 2009, fourteen servicemembers were killed in attacks \non military facilities in Little Rock, AR, and Fort Hood, TX. Christmas \nDay 2009 brought the attempted bombing of an airplane over the skies of \nDetroit, an attack that if successful would likely have killed, at a \nminimum, all 289 people on board. A few months later, disaster was \naverted in Times Square only because explosives inside a vehicle failed \nto ignite.\n  Our successes and failures since 9/11 can teach us a lot about what \nwe are doing right and where we must do better. First and foremost, we \nmust all remain vigilant. I have heard it repeated in recent months, \nespecially since the death of Osama bin Laden, that al-Qaida has been \nmarginalized and they are not the threat they once were. In certain \nrespects, this is accurate, but as we saw just this past weekend with \nthe heightened concern that al-Qaida operatives would attack New York \nCity or Washington, DC, al-Qaida remains a threat. We must also \nremember that al-Qaida has many facets and none of them are benign. We \nknow that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula today represents the \nbiggest threat to our homeland and they are continually seeking new \nrecruits, especially among our own citizens and former Guantanamo \ndetainees. Their new status manifested itself with the Christmas Day \nbombing attempt, for which they immediately claimed responsibility.\n  Our country faces many different threats, from terrorism to hostile \nnation states to cyber attacks. We cannot afford to grow complacent or \nundo the progress we have made. I have heard too often that the \nintelligence community ``can live with'' changes to the PATRIOT Act, \nthe FISA Amendments Act, or other classified authorities that are vital \nto preventing terrorist attacks. Prior to 9/11, we forced the \nintelligence community to ``live with'' many unnecessary restrictions \nand I believe that is a gamble we can no longer afford to take.\n  Second, we must ensure that the same mistakes that contributed to the \nSeptember 11 attacks are not repeated. Following the failed Christmas \nDay attack, the Senate Intelligence Committee conducted an in-depth \nreview to determine what intelligence there was leading up to the \nattack. The committee concluded that there were systemic breakdowns \nacross the intelligence community that contributed to the failure to \nidentify the threat posed by the Christmas Day bomber. Senator Burr and \nI submitted additional views to the report noting that some of the very \nsame intelligence failures identified by the committee were also cited \nas failures leading up to 9/11, including a lack of aggressive analysis \nand insufficient technology to facilitate sharing and analysis of \ninformation. Compounding our concerns was the fact that the National \nCounterterrorism Center, NCTC, created in response to 9/11, still did \nnot seem to understand\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nits statutory responsibility to integrate and analyze all terrorism-\nrelated intelligence. After so many years--and so much effort to reform \nthe old ways of doing business--repeating the same mistakes is not an \noption. I am encouraged that, since the committee's report, NCTC has \ntaken concrete steps towards meeting this responsibility and I am \ncommitted to ensuring they continue on this path.\n  I am also committed to ensuring that we do not retreat from the \nprogress made in improving information sharing. Following 9/11 there \nwere concerted efforts to remove stovepipes within the intelligence \ncommunity and get the information to analysts who needed it. \nUnfortunately, some of the old tendencies to restrict intelligence are \nrecurring, particularly amid concerns about Wikileaks. I share the \nanger about the many leaks of classified information that have \njeopardized successful intelligence programs, such as the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program and the CIA's interrogation program. But we must \nbe careful not to overreact by restricting access to information that \nanalysts need to do their jobs.\n  Third, our policies and laws must promote effective intelligence \ncollection, specifically with respect to detainees and foreign \nintelligence surveillance laws. Since the President ordered the closure \nof the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in January 2009, our nation \nhas been without a clear policy for detaining suspected terrorists. \nWithout such a policy, including one that identifies a facility for \nholding terrorists captured outside Afghanistan, the intelligence \ncommunity's ability to conduct intelligence interrogations is being \nseverely limited. I recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all \nsolution for handling terrorists, but our detention policies must \nfoster full intelligence collection, before any prosecution begins. Yet \nour default seems to be that terrorists, such as the Christmas Day \nbomber, should be treated like ordinary criminals, given their Miranda \nrights, and prosecuted in Federal court, with all the protections \nenjoyed by criminal defendants. This means the opportunity for any \ninterrogation, much less one that allows for in-depth intelligence \nquestions, may be very short lived.\n  The bottom line is that the intelligence community cannot conduct \neffective interrogations without an established policy that includes a \nplace for those interrogations to occur. While the administration \nmaintains its intent to close Guantanamo Bay, I believe the facility \nthere which I have visited and found to be impressive remains the best \noption for holding terrorists, like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, captured \noff the coast of Yemen and transferred for prosecution after only 60 \ndays of interrogation. Many of my colleagues, as well as the American \npeople, have made clear that bringing suspected terrorists into the \nUnited States is not a good solution. Moreover, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nand the other terrorists housed at Guantanamo Bay are not likely to \nleave there any time soon, especially as the recidivism rate among \nformer detainees continues to rise. But regardless of whether \nGuantanamo or another facility outside the United States is selected, \nit is well past time for the President to come up with a long-term \ndetention policy that allows for full and effective intelligence \ncollection. Many of my colleagues and I have been asking for this \npolicy, with no success. Quite simply, our intelligence community \ncannot afford further delays. Congress must stand ready to pass \nlegislation that ensures our intelligence interrogations of suspected \nterrorists are not cut short because of arbitrary timelines or \npotential criminal proceedings.\n  Congress must also make permanent the remaining provisions in the USA \nPATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are \nsubject to sunsets. Continually revisiting these laws because of \narbitrary sunsets does not facilitate oversight, especially when we \nknow that there have been no intentional abuses of these authorities. \nMoreover, each time we get into a public debate about how some of our \nmost sensitive intelligence collection authorities are used, our \nenemies learn that much more about our methods. We know they pay \nattention to our laws and readjust their own communication methods in \norder to defeat our surveillance. This makes the intelligence \ncommunity's job that much harder. We cannot expect intelligence \nanalysts to put together vital pieces of information if we do not \ncollect the information in the first place. It is time for Congress to \ngive them permanent tools to do their jobs.\n  Our Nation, our families, and our communities have suffered \ntremendously because of the September 11 terrorist attacks. We must not \nforget that suffering, nor should we ever lose sight of the failures \nthat prevented us from averting this tragedy in the first place. We \nmust remain vigilant. Our Nation is fortunate to be blessed with \noutstanding men and women in the armed forces and our intelligence \ncommunity who serve tirelessly to protect and defend us, wherever the \nthreat. We owe them our thanks and our support. As we remember those \nwho have sacrificed so much in this fight against terrorism, we must \nresolve to do all that is possible to protect and preserve our great \nNation and our way of life.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of September 11, 2001.\n  This year, like every year that has passed since, our nation reflects \nback on the horrific attacks that cost the lives of 2,977 men, women, \nand children in New York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon, and on the \nbrave men and women who have laid their lives down since then in \ndefense of the freedoms and security we so often take for granted.\n  These coordinated attacks on our Nation had such a profound impact on \nour society and our world view that we now look at our recent history \nin two different phases, pre-9/11 and post-9/11. They made us more \naware of the threats that we face as a nation, and they woke us up to \nthe cold reality that the things we hold most dear as Americans are the \nvery things that make us a target for terrorism.\n  However, these attacks and our collective response had a much deeper, \nmore profound impact than that--they brought us together in a way that \nnothing else has since the Second World War, and they underscored the \nsame spirit that has characterized our Nation and its citizens since \nAmerica's founding. It is this spirit that truly sets America apart and \nmakes us unique. It is a sense of perseverance and determination, a \nloyalty to our fellow Americans, and the willingness to risk it all for \nwhat we believe in. This spirit was forged in the fires of revolution, \ngrew strong in the face of adversity, and has defined the character of \nour Nation since its inception.\n  These attacks were not just directed at buildings and people. They \nwere meant to hit us at our core, to attack our very way of life and \neverything we stand for. They sought to instill fear and doubt in us, \nbut they failed. They sought to intimidate us and disrupt our \ncommunities, but they failed. What they did was bind us together in a \nunified front to stand up to these injustices and push forward with the \nsame spirit and character that the terrorists sought to destroy. We \nstood together, and in one collective voice said, ``We will not be \nintimidated, and we will not be held down. We are Americans, and we \nstand together.''\n  Ten years have passed since that fateful September morning, and not \nan American alive at the time will ever forget the horrors of that day. \nThose whom we lost will remain in our hearts forever, and images of the \naftermath are permanently engrained in our memories. We came together \nto cope with a national tragedy and were reminded not of those things \nthat divide us, but of those things that unify us. In the wake of \ntragedy, we found hope.\n  Though a decade has passed since then, I urge all Americans to look \nback to the days and weeks that followed 9/11 and remember that sense \nof unity and patriotism that was so prevalent. Though it is our \ndiversity and differences that, in part, make us such a great and \nunique Nation, it is our common bonds that make us Americans. Let us \nput our differences aside and once again focus on those things that \nbind us, for we are all Americans, and we will forever be one nation \nunder God.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5493-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      SPECIALIST DENNIS G.

Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to call the Senate's \nattention to the economic development contributions of Peter Van Oot, a \nfriend and former member of my staff. Pete, a native of Westminster, \nVT, has long served his community and our State with dedication and \nenthusiasm. Through his work with the Brattleboro Economic Development \nCredit Corporation board, and, more recently, the Green Mountain \nEconomic Development Corporation, Pete has worked tirelessly to create \njobs and to promote our local economy. Named Volunteer of the Year by \nthe Northeast Economic Development Association, Pete was recently \nrecognized for his hard work, and I take this opportunity to offer him \nmy congratulations. I ask unanimous consent that an August 8 article \nhighlighting his work, in the Brattleboro Reformer, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n     Local Lawyer Recognized for His Commitment to Economic Growth\n\n             [From the Brattleboro Reformer, Aug. 8, 2011]\n\n                            (By Josh Stilts)\n\n       Brattleboro.--Peter D. Van Oot's said his vision of a \n     healthy community starts with a strong local economy. Because \n     of this commitment and his unwavering focus, which he \n     attributes to his father, Van Oot was named Volunteer of the \n     Year by the Northeast Economic Development Association.\n       Without access to good paying, secure jobs, the education \n     system falters and it can easily lead to social injustice, he \n     said.\n       ``When mom and dad don't have a job anymore, bad things can \n     happen,'' he said.\n       That's why in his 20s, Van Oot dedicated his spare time to \n     establishing outlets for businesses to grow and to figure out \n     ways to draw large employers to the area.\n       Van Oot grew up in Westminster and said he can remember \n     when there were plenty of jobs and how much happier the \n     residents seemed. After earning his law degree, he returned \n     to the area and began working at Downs Rachlin Martin PLLC \n     and nearly simultaneously started volunteering on the United \n     Way of Windham County board.\n       ``I realized quickly that if we didn't work to shore up the \n     Windham County economy, all the organizations would be for \n     naught,'' Van Oot said. ``Without good-paying jobs and a \n     solid local economy you lose the base of the community.''\n       As unemployment rises, the strains on organizations such as \n     the United Way and Youth Services becomes almost too much, he \n     said.\n       About a decade ago he shifted his focus and began serving \n     on the Brattleboro Economic Development Credit Corporation \n     board.\n       ``My interest really became how do we bring jobs to the \n     area to fulfill the ones that left and bolster the economy,'' \n     Van Oot said. ``It was a fantastic organization to work with. \n     In the past two years we really did some great work. We've \n     had economic development success with Grafton Cheese's retail \n     store and brining in the Common Wealth Yogurt factory.''\n       Not only do those businesses provide good paying jobs, \n     they're also using Vermont based resources, Van Oot said.\n       ``It really helps to fill the economic gaps,'' he said. \n     ``Like in golf, we need to fill in the divots.''\n       Van Oot said there's a lot of people who have done and are \n     doing what he does but urged younger people to get involved.\n       ``Brattleboro had always been known as a community that had \n     people who were involved in the economy, in rotary clubs and \n     boards like the United Way,'' he said. ``But now it's much \n     more difficult to get younger business people involved in \n     these types of activities.''\n       He added that reaching out to young entrepreneurs has \n     already started to bear fruit.\n       ``Look at what they're doing with the BDCC small business \n     competitions,'' Van Oot said. ``What a great way to get \n     people involved.''\n       Jeff Lewis, executive director of the Brattleboro Economic \n     Development Credit Corporation, said Van Oot was a champion \n     of growing the local economy.\n       ``Pete worked tirelessly to promote economic development in \n     southern Vermont during his many years in Brattleboro,'' \n     Lewis said. ``His focus and leadership helped the \n     organization create dynamic strategy that addressed \n     widespread economic decline in the region.''\n       Lewis added that Van Oot transformed the board's \n     membership, created a robust public policy, orchestrated \n     annual plan reviews and developed a BDCC CEO council.\n       ``BDCC now annually exceeds its goals for economic \n     development and its own financial stability,'' Lewis said. \n     ``Based on Pete's work with the board, BDCC is now leading a \n     regional strategy project looking to address long-term job \n     and population loss, and the prospective loss of the region's \n     largest employer.''\n       In the last couple of years Van Oot has transitioned from \n     his Brattleboro office to the firm's Lebanon location, and it \n     was there he got involved with another group, the Green \n     Mountain Economic Development Corporation, which is similarly \n     focused on creating community through jobs.\n       ``Pete has brought that same deep level of commitment to \n     his role on the board at GMEDC (that he had in \n     Brattleboro),'' said Joan Goldstein, the group's executive \n     director. ``Leadership of this type ought to be recognized \n     and I am pleased that NEDA saw it the same way we did.''\n       Van Oot will be presented his award at the NED's annual \n     meeting on Oct. 24 at the Sheraton Hotel in Burlington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5493-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5493-S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize \nSeptember 9, 2011, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \nAwareness Day. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD, is an umbrella \nterm describing the varied range of alcohol-related birth defects that \nmay result from the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The effects of \nthis disorder may involve mental, behavioral, and/or learning \ndisabilities. FASD is the leading known cause of preventable cognitive \nimpairment in America. It is estimated FASD effects 1 in 100 live \nbirths each year.\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\n  Unfortunately, my State of South Dakota suffers from one of the \nhighest incidences of FASDs in the Nation. While I applaud the ongoing \nefforts of local organizations, State governments and federal agencies \nto address the public health threat of FASD, I continue to have great \nconcern about this disorder's impact in South Dakota and across the \ncountry.\n  We must move past the stigma of this devastating disease to truly \nhelp those and their families who are affected by FASD get the health, \neducation, counseling and support services they need and deserve. We \nmust also address the tragedy of FASD at the source, by increasing \nawareness that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can have \nheartbreaking, lifelong effects. Education and outreach efforts must \ncontinue their focus of ensuring this message is understood by all \nwomen of child-bearing age and ensuring access to treatment and \ncounseling services for those at risk of substance abuse.\n  One of the most distressing facts regarding FASD is that it is \nentirely preventable. I have joined my colleagues in the Senate to \nintroduce and pass a resolution designating September 9, 2011 as \nNational FASD Awareness Day. It is my hope these efforts progress \ntowards global awareness of FASD and an end to this destructive \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5494-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION WEEK AND WORLD SUICIDE PREVENTION DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nthe 37th annual National Suicide Prevention Week, which began on \nSeptember 4 and culminated with World Suicide Prevention Day on \nSeptember 10. I take this opportunity to reflect on the destructive \neffects of suicide on families and communities and to raise awareness \nabout the need for an effective national suicide prevention strategy to \nhelp communities address this serious public mental health threat. \nSuicide is a major cause of premature death, and we must do more to \nprevent it.\n  The statistics about suicide are deeply concerning. In our Nation, \nsuicide is the 11th leading cause of death for all ages. Among young \nadults ages 15 through 24, there are approximately 100 to 200 attempts \nfor every completed suicide. Suicide takes the lives of approximately \n30,000 Americans each year, and a person dies by suicide almost every \n15 minutes. Our Nation's veterans account for 20 percent of suicides \nand the Army recently suffered a record number of suicides this past \nJuly.\n  In my State of South Dakota, suicide is the fourth-leading cause of \ndeath among all South Dakotans and the second-leading cause of death \nfor adolescents and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24. The \nrate of youth suicide in my State is over three times the national \naverage. These statistics place South Dakota among a group of Western \nStates that consistently has a higher rate of suicide than the rest of \nthe country.\n  Youth suicide among American Indians in South Dakota is of particular \nconcern. The suicide rate for American Indians ages 15 to 34 is more \nthan two times higher than the national average and is the second \nleading cause of death for this age group. The suicide rate for the \nRosebud Sioux Tribe is among the highest in the world. The loss of \nyoung people to suicide is a real crisis. On American Indian \nreservations in South Dakota, I have seen the catastrophic ripple \neffect that one suicide can have. Given the alarming occurrence of \n``suicide clusters'' and imitative deaths that have occurred in Indian \ncountry in the past, it is imperative to provide support for those at \nrisk.\n  Substance abuse and violence, two accepted risk factors for suicide, \nare common on the reservation, and tribe members also face extreme \npoverty and geographic isolation. During the past few years, I have \nbeen encouraged by the increased recognition of the need for suicide \nprevention programs in tribal areas. Tribes now have more access to \nfunds that will aid in the building of suicide prevention programs. \nHowever, we must continue to provide tribes with the resources they \nneed to implement culturally sensitive suicide prevention programs. It \nis critical to strengthen the social fabric to help improve mental \nhealth. Youth suicide prevention programs have helped bridge this \nservice gap, but further investments are necessary to sustain and \nexpand these efforts. Decreasing the number of suicides in Indian \ncountry will require increased community awareness, developing \neffective prevention and intervention methods, and enhancing access to \nmental health service providers.\n  Studies indicate the best way to prevent suicide is through early \nrecognition and treatment of depression and other psychiatric \nillnesses. Depression goes unrecognized in half of the general \npopulation and in 80 percent of seniors. Over 90 percent of suicide \nvictims have a significant psychiatric illness at the time of their \ndeath. These are often undiagnosed, untreated, or both.\n  Furthermore, it is necessary to acknowledge the obstacles that \nindividuals at risk of suicide face in accessing treatment. Lack of \ninsurance coverage, limited access to affordable mental health care, as \nwell as cultural stigmas and myths about suicide pose significant \nbarriers to treatment. A serious effort to prevent suicide must break \ndown those barriers and expand access to mental health services \nnationwide, with a special focus on increased mental health awareness \nand improving prevention and early intervention methods. In addition, \ninvestments in tools to evaluate intervention and prevention methods \nand training programs for health care professionals are needed to \nfoster the development and implementation of evidence-based and \nemerging best practices in the prevention of suicide.\n  National Suicide Prevention Week and World Suicide Prevention Day are \nreminders that suicide is a preventable cause of premature death that \ntears families and communities apart, and more can be done to prevent \nthese tragedies. Each day, families and communities across the Nation \nsuffer devastating losses as a result of suicide. It is estimated that \nfor each suicide, seven other lives are altered forever. Every year, \napproximately 200,000 people become survivors due to this tragic loss \nof life. Many suicide survivors are left devastated, confused and \nweakened by their loss. Friends and family often experience depression, \nguilt, shock and anger. Unfortunately, there remains a stigma \nsurrounding suicide and mental illness, and victims often shoulder some \nof the blame.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to increase awareness about the \ndestructive impact of suicide on America's families and communities and \nto raise awareness about the urgent need for an effective national \nsuicide prevention strategy to help communities prevent future losses \nof life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5494-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5494-S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GARY SONSTENG\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I honor Gary Sonsteng and his \nservice to the United States of America during the Vietnam war.\n  Gary enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 17.\n  As a boatswain mate second class, Gary was assigned to the U.S.S. \nTalladega for several years. After a stint in Japan, Gary served on \npatrol boats in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam for a little over a year.\n  In 1971, after 6 years of wartime service, Gary quietly returned to \nhis home in Butte, MT, where he worked as a miner and a truck driver \nfor more than 30 years.\n  Gary is a modest man. He never asked for recognition for his service \nin Vietnam. And through all these years, that recognition of his valor \nand service slipped through the cracks.\n  In working with my office, we discovered that Gary never received the \nmedals he earned decades ago. Gary insists his service was, quote, \n``nothing extraordinary.'' I, along with millions of Americans and the \nU.S. military, see it differently.\n  Last month, I had the honor of presenting Gary Sonsteng with a Combat \nAction Ribbon, and a Navy Commendation Medal with a Combat Valor \nDevice. This Navy Commendation Medal is reserved for ``sustained acts \nof heroism or meritorious service.''\n  It was also my honor to present Gary a Presidential Unit Citation \nRibbon, an\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\naward earned for displaying gallantry and determination under extremely \ndifficult and hazardous conditions.\n  Last month I also presented to Gary: A Vietnam Service Medal with one \nsilver star and four bronze stars, the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, \nand the Vietnam Campaign Medal with 1960 Device and Discharge Button.\n  These six medals are a long overdue addition to the prestigious \nmedals Gary has already received for his service to America: the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation \nRibbon with one silver star, and the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service \nMedal.\n  All of these medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation. \nThey may be small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of true \nheroism. Sacrifice. And dedication to service.\n  Gary, I join all Montanans and all Americans in saying thank \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5495-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING RAVEN-AEROSTAR EMPLOYEES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to commend \nthe team at Raven-Aerostar of Sioux Falls, SD, for their service and \ndedication to excellence in supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan. Aerostar employees have designed, built, and serviced \ntethered aerostats for the U.S. military's Persistent Ground \nSurveillance System, PGSS, since its inception less than 2 years ago, \nrapidly fielding the first systems for use in the protection of U.S. \nand coalition troops. This summer, Aerostar deployed three of their own \nemployees to Afghanistan to provide technical support and analysis of \ncurrent aerostat systems. Pat Thies, Walter Halbleib, and Ryan Casey \nrecently returned safely to South Dakota after having traveled to \nnumerous remote Forward Operating Bases throughout the war zone. During \ntheir 6-week mission they traversed Afghanistan with U.S. and coalition \nforces via fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter, and ground convoy. Their \nmission was an immediate success as they offered real-time, on-site \ntechnical expertise to PGSS operators and maintenance personnel. In \naddition, they were able to provide instant recommendations to Aerostar \nengineers in Sioux Falls for improved designs and processes.\n  Raven-Aerostar is a proven manufacturer of high-performance tethered \naerostat systems used in persistent surveillance and communication \nrelays. In Afghanistan, these lighter-than-air blimps hover above \nmilitary outposts in hostile areas and provide continuous imagery used \nin the detection of improvised explosive devices, IEDs, and other \ninsurgent activity. Ultimately, Aerostar's products save lives, while \nalso saving money for U.S. taxpayers.\n  I applaud Pat, Walter, and Ryan on a job well done, and for their \ndedication. They and their fellow Aerostar employees represent the \ncommitment to service so prevalent throughout our great State of South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5495-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL ENTITLED THE ``AMERICAN JOBS ACT''--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Today, I am pleased to submit to the Congress the enclosed \nlegislative proposal, the ``American Jobs Act of 2011,'' together with \na section-by-section analysis of the legislation.\n  The American people understand that the economic crisis and the deep \nrecession were not created overnight and will not be solved overnight. \nThe economic security of the middle class has been under attack for \ndecades. That is why I believe we need to do more than just recover \nfrom this economic crisis--we need to rebuild the economy the American \nway, based on balance, fairness, and the same set of rules for everyone \nfrom Wall Street to Main Street. We can work together to create the \njobs of the future by helping small business entrepreneurs, by \ninvesting in education, and by making things the world buys.\n  To create jobs, I am submitting the American Jobs Act of 2011--nearly \nall of which is made up of the kinds of proposals supported by both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and that the Congress should pass right away \nto get the economy moving now. The purpose of the American Jobs Act of \n2011 is simple: put more people back to work and put more money in the \npockets of working Americans. And it will do so without adding a dime \nto the deficit.\n  First, the American Jobs Act of 2011 provides a tax cut for small \nbusinesses, to help them hire and expand now, and an additional tax cut \nto any business that hires or increases wages. In addition, the \nAmerican Jobs Act of 2011 puts more money in the pockets of working and \nmiddle class Americans by cutting in half the payroll tax that comes \nout of the paycheck of every worker, saving typical families an average \nof $1,500 a year.\n  Second, the American Jobs Act of 2011 puts more people back to work, \nincluding teachers laid off by State budget cuts, first responders and \nveterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, and construction \nworkers repairing crumbling bridges, roads and more than 35,000 \nschools, with projects chosen by need and impact, not earmarks and \npolitics. It will repair and refurbish hundreds of thousands of \nforeclosed homes and businesses in communities across the country.\n  Third, the American Jobs Act of 2011 helps out-of-work Americans by \nextending unemployment benefits to help them support their families \nwhile looking for work, and by reforming the system with training \nprograms that build real skills, connect to real jobs, and help the \nlong-term unemployed. It bans employers from discriminating against the \nunemployed when hiring, and provides a new tax credit to employers \nhiring workers who have been out of a job for over 6 months. And, it \nexpands job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of low-income youth \nand adults through a new Pathways Back to Work Fund that supports \nsummer and year round jobs for youth; innovative new job training \nprograms to connect low-income workers to jobs quickly; and successful \nprograms to encourage employers to bring on disadvantaged workers.\n  Lastly, this legislation is fully paid for. The legislation includes \nspecific offsets to close corporate tax loopholes and asks the \nwealthiest Americans to pay their fair share that more than cover the \ncost of the jobs measures. The legislation also increases the deficit \nreduction target for the Joint Committee by the amount of the cost of \nthe jobs package and specifies that, if the Committee reaches that \nhigher target, then their measures would replace and turn off the \nspecific offsets in this legislation.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this proposal.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 12, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/12/senate-section/article/S5495-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:50 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1892.

Mr. President, last month's dire economic news is a call \nto urgent action to get America working again. In August, our Nation \nproduced no net new jobs. Productivity fell. Home sales fell. \nConstruction spending fell. The manufacturing index declined. \nUnemployment is stagnant at 9.1 percent, and consumer confidence is \nplummeting.\n  Businesses, our Nation's job creators and the engine of any lasting \neconomic growth, have been saying for some time that the lack of jobs \nis largely due to a climate of uncertainty, most notably the \nuncertainty and cost created by new Federal regulations.\n  The Regulatory Time-Out Act, which I am introducing today with 16 of \nmy colleagues, provides job creators with a sensible breather from \nthese burdensome new regulations. This would give businesses time to \nget back on their feet, create the jobs that Americans so desperately \nneed, and enhance the global competitiveness of American workers.\n  Let me make clear that we also need to reform the process for issuing \nregulations. Earlier this year I proposed the CURB Act, which stands \nfor Clearing Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens. The CURB Act would require \nagencies to examine the costs and benefits of proposed rules, prohibit \nthem from attempting to set rules through unofficial guidance \ndocuments--thus circumventing the public notice and comment period--and \nprovide businesses with relief from first-time paperwork violations \nwhen no harm comes from the violation. Senators Barrasso and Roberts \njoined me in introducing this bill.\n  Indeed, as I am sure you are aware, many of our colleagues have \nrecognized the need to reform the regulatory process and have \nintroduced their own proposals. The Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee has already held three hearings on regulatory reform \nthis year, and I expect this issue will be a priority for our committee \nthis fall.\n  But the fact is, our economy cannot wait for Congress to complete an \noverhaul of the regulatory process. If we want to create more jobs, we \nmust act now. We must send a clear signal to the job creators that we \nhave heard them. That is why I believe we must have a timeout from any \nsignificant new regulation that would have an adverse impact on jobs, \nthe economy, or our international competitiveness.\n  Under my bill, no significant final rule that would have an adverse \nimpact could go into effect during a 1-year moratorium. This timeout \nwould cover major rules costing more than $100 million per year, and \nother rules that have been considered ``significant'' under Executive \norders going back to President Clinton and followed by President George \nW. Bush and President Obama.\n  Let me give an example of a rule that would be covered by the 1-year \nmoratorium I am proposing. A rule that would be covered by this \ndefinition is EPA's Boiler MACT rule. I am sure the Presiding Officer \nis familiar with this rule. This one regulation, if it were fully \nimplemented, could cost Maine's employers alone hundreds of millions of \ndollars. In fact, as the Wall Street Journal has recently reported, a \njobs study just released shows that Boiler MACT, along with other \npending air regulations, could cause 36 pulp and paper mills around the \ncountry to close, putting more than 20,000 Americans out of work. That \nis 18 percent of that industry's workforce. That shows you the potent \nand terrible impact excessive regulation can have on job preservation \nand job creation.\n  And that is just for starters. Once these mills close, the businesses \nthat supply them would also be forced to lay off workers. Estimates are \nthat nearly 90,000 Americans would lose their jobs, wages would drop by \n$4 billion, and government at all levels would see revenues decline by \na staggering $1.3 billion.\n  That is why, along with Senator Ron Wyden, I have introduced a Boiler \nMACT bill that 24 of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nalready cosponsored. Our bill has been endorsed by 292 employer \norganizations and individual businesses--292 businesses and \norganizations representing employers. That shows you how worried our \njob creators are about the impact of just this one set of rules. Their \nletter sums up the impact of the Boiler MACT rule very plainly. It \nsays:\n\n       These rules place at risk tens of thousands of high-paying \n     manufacturing jobs that our Nation cannot afford to lose.\n\n  The Boiler MACT regulations are exactly the kind of significant rules \nthat my Regulatory Time-Out Act is intended to reach. The moratorium \napplies to rules issued by independent regulatory agencies such as the \nNational Labor Relations Board as well as executive branch departments.\n  The impact of the regulatory burden under President Obama can be seen \nin the pages of the Federal Register. As my colleagues know, the \nFederal Register is the publication for all Federal regulations. Last \nyear alone, the Federal Register expanded by nearly 82,600 pages, a \nlevel higher than any year under President Bush. Worse yet, the Obama \nadministration has 144 rules in the pipeline that would each cost the \neconomy at least $100 million. This is\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nnearly twice as high as the number of such rules that were in the \npipeline each year of the Bush administration.\n  Let me clarify that the legislation I am proposing exempts those \nrules that are needed in emergencies such as imminent threats to public \nhealth or safety, as well as rules that are necessary to enforce our \ncriminal laws, and with respect to military or foreign affairs. I think \nit is important that I put that on the record.\n  It also exempts rules that would reduce the regulatory burden, in \norder to help the private sector create jobs and boost the ability of \nAmerican workers to compete. Unfortunately, those rules that actually \nreduce regulatory burdens and promote jobs are few and far between.\n  Finally, my bill requires that within 10 days of passage, agencies \nand departments must submit to Congress and to the Office of Management \nand Budget the list of rules they believe are exempt from the 1-year \nmoratorium. That is important to make sure the intent of the law is \nfollowed and that Congress and the administration can exercise \nappropriate oversight.\n  The intent of my bill is to lift the cloud of uncertainty that is \ncausing employers to be cautious and to refrain from creating jobs--\njobs our economy desperately needs.\n  During the August recess, I asked employers throughout the great \nState of Maine what it would take to encourage them to add jobs. To a \nperson, no matter what line of business these employers were in, no \nmatter what the size of their workforce, each one of them replied that \nWashington needed to stop imposing crushing new regulations; that these \njob creators needed stable progrowth economic policies; that they \nneeded an end to the uncertainty that was hampering their \ndecisionmaking.\n  I am pleased that the Regulatory Time-Out Act has been endorsed by \nthe NFIB, our Nation's largest small business advocacy group, and by \nthe Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. My bill has also been \nwelcomed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has stated:\n\n       American businesses need immediate relief. A ``time out'' \n     would allow both the regulators and the regulated to take a \n     deep breath and ensure that regulations are not destroying \n     jobs and economic growth.\n\n  I agree completely. I will ask that the letters from the NFIB, the \nSBEC, and the statement by the Chamber of Commerce, be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I am honored to have the following colleagues as cosponsors of this \n1-year regulatory moratorium: Senators Alexander, Barrasso, Blunt, \nBoozman, Chambliss, Coats, Coburn, Cornyn, Hoeven, Hutchison, Isakson, \nKirk, Kyl, Moran, Roberts and Thune.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Regulatory Time-Out Act, \nwhich is a critical step toward easing the regulatory uncertainty and \ncosts that are keeping our job creators from getting Americans back to \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that materials of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 6, 2011.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner; Minority Leader Pelosi; Majority \n     Leader Reid; Minority Leader McConnell: We are writing to \n     express our united and strong support for H.R. 2250 and S. \n     1392, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011,'' bipartisan \n     legislation to address the serious concerns that remain with \n     EPA's Boiler MACT rules. As they exist today, the final \n     Boiler MACT rules will have serious economic impacts on a \n     vast array of facilities across the industrial, commercial \n     and institutional sectors. These rules place at risk tens of \n     thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs that our nation \n     cannot afford to lose.\n       As finalized, the Boiler MACT rules are unaffordable, just \n     as the proposed rules were. The rules are not achievable for \n     real-world boilers across the range of fuels and operating \n     conditions. EPA also has created a presumption that materials \n     commonly used as fuels are wastes subject to the extremely \n     costly and stigmatizing incinerator standards. This would not \n     only impose billions of dollars in unreasonable costs, but it \n     also would cause millions of tons of valuable materials to be \n     diverted to landfills and replaced with fossil fuel--a bad \n     result for the environment.\n       As EPA has acknowledged, the rules were finalized with \n     serious flaws because EPA was forced to meet a strict court-\n     ordered deadline. The final Boiler MACT rule alone would cost \n     over $14 billion in capital for the manufacturing sector, \n     plus billions more in annual operating costs. Complying with \n     the incinerator standards could cost several billion dollars \n     more in capital.\n       Legislation is needed to resolve serious uncertainties and \n     vulnerabilities, including to:\n       Ensure the rules are stayed for an adequate and certain \n     period, as EPA's current administrative stay is being \n     challenged in court;\n       Allow EPA adequate time to re-propose the rules and get \n     them right, including time for stakeholders to conduct more \n     emissions testing and to avoid mistakes that occur when \n     rulemakings of this scope and importance are rushed and \n     become vulnerable to legal challenge;\n       Provide direction and support for EPA to use the discretion \n     it already has under the Clean Air Act and Executive Order \n     13563 to add flexibility and make the rules achievable;\n       Clarify that using non-hazardous materials as fuels does \n     not result in boilers being treated as incinerators; and\n       Give facilities more time to comply with the complex and \n     capital-intensive requirements of the rules.\n       If enacted, the ``EPA Regulatory Relief Act'' will provide \n     the much-needed certainty and time for EPA to get the rules \n     right and for businesses that will be investing billions of \n     dollars to rationally plan for the capital expenses. This \n     legislation will preserve jobs and the competitiveness of the \n     U.S. manufacturing sector while protecting the environment.\n       We urge you to pass this important legislation as soon as \n     possible and send it to the President for his signature.\n           Sincerely,\n       A/C Power Colver; AbitibiBowater; Alabama Forestry \n     Association; Alabama Pulp & Paper Council; Allegheny Hardwood \n     Utilization Group, Inc.; American Architectural Manufacturers \n     Association; American Chemistry Council; American Coatings \n     Association; American Coke & Coal Chemicals Institute; \n     American Composites Manufacturers Association; American Fiber \n     Manufacturers Association; American Forest & Paper \n     Association; American Foundry Society; American Frozen Food \n     Institute; American Home Furnishings Alliance; American \n     Loggers Council; American Municipal Power; American Petroleum \n     Institute; American Sugar Cane League; American Wood Council.\n       Amerities Holdings LLC; Anthony Liftgates, Inc.; APA--The \n     Engineered Wood Association; Appleton Papers Inc.; APUs by \n     Rex, LLC; Archer Daniels Midland Company; ARIPPA; Arkansas \n     Forestry Association; Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce; \n     Associated Industries of Arkansas, Inc.; Associated \n     Industries of Vermont; Association of American Railroads; \n     Association of Independent Corrugated Converters; Atlantic \n     Wood Industries, Inc.; Barge Forest Products Co.; Beet Sugar \n     Development Foundation; Belden Brick Company; Belimed, Inc.; \n     Bennett Lumber Company Berco, Inc.\n       Biomass One, LP; Biomass Power Association; Blue Bell \n     Creameries; Blue Ridge Paper Products; Boise Cascade, LLC; \n     Boise Inc.; Brick Industry Association; Business Council of \n     Alabama; Business Roundtable; Cahaba Timber Co.; California \n     Forestry Association; California League of Food Processors; \n     California Metals Coalition; Canyon Creek Logging; Carolina \n     Cotton Works, Inc.; Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition; Chaney \n     Lumber Co., Inc.; Charles Ingram Lumber Co.; Coast Wood \n     Preserving, Inc.; Coastal Plywood Company; Collins Pine \n     Company.\n       Colorado Association of Commerce & Industry; Composite \n     Panel Association; Construction Materials Recycling \n     Association; Corn Refiners Association; Council of Industrial \n     Boiler Owners; Cresote Council; Decker Energy International, \n     Inc.; Dietz & Watson, Inc.; Domtar Corporation; Douglas \n     County Forest Products; Eastman Chemical Company; Eaton \n     Corporation; Electric Mills Wood Preserving; Empire State \n     Forest Products Association; Evergreen Packaging; Fibrek; \n     Finch Paper LLC; Flakeboard America; Flambeau River Papers; \n     Florida Forestry Association.\n       Florida Pulp and Paper Association; Flower City Tissue \n     Mills Co., Inc.; FMC Corporation; Forest Landowners \n     Association; Forest Resources Association Inc.; Forging \n     Industry Association; Fowler Post Co, Inc.; Fox River Fiber \n     Company; Genesee Power Station LP; George A.

The study comes \n     on the heels of a decision by Mr. Obama to jettison another \n     EPA air quality rule related to ozone that industry \n     complained would kill millions of jobs.\n       The so-called boiler rule has come under sharp attack from \n     both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as \n     industry, which say the regulations would be too costly and \n     difficult to implement. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor \n     included the rule in his list of 10 ``job-destroying \n     regulations'' that he has vowed to fight.\n       The boiler rule would affect paper mills, refineries, \n     chemical factories and other facilities that use boilers, \n     such as universities, hospitals and apartment buildings. \n     Boilers are on-site generators that can provide energy for \n     facilities and factories. Bipartisan legislation is now \n     pending in the House and Senate to delay implementation of \n     the rule, with the aim of having EPA reconsider the \n     regulation.\n       The AF study, conducted by Fisher International, looked \n     at how many mills would be in danger of closing if they had \n     to comply with the new air quality regulations and install \n     new pollution controls. The study found 36 mills would have \n     to close, impacting 18% of the industry's workforce.\n       Supporters of the rule say the benefits far outweigh the \n     costs and counter job loss claims by saying the new controls \n     being required could provide an economic boost.\n       ``Industry is trying to leverage fears about the economic \n     impact and jobs and ignoring that pollution controls are made \n     and installed here in the U.S.,'' said Paul G. Billings, vice \n     president of national policy and advocacy for the American \n     Lung Association.\n       Gina McCarthy, a top EPA official, is expected to testify \n     Thursday before a U.S. House subcommittee about the rule. The \n     agency, which has touted the health benefits of the rule, has \n     delayed issuing final regulations, saying it needs more time \n     for public input. That's frustrated environmental and public-\n     health groups, which say the rules would save lives and help \n     avoid thousands of heart and asthma attacks.\n       John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, said the boiler rule is critical because it \n     will cut mercury and other toxic air emissions from \n     incinerators and boilers at industrial facilities. ``The the \n     reason it's important is those sectors are one of only a \n     handful that still have not had lawful toxic emission \n     standards adopted for them under the 1990 clean air act \n     amendments,'' he said.\n       Donna Harman, president and CEO of AF, said the rule \n     will hurt an already hard-hit sector and said lawmakers and \n     regulators should give the industry more time and impose a \n     less stringent standard.\n       ``We're not asking to not be regulated. We're asking to \n     have a regulation that can be achieved based on the \n     technology that's currently available,'' she said.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The National Foundation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The National Federation of \n     Independent Business is pleased to support the Regulatory \n     Time-Out Act. This legislation provides small business \n     owners--who create roughly two-thirds of the net new jobs in \n     America--with relief from burdensome regulations for a period \n     of one year.\n       The bill would impose a one-year moratorium on \n     ``significant'' new rules--those with a cost of $100 million \n     or more--from going into effect if those rules would have an \n     adverse impact on jobs, the economy, or America's \n     international competitiveness. These particular rules \n     generally come with considerable uncertainty, which inhibits \n     small businesses from making decisions that would help the \n     economy grow.\n       A recent study released by the U.S. Small Business \n     Administration showed that the cost of regulatory compliance \n     for the smallest businesses is 36 percent more than their \n     larger counterparts. The study estimates the cost of \n     compliance for small businesses to be $10,585 per employee \n     per year. Small businesses desperately need the help of \n     Congress to cut red tape.\n       Importantly, the Regulatory Time-Out Act would not prevent \n     important rules that address imminent threats to human health \n     or\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\n     safety or other emergencies, or that apply to the criminal \n     justice system, military or foreign affairs. Nor would the \n     legislation prevent rules which foster private sector job \n     creation and the enhancement of the competitiveness of the \n     American worker, or which otherwise reduce the regulatory \n     burden.\n       The Regulatory Time-Out Act that you have introduced is a \n     prudent step toward providing small business owners with the \n     certainty they need to create jobs for Americans. NFIB looks \n     forward to working with you to help ensure that this \n     important legislation becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n     Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                    Oakton, VA, September 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 100,000 members of \n     the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council), \n     I offer our strong support for ``The Regulatory `Time-Out' \n     Act.'' Given the severe fragility of the economy and dismal \n     job growth, placing a one-year moratorium on ``economically \n     significant'' rules is a commonsense strategy. Even in better \n     economic times, our economy and its competitiveness would \n     suffer under a regulatory onslaught of the current order. \n     Something must be done to counter the untamed and intrusive \n     rulemaking coming out of Washington. The ``Time-Out Act'' is \n     an approach that should warrant bipartisan support.\n       The torrent of new regulations being proposed by federal \n     agencies is generating significant uncertainty among our \n     nation's small business owners. Furthermore, once finalized, \n     these regulations will impose a substantial burden on \n     entrepreneurs, exacerbating existing financial pressures that \n     are a result of weak sales and higher business costs.\n       The number of ``major'' regulations issued last year is \n     unprecedented. Those costing the economy $100 million or more \n     number 224--an increase of 22 percent over 2009 and the \n     highest number on record. Many of these directly and \n     indirectly impact small business. Quite simply, our economy \n     and small businesses cannot absorb any more costs. As you \n     well know, the disproportionate cost of regulation places a \n     heavy burden on small firms. The ``Regulatory `Time-Out' \n     Act'' will help steady the rough economic and policy \n     environment that has so badly shaken entrepreneurs.\n       The ``Time-Out'' act provides consideration for rules that \n     address emergencies and imminent threats to human health and \n     safety, as well as those that would enhance the environment \n     for job creation, worker competitiveness or those that reduce \n     the regulatory burden. No one can label this legislation as \n     anything but smart, practical and essential.\n       Senator Collins, SBE Council appreciates your leadership. \n     Please let us know what we can do to help advance the \n     ``Regulatory `Time-Out' Act'' into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From CHAMBERPOST, Sept. 8, 2011]\n\n U.S. Chamber Welcomes Sen. Collins' Proposed Regulatory Time-Out Bill\n\n                           (By Tom Collamore)\n\n       The U.S. Chamber welcomes Senator Susan Collins' proposed \n     legislation requiring a regulatory ``time-out.'' American \n     businesses have been overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of \n     burdensome and job-killing regulations. With another 4,257 \n     regulations in the pipeline, American businesses need \n     immediate relief. A time-out would allow both the regulators \n     and the regulated to take a deep breath and ensure that \n     regulations are not destroying jobs and economic growth.\n       A regulatory ``time-out'' is one important step in stemming \n     the tidal wave of new regulations. Reforming the regulatory \n     process itself is another. Congress must bring fundamental \n     reform to the rulemaking process, some elements of which have \n     not been modernized in 65 years. We need permanent reforms to \n     the administrative process to ensure regulations are narrowly \n     tailored and impose the least amount of regulatory burden \n     needed to achieve congressional intent, are based on quality \n     data, and will not impede job creation and growth. Reforms \n     must also encourage Congress to exercise its essential \n     oversight over federal agencies to ensure they are carrying \n     out its intent.\n       We applaud Senator Collins for focusing on one of the most \n     important economic issues facing our economy--\n     overregulation--and look forward to working with her on her \n     regulatory time-out legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1543. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to address retirement for Pentagon Force Protection Agency \nofficers; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Retirement \nEquity for Pentagon Police Heroes Act, a bill to place Pentagon Police \non par with Federal law enforcement officers government wide.\n  As we remember the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the \nbravery of those who rushed into burning buildings as most ran away, it \nis particularly fitting to recognize the bravery of Pentagon Force \nProtection Agency Officers with this legislation.\n  Ten years ago, unthinkable acts of terrorism were perpetrated against \nAmerica, resulting in the loss of thousands of innocent lives at the \nWorld Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia, and the final \nlanding site of flight 93 in Pennsylvania. The men and women of the \nPentagon Force Protection Agency were among the first to respond in the \nchaotic minutes after flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.\n  On the morning of September 11, Isaac Ho`opi`i, a Pentagon Police \nofficer from my home state of Hawai`i, rushed into the Pentagon and \ncarried eight people out of the rubble, many of whom were badly burned. \nMany others made it out of the Pentagon thanks to Mr. Ho`opi`i, who \nbecame known as ``the voice,'' because survivors remember him calling \nout for those lost in the smoke and debris to crawl towards the sound \nof his voice. In 2002, Mr. Ho`opi`i was awarded a Medal of Valor for \nhis bravery and quick thinking on that fateful day.\n  Threats to the Pentagon continue to mount in the time since 9/11. \nJust last year, an armed gunman stormed the Pentagon, shooting at \nofficers while attempting to enter the building. Officers Jeffery Amos \nand Marvin Carraway, Jr. were wounded during the shootout, but managed \nto neutralize the perpetrator, ensuring that no other officers or \nbystanders were harmed in the process.\n  Despite their heroic actions and the dangerous nature of their job, \nPentagon Police officers do not accrue retirement benefits at the same \nrate as Federal law enforcement officers. This bill would add Pentagon \nPolice to the list of employees under the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem and Federal Employees' Retirement System who make larger \nretirement contributions than most Federal employees, and accrue \nretirement benefits at an enhanced rate. The higher accrual rate is an \nimportant recognition that police work is dangerous and physically \ndemanding, so law enforcement officers are required to retire earlier \nthan others.\n  The time has come to recognize the courage of these brave men and \nwomen who everyday protect thousands of military personnel and \ncivilians at the Pentagon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
