Mr. President, I have the sad duty today to share with \nmy colleagues the story of one brave\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nKentuckian who sacrificed his life for his country. First Lieutenant \nEric Yates, of Rineyville, KY, was killed on September 18, 2010, in \nKandahar province, Afghanistan, after insurgents attacked his patrol \nwith an improvised explosive device. He was 26 years old.\n  For his heroic service, Lieutenant Yates received several awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO \nMedal, the Combat Action Badge, and the Overseas Service Bar.\n  On Veterans Day last year, Lieutenant Yates's alma mater, Western \nKentucky University, honored him by inducting him into its ROTC Hall of \nFame. A likeness of Lieutenant Yates, etched in granite, was unveiled \nand placed on the university's landmark Guthrie Bell Tower.\n  The history department at Western Kentucky University, working with \nthe Yates family, also established the First Lieutenant Eric Yates \nMemorial Scholarship. ``We have made it our mission to make it a \nscholarship that will be here forever, to keep Eric alive in our \nhearts,'' says Kathy Yates, Eric's mother. Thanks to fund raisers and \ngenerous donations, that scholarship fund now has over $20,000 in it.\n  Eric was born on July 1, 1984, to Kathy and David Yates, and grew up \non a farm in Rineyville. A typical little kid, he liked to play with \ntoy tractors and watch cartoons. Batman and Power Rangers were his \nfavorites. ``He went through a phase where he wore a cape all the time \nso he would be ready for any impending danger,'' remembers Kathy. Eric \nattended Rineyville Elementary School, and played baseball.\n  On the farm, the Yates family grew hay and tobacco, and there was \nwork to be done clearing weeds, topping plants, cutting the tobacco, \nand stripping it in the barn to get it ready for market. ``I am so \nthankful for that time we spent together working and talking, as that's \nwhen you really get to know your children and the work ethic they \ndevelop,'' Kathy says.\n  One spring when Eric was about 10 and his little brother Nathan was \nabout 6, David told his two sons they could each pick a newborn calf \nafter their hard work stripping tobacco all winter. Nathan picked out \nthe biggest bull he could find. He could not understand why his big \nbrother Eric chose a little heifer calf. ``I want the gift that's going \nto keep on giving,'' Eric said, and he went on to sell a calf from that \ncow every year for the next 13 years.\n  In high school Eric got his first job for Butternut Bread, filling \nthe shelves in Wal-Mart, and was elected as treasurer of his school's \nchapter of Future Farmers of America.\n  During the summer of 2001, the Yates family took a vacation to our \nNation's capital here in Washington, D.C. Eric was thrilled to visit \nthe White House, the Smithsonian, Arlington Cemetery, the Korean \nMemorial, the Vietnam Memorial, Robert E. Lee's house, and the Tomb of \nthe Unknown Soldier.\n  Kathy recalls how he practically taught the family a history lesson \nat every stop along the way. ``He was amazed by all of it,'' she says.\n  Soon after that summer trip came the events of 9/11. A junior in high \nschool, Eric read as much about the brutal terrorist attacks on this \ncountry as he could. ``I had not seen anything that grabbed his \nattention like that fateful day,'' Kathy remembers. It was then that \nEric began to think about a career in the U.S. Army.\n  After graduating from John Hardin High School in 2003, Eric started \nat Elizabethtown Community College. Then he transferred to Western \nKentucky University and joined their ROTC program, with an eye toward a \nmilitary career. He hoped to return to Hardin County one day after \nretiring from the Army, to teach and share his stories of military \nadventure.\n  Eric graduated from WKU in 2008. ``We were so proud of him that \nweekend as David and I put on his gold bars at his commissioning \nceremony,'' Kathy says. After graduation, he joined the 101st Airborne \nDivision and was stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, a point of pride \nfor Eric as that was the same division his grandfather, Herbert L. \nCrabb, had served in.\n  In May of 2010, Eric was deployed to Afghanistan with B Company, 1st \nBattalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. It would \nbe his first and only deployment.\n  We are thinking of First Lieutenant Yates's loved ones today, Mr. \nPresident, as I recount his story for my colleagues in the Senate, \nincluding his parents, David and Kathy Yates; his brother, Nathan \nYates; his grandfather, Herbert L. Crabb; and many other beloved family \nmembers and friends.\n  Eric's family learned after his tragic death that he had left behind \na letter he wanted read at his funeral. His parents have gracefully \nshared that letter with me, and I would like to read it for my \ncolleagues now. Eric writes as follows:\n\n       Hello to everyone in attendance,\n       I'm sorry that you all had to gather here today for this \n     event--no, really I am. But since you are here I would like \n     to take the chance to say a few things, try to impart some of \n     my knowledge and wisdom that I have stored up over the past \n     26 years. I consider myself fairly cultured and worldly, so \n     please pay attention; I have the following advice.\n       Number one, take a chance. Get out there and do something \n     you wouldn't normally do. You will see and do some really \n     cool stuff and meet some really fine and interesting people. \n     Once an Army buddy and myself ate breakfast with a homeless \n     man in Oklahoma City, and I must say he left an impression on \n     me.\n       Number two, watch the original Star Wars trilogy. It's an \n     amazing story.\n       Number three, no matter how old you are, get off the couch \n     and exercise. You will look and feel so much better, have \n     more energy and be happier.\n       Number four, read a lot books, both fiction and non-\n     fiction, newspapers, magazines, blogs, online stories, movie \n     reviews--all these things will help you understand the world \n     around you, your role in it, and why what happened to me \n     happened where and when it did.\n       Number five, save your money. You don't own your things; \n     your things own you.\n       Number six, liquor is better than beer.\n       Number seven, don't reject new ideas immediately.\n       That seems to be all that I wanted to say, so thank you for \n     coming. Please have a safe trip home and have a good life. \n     Love, Eric Yates.\n\n  It is a great loss, Mr. President, that First Lieutenant Eric Yates \nwill not have a long and happy life himself, with the opportunities to \nshare those lessons--and many more--with the people that fill that \nlife. But I am honored to be able to share them now with my colleagues \nin the United States Senate.\n  And I am honored to stand here today and recognize Lieutenant Yates's \nheroic service, and the solemn sacrifice he has made on behalf of a \nloving family, a proud Commonwealth, and a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S396-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, since his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Obama and Vice President\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nBiden have been talking about their efforts to help students afford to \ngo to college, which is something we are all in favor of.\n  The President's proposals include what he calls a higher education \nrace to the top. It has a familiar sounding formula. Though, in this \ncase, it will impose new rules and mandates and price controls on \ncolleges and universities in States. Unfortunately, this race to the \ntop is headed in the wrong direction.\n  The President should turn around his higher education race to the top \nand head it in the direction of Washington, DC, to help the federal \ngovernment compete for ways to stop adding mandates and costs on States \nthat are soaking up dollars and driving college tuition through the \nroof.\n  Let me be specific and offer three examples of how a race to the top \nheaded toward Washington, DC, could actually help students by saving \nthem money on their tuition.\n  First, Washington could stop overcharging students on their student \nloans. They are doing that now by borrowing money at 2.8 percent, \nloaning it to students at 6.8 percent, and using the profit to help pay \nfor the new health care law and other government programs.\n  Second, Washington could help students with lower tuition by \nrepealing the new Medicaid mandates on States that take effect in 2014. \nThese new Medicaid mandates will further reduce State funding for \nhigher education and raise tuition at public colleges and universities, \nwhich is where approximately 75 percent of students go to college.\n  Third, Washington could stop prohibiting States from reducing \nspending on Medicaid at a time when State revenues and expenditures are \ngoing down. That forces States to spend money on health care that \notherwise would be available for higher education.\n  Let me talk about each of those three ideas.\n  First, this business of overcharging on student loans. I think it \nwould come as a big surprise to most students to know that Washington \nis borrowing money at 2.8 percent and loaning it to them at 6.8 \npercent, and using the profit to pay for the health care law and for \nother government programs. We have roughly 25 million students \nattending 6,000 colleges and universities in America today, and \napproximately 16 million of those have Federal loans that allow them to \nspend that money at the school of their choice. Approximately 70 \npercent of the Federal funding made available for our higher education \nlast year--about $116 billion--went for those student loans. Under the \nnew health care law, the Department of Education is going to be \nborrowing money from the Treasury at 2.8 percent and then loaning it to \nthe students at 6.8 percent. So, the government is actually \novercharging 16 million students and taking that profit and spending it \non new government programs, including the new health care law.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 10 years, \nhere is where the profit goes, approximately: $8.7 billion goes to pay \nfor the new health care law; $10.3 billion goes to pay down the Federal \ndebt; and $36 billion goes to support other Pell grants. So if we \nreally want to help students pay for tuition, why would we not use this \nprofit to reduce the interest rate on student loans? CBO says we could \nhave reduced the rate from 6.8 percent to 5.3 percent and let the \nstudents have the savings instead of letting the government have the \nsavings. By reducing the interest on student loans that much, students \nwould save an average of $2,200 over 10 years. That is a lot of money \nfor the average student borrower who has approximately $25,000 in debt.\n  I have proposed the idea of legislation that puts a ``truth in \nlending'' label on every one of the 16 million student loans, saying \nthis: Beware: Your government is overcharging you on your student loan \nto help pay for the health care law and other government programs.\n  Here is a second way Washington could help lower tuition rates. \nWashington could repeal the Medicaid mandates imposed on States that \ntake effect in 2014 and will inevitably drive up tuition rates. This is \nhow that works. The new health care law requires States to expand and \nhelp pay for Medicaid coverage. This in turn requires Governors who are \nmaking up budgets to take money that, otherwise, would likely go for \nhigher education and spend it instead on Medicaid.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this new expansion of \nMedicaid will cost States an additional $20 billion over 10 years and \nadd 16 million more people to Medicaid programs. The CMS Chief Actuary \nsays it may add 25 million to the Medicaid Program, costing States even \nmore. We know this is going to happen because it has already happened. \nFor years Medicaid mandates have been imposing huge costs on States, \nwhich in turn soaks up money for colleges, and in turn causes tuition \nto go up to replace that money.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, average State funding this \nyear for Medicaid increased by 28.7 percent compared to the prior year. \nWhere did the money come from? In Tennessee, which had a 15.8-percent \nincrease in State spending on Medicaid last year, at the same time \nthere was a 15-percent decrease in State spending for higher education. \nThat is a real cut, not a Washington cut; that is 15 percent less \nmoney. That did what? There was a 7.3-percent increase in tuition at \npublic universities and an 8.2-percent increase in tuition at community \ncolleges to make up for the cuts.\n  In California, where the state enrolls 8.3 million Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, they are expected to gain 2 million more when the new \nhealth care law is implemented in 2014. Just over the last year, there \nhas been a 13.5-percent decrease in State support for higher education \nin California, along with a 21-percent increase in tuition and fees at \nState universities and a 37 percent increase in tuition at community \ncolleges. Most of those students probably do not know that the \nprincipal reason their tuition is going up is because of the Federal \nhealth care mandates on the State.\n  From 2000 to 2006, spending by State governments on Medicaid \nincreased by 62.6 percent. This has been going on long before President \nObama came into office. I balanced it as Governor in the 1980s. Every \nyear I tried to keep education funding at 50 percent of the State \nbudgets. In those days the States paid for 70 percent of the cost of \noperating the University of Tennessee or the community college and \ntuition paid for 30 percent of the cost. We had an implicit deal with \nthe students that if we raise tuition, we will raise State funding by \nabout the same amount. Those days are long gone.\n  Medicaid costs on States are the most insoluble part of the budget \ndilemma we have here in Washington. I believe Medicaid either should be \nrun 100 percent by the Federal Government or 100 percent by the States. \nI came to Washington and suggested that to President Reagan in the \n1980s. He agreed, but many did not. So it is not new. We should not \nblame President Obama for the fact that this has gone on for 30 years, \nbut we ought to hold him responsible for making it worse.\n  Here is how he has made it worse in a third way--by a so-called \nmaintenance of effort requirement on States as a condition of \ncontinuing to receive Federal payments under Medicaid. The 2009 \nstimulus bill prohibited States from imposing new eligibility \nstandards, methodologies, or procedures as a condition of receiving \nFederal Medicaid payments. The new health care law extends the \nmaintenance of effort requirements through 2014. So for 5 years, \nthroughout this recession, while State revenues are going down, the \nFederal Government in its wisdom has been imposing billions of new \ndollars in Medicaid mandates on States requiring them to spend more on \nMedicaid. And what happens? They must spend less on something else.\n  In 2010, New York Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch, a Democrat, \neloquently talked about that problem. He said Medicaid is ``the largest \nsingle driver of New York's growing expenditures,'' making up more than \none-third of the State total budget. New York spends twice as much on \nMedicaid as California. He said this spending is expected to grow at an \nannual rate of 18 percent over the next 4 years but that the Federal \nstimulus and health care expansions have made it harder for States such \nas New York and California to cut expenditures because of the strings \nattached. He said:\n\n       These strings prevent States from substituting Federal \n     money for State funds, require States to spend minimum \n     amounts of\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\n     their own funds, and prevent States from tightening \n     eligibility standards for benefits.\n\n  So while the Federal Government is burdening the States with hundreds \nof billions of dollars in Medicaid liabilities, the President has made \nit worse by forbidding States from tightening their eligibility \nrequirements as their economies shrink.\n  The administration and Congress have left Governors with little \nchoice but to cut in other areas, and that usually turns out to be \npublic higher education, where 75 percent of students go to school. So \nwhy is tuition going up? The biggest reason is us--Congress, Washington \nDC. Instead of pointing the finger at States and colleges, we ought to \nlook in the mirror.\n\n  There is another problem with the President's proposals. His \nproposals are not likely to affect many students, and if they do they \nare more likely to hurt them than help them. Here is why that is true. \nNinety-eight percent of all Federal money made available to college \nstudents goes directly to the students to spend at one of the 6,000 \ninstitutions of their choice.\n  The President's proposals would only affect three programs of campus-\nbased aid that eventually affects about 2 percent of all students and \nimpacts about 2 percent of all the federal money available for higher \neducation. What the President would propose doing includes putting \nprice controls on colleges offering those programs and saying that \nstudents could not go to the institution if tuition goes up too much. \nSo if a low-income student wants to go to the University of Tennessee \nor North Carolina or Michigan and tuition goes up more than the Federal \nGovernment says it should, mostly because of Federal policies, what \nhappens? The student cannot go to the University of Michigan or the \nUniversity of Tennessee or the University of North Carolina. Those \nschools have plenty of applicants. They are going to get their students \nanyway. So the effect will be to make it harder for a low-income \nstudent to go to the college of his or her choice.\n  What should we be doing? I think it is pretty obvious. The taxpayers \nalready are generous with support for students going to college. The \naverage tuition at a 4-year public institution is $8,200. At a 2-year \ncommunity college, it is $3,000. At private institutions, it may be \ncloser to $28,000 or $30,000 a year. To make it easier, there are 16 \nmillion student loans--$116 billion in new student loans last year. \nThere are 9 million Pell grants, supported by $41 billion in taxpayers' \ndollars. So half our 25 million college students have a Federal grant \nor loan to help pay for college, and they spend it at one of 6,000 \ninstitutions of their choice.\n  Still, the rising cost of tuition is a real problem for American \nfamilies. Tuition and fees have soared over the past 10 years above the \nrate of inflation by 5.6 percent a year at public 4-year institutions. \nThis adds up to about a 113 percent increase in tuition over the \ndecade.\n  Colleges and universities need to do their part to cut costs. I have \nsuggested that well-prepared students ought to be offered 3-year \ndegrees instead of 4. The president of George Washington University has \nsuggested ways that colleges could be more efficient. He said he could \nrun two complete colleges with two complete faculties in the facilities \nnow used half the year for one. That is without cutting the length of \nstudent vacations, increasing class size, or requiring faculty to teach \nmore. Requiring one mandatory summer session for every student every 4 \nyears, as Dartmouth College does, would improve institutions' bottom \nline. The GW president said his institution's bottom line would improve \nby $10 to $15 million a year. Those are just two good ideas.\n  There is nothing wrong with President Obama's proposal to encourage \nideas like that, even to give grants and put the spotlight on colleges \nthat are trying those things. The Malcolm Baldrige Award for Quality \nControl years ago did a lot to improve quality in business and \ngovernment without spending very much. But mandates and price controls \non 6,000 autonomous colleges and universities is not the right \nprescription. They are more likely to hurt students than help. They are \nmore likely to drive up tuition than lower it. And they are more likely \nto diminish the quality of the best system of higher education in the \nworld.\n  The reason we have the best system is, for one reason, because \ngenerally the Federal Government keeps its hands off those autonomous \ncolleges, and the second reason is that students can choose among those \n6,000 institutions with the money we make available to them in grants \nand loans.\n  Rather than creating new price controls, new mandates, and new \nregulations of the kind that have already pushed tuition higher, I \nsuggest the President turn his race to the top around. Instead of \nheading it towards the States and colleges, head it towards Washington, \nDC. Stop overcharging students for their student loans, stop requiring \nStates to spend more State dollars on health care at the expense of \npublic colleges and universities, repeal the new Medicaid mandates that \nin 2014 will take already-high tuition and drive it even higher, and \nlet the Federal agencies compete to see how they can stop adding costs \nthat are the main reason college tuition is rising. That would be the \nreal race to the top. That is the real way to help students afford \ncollege.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, for some time now Americans have suspected \nthat this administration has lost touch with the American people. John \nMeacham, the former editor of Newsweek and a fan of the President, \nexplained this detachment by explaining that the President does not \n``particularly like people.'' That might be an overstatement, but he is \non to something. This administration seems to take its cues from the \nfar left, whether or not they represent the aspirations and hopes of \nordinary Americans.\n  Nowhere is this disconnection from the American people on better \ndisplay than with the hamfisted decision by Secretary Kathleen Sebelius \nand the Department of Health and Human Services to require that \nreligious persons and institutions violate their most cherished beliefs \nor face the consequences.\n  Late last year, HHS ordered all employers, including religious \ninstitutions, to cover in their employer insurance plans such things as \nsterilization, contraception, and abortion-inducing drugs and devices. \nWith very limited exceptions, religious hospitals, universities, and \ncharitable institutions would face the choice of dropping coverage for \ntheir employees or violating their consciences.\n  The Nation's Catholic bishops and many other religious institutions \npleaded with this administration to grant broader waivers to avoid \njeopardizing these institutions' constitutional rights to freely \nexercise religion. But the administration, rather than side with \nmillions of religious Americans who just want to be left alone to \npractice their own faith, decided to throw in with the most radical of \nproabortion advocates. They decided to subordinate our central \nconstitutional commitment to religious liberty to a radical agenda that \nis overtly hostile to all of these people of faith.\n  The response has been overwhelming. At church this weekend millions \nof American Catholics were read a letter from their bishops. The \nmessage was simple, and it was powerful. This action is unjust and one \nwith which they\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nwill not comply. They are right, and they shouldn't. The first \namendment doubly protects religious liberty. It prohibits the \ngovernment establishment of religion and explicitly protects the free \nexercise of religion, the first individual right listed in the Bill of \nRights. That is how important religious liberty is to America.\n  In our system of government, such fundamental rights and principles \nare supposed to trump statutes, regulations, and political agendas. The \nConstitution and the liberties that it protects are supreme not the \nfleeting politically driven motivations of any particular \nadministration. Yet the Obama administration, as it has always does, \nhas turned these priorities upside down. In this administration, \npolitics trumps absolutely everything else, even the Constitution and \nreligious liberty. Instead of conforming their political agenda to the \nConstitution, they distort the Constitution and even liberty itself to \nconform to their political agenda.\n  The politicians driving this mandate underestimated the American \npeople who have in succession rejected the sorry efforts by the \nadministration to defend its actions. The administration first hid \nbehind the opinion of a purportedly objective medical group that birth \ncontrol should be included in health insurance plans, but the American \npeople knew who was ultimately responsible for this rule--not some \nboard of so-called experts but the President and his officers. They \ntried to minimize this mandate's impact by arguing that many States \nalready have similar requirements. But this was incredibly misleading \nsince nearly all of those States have much broader religious \nprotections. In fact, only three States have religious exemptions as \nnarrow and limited as this new Federal mandate.\n  They tried to assuage the concerns of religious citizens by saying \nthat the rule does not cover churches and houses of worship, but \nAmericans will not accept only the remnant of our constitutional rights \nthat the President chooses to recognize. Were we supposed to thank the \nObama administration for letting us retain a few scraps of religious \nliberty? There are many religious institutions and organizations that \ndo not fit into the Obama administration's artificial, narrow \ncategories but that just as fully exercise their faith and religious \nmissions. Religious liberty belongs to the Catholic hospital or the \nUniversity of Notre Dame no less than it belongs to the Catholic \nChurch.\n  Then, when this simmering controversy broke wide open a few weeks \nago, Secretary Sebelius thought she could make it all go away by \nagreeing not to impose this mandate for another year. Like her boss the \nPresident she just plain doesn't get it. Religious liberty is not a \nbargaining chip or a deal sweetener like premium floor mats or an \nupgraded appliance. Did she think Americans would not mind losing this \ncherished liberty if they were allowed to spend just a little extra \ntime with it?\n  The Obama administration's attitude toward religious liberty has \nbecome ``enjoy it while it lasts.'' And to the administration's \nsurprise, the American people have been less than enthusiastic about \nthis cavalier attitude toward constitutional rights.\n  The President of the United States takes an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution, to stand for the fundamental liberty of all \nAmericans. He and the officials responsible for this mandate have \nfallen far short of this oath.\n  The fight for religious liberty began before America was born, and it \nmust be fought continually. We can all see that now. It is a part of \nour constitutional heritage. Our Founding Fathers pledged their lives, \nfortunes, and sacred honor to defend the principle that all people are \ncreated equal and endowed by God with certain unalienable rights. The \nright for persons and institutions to be free to practice their faith \nwithout undue interference by the government is among our most \ncherished rights and liberties.\n  There was a day when liberals and conservatives, Democrats and \nRepublicans--everyone--joined to defend liberty. I should know. I was \nthe principal Republican co-sponsor of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act which brought together unprecedented grassroots and \ncongressional coalitions to defend this first freedom. They knew that \nrights such as religious liberty rise and fall together, that religious \nliberty cannot be packaged, sliced, diced, and doled out in little \npieces to please certain interest groups. We need that same unity today \nbecause religious liberty is just as important and, sadly, just as \nthreatened as it was in the past.\n  In addition to violating the first amendment right to freely exercise \nour religion, this mandate also appears to violate that landmark law, \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It burdens the free exercise of \nreligion and is clearly not, as the law requires, a narrow means of \nachieving a compelling purpose.\n  Last month the Supreme Court unanimously held that the right of \nreligious organizations to decide who may further their religious \nmission trumps nondiscrimination statutes. The Obama administration \nargued that religious organizations are nothing special, that they \nshould have no more freedom from Federal control than, say, a labor \nunion or a social club. In other words, religious liberty is simply no \nbig deal to the Obama administration.\n  Writing for the entire Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts called \nthis a remarkable view of religious liberty, one that is ``hard to \nsquare with the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives special \nsolicitude to the rights of religious organizations.''\n  Soon the Supreme Court will have the opportunity to rule on the \nconstitutionality of ObamaCare. What the preventive services mandate \nconfirms beyond all doubt is that the constitutional defects in \nObamaCare only begin with the insurance mandate that will be before the \nSupreme Court. There are some other issues there as well, and I hope \nthe Court examines every one of them and overturns this law.\n  The very DNA of ObamaCare is unconstitutional. At its core, the law \nand its expansion of government are a threat to personal liberty. The \ndecision to implement this law in a way that forces religious \ninstitutions to violate their deepest principles is a vivid \ndemonstration of what happens to personal liberty when the power of the \nstate expands. As the state controls more and more of our lives to \nfurther a political agenda, our freedom is put in greater and greater \njeopardy.\n  After 3 years of this administration, the American people seem to be \nsaying enough is enough. Those responsible for this decision to force \nreligious institutions to subsidize health coverage for abortifacient \ndrugs need to be brought to account. The President needs to answer for \nthis. Secretary Sebelius needs to answer for this. The Attorney General \nneeds to answer for this. How could he let this happen?\n  Let me say, however, that getting answers is not enough. Congress \nneeds to assert its authority as the representative of the American \npeople, stand for the first amendment, and restore religious liberty by \noverturning this health care law.\n  For those who are on the front lines fighting this mandate: I applaud \nyour courage, and please understand that you are not alone; you are \nDemocrats, Independents, Republicans, and others. The Obama \nadministration may not care about religious liberty, but the \nConstitution does, and I, along with many of my colleagues, will fight \nalongside you until we prevail over this unjust law. This new HHS \nmandate cannot be allowed to stand, and I am confident that if the will \nof the American people prevails, it will not stand.\n  I belong to a faith that has been persecuted and mischaracterized for \nmany decades. We are the only church in the history of America that had \na Governor issue an extermination order against its members. That is \nhow bad it got in this greatest of all countries where religious \nliberty is without question our most valued right. We understand what \nit is like to be persecuted. I don't care whether one is liberal, \nconservative, independent, or what, and I don't care what religious \nbeliefs folks out there all have. There is no excuse for this type of \nheavy-handed, ham-handed, overgovernmentalization of our religious \nfreedom. We simply cannot allow this to stand.\n  Does President Obama have the guts to stand up for religious liberty? \nIf he doesn't, he should not be President of this United States. If he \ndoes, I will be\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\nthe first to compliment him for it. It comes right down to the \nConstitution itself and, in many respects, I believe the most important \nprovision in the Constitution. Religious liberty is something that our \nearly leaders risked their lives to obtain because they were persecuted \nbecause of their religious beliefs.\n  I call on the President of the United States to change this, to \nacknowledge that this is a mistake, and to understand that we are \nunited--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and others--in the \nprotection of this great liberty.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1813, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 311, \n     S. 1813, a bill to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, Mr. President, this is a big day for those of us \nwho believe strongly that we need to focus on job creation, a better \nbusiness climate, a bill that will, in fact, not only protect jobs but \ncreate new jobs. That is the bill we are hoping will get the go-ahead \nat 2 o'clock, what we call MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the \n21st Century Act, S. 1813.\n  This has been--if I could use an analogy that fits--a long road to \nget to this point so we can, in fact, make sure we have an adequate \nroad system, an adequate highway system, an adequate transit system, \nand that we make sure, as a world leader, our infrastructure--our \nbridges, our roads--keep up with the demands put upon them. There are \nmany demands put upon them because we are a great nation with commerce \nand heavy-duty vehicles on our roadways and railroads that cross over \nroadways that create potential problems, and, certainly, we have a \nrobust transit system that needs to keep up with the times.\n  Last night, I received a letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand I was very pleased to see it because they support the bill Senator \nInhofe and I, on a bipartisan basis, were able to get through our \ncommittee on a unanimous vote.\n  It is a rare moment in history, frankly, when the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and labor unions all come together, with everyone on the same \npage, to say: Let's move forward with a bill. In these days of \ncontroversy and debate--and, Lord knows, I am immersed in many of \nthem--this is one where we have been able to carve out a very important \nconsensus, not only in the Environment and Public Works Committee but \nin the Banking Committee--where Senators Johnson and Shelby work \ntogether--to get a piece of this bill done.\n  In the Finance Committee--where Senators there are led by Senator \nBaucus--they were able to hammer out a tough and important agreement to \nfund this bill because it has some shortfalls due to the fact that the \nhighway trust fund has been going down because cars are getting better \nfuel economy--and that is a good thing--but the bad, unintended problem \nis the trust fund now has fewer dollars, so we run short of what we \nneed to keep our bridges and highways and transit systems going.\n  So what a moment it was to see not only our committee but the Banking \nCommittee, the Finance Committee, and the Commerce Committee, with a \ncouple of exceptions on a couple of provisions--they did their job as \nwell, and we are trying to work with them to resolve whatever matters \nremain in that portion of the bill.\n  But I want to quote from the letter from the Chamber of Commerce that \nI received last night. I want to share a couple lines with everyone. I \nam quoting:\n\n       The Chamber strongly supports this important legislation. \n     Investment in transportation has proven to grow jobs, and the \n     need for Congress to act on transportation infrastructure is \n     clear.\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       Passing transportation reauthorization legislation is a \n     specific action Congress and the Administration can take \n     right now to support job growth and economic productivity \n     without adding to the deficit.\n\n  Those two quotes I think show we have done our job well.\n  This is a bill that is paid for. This is a bill that, because of the \nway it was written, is a reform bill, which I will go into. But it also \nprotects the jobs we currently have, which is 1.8 million jobs in the \ntransportation area, and also, because of the way we have boosted a \nprogram called TIFIA--which I will talk about, which is a highly \nleveraged program--we have the capacity to add over a million new jobs. \nMostly these jobs are in the private sector. That is where they are, \nand that is what we are focused on in this legislation.\n  I mentioned Senator Inhofe before, my ranking member on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I expect him to be in the \nChamber shortly. I cannot tell you of the trusted partnership we were \nable to develop with him that went not only for his relationship with \nme in working on this bill, but the staff-to-staff relationships which \nhave blossomed into friendships and trust. I think what we have shown \nis that each of us can be a tough but fair partner. Our staffs \nunderstand where we are coming from. But we have a bigger goal in front \nof us than our differences; that is, our agreement that it is our \nresponsibility to fix our aging roads and highways and bridges--our \ninfrastructure--to put people back to work, to boost our economy, and, \nas Senator Inhofe has talked about very often, with examples that are \nin many ways heart breaking, we have problems with safety in our \nNation. We have bridges that are crumbling. We have seen them with our \nown eyes. We cannot turn away from this because we may have \ndisagreements on lots of other things.\n  It has been a long but a very worthwhile journey to get to this stage \nbecause the payoff here, if this bill eventually becomes law, is, as I \nsaid, protecting 1.8 million jobs and creating up to another million \njobs.\n  Again, I want to mention the Commerce Committee. I did not thank \nSenators Rockefeller and Hutchison for their work on this as well. So \nwe have four committees that are involved in writing this bill. Each \ncommittee has voted out their bills. If all goes right today, and we \nget a resounding go-ahead, I hope we begin with amendments on the EPW \nportion, and then move to add the different other bills to this bill, \nuntil we have added all four--all the committees together--and then I \nhope we will have a resounding vote and get to a conference committee. \nWe have major differences with the other body, but I think we can work \nthem out for the good of the people and the thousand organizations that \nback us in this bill, in this effort.\n  I also have to thank Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. He \nbrought this bill to the floor. He exerted the right kind of pressure \non all of our committees. He encouraged us. He understands clearly \nthat, as we try to get out of this recession--and we have seen \nbeneficial results from our actions in a number of areas--this is going \nto mean a big boost for jobs.\n  I want to also say that within my committee we have what we call the \nbig four: it is the chairman and the ranking member--myself and Senator \nInhofe--and then it is the chairman of the Highway Subcommittee and the \nranking member there; and that is Senator Baucus and Senator Vitter. So \nI honestly think if you look at the big four, and you look at our \nphilosophies, and you look at where we are from and the differences we \nbring to the table, we cover the whole Senate in terms of\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\nthe range of ideologies but are tied together by a belief that this is \nsomething that needs to get done. And Senators Baucus and Vitter were \nwith Senator Inhofe and me every step of the way, for which we are very \ngrateful.\n  I mentioned, I alluded to a thousand organizations that have been \ninvolved on the outside pushing us to get this done. My hat is off to \nthem. They make up a broad coalition. I have spoken frequently with \nthem to give them an update on how we are doing, and I have to tell you \nthey truly represent America. Over the course of this debate, if I have \nthe time--and in many ways I hope I do not have the time because I hope \nwe can get this done and not spend a whole lot of time on it because I \nthink the committees have done such a good job, but if we have excess \ntime on the floor, I intend to read as many of those organizations into \nthe Record as I possibly can because that coalition is remarkable in \nits reach.\n  They were led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It is an unprecedented \ncoalition. They came together regardless of ideology and differences. \nEvery time I look at this list, I am reminded that essentially it is \nAmerica. It is America: business, labor groups, State organizations, \ncity organizations, and organizations from all 50 States.\n  We received a letter from these thousand organizations recently, and \nI am going to quote some of what they said. They said:\n\n       There are few federal efforts that rival the potential of \n     critical transportation infrastructure investments for \n     sustaining and creating jobs and economic activity. . . .\n\n  They wrote:\n\n       In 2011, political leaders--Republican and Democrat, House, \n     Senate and the Administration--stated a multi-year surface \n     transportation bill is important for job creation and \n     economic recovery. We urge you to follow words with action:\n\n  And this is what they asked us:\n\n       Make Transportation Job #1 and move legislation immediately \n     in the House and Senate to invest in the roads, bridges, \n     [and] transit systems that are the backbone of [our] economy, \n     its businesses large and small, and communities of all sizes.\n\n  Again, it is important to note, our surface transportation bill \ncreates or saves millions of jobs, benefiting millions of American \nfamilies across the country. What a great signal it will send, as we \nstruggle to get out of the slowdown and we begin to see the light at \nthe end of the tunnel. This will be a very large light because there \nare very few other things we can do here that have the reach of a \ntransportation bill.\n  Let's talk about the construction industry. According to the most \nrecent unemployment figures, there are 1.5 million construction workers \nout of work, with the industry facing an unemployment rate of 17.7 \npercent. Construction workers are out of work.\n  I show you a chart I have in the Chamber. The national unemployment \nrate is 8.3 percent. We want to see that come down. But look at that \nconstruction industry unemployment rate: 17.7 percent. These are real \npeople with pride in what they do. And we know the housing industry has \nhad a horrible time. It has stalled out, and it is in a horrible \ntrough.\n  So if we can take those construction workers and offer them an \nopportunity to build the roads, the bridges, the highways, the transit \nsystems, it will put them to work and we will get that 17.7-percent \nrate down.\n  I do not know if we have a picture of that stadium. This is a picture \nof the Super Bowl stadium. From what I understand, it seats about \n100,000. That is what we see here. If we had 15, 15 of these pictures, \n15 Super Bowl stadiums' worth of people, that is how many people are \nunemployed in construction.\n  I use this not only because I watch the Super Bowl, although my \nNiners did not get in and it was upsetting, but because this is a \npicture, a visual. Imagine every one of those people unemployed times \n15. It is a visual. I think it is important that we keep in mind we are \ntalking about real people who have lost real jobs because of this \nrecession and especially the housing downturn.\n  This is a chance to put them to work. There is an urgent need to get \nthis legislation through the conference committee and onto the \nPresident's desk because the current transportation authorization \nextension expires on March 31. I wish to say to colleagues who may be \nwatching or staff who may be watching: You may have a lot of amendments \nin your mind, in your heart, and everybody has a right, and I support \nyour right. But please think very hard before you start bringing down \namendments that will slow us up. Those thousand organizations know we \nneed to keep our eye on the ball, and these organizations are in all \nour States. They represent millions and millions and millions of \nAmerican families. So let's not add extraneous matters, please. Let's \nnot have frivolous amendments, killer amendments. We all can offer \nthese. I have several I could offer in a heartbeat. But this is not the \nplace to have our ideological disputes. This is a bill that is a jobs \nbill. This is a bill that is good for our businesses. This is a bill \nthat will save 1.8 million jobs and create up to 1 million more at a \ntime when we must have that kind of wind at our back.\n  There is another reason. Not only does the highway bill expire in \nMarch, but we also know the trust fund is running out of money for \nprojects already in the pipeline. So we have to find a reliable and \nstable source of funding. Senator Baucus and his Finance Committee have \ncome up with a way to responsibly fill this shortfall. I cannot thank \nthem enough, the Democrats and Republicans on that committee. Thank \nyou. Because what you have done is to have come up with some very good \nways to pay for the shortfall, and those ways do no harm.\n  We must push forward for another reason which I alluded to before. \nAmerica's aging infrastructure is crumbling. Let me just tell America \nthis: Some 70,000 of our Nation's bridge are structurally deficient--\n70,000 of our Nation's bridges are structurally deficient, 50 percent \nof our roads are not up to standard.\n  If you are in your home and you have little kids and someone who is \nan expert comes up to you, an engineer, and says your house could \neasily crumble, we all know what you would do. You would get out of \nthere, fix it, and then move the family back in. This is no different. \nIf somebody tells you your house is crumbling, you have to fix it. If \nsomebody says to us, our Nation's bridges are structurally deficient \nand over 50 percent of our roads are not up to standard, we have to \nact.\n  My dear friend and colleague who is going to manage this bill with me \nhas arrived. I will tell him, I am about 5 minutes away from finishing \nmy opening statement and yielding to him. But he is more eloquent than \nanyone I have ever heard on two issues; one, what is the role of \ngovernment. He makes the point, which I am not going to take away from \nhim, as to how infrastructure fits into that.\n  He also is eloquent on the point of safety. Because he has seen with \nhis own eyes what happens if we do not get our infrastructure sound and \nsafe. We have a deteriorating part of our infrastructure, and it needs \nto be fixed.\n  We cannot be an economic leader if we cannot move people and goods. \nWe cannot thrive as a nation if our people are trapped in traffic and \nour businesses are trying to move goods and they are trapped in \ntraffic. We lose 4.8 billion hours from work and we pay the price for \nthat in loss of productive time and in dirty air.\n  As to our bill that was passed out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I wish to say to my ranking member who was not here \nand his staff was not here at the time that I started, I praised him to \nthe sky--and staff--because regardless of our differences on many \nissues, we have been able to put this country first in this bill.\n  I am so grateful for the spirit of cooperation we have brought to our \nwork, which was captured in the Banking Committee where Senators \nJohnson and Shelby got together, and in the Finance Committee where \nmany Republicans joined our Democratic friends to figure out a way to \nfund this responsibly, and in the Commerce Committee where we have one \nor two little hiccups, but I do believe we are going to resolve them. I \nam proud we were out there first showing we could do this.\n  People said all over the Senate: If Boxer and Inhofe can do this, \nanything is possible.\n  MAP-21 is a reform bill, and I am proud about that. It consolidates \n90 programs into less than 30. It focuses\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\non key national goals. It gives greater flexibility to the States to \ninvest in their top priorities. It eliminates earmarks. It establishes \nperformance measures to improve accountability. It accelerates project \ndelivery, and it provides resources for a new national freight program.\n  This bill is responsible. It continues the current level of funding \nplus inflation which, as I said, protects 1.8 million jobs. The TIFIA \nProgram, which Senator Inhofe and I agreed to increase, which stands \nfor Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, is also \nembraced by Chairman Mica over on the House side.\n  So Republicans and Democrats agree that by making more funds \navailable through TIFIA, we can mobilize up to $30 billion more from \nthe $1 billion we have placed in that fund and create up to 1 million \njobs.\n  I wish to thank the mayor of Los Angeles and the Chamber there and \nthe workers there who brought the idea of leveraging to my attention. I \nwish to say that Tom Donahue, of the U.S. Chamber, president there, \nRichard Trumka, the president of the AFL and many business and labor \ngroups throughout our Nation supported this TIFIA Program to stretch \ntaxpayer dollars in a safe way.\n  Again, they have done that in the House bill as well, which is very \ngood for us.\n\n  I am proud of this bill and the reforms in it. I am proud of working \nrelationships we have established across party lines in our committee. \nI could say, very honestly, there are a lot of things this bill does \nnot have that I am sorry about, that I wanted to see in there. I am not \ngoing to detail those. But I know Senator Inhofe feels the same way. \nBut there were certain things that were lines in the sand for each of \nus, and it was a give and take that resulted in this compromise which \nis a good bill--a good solid bill.\n  We put those controversial issues aside for the good of the Nation. I \nwill close with this. Ever since Dwight Eisenhower started us on a path \nto build the Interstate Highway System, transportation has been a \nbipartisan effort. I asked my staff to research some of the comments \nmade by President Eisenhower in 1963 when he established the Federal \nInterstate Highway System.\n  Actually, he wrote his autobiography in 1963. He established the \nSystem in 1956.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       More than any single action by the government since the end \n     of the war, this one would change the face of America with \n     straightaways, cloverleaf turns, bridges, and elongated \n     parkways. Its impact on the American economy--the jobs it \n     would produce in manufacturing and construction, the rural \n     areas it would open up--was beyond calculation.\n\n  It is very important to note how bipartisan this is. Ronald Reagan in \n1982, ``More efficient roads mean lower transportation costs.''\n  He said:\n\n       Lately driving is not as much fun as it used to be. Time \n     and wear have taken their toll on America's roads and \n     highways.\n\n  He said it well. So we have Democratic Presidents, Republican \nPresidents, Democratic Senators, Republican Senators all working in a \nbipartisan way. Votes on these bills have been overwhelming, 79 to 8; \n372 in the House to 47--all of our President's signing these \nlaws. Historically, major surface transportation legislation has \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\n  In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Equity Act, ISTEA, \nwith a Senate Democratic majority, passed by a vote of 79 to 8. The \nHouse, with a Democratic majority, passed it by a vote of 372 to 47. \nPresident George H.W. Bush signed it into law. At the December 18, \n1991, signing ceremony, President Bush said:\n\n       ISTEA is ``the most important transportation bill since \n     President Eisenhower started the Interstate System 35 years \n     ago . . . this bill also means investment in America's \n     economic future, for an efficient transportation system is \n     absolutely essential for a productive and efficient \n     economy.''\n\n  In 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, \nwith a Senate Republican majority, passed by a vote of 88 to 5. The \nHouse with a Republican majority, passed it by a vote of 297 to 86. \nPresident Bill Clinton signed it into law.\n  In 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation \nEquity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, passed the Senate, with a \nRepublican majority, by a vote of 91 to 4. The House, with a Republican \nmajority, passed it by a vote of 412 to 8. President George W. Bush \nsigned it into law.\n  Elected officials are not the only people who recognize the \nimportance of maintaining our transportation systems. The American \npublic also supports rebuilding the Nation through infrastructure \ninvestment.\n  According to a poll released last October by CNN, 72 percent of \nAmericans--and 54 percent of Republicans--support ``increasing federal \nspending to build and repair roads, bridges and schools.''\n  Roads and bridges are neither Democratic nor Republican, and all \nelected officials need to leave partisanship on this issue at the door. \nBipartisanship is the only way to get the job done, and Senator \nInhofe's and my partnership in this effort is proof positive that it \ncan be done.\n  Senator Inhofe and I do not agree on many issues, but we found common \nground on this one. We agree that we must invest in our aging \ntransportation systems, we must boost the economy, we must put people \nback to work, and we must pay for it in a way that is not divisive or \npartisan. Neither Senator Inhofe nor I got our wish list in this bill, \nbut we do have a bill that both of us can support. At the end of the \nday, that is what matters.\n  The American people deserve to have their elected officials work \ntogether to solve our pressing problems, and that is what we did. The \nbill before us is thoroughly bipartisan, and therefore nobody will \nthink it is perfect, but it is a very strong commitment to our \ntransportation systems and to the health of our businesses, workers, \nand communities that depend on it.\n  I say today is a good day. I have tried to thank everyone I can think \nof who had anything to do with it. It is my privilege now to yield the \nfloor and look forward to the comments of my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am not sure, I say to my good friend \nSenator Boxer, she is going to be too excited about some of the things \nbecause what I wish to do is establish what is unique about this bill.\n  There is a committee in the Senate. It is not like any committee in \nthe House. In the House, they have two separate committees. It is \ncalled Environment and Public Works. So it is two almost unrelated \ncommittees. Our committee has more jurisdiction than any other \ncommittee in the Senate, but it handles things that are totally \ndifferent.\n  I will sound a little partisan right now, but I am very concerned \nabout President Obama and what he has done to this country in terms of \nthe deficit. A lot of people do not realize that the budgets actually \ncome from the President--not the Democrats, not the Republicans, not \nthe House and the Senate. Those budgets have had deficits of around \n$4\\1/2\\ trillion. I have been very upset about that.\n  I am upset about what the President is doing with the military right \nnow. If we have to go through the sequestration as is planned, we are \ngoing to lose about $1 trillion in defense spending over the next 10 \nyears. The third area is in energy. We have the opportunity to be \ntotally energy self-supporting just by developing our own resources, \nbut the problem is a political problem. The fourth area is over \nregulation.\n  I say this because my good friend, the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, would disagree with me in all those areas \nbecause we do not agree. I look at the regulations and the fact that, \nin my opinion, they are driving our manufacturing base overseas. I see \nthe crown jewel of all regulations is cap and trade. They tried their \nbest to do it. They had the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003 and again in \n2005. We had the Boxer bill--several Boxer bills that Senator Boxer was \ninvolved in--certainly Waxman-Markey.\n  We defeated them all, and now what the President is trying to do is \ndo through regulation what he could not do through legislation. I only \nsay that because I am in agreement with the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Boxer, on most of what she just said\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nbecause of the significance of this. I am going to repeat what I said \nyesterday, I guess it was, or the day before. When rankings come out, \nhistorically since I have been in the House and the Senate--I came to \nthe Senate in 1994--I am always ranked among the most conservative \nMembers.\n  My good friend Senator Boxer is ranked among the most liberal \nMembers--progressive, liberal. But what I appreciate about her is that \nshe is a sincere liberal.\n  She understands that. In her feelings, she believes government should \nbe involved in more things than I do. I hasten to say this again, that \nwhile I have been historically considered the most conservative Member, \nI am a big spender in two areas. One area is national defense--I am \nvery concerned about what is happening in national defense--the other \narea is infrastructure.\n  Way back when I was in the House and on the Transportation \nInfrastructure Committee, at that time we worked very hard for a robust \nbill, for reauthorizing the transportation system. We were successful. \nThat was back in the good-old days, I say to Senator Boxer, when we \nalways had surpluses in the highway trust fund.\n  The highway trust fund probably goes down as the most popular tax in \nhistory because people know, since 1953, it has been a trust fund where \npeople pay their 18 or so cents per gallon, and it goes to maintaining \nthose roads they are driving on. So it is directly related to the \ngasoline purchased.\n  Then some things happened. First of all, I can remember when we had \nsurpluses. So everybody who had their own deal wanted to get in on \nsurpluses, and they started expanding the highway trust fund \nexpenditures beyond just maintaining and building roads. That was one \nof the problems. Then along came a lot of the changes. When they talk \nabout electric cars, whether one is for them or against them, and \nmandating gas mileage, that reduces the proceeds dramatically. In the \nbeginning, I think they probably should have had the highway trust fund \ngeared to a percentage instead of cents.\n  Now fast-forward to recent times and we have a deteriorating system. \nI was proud of the Environment and Public Works Committee I have been \ntalking about. In 2006, prior to the last election, I was chairman \nbecause the Republicans were in the majority. At that time, we did the \n2005 highway reauthorization bill, and it was $286.4 billion--a very \nrobust bill. Yet we could pretty much document that we didn't do \nanything new in that bill. We just maintained what we had. It expired \nin 2009. Since then, we have been operating on extensions.\n  This is significant. Before I get on to operating on an extension, I \nwill mention what we are talking about, Senator Boxer and I. Our \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee has the jurisdiction over the \nhighway title of the bill. Some things are controversial. Not many. I \ndon't know of anything controversial in the highway title. The Commerce \nCommittee with Senator Rockefeller as chairman and Senator Hutchison as \nranking member, the Finance Committee with Senators Baucus and Hatch, \nand the Banking Committee--that is Tim Johnson and Richard Shelby from \nAlabama--have done their work now.\n  Ours is the highway title. In my State of Oklahoma, because of the \ncondition of the bridges and highways--the last time I looked, I think \nMissouri and Oklahoma tied at dead last in the condition of our \nbridges--we had a young lady--and I have told this story many times; \nthis is most compelling. This young lady--a mother of three small \nchildren in Oklahoma City--drove under one of our bridges and a chunk \nof concrete dropped off and killed them. These are serious matters. So \nbridges have dropped, just as one did in Minnesota and down in south \nTexas.\n  We have had so many times when crumbling infrastructure has given \nway. I remember when they considered Oklahoma--since we became a State \nin 1907, we are one of the newer States--people didn't think we had \ninfrastructure problems. They thought that was just confined to \nCalifornia, New York, and the older parts of the country. That is not \ntrue anymore because in many of those older parts the infrastructure \nhas been rebuilt while some of the newer States have been ignored. That \nis why in Oklahoma it is critical.\n  People say they don't want earmarks. Senator Boxer said: We don't \nhave earmarks.\n  I would like to discuss that because I am a strong believer as \nopposed to the people who don't want us to do what we are supposed to \nbe doing when we were sworn to uphold the Constitution, article I, \nsection 9--we should be the ones, the House and Senate, to do the \nappropriating and the authorization. By saying we are not going to do \nit and defining earmarks as appropriations and authorization, I can see \nwhy Democrats lined up to do away with earmarks in a recent vote \nbecause that turns it over to President Obama, and he was very \nsupportive of that.\n  Some Republicans are going to talk about that again. This is not \nsomething that is a problem with this bill. In this bill, we have \nthings that come from the needs of our States. We have a secretary of \ntransportation in Oklahoma who has been before our committee numerous \ntimes because that secretary of transportation has been in that job for \nmany years now. Before that, he was director of transportation for, I \nthink, 30 years. There is nobody who is more knowledgeable on that \nissue.\n  So we checked--and I do--with the department of transportation in \nOklahoma on their prioritizing of projects. We have a system--and I \nwish all States had this system. We have transportation districts and \nchairmen of the districts. They can use the same criteria throughout \nOklahoma, and they determine what should be fixed and where the money \nshould be spent. So it is not a political decision, a decision where we \nare doing what most people consider to be earmarks and trying to help \nour friends. That is not what we do in Oklahoma. This system, frankly, \nworks very well.\n  So now we go back to the extensions. Here is the problem with \nextensions. Our 2005 bill expired in 2009. We have now gone through \neight extensions. The problem we have with extensions is that we cannot \ndo anything creative. We cannot change, reform the system. We just have \nto take the money that is available and try to use it as best we can. \nBut we cannot not reform a system that needs to be reformed.\n  I have said some things that were not all that complimentary about my \npartner--in this case, Senator Boxer. We have served together for years \nin trying to overcome these obstacles. On the highway title of the \ntransportation bill that we are going to be voting on, we have done a \ngood job. When I think about the reforms--and I compliment Senator \nBoxer. She has been in a real tough position with some of the more \nliberal members of her party and in some of the things to which she has \nagreed. We sat down and worked out the differences in a lot of these \nproblems.\n  State flexibility, we have that in this bill, which we have never had \nbefore. I have always been a believer that we are the guys who are in \nthe best position to determine the needs of the States.\n\n  I have often said I have served on the State level of government; I \nhave been mayor of a major city. I believe the closer you get to the \npeople, the more responsible government is. I believe that to be true. \nThat is what we have done. We have done that in the flexibility that we \nhave given the States in our program.\n  Senator Boxer mentioned that we cut down the number of programs by \ntwo-thirds. We are down to one-third in the number of programs we had \nbefore. That is major reform.\n  NEPA: We have done streamlining, which is something we have tried to \ndo for a long time. Let me mention the one area of reform that I want \neverybody to listen to because this is significant. We have had a \nfriendly disagreement, Senator Boxer and I, on transportation \nenhancement. These are things we could argue do not affect \ntransportation directly. I have always believed these things we spend \nmoney on that comes from the highway trust fund should go into \ntransportation projects. But they have not. Two percent of the highway \nfunding is required to go to enhancements. That equates to 10 percent \nof the surface transportation money.\n  So we can use 10 percent or 2 percent, depending on which one we are \napplying it to. If we take 2 percent of the total funding, that is a \nlot of money. Enhancements are things people criticize us for. I think \nthat criticism is just.\n  How did we handle this situation and get a highway bill in the \nhighway title\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nportion? We sat down and worked out something right here on the floor \nof the Senate and said there has to be an answer. In Oklahoma, we don't \neven want enhancements. How can we handle this? We worked out an \nagreement that a State, at its own decision level, is able to use this \n2 percent of the total highway funding that would go to enhancements in \nany way they want to do it, and primarily in taking care of some of the \nunfunded mandates, the requirements there, where the government is \nsaying to people in Oklahoma that this is what they have to do--some \nendangered species stuff and those things, they can use it this way.\n  In my State, we cannot have any of the 2 percent going to \nenhancements. Other States feel differently. This is not one size fits \nall.\n  So we have the opportunity that they can do what they want. These are \nreforms. We never had reforms like those before. I am proud we are able \nto do it. I compliment the chairman of the committee for being willing \nto do this, for taking the time to talk to her colleagues and say: All \nright, the choice is not do we want a perfect bill for Democrats or do \nI want one for Republicans. I think we have a pretty near perfect bill \nfor Republicans on the highway title. I am very proud of what we have \ncome up with. Nonetheless, it has been heavy lifting. I applaud the \nchairman of the committee.\n  I want to go back to this extension. If we were to continue to \noperate on extensions, the amount of money we would be spending on \nhighways would reduce by about 34 percent, about one-third. If we talk \nto Gary Ridley in Oklahoma as to what that would do in terms of our \nprogram that we already have online, we would have to default on some \ncontracts. We would have to be in a situation where we are not able to \ndo the things that are in our 5-year plan in Oklahoma. We think things \nout in Oklahoma. We go over the State and make determinations. It is \ndone outside of the political system by people charged with different \ntransportation districts. I can tell you now that it will be--it is a \nlife-threatening issue. If we are dropping down by 34 percent, it will \nbe a serious problem.\n  I suggest to every Member of the Senate, before they make final \ndecisions on the bill, call their director of highways in their States \nand talk to them. Talk to your State legislators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives and liberals alike. This is the one area \nwhere they will agree. In Oklahoma, they are in agreement. They want to \nhave a highway bill. They look to constituents and say this is life \nthreatening and we have to do a better job. This is a partnership \nthing. We are going to have more flexibility for State programs, \nstreamlining, and are not going to be encumbered by mandatory \nenhancements. I don't know of one member of the Oklahoma House or \nSenate who doesn't want this.\n  What is wrong with doing what the people at home want? I used to work \nas mayor of the second largest city in Oklahoma. My phone rings off the \nhook about programs that need to be completed in our highway system in \nOklahoma. I sometimes look at people who demagog the issue and talk \nabout: Oh, no, we don't want to spend all this. There is one area where \nconservatives and liberals alike should be spending--two areas--\nnational defense and infrastructure.\n  I remember when Congresswoman Bachmann was talking around the country \nabout the spending during the earmark argument. They got back to \nMinnesota and talked about the needs for transportation. She said, ``I \nam not talking about transportation.''\n  That is the point we need to get across. Of course, I throw in \nnational defense, but that is not in this discussion. Transportation \ninfrastructure is something we have to do. In Oklahoma, we are going to \ndo our part, do everything we can to get with the bill. It is not going \nto change anything except for the fact that it is going to be able to \nhandle that.\n  Oh, I didn't see--but I am managing the time.\n  By the way, I want to comment, Mr. President----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Wait a minute, the Senator is not managing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Maybe I am not.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, we are both managing the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are both doing it. All right.\n  What I am saying is that shouldn't really be a Democrat-Republican \nmanagement here because there are a lot of Democrats who agree with me \nand a lot of Republicans who agree with Senator Boxer. But we do have \nthe junior Senator from Kentucky here who wants to be heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I do have some remarks I would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I think Senator Inhofe and I will have to talk about how we are going \nto yield back and forth, but at this point I had not finished my \nremarks and I wanted to respond to his.\n  We are here as partners on this bill. We are not partners on a lot of \nthings. And I didn't say, when I opened my remarks, where we are not \npartners, but my friend did, so I am going to respond to his opening \ncomments in which for some reason he wanted to open by saying that the \none place we differ--and he is right on this--is that he blames \nPresident Obama for the deficit. Now, I want to put this on the record: \nI do not. Let me tell you why. When Bill Clinton was the President of \nthese United States, he turned over a booming surplus of $236 billion \nto George W. Bush, and it didn't take him but the blink of an eye to \nturn those surpluses as far as the eye could see into raging deficits, \nand he left President Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit, for which my \ncolleagues on the other side blame President Obama. Not only did George \nW. Bush leave him this kind of deficit, but he left him the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression, a total collapse of Wall Street, \nbleeding jobs--800,000 a month. Yet we have turned it around. The \nPresident has shown magnificent leadership--saved Detroit.\n  My friend further said that another place we disagree--and he is \nright--is that President Obama is driving manufacturing overseas. No. \nThe Tax Code, which the Republicans support, which rewards companies \nfor moving overseas, is very much responsible for that.\n  So that proves the point. We get mad at each other. He is annoyed now \nthat I am saying these things, and I was annoyed at him for saying what \nhe said. But the great news today is that we are here to pass a bill.\n  My friend said I had a problem with liberal Members in my own party. \nI have to say there was concern, for sure. He is right. But once I \nexplained to them that the ranking member and I have to work together, \nthey were terrific about it. And I think some of my colleague's \nRepublican friends said the same. They said: OK, we have to make this \nhappen. So I congratulate all Members on both sides of the aisle who \nput aside these really tough differences we have, and you just saw a \nlittle bit of it.\n  I am not going to get into the climate change area because my friend \nbelieves it is the greatest hoax and I believe it is a scientific fact.\n  We could go on and on with these arguments. It would be interesting. \nIt would be like ``Crossfire.'' Do you remember that show where two \npeople got up there and argued? Yes, we could do that in every way. But \nin this bill we have decided to fight for what we believe in but at the \nend of the day get a bill we believe is fair.\n  Did my friend want me to yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. I just wanted to say that this should be very visible \nto everyone. How could you and I agree and feel so strongly about \ninfrastructure in America when we have such diverse opinions \nphilosophically? My case rests.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You made the point. I was happy when you made the point \nbecause it gave me a chance to argue with you, and we both enjoy that, \nand we will continue. Our friendship is deep. We each know when we talk \nto each other that it is from the heart. But when it comes to this \nparticular issue, we both agree we have to get a bill done. So much is \ndependent upon it.\n  I just received a letter from the Americans for Transportation \nMobility. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter to which I am referring.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2012.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The Americans \n     for Transportation\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n     Mobility (ATM) Coalition is a nationwide group representing \n     business, labor, highway and public transportation interests \n     that advocate for improved and increased investment in the \n     nation's aging and overburdened transportation system. The \n     ATM strongly supports the motion to proceed to S. 1813, \n     ``Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century'' (MAP-21), \n     and urges the Senate to pass a multi-year reauthorization of \n     highway, public transportation and safety programs that both \n     includes reforms to the federal programs and maintains, at \n     minimum, FY 2011 investment levels adjusted for inflation \n     before the expiration of the six-month extension of current \n     law on March 31, 2012.\n       At a time of continuing economic stagnation in the \n     construction sector, slow U.S. economic growth, and \n     increasing competitive pressures, multi-year highway and \n     transit reform and investment legislation is critical for \n     boosting productivity, U.S. economic competitiveness and \n     supporting jobs. A study released last week by the Associated \n     Equipment Distributors found that over two years, one dollar \n     spent on infrastructure construction produces roughly double \n     ($1.92) the initial spending in direct and indirect economic \n     output. The long-term impact is also significant, with a \n     dollar in aggregate public infrastructure spending generating \n     $3.21 in economic output (GDP) over a 20-year period.\n       We commend the Senate committees that helped craft S. 1813, \n     a bi-partisan bill for stabilizing federal transportation \n     funding mechanisms for the near-term and avoiding draconian \n     cuts amounting to one-third of total federal investment in \n     highway, transit and safety programs. Cuts of this magnitude \n     would accelerate the deteriorating performance of the \n     nation's surface transportation network, greatly undermine \n     U.S. economic growth and competitiveness, and result in the \n     real loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs across the \n     country. This bill includes important policy reforms that \n     would improve the delivery of transportation improvements by \n     consolidating programs, reducing red tape, and leveraging \n     private sector resources.\n       The ATM Coalition will strongly oppose any amendments to \n     reduce the funding levels established in this legislation, \n     and remains committed to working with Congress to find \n     reliable revenue streams sufficient to support the long-term \n     growth and the fiscal sustainability of the Highway Trust \n     Fund.\n       Without the certainty of a multi-year bill, current \n     problems become harder to solve as highway and transit \n     conditions worsen and land, labor, and materials get more \n     expensive. Absent passage of a multi-year reauthorization, \n     there would be continued uncertainty and erratic funding for \n     critical infrastructure investments and the public and \n     private sectors would continue to respond by delaying \n     projects, withdrawing investment, and laying off employees.\n       We encourage you to support the motion to proceed to S. \n     1813. The ATM Coalition stands ready to bring together \n     business, labor, highways and transit stakeholders to provide \n     Congress the public support to pass an adequately funded \n     multi-year surface transportation bill by March 31, 2012.\n           Sincerely,\n                            Americans for Transportation Mobility.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to tell you who signed this letter. And my friend \nmay not have seen it. The American Public Transportation Association, \nthe American Road and Transportation Builders Association, the \nAssociated Equipment Distributors, the Association of Equipment \nManufacturers, the Associated General Contractors, the American Society \nof Civil Engineers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the \nLaborers' International Union of North America, the National Asphalt \nPavement Association, the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association, \nthe United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, and the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Now, I have to say----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, but let me make one statement. This list I have just \nread represents America--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Even though we haven't ironed out how to handle time, we \nhave a Senator who wanted to speak 20 minutes ago, and if we could, I \nwould love to get back into the dialog.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am finishing this, and then I will yield the floor and \nam happy to have him speak. I felt this was opening time for the \nchairman and the ranking member to lay down their case, and I am not \nabout to let an attack on the President of the United States of America \ngo unanswered. I am not going to do it. So if we are going to go down \nthat road, we are going to have a give-and-take. If we are going down \nthe road I hope we will go down, it is about getting this bill done.\n  So let me talk about this letter, and then I will yield the floor. \nAnd I say to my ranking member, we will decide how to divide the time, \nand we should. That is fine with me.\n  They say in this letter:\n\n       We commend the Senate committees that helped craft S. 1813, \n     a bi-partisan bill for stabilizing federal transportation \n     funding mechanisms for the near-term and avoiding draconian \n     cuts amounting to one-third of total federal investment in \n     highway, transit and safety programs.\n\n  They are talking about the fact that the highway trust fund is a \nthird of where it should be. That is why we are so happy that the \nFinance Committee, on a bipartisan vote, is replacing these funds.\n  The letter goes on to talk about what would happen if we didn't do \nthis bill.\n\n       Cuts of this magnitude would accelerate the deteriorating \n     performance of the nation's surface transportation network, \n     greatly undermine U.S. economic growth and competitiveness, \n     and result in the real loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs \n     across the country. This bill includes important policy \n     reforms that would improve the delivery of transportation \n     improvements by consolidating programs, reducing red tape, \n     and leveraging private sector resources.\n\n  Additionally, this great coalition, which is comprised of the chamber \nof commerce, the unions, and business, says:\n\n       The ATM coalition will strongly oppose any amendments to \n     reduce the funding levels established in this legislation, \n     and remains committed to working with Congress to find \n     reliable revenue streams sufficient to support the long-term \n     growth and the fiscal sustainability of the Highway Trust \n     Fund.\n\n  This next quote from their letter is so important:\n\n       Without the certainty of a multi-year bill, current \n     problems become harder to solve as highway and transit \n     conditions worsen and land, labor, and materials get more \n     expensive. Absent passage of a multi-year reauthorization, \n     there will be continued uncertainty and erratic funding for \n     critical infrastructure investments and the public and the \n     private sectors would continue to respond by delaying \n     projects, withdrawing investment, and laying off employees.\n       We encourage you to support the motion to proceed to S. \n     1813.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, that is the motion we will be voting on \ntoday at 2 p.m.\n  They continue:\n\n       The ATM Coalition stands ready to bring together business, \n     labor, highways and transit stakeholders to provide Congress \n     the public support to pass an adequately funded multi-year \n     surface transportation bill by March 31, 2012.\n\n  On the issue of the enhancements, we already had a vote on \nenhancements before, and we turned back proposals to do away with \nenhancements. So what we did in this bill is we said to the States: \nGuess what, you have much more flexibility.\n  I have to tell you--and I won't do it now, but perhaps Senator Paul \nis going to speak about these enhancements--we know for sure that these \nenhancements--and I think that is the wrong name because they are \nreally safety projects--have saved lives because they fund things such \nas pedestrian paths and safe passageways for kids to get to school. So \nwhile my colleague and I may differ, I strongly believe Congress stands \nbehind--I should say the Senate stands behind continuing to fund these \nsafety projects, and we have given the States far more flexibility. So \nI hope we will defeat any amendment to remove the ability of our States \nto determine which of those safety projects they want because we have \nthe facts behind us--13 percent of traffic fatalities involve \npedestrians and bicyclists. I feel we give our States the opportunity, \nand if Oklahoma doesn't have any of these problems because it is a much \nmore rural State than California, I am happy with that. But we have to \nunderstand that these are safety projects, and I hope we will defeat \nany amendment that tries to reduce the ability of the States to fund \nthese projects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the junior \nSenator from Kentucky be recognized for up to 7 minutes. He has been \ntrying to get on for quite some time. I think that is agreeable with \neveryone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                          Foreign Aid to Egypt\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from Oklahoma \non being a leader in trying to repair and restore our infrastructure. I \nthink\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nthe Senator from Oklahoma has shown that this is a bipartisan issue.\n  I rise today not only to support the bipartisan nature of rebuilding \nour infrastructure but also to address an urgent concern regarding what \nis happening in Egypt. I rise to introduce an amendment to suspend \nforeign aid to Egypt until they release our American citizens.\n  The situation in Egypt over the past year has been tumultuous, and \ntheir people and government stand at a moment where they will choose \ntheir future. Will they stand for freedom? Will they choose to stand \nwith the United States? The choice is entirely theirs, of course, but \ntheir recent actions are troubling and should give us reason to \nreconsider our significant aid to the Government of Egypt.\n  What bothers critics of our foreign policy is the disconnect between \nhope and reality. Well-intentioned people vote to give aid to countries \nin hopes they will promote freedom, democracy, and the interests of the \nUnited States abroad. Too often, though, it does none of those things. \nInstead, it enriches dictators and emboldens governments that act \nagainst our interests.\n  Right now American citizens who work for prodemocracy organizations \nin Egypt are being held hostage. There really is no other way to put \nit. These innocent American citizens are not being allowed to leave \nEgypt and are facing trial by a military government.\n  This situation has been allowed to escalate by the Obama \nadministration over the past several months, as authorities in Egypt \nhave accelerated a cynical war against these prodemocracy forces--these \nindividuals who are American citizens--in an attempt to gain support \nfrom radicals who are convinced that NGOs represent a Western plot to \nundermine Egypt. These extremists seek to impose their own agenda in \nEgypt and are determined to prevent Egypt's democratic process as much \nas possible.\n  The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in Egypt--the ones \nresponsible for the transition--has demonstrated that they are not only \nwilling but are in the process of using American citizens as scapegoats \nfor the continual upheaval in Egypt. Their actions do not illustrate a \nsignificant democratic transition. In fact, they are encouraging and \nprovoking distrust among the Egyptian people by making false \nallegations about the nature of these American citizens.\n  In the aftermath of the Arab revolution and the toppling of the \nauthoritarian Mubarak government, Egypt finds itself in critical need \nof support in order to build a functioning democratic system. Yet, in \nlate December, Egyptian authorities abruptly raided the offices of \nseveral nongovernmental organizations working toward democratic \ndevelopment, seizing their computers and documents. This past weekend \nEgyptian prosecutors filed criminal charges against these innocent \nAmerican citizens. This must not be allowed to stand.\n  The American people should be concerned. We are subsidizing behavior, \nthrough U.S. taxpayer foreign aid to Egypt, that is leading to and \nallowing for the unjust detainment of American citizens in Egypt. Egypt \nis one of the largest recipients of foreign aid, totaling over $70 \nbillion over the last half century. Egypt's ruling military has itself \nreceived $1.3 billion in foreign aid every year since 1987, and they \nhave the gall to hold American citizens hostage. This must end.\n  Not everyone in this body agrees on foreign policy or on the role of \nU.S. foreign assistance. But the reckless actions of Egyptian \nauthorities in this matter should bring us together to form one \nundeniable conclusion: American foreign assistance dollars should never \nbe provided to any country that bullies our citizens, recklessly seeks \nto arrest them on imaginary charges or denies them access to their most \nbasic rights.\n  Egypt must immediately stop the detainment and prosecution of these \nAmerican citizens. If they fail to do so, then we have the moral \nobligation to immediately end their foreign aid. The time for action is \nnow.\n  I will offer an amendment to suspend Egypt's foreign aid until our \nAmerican citizens are released. It is our duty as our people's \nrepresentatives to ensure no more American taxpayer dollars will flow \nto Egypt until they rescind the charges against innocent Americans and \nallow them to peacefully leave the country. The American people are \nbehind this, and I advise the Senate to consider that we should no \nlonger send foreign aid to a country that is illegally detaining our \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the Senator from Kentucky still on \nthe floor, I appreciate what he has said, and I am glad he has shown \nsupport for the Leahy amendment which passed in the last foreign aid \nbill.\n  There was a lot of pushback from a number of people, the \nadministration and on the Senator's side of the aisle, initially, when \nI wrote into the law that said it would suspend any money--$1.3 \nbillion--for the military, unless there was a certification that they \nwere upholding the moves necessary toward democracy.\n  As a result, all the money the Senator is concerned about is being \nheld back because of the Leahy amendment--which is joined in by Senator \nGraham, whom I see coming onto the floor--when we did the Foreign \nOperations bill.\n  I appreciate the words of the Senator from Kentucky. I can assure \nhim, with the Leahy amendment, none of the foreign aid is going to \nEgypt as they conduct their operations the way they are.\n\n\n           Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters in support of the reauthorization of the bipartisan Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                                 February 9, 2012.\n       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     represent millions of victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault and stalking, and the professionals \n     who serve them, throughout the United States and territories. \n     On behalf of the victims we represent, we ask that you \n     support the Violence Against Women Act's (VAWA) \n     reauthorization.\n       VAWA's programs support state, tribal and local efforts to \n     address the pervasive and insidious crimes of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. These \n     programs have made great progress towards keeping victims \n     safe and holding perpetrators accountable. This critical \n     legislation must be reauthorized to ensure a continued \n     response to these crimes.\n       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has dramatically \n     enhanced our nation's response to violence against women. \n     More victims report domestic violence to the police and the \n     rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence against women has \n     decreased by 53%. The sexual assault services program in VAWA \n     helps rape crisis centers keep their doors open to provide \n     the frontline response to victims of rape. VAWA provides for \n     a coordinated community approach, improving collaboration \n     between law enforcement and victim services providers to \n     better meet the needs of victims. These comprehensive and \n     cost-effective programs not only save lives, they also save \n     money. In fact, VAWA saved nearly $12.6 billion in net \n     averted social costs in just its first six years.\n       VAWA has unquestionably improved the national response to \n     these terrible crimes. We urge you to support VAWA's \n     reauthorization to build upon its successes and continue to \n     enhance our nation's ability to hold perpetrators accountable \n     and keep victims and their children safe from future harm.\n       We look forward to working with you throughout the \n     reauthorization process. If you have any questions, please \n     feel free to contact Juley Fulcher with Break the Cycle at \n     jfulcher@breakthecycle.org, Rob Valente with the National \n     Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges at \n     robvalente@dvpolicy.com, or Terri Poore with the National \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence at tpoore@fcasv.org.\n           Sincerely,\n       9to5, National Association of Working Women;

VAWA transformed the response to domestic \n     violence at the local, state and federal level. Its successes \n     have been dramatic, with the annual incidence of domestic \n     violence falling by more than 50 percent.\n       Even though the advancements made since in 1994 have been \n     significant, a tremendous amount of work remains and we \n     believe it is critical that the Congress reauthorize VAWA. \n     Every day in this country, abusive husbands or partners kill \n     three women, and for every victim killed, there are nine more \n     who narrowly escape that fate. We see this realized in our \n     home states every day. Earlier this year in Delaware, three \n     children--ages 12, 2\\1/2\\ and 1\\1/2\\--watched their mother be \n     beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend on a sidewalk. In Maine \n     last summer, an abusive husband subject to a protective order \n     murdered his wife and two young children before taking his \n     own life.\n       Reauthorizing VAWA will send a clear message that this \n     country does not tolerate violence against women and show \n     Congress' commitment to reducing domestic violence, \n     protecting women from sexual assault and securing justice for \n     victims.\n       VAWA reauthorization will continue critical support for \n     victim services and target three key areas where data shows \n     we must focus our efforts in order to have the greatest \n     impact:\n       Domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault are \n     most prevalent among young women aged 16-24, with studies \n     showing that youth attitudes are still largely tolerant of \n     violence, and that women abused in adolescence are more \n     likely to be abused again as adults. VAWA reauthorization \n     will help us break that cycle by consolidating and \n     strengthening programs aimed at both prevention and \n     intervention, with a particular emphasis on more effectively \n     engaging men and local community-based resources in the \n     process.\n       A woman who has been sexually assaulted can be subjected to \n     further distress when the healthcare, law enforcement, and \n     legal response to her attack is not coordinated and \n     productive. Whether it is a first responder without adequate \n     training, a rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of \n     funding, or a phone call between a crisis counselor and a \n     prosecutor that never takes place, sexual assault victims \n     deserve better. We must develop and implement best practices, \n     training, and communication tools across disciplines in order \n     to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators, as well as \n     help victims heal and rebuild their lives.\n       There is a growing consensus among practitioners and \n     researchers that domestic violence homicides are predictable \n     and, therefore, often preventable. We can save the lives of \n     untold numbers of potential homicide victims with better \n     training for advocates, law enforcement, and others who \n     interact with victims to recognize the warning signs and \n     react meaningfully.\n       The fight to protect women from violence is one that never \n     ends. It is not a year-to-year issue, which is why we think \n     it is critical that Congress reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act. We know a great deal more about domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking than we did 17 \n     years ago. Reauthorizing VAWA will allow us to build on those \n     lessons and continue to make progress and save lives.\n       VAWA was last reauthorized in 2006 and time is of the \n     essence for reauthorization of this important law. We urge \n     Congress to take on this critical mission and reauthorize \n     VAWA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 1, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo: On behalf of the \n     National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) and 3,079 elected \n     sheriffs nationwide, I am writing to express our support for \n     the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA).\n       NSA and the nation's sheriffs recognizes the extreme \n     seriousness that the crimes of domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, dating violence, stalking, and sex trafficking have \n     on law enforcement, victims, and communities across the \n     nation. Originally established in 1994, VAWA works to \n     increase officer and victim safety, while striving to prevent \n     future abuse, by providing resources to law enforcement \n     agencies to enhance their core programs and policies, as well \n     as to reaffirm the commitment to reform systems, that affect \n     victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, stalking, and sex trafficking.\n       The reauthorization of VAWA would continue to enable law \n     enforcement agencies across the country to adequately address \n     domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, \n     and sex trafficking crimes by expanding funding for programs \n     that recognize the concerns and needs of victims. \n     Furthermore, VAWA supports the key collaboration between the \n     victims' services community; health care community; and law \n     enforcement to ensure that all victims are receiving the \n     critical treatment and services necessary after a crime has \n     occurred.\n       However, we do have one point of concern regarding the VAWA \n     reauthorization involving PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act) \n     standards as they apply to the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS). NSA strongly believes that sexual violence \n     and abuse have no place in our correctional facilities. As \n     such, NSA has been working closely with the Department of \n     Justice (DOJ) on PREA to ensure that the final standards take \n     into consideration the vast differences between jails, which \n     sheriffs largely operate, versus prisons; thus enabling for \n     the efficient and effective implementation in jails \n     nationwide.\n       Title X of the VAWA reauthorization would require DHS to \n     establish and implement PREA standards for DHS detention \n     facilities. As you may be aware, many sheriffs contract with \n     DHS to house criminal aliens in their jails. As sheriffs will \n     need to comply with PREA standards when finally established \n     by the DOJ, NSA would ask that you, and the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, ensure that the VAWA reauthorization language \n     clarifies that DHS PREA standards need to be consistent with \n     DOJ PREA standards. This would ensure that there are not \n     differing standards for jails based on the federal, state, or \n     local detainees held, as well as help with the swift and \n     successful implementation of final PREA standards.\n       While the law enforcement community, and society as a \n     whole, has made great strides in combating such crimes as \n     domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, sex trafficking, \n     and dating violence since the original enactment of VAWA, \n     there is still more work that still needs to be done. The \n     reauthorization of VAWA will enable the continued partnership \n     among sheriffs and victims' advocates and service providers \n     to protect victims and prevent future victimization \n     throughout the United States.\n       Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo, the National Sheriffs' \n     Association thanks you for\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\n     your leadership on this important issue in the 112th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Sheriff Paul H. Fitzgerald,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf \n     of the 26,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \n     Association (FLEOA), I am writing to express our full support \n     for Senator Leahy's proposed reauthorization of the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA). FLEOA has supported the essential \n     purpose of this legislation since it was first passed in \n     1994. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, one in four women will experience domestic \n     violence in their lifetime. In our proud Land of the Free and \n     Home of the Brave, this is unacceptable.\n       FLEOA fully supports the substitute amendment to S. 1925. \n     The amendment properly calls for the U Visa cap to be raised \n     to allow for the recapture of 5,000 unused U Visas. Current \n     law authorizes an annual issuance of only 10,000 U Visas. \n     Unfortunately, dangerous criminals remain undaunted by this \n     cap and it only serves to discourage non-citizen battered \n     women from cooperating with law enforcement.\n       The absolute priority for all law enforcement officers is \n     the pursuit and capture of violent criminals. By limiting the \n     number of U Visas law enforcement can request, Congress is \n     effectively amputating the long arm of the law. Law \n     enforcement officers and prosecutors don't hand out U Visas \n     like cotton candy. U Visas are an essential tool carefully \n     used by law enforcement and tempered with great scrutiny. \n     Again, our unwavering priority is to do everything within our \n     means to protect women who are victimized by violent \n     criminals.\n       I respectfully ask that both parties rally behind this \n     important legislation, and that we unite in recognition of \n     the need to protect all battered women from dangerous \n     criminals.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                        Jon Adler,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. For almost 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act has \nbeen the centerpiece of the Federal Government's commitment to combat \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  Senator Crapo and I introduced this bill, a moderate bill, which has \nnow gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee and should be voted up \nor voted down. It saves money, but it also commits to those programs \nneeded by our States.\n  At some point, if it is delayed much longer, I am going to come to \nthe floor and recount some of the horrific crime scenes I went to of \nviolence, sexual violence, domestic violence, the things that are being \ncombated now, things that happened when we did not have the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  Last Thursday, the Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act. For almost 18 years, the \nViolence Against Women Act, VAWA, has been the centerpiece of the \nFederal government's commitment to combat domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  It has been extraordinarily effective, and the annual incidence of \ndomestic violence has fallen by more than 50 percent since the landmark \nlaw was first passed.\n  As a prosecutor in Vermont, I saw firsthand the destruction caused by \ndomestic and sexual violence. Those were the days before VAWA, when too \noften people dismissed these serious crimes with a joke, and there were \nfew, if any, services for victims.\n  We must not go back to those days. This law saves lives, and it must \nbe reauthorized.\n  Senator Crapo and I introduced a moderate bill that incorporates \ninput from survivors of domestic and sexual violence all around the \ncountry and the tireless professionals who serve them every day.\n  This legislation builds on the progress that has been made in \nreducing violence against women, and it makes vital improvements to \nrespond to remaining, unmet needs.\n  Unfortunately, partisan politics threaten to stop this critical \nlegislation from moving forward. We have seen this same pattern too \noften.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and the Second \nChance Act, both laws originally championed by Republican Senators and \nsupported by Republican Presidents, are now suddenly unacceptable.\n  This obstruction must stop. These programs are too important. They \nsave lives. They make our communities safer.\n  Nowhere is that more true than for the Violence Against Women Act. \nCertainly, helping survivors of domestic and sexual violence should be \nabove politics.\n  The last two times VAWA was reauthorized, it was unanimously approved \nby the Senate. Now, this law, which has done more to stop domestic and \nsexual violence than any other legislation ever passed, faces \nRepublican opposition. That is not right.\n  To those who suggest that this legislation creates too many new \nprograms, I say that is simply not true. In fact, the bill reduces the \nscale of VAWA.\n  It consolidates 13 existing programs and reduces authorization levels \nby nearly 20 percent while providing for only one small additional \nprogram.\n  The improvements in this bill are important but modest when compared \nto previous reauthorizations, which created many new grant programs and \nraised authorization levels almost across the board.\n  I have heard some say that our bill protects too many victims. I find \nthat disheartening. One thing I know from my time as a prosecutor, and \nI would hope it is something we can all agree on, is that every victim \ncounts.\n  All victims deserve protection. That is a message we have heard loud \nand clear from our States and something I hope is common ground.\n  More than 200 national organizations and 500 State and local \norganizations have expressed their support for this bill.\n  Many of them have written strong letters urging swift passage of this \nlegislation including the National Task Force to End Sexual and \nDomestic Violence, the National Association of Attorneys General, the \nNational District Attorneys' Association, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.\n  This legislation has the support of five Republican Senators.\n  I thank Senators Crapo, Kirk, Murkowski, Brown, and Collins for their \nwillingness to step forward and support the reauthorization of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  This is the Violence Against Women Act. It should not be a partisan \nmatter.\n  I hope that all Senators will support this bill and that we can move \nquickly to reauthorize this critical legislation.\n  It is a law that has saved countless lives, and it is an example of \nwhat we can accomplish when we work together.\n\n\n                    Air National Guard and Reserves\n\n  Madam President, I am glad to see the senior Senator from South \nCarolina. For the first 50 or 60 years I was in the Senate--or it felt \nlike that--it was a different senior Senator. But I am delighted to see \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, who is joining me \nto address a matter of great importance to the Nation at a crucial \nmoment in our history.\n  The U.S. Air Force last week offered a preliminary look into its \nbudget for fiscal year 2013. While the President will formally submit \nhis budget proposals on Monday, last week's briefing and information \npapers offered enough detail for the Senate to begin considering the \noverall strategic direction of the Air Force Future Years Defense \nProgram. In Pentagon jargon, that is usually called FYDP.\n  I have to say I am deeply disappointed and very worried as I look at \nthe first glance at that proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to engage \nin this colloquy.\n  As cochairman of the Guard Caucus, which obviously has the Air \nNational Guard Component, Senator Leahy has been a real pleasure to \nwork with.\n  The bottom line is, this effort to downsize the Air Force falls \nincredibly heavy on the Air National Guard. There will be 3,000 Active-\nDuty members lost regarding the plan he just mentioned, 5,000 coming \nfrom the Air National Guard. The airframes to be eliminated in the \nplans Senator Leahy just mentioned fall disproportionately on the Air \nNational Guard. In just a moment, we are going to talk about the bang \nfor your buck in terms of the Reserve component called the Air National \nGuard, and we are going to challenge the Congress and the Department\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nof Defense to reconsider this because, quite frankly, it makes no \nmilitary or fiscal sense.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As an example of the approach to the budget cuts, one of \nthe A-10 units slated for cutting, the 127th Wing from Michigan, just \nreturned from fighting bravely in Afghanistan and as a welcome home: \nGreat job. Sorry, we are going to disband you.\n  The approach to budget cuts the Air Force has decided to take is \nsimply wrong. We have to have budget cuts. We know that. But there is a \nwide variety of reasons why this makes not the sense it should. I draw \nthe Senate's attention to a study produced by the Pentagon last year \nthat was signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs that demonstrated \nwhat we already knew: Even when mobilized, Reserve component units are \nfar less expensive than their peer units in the Active component.\n  It has always been a foregone conclusion that the Air National Guard \ncosts are far less than Active component costs when they are on base or \nin garrison. Personnel are not drawing the salaries their peer units \nare and so on. But the Pentagon report showed something more \ninteresting. It showed the Guard and Reserve save taxpayers dollars \neven when mobilized. The Reserve component units are estimated to be \nabout one-third as expensive as similar Active component units, and \nthey can deploy nearly half as often. That adds up to lot of savings in \ndollars and cents, but it also reflects a very major component of our \nsecurity, because in the wars we fought in the last decade, we could \nnot have done it without these Guard and Reserve units.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely right. When we look at the \nutilization of the Guard and Reserve since 9/11, it has been at World \nWar II levels. When we go into the combat theater, we can't tell the \ndifference between Guard, Reserve or Active-Duty member, which is a \ntestament to all three.\n  But when we look at what the Air Force is doing--and I think it is \nproper to consider the other services--the Marine Corps is making no \nreduction to their Reserves. The Army is making very small cuts in the \nGuard and Reserves and substantial cuts to the Active Forces. The Army \nand Marine Corps plans support the new strategic concept of \nreversibility; that is, the part of the Department of Defense strategic \nguidance. We cannot be sure what contingencies might arise, and we \ncannot afford to make cuts that will leave us incapable of responding \nwhen necessary.\n  Secretary Flournoy, during her last speech to the Defense for Policy, \nstated that ``the Guard and the Reserves will play an extremely \nimportant role'' in the reversibility concept because they give the \nmilitary built-in adaptability and resourcefulness. This reversibility \nconcept is what we are doing to reduce the defense infrastructure. If \nit were ever reversed or had to be reversed because of some \ncontingency, we want to make sure that is possible. The Guard and \nReserve is the most capable force to maintain and, in terms of the \nconcept of reversibility, is our best bang for the buck.\n  So the Air Force is taking a different approach than the Army, Navy, \nand Marine Corps to their Reserve component, particularly their Air \nNational Guard. I think Senator Leahy and I are going to make sure that \ndecision is examined in-depth.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with my colleague on that, and that is why the \nbipartisan Guard Caucus will have some very strong statements.\n  We look at what the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, GEN Ron \nFogelman, said before these plans were announced. He argued for a \nlarger Reserve component and a smaller Active-Duty Force. He did a \nguest column in DefenseNews. He said, among other things:\n\n       The big question is, how does the department reduce its \n     budget and continue to provide a modern, balanced and ready \n     defense when more than half of the budget is committed to \n     personnel costs?\n       The answer to that question is right before us: We should \n     return to our historic roots as a militia nation. So, what \n     does that mean, exactly? Simply put, it means we should \n     return to the constitutional construct for our military and \n     the days when we maintained a smaller standing military and a \n     robust militia.\n       To do that, leaders must put old parochial norms aside and \n     be willing to actually shift forces and capabilities to the \n     National Guard and Reserve.\n\n  He said ``put old parochial norms aside.'' He goes on to say:\n\n       This would enable significant personnel reductions in the \n     active components. It would also result in a larger reserve \n     component. Most important, it would preserve capability and \n     equipment that has cost the American taxpayer trillions of \n     dollars, nest it in our mostly part-time Guard and Reserve, \n     and have it available should it be needed.\n       This concept worked well for our country for the better \n     part of two centuries. Unfortunately, several generations of \n     leaders have come and gone, and most of today's leadership \n     fails to recognize the true potential of the militia model.\n       We need our collective senior military and civilian leaders \n     to recognize there is a way back to a smaller active military \n     and a larger militia posture. The fiscal environment and \n     emerging threats demand it.\n\n  Those aren't my words. Those are the words of a former Air Force \nChief of Staff.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Leahy is right. When we look at our Constitution \nitself, it talks about a militia. When we look at the history of the \ncountry, it is the citizen soldier who got this whole concept called \nAmerica started.\n  We do need a standing Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. But \nwhen we are looking at the budget problems we face and the fiscal \nconcerns we have as a nation and we want to restructure the military, I \nwill be talking in just a minute about why we should be looking for a \ngreater role from the Guard and Reserve just from economics. But when \nit comes to military capability, I think we have the best of both \nworlds now: a very efficient, quite frankly, cheaper force to maintain \nwith very similar, if not like, capabilities. We don't want to let that \nconcept be eroded by a plan that I think doesn't appreciate the role of \nthe militia and doesn't appreciate the cost-benefit analysis from a \nrobust Reserve component.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In fact, Senator Graham and I introduced a successful \namendment in last year's Defense authorization bill that required the \nPentagon and the GAO perform studies that should produce more \nconclusive analysis of the relative cost of similar units in the Active \ncomponents and the Reserve components. We are also aware of at least \ntwo other third-party studies currently underway to address the \nquestions. I think we are going to have three or four such studies that \nwill conclusively answer the questions. Senator Graham and I--and I \nthink most of our colleagues in the Senate--consider these proposed Air \nForce cuts to be dangerously premature. Once we cut the Reserve \ncomponents, once we send an aircraft to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan \nAir Force Base and these airmen and pilots go out to civilian life, we \ndon't get them back. In fact, that is precisely why the Army and Marine \nCorps have taken a different approach of preserving their Reserve \ncomponent force structure: They can mobilize Active component troops \nthey place in the Reserve component. But once we cut that, they are \ngone forever. They are gone forever.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I am about to provide to the body, I think we need \nto absorb and be aware of.\n  This study that Senator Leahy is talking about, an analysis of the \neffectiveness and cost, is an ongoing endeavor. I would like to know \nmore about what the study yields before we make what I think are pretty \nDraconian cuts in the Air National Guard.\n  But this is what we know before the study. This information is \nalready in: According to an Air Guard briefing, the Air National Guard, \noperating under today's deployment constraints, is still 53 percent of \nthe cost of an equivalent Active-Duty major command. The Air National \nGuard costs $2.25 billion less annually than a similarly sized Active \nAir Force command. That is $6.2 million a day in savings.\n  After 20 years of service, our average enlisted airman costs nearly \n$80,000 a year in total compensation. On the other hand, an identical \nAir National Guard enlisted airman costs about $10,000 a year, about an \n85-percent savings.\n  Over a 20-year career, an Air National Guard airman will save the \ncountry about $1 million compared to an active-duty airman. At 22 \nyears, an active-duty pilot will cost about $150,000 in compensation. \nOn the other hand, an Air National Guard pilot at 22\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nyears costs the taxpayers about $30,000 in total compensation. Over a \n26-year career, an Air National Guard pilot will save the country \nnearly $2 million compared to an active-duty pilot.\n  Active-duty pilots retire on average with 22 years of service. Air \nNational Guard pilots retire with an average of 26 years of experience, \ngiving the country a greater level of experience and ability for those \nfinal 4 years, at a much lower cost. These cost figures do not even \naccount for other life cycle and infrastructure savings that a Reserve \ncomponent-first model would yield.\n  These are stunning numbers without the study to fully be \naccomplished. We are going to do our best, I say to Senator Leahy, to \ntell the story of capability and cost.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, clearly this approach, if we keep the \nGuard and Reserve, saves our country precious resources at a time we \nneed to tighten our belts. There are a couple of things we agree on. \nEverybody in the Senate agrees that our military has to be kept strong \nand vigilant to threats from our enemies. But the source of our \nmilitary strength has been and always will be our economic might. If we \nare to protect ourselves militarily while also marshaling our economic \npower, moving to the kind of constitutional defense model my colleague \nhas discussed should be our first choice.\n  I think these Air Force proposals are ill-advised and premature at \nthe very least. I think they are flat-out wrong, as has already been \nsaid here on the floor. When any of us who have visited the areas, \nespecially in the last few years, where our military guard and our \nReserves are deployed, you cannot tell the difference between their \nduties or the risks they put themselves in--between the active-duty and \nGuard and Reserve components. The National Guard has been given a much \ngreater role in our overall national defense--more missions, greater \nresponsibility, heavier burdens. They perform these missions superbly, \nwith great skill and effectiveness. They have defended our interests, \nand many have lost their lives doing it, but they carried out the same \nmissions as everybody else.\n  The Senate National Guard Caucus worked closely with all concerned to \naccommodate and facilitate these changes. But now we are going to take \nan active role in informing the Senate as these are being made. We are \nnot going to sit by while any of the military services decimate their \nReserve components. We will work together, Senator Graham and I, with \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on which he serves with \ndistinction, and the Senate Appropriations Committee on which we are \nboth privileged to serve, but also the entire membership of the Senate, \nto produce a thoughtful, well-conceived strategy for military manpower \nthat makes use of a cost-effective and accessible, fully operational, \ntrained, and ready Reserve component.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I look forward to working with Senator Leahy and others \nto bring about what he indicated to make it a reality. The bottom line \nof this whole discussion is that the Cold War is over. We are very \nproud of our standing military, our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine \nCorps, Coast Guard--they do a terrific job, the standing military. The \nmilitia component has been the heart and soul of this country since its \nfounding and in a post-Cold War war on terrorism environment where you \nhave to call on resources that the Guard and Reserve have that are \nunique--like civil affairs. When you are going into Afghanistan and \nIraq, it is one thing to clear the village; you have to hold the \nvillage. You have to hold it. Agricultural specialists come from the \nGuard and Reserve, people from Vermont and South Carolina who have \nskills in their day job, who can do more in the war effort than \ndropping a bomb.\n  As we look at the threats we face, I think we need to understand the \nReserve component is more valuable than ever. We are not defending the \nFulda Gap against a massive Soviet Union tank invasion. We have to be \nnimble, we have to deploy quickly. The Reserve component, particularly \nthe Air National Guard, has a great return on investment and, like any \nother part of the military, can be reformed. But this proposal doesn't \nreform it; it in many ways neuters the Air National Guard and at a time \nwhen that makes no sense. We will continue this endeavor, and I look \nforward to working with Senator Leahy and others to create a rational \napproach to the Reserve and Guard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from South Carolina. We will from time \nto time report to the Senate on this issue. It is extremely important. \nIt comes down to the bottom line: Have the best defense at the least \ncost to the taxpayer. That is what we are both aiming for.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Nomination\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that today, \nFebruary 9, at 1:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider Calendar No. 407; that there be 30 minutes divided in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time the Senate \nproceed to vote with no intervening action or debate on Calendar No. \n407; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order; and that any statements related to this matter be printed in \nthe Record; that President Obama be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; and the Senate proceed then to legislative session and \nthe cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1813, under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask permission to speak as in morning business for \nabout 12 or 13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Operation Fast and Furious\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for over a year now I have been \ninvestigating Fast and Furious. That is an operation coming out of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\n  This has been a very complicated investigation. It has been made even \nmore difficult because of the Justice Department's lack of candor and \ntransparency. Basically, the Justice Department is stonewalling, \ninterfering with Congress's constitutional responsibility of oversight.\n  For example, the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General \nrecently disclosed that it has received 80,000 pages of documents from \nthe Department and over 100,000 e-mails.\n  Think of what the Inspector General gets from the Department: 80,000 \npages and 100,000 e-mails. How much do you think they have given the \nCongress of the United States, which has the constitutional \nresponsibility of oversight? It is only 6,000 pages that we have \nreceived.\n  Similarly, the inspector general has been allowed to conduct 70 \nwitness interviews. How many has the Justice Department allowed the \nCongress, in our responsibility of oversight, to interview? Only 9 \nwitnesses.\n  Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the House \nCommittee On Oversight and Government Reform. The Justice Department \ndid a document dump to Congress the Friday night before the hearing. \nThat has become a very bad habit of the Department of Justice. In fact, \nwithout giving us any advance notice that it was coming, they actually \nput a CD under the door of our office, after business hours. What did \nthey do for the press? They gave the same documents to the press 2 \nhours before they ever gave them to us. Yes, they managed to find time \nto leak the documents to the press during regular business hours. This \nis the kind of cooperation we get from the Justice Department in our \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight.\n  What I am telling my colleagues here is that we have a terrible lack \nof cooperation from the Justice Department. The Justice Department is \nnot only thumbing its nose at the Senate, they are doing it to the \nentire Congress of the United States, when we know there are 80,000 \npages of documents and they only give us 6,000 pages; when\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nthere are 100,000 e-mails and we get a handful of e-mails. Why would \nthey be so mysterious by putting a disk under our door on a Friday \nnight and giving it to the press 2 hours before? What sort of attitude \nis that of our Justice Department toward the cooperation you ought to \nhave with our filling our constitutional role of oversight? So I guess \nI would say there is hardly any cooperation whatsoever from the Justice \nDepartment.\n\n  Even though we get a dribble here and a dribble there, even though we \nget a CD under the door, instead of very openly face to face receiving \ndocuments, what we got last Friday did reveal further facts about a \npreviously unknown proposal to allow these guns to cross the border.\n  We have long known that in March of 2011, Deputy Attorney General \nJames Cole had a conference call with all Southwest border U.S. agents. \nIn a follow-up e-mail after the call, Mr. Cole wrote:\n\n       As I said on the call, to avoid any potential confusion, I \n     want to reiterate the Department's policy: We should not \n     design or conduct undercover operations which include guns \n     crossing the border. If we have knowledge that guns are about \n     to cross the border, we must take immediate action to stop \n     the firearms from crossing the border, even if that \n     prematurely terminates or otherwise jeopardizes an \n     investigation.\n\n  Attorney General Holder himself told us in a hearing in May that Mr. \nCole was simply reiterating an existing Justice policy in his e-mails, \nnot communicating new policy. So imagine my surprise when I discovered \nin the document slid under my door late last Friday that while in \nMexico Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer proposed letting guns \ncross the border. Mr. Breuer's proposal came at exactly the same time \nthe Department was preparing to send its letter to me denying that the \nATF ever does the very thing he was proposing.\n  In a February 4, 2011 e-mail, the Justice Department attache in \nMexico City wrote to a number of officials at the Justice Department:\n\n       AAG Breuer proposed allowing straw purchasers to cross into \n     Mexico so [the Secretariat of Public Safety] can attest and \n     [the Attorney General of Mexico] can prosecute and convict. \n     Such coordinated operations between the US and Mexico may \n     send a strong message to arms traffickers.\n\n  We have people here in Washington saying the program doesn't exist at \nthe same time we have people talking down in Mexico City of what we are \ntrying to accomplish by the illegal sale of guns.\n  That e-mail I quoted, the recipient of it included Mr. Breuer's \ndeputy, Jason Weinstein, who was helping to write the Justice \nDepartment letter to me that they would later withdraw for its \ninaccuracies. In other words, they wrote a letter to me on February 4 \nof last year that in October they admitted they misled us. Mr. \nWeinstein was sending updates about the draft letter to Mr. Breuer in \nMexico at the very same time so he cannot say he didn't know about it. \nYet, during his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Breuer \ndownplayed his involvement in reviewing the draft letter. It is \noutrageous to me that the head of the Justice Department's Criminal \nDivision proposed exactly what his Department was denying to me was \nactually happening.\n  The Justice Department's letter to me clearly said:\n\n       ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been \n     purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to \n     Mexico.\n\n  They said that at the very same time Mr. Breuer was advocating that a \nJustice Department operation allow weapons to be transported into \nMexico. Further, what Mr. Breuer advocated directly contradicted what \nthe Justice Department said its policy was.\n  Is it possible they can have it both ways? No, you cannot have it \nboth ways. If they didn't have a policy against such operations, and if \nthe left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, perhaps it is \nnot a surprise that an operation like Fast and Furious sprang up. After \nall, as that same Justice Department attache wrote of a meeting a few \ndays after his first e-mail:\n\n       I raised the issue that there is an inherent risk in \n     allowing weapons to pass from the US to Mexico; the \n     possibility of the [Government of Mexico] not seizing the \n     weapons; and the weapons being used to commit a crime in \n     Mexico.\n\n  Well, the light bulb went on. If you are selling 2,000 guns illegally \nand they don't interdict them, well, yes, they end up murdering \nhundreds of people in Mexico and at least one person in the United \nStates.\n  If the Justice Department did have a policy against such operations, \nthis is a record of Mr. Breuer proposing to violate it. That is not \njust my conclusion, that is the Attorney General's conclusion as well.\n  At last week's hearing in the House of Representatives, the Attorney \nGeneral was asked to explain the contradiction between his deputy's \nanti-gunwalking policy and the evidence of Mr. Breuer's proposed \noperation to let guns cross the border. He could not answer that \nquestion, but the Attorney General answered:\n\n       Well, clearly what was proposed in, I guess, February by \n     Lanny Breuer was in contravention of the policy that I had \n     the Deputy Attorney General make clear to everybody at Main \n     Justice and to the field . . .\n\n  Perhaps this disconnect between Justice Department policy and Lanny \nBreuer's proposal explains Mr. Breuer's previous inaction to stop \ngunwalking. When he found out about gunwalking in Operation Wide \nReceiver in April of 2010, he failed to do anything to stop it or to \nhold anyone accountable. He simply had his deputy inform ATF \nleadership.\n  Regardless, Mr. Breuer's contravention of Justice Department policy \nis yet another reason why it is long past time for Mr. Breuer to leave \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Mr. Breuer misled Congress about whether he was aware of the \nDepartment's false letter to me. To this day he is still the highest \nranking official in any administration that we know was aware of \ngunwalking in any Federal program, yet he took no action to stop \ngunwalking. He failed to alert the Attorney General or the inspector \ngeneral.\n  Mr. Breuer has failed the Justice Department, and he has failed the \nAmerican people. This failure raises some important questions. When did \nAttorney General Holder determine that Mr. Breuer was proposing \nallowing straw purchasers to reach Mexico with traffic weapons? What \nhas he done about it? Will Mr. Breuer be held accountable for hatching \na plan to directly violate the Attorney General's anti-gunwalking \npolicy? The Attorney General clearly testified that the proposal was in \ncontravention of that policy. How does the Justice Department know \nother senior criminal division officials were not proposing operations \nsimilar to Fast and Furious? These are just a subset of some of the \nmajor questions remaining in our investigation of Fast and Furious.\n\n  It has now been 1 year since the Department sent me its false letter. \nHow did the Justice Department move from its position of dismissing the \ncomplaints of whistleblowers to acknowledging that now those \nwhistleblower complaints are true? What officials were internally \ndismissive of whistleblower complaints and who believes that they could \nhave merit and should be taken seriously? To what extent did Justice \nDepartment officials seek to retaliate against whistleblowers? Exactly \nhow and when did the Justice Department officials begin to learn the \ntruth of what happened?\n  Former ATF Director Ken Melson has testified how and when he learned \nthat guns had walked in Fast and Furious. What about Attorney General \nHolder? When and how did he learn guns had walked? What about Assistant \nAttorney General Lanny Breuer? A year after Operation Fast and Furious \nconcluded, who will be held accountable? Why didn't top Justice \nofficials see the clear connection between Fast and Furious and \npreviously flawed operations that they have admitted they knew about? \nHow has the Justice Department assessed the mistakes and culpability of \nthese officials?\n  Finally, it is time for the Justice Department to stop stonewalling \nand start providing answers. It is time for Holder to share with \nCongress the other 74,000 pages of documents they have turned over to \nthe inspector general. It is time for Holder to give us access to the \ndozens of other people the inspector general has been allowed to \ninterview.\n  In short, it is time for Holder to come clean with the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nThe sooner he does it, and the Department does it, the sooner we can \nget to the bottom of what happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I do \nweek after week, as a physician who practiced medicine in Casper, WY, \ntaking care of families in the community and across the State for about \na quarter of a century. I come as a doctor providing a second opinion \nabout the health care law. Since this health care law was signed by the \nPresident almost 2 years ago, the public has been overwhelmingly \nopposed to it. The Democrats in Congress drafted this health care law. \nThey did so quickly and behind closed doors. In spite of the \nPresident's promise that the discussions would be held on C-SPAN, no \none saw what was happening.\n  Now the bill is law and, as Nancy Pelosi said, first you have to pass \nit before you get to find out what is in it. We have, as Americans, \nwitnessed week after week the unintended consequences of the rush of \nthe Democrats to score what they thought would be a political victory. \nSo I continue to come to the floor with a second opinion because week \nafter week there is another new finding of this monstrous law, and it \nis why week after week this health care law remains incredibly \nunpopular. The list of victims of this law continues to grow longer \neach week. Small business owners, families, people who get their \ncoverage through their employers, and patients all across the country \nhave already been impacted by this health care law.\n  But on January 20, the third anniversary of the President's \ninauguration, the President's health care law found a very new target, \nand that target amazingly is religious liberty. Now this administration \nis mandating that religious institutions provide services that \nundermine the beliefs of religious institutions across the country. In \nmy opinion, and in the opinion of many across this Nation, this ruling \ntramples one of the amendments of the Constitution. I would say it is \nan easy amendment to find since it is the first one. It is the one \nwhich protects the rights to freedom of religion and freedom of \nexpression. Reading from the Constitution, Amendment No. 1, Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n  If you take a look back at our Nation's history, the right to freedom \nof religion is one of the main reasons that many people came to America \nin the first place, and it is one of the reasons people have fought and \nhave died for our Nation.\n  So what is someone to do? Well, Washington Archbishop Donald Wuerl \nhas expressed the dilemma many institutions face, and he did it in a \nletter last week. The archbishop in Washington said the mandate will \nallow a Catholic school only one of three options: No. 1, to violate \nits beliefs by providing coverage for medications and procedures that \nCatholics believe are immoral; No. 2, to cease providing insurance \ncoverage for all of its employees and then face ongoing and ultimately \nruinous fines; or, No. 3, attempt to qualify for the exemptions by \nhiring and serving only Catholics, exclude everyone else.\n\n  Many Americans understand all three of those options are \nindefensible. Americans from across the political spectrum are speaking \nout against President Obama's big government power grab. One of my \nDemocratic colleagues, Senator Joe Manchin, called this mandate un-\nAmerican. Another, Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, \nobjected to forcing Catholic institutions to violate their religious \nbeliefs. Then we have former Representative Kathy Dahlkemper, a \nDemocrat from Pennsylvania, who voted for the health care law in the \nHouse of Representatives, who said she would never have voted for the \nfinal version of the health care law ``if I expected the Obama \nadministration to force Catholic hospitals and Catholic colleges and \nuniversities to pay for contraception.''\n  Even liberal commentators such as E.J. Dionne and Mark Shields have \ncriticized the administration for being unwilling to offer a broader \nconscience exemption to religious-affiliated institutions.\n  Now that the President's liberal allies are even opposed to this \nunprecedented power grab, the White House is trying to clean up the \nmess. It has signaled that it is willing to compromise on its decision. \nInstead of a mild compromise, the regulation--and the entire health \ncare law--needs to be fully repealed. As the Wall Street Journal \neditorial board points out:\n\n       In any case HHS would revive this coercion whenever it is \n     politically convenient sometime in Mr. Obama's second term. \n     Religious liberty won't be protected from the entitlement \n     state until Obamacare is repealed.\n\n  I think all Americans should be afraid of the course this White House \nis on with this regulation. This debate isn't about women's health; it \nis about power. Washington should not have the power to force religious \npeople and religious institutions to take actions that contradict their \nbeliefs.\n  What we are going to continue to see as the health care law and the \nmandates and the regulations continue to come out is a government and \nan administration that continue to expand the government reach in terms \nof its size, in terms of its scope, and in terms of its grab for power.\n  The health care law was supposed to be about people and health care--\nthe care they need from the doctor they want at a cost they can afford. \nInstead we have a lot of IRS agents but no new doctors and nurses. I go \nto townhall meetings and ask: How many of you under this health care \nlaw who are hoping to get the care you need from a doctor you want at a \nprice you can afford--how many of you believe the cost of your health \ncare, because of this health care law, will increase, the costs to you \nwill go up? All the hands went up. That is what the people believe when \nthey hear more and more about this health care law.\n  Then I say: How many of you believe the quality and availability of \nyour care will go down? Again, the hands went up.\n  These are the American people knowing everything they do about the \nhealth care law, which is very complicated and has not given them what \nthey asked for: the care they need, from a doctor they want, at a cost \nthey can afford. What they find and believe is that they are going to \nbe actually paying more and getting less. That is not what the American \npeople have been promised. It is not what they want. It is not what \nthey expected. But it is what they are finding out they have received \nnow that the law has passed.\n  So this clearly explains why Republicans in the Senate and in the \nHouse continue to be committed to repealing the President's health care \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, if I could ask my friend \nthrough the Chair, would it be possible for me to have 2 minutes prior \nto his statement, and then following my remarks the floor will be the \nSenator's.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to take 2 minutes to respond to \nSenator Barrasso, who offered a second opinion. I hope my colleague \nwill also talk about that.\n  I have to say it is stunning to see the assault on women's health \nthat is taking place from the Republican Party day after day after day. \nFirst, they tried to stop women from getting breast screenings. Then \nthey tried to stop us from getting cervical cancer screenings. Now they \nare going after our ability to get birth control.\n  I have to say this: We know that for a full 15 percent of women, \nbirth control is pure medicine. They suffer from debilitating monthly \npain, endometriosis. We have stories of women who couldn't afford birth \ncontrol pills and a cyst got out of hand resulting in the loss of an \novary. We know that birth control is used for a very serious skin \ncondition. So if they want to stand here and say that women don't have \na right to our medicine, that is their right but don't put it into the \nframe of religious freedom.\n  We know President Obama said he was going to do what 28 States have\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\ndone; that is, to make sure women who work in this country have the \nability to get access to birth control pills through their insurance. \nThat is as simple as it gets. Twenty-eight States do it. I never heard \na word out of them--never. And eight of those States had no exception \nwhen President Obama made an exception for 335,000 churches.\n  So let's not stand here and talk about the overreach of the Federal \nGovernment and the rest of it. The fact is our States have been doing \nthis for years. More than 50 percent of women in this Nation have the \nability to get contraception. It is about health. It is the Institute \nof Medicine that said it is critical. It will cut down on tens of \nthousands of abortions when families plan their families.\n  So as long as our colleagues on the other side want to make women a \npolitical football in this country, there are many of us here, women \nand men alike, who are going to stand sentry and say: You can't do this \nto the women of this Nation.\n  This is the 21st century, and we are arguing about birth control \ninstead of how to get out of this economic malaise when we are finally \nseeing light at the end of the tunnel? Oh, no. I am hoping we go to a \nhighway bill this afternoon, but we have to now have this diversion \nabout an issue that was resolved, frankly, in the 1950s and in the \n1960s.\n  So I thank my colleague for this opportunity. Senator Barrasso has a \nright to a second opinion, but I think his opinion is off the mark.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from California. She is on the floor today with Senator \nInhofe--unlikely peas in a pod, one pretty liberal, one pretty \nconservative, very different views--to talk about job creation, \ninfrastructure, building highways and bridges and public transit, and \njob creation. As so often is the case, people on the other side want to \nchange the subject.\n  In my State, the elections 1\\1/2\\, 2 years ago were all about lost \njobs, about lost manufacturing jobs that, frankly, accelerated during \nthe Bush years, and we finally turned that manufacturing job loss \naround. We have seen 20 straight months of job increases in \nmanufacturing.\n  But the legislature in Columbus, my State capital, and the Governor, \nwhat are they doing? They are not fighting for job creation. They are \ngoing after workers' rights and women's rights--the heartbeat bill, \npretty extreme--instead of focusing on job creation.\n  That is what I came to discuss on the Senate floor today too--not \nspecifically on this bill but another infrastructure bill, which I will \nget to in a moment.\n  The comment I heard from Senator Barrasso, only from the end of his \ndiscussion, was that he wants to repeal the health care law. How do \nthey tell a 23-year-old who now is on her mother's insurance, who is \nwithout a job and doesn't have insurance, that she is going to lose her \ninsurance she has through her mother's insurance? How are they going to \nexplain it to the family who has a child with a preexisting condition \nwho now can get insurance when the insurance company denied it before? \nHow are they going to explain it to the Medicare retiree, the 72-year-\nold woman on Medicare who now has no copay, no deductible, free \nscreenings for osteoporosis, or the man who gets prostate screenings--\nhow are they going to explain that? They want to repeal that.\n  How are they going to explain the fact that they want to repeal \nstopping one of the most insidious insurance company practices, which \nis that if people get too sick and they are too expensive, insurance \ncompanies just cut them off? They want to repeal that prohibition. I \nguess it is because they want to do the insurance companies' bidding \nover and over. That is a big part of their game.\n  It just breaks my heart when I see the progress we have made for the \nmillions of Americans who now will have health insurance. I know the \nSenator and my colleagues, everybody in this body has good health \ninsurance. People in this body are generally pretty affluent. They have \ngood government insurance. But they don't want millions of men and \nwomen in our country--people who have lost jobs, people who are working \nwithout insurance--they don't want them to have insurance, all for some \npolitical gain of repealing ObamaCare. It is too bad.\n  Madam President, now I wish to focus on job creation. I wish to make \nsome remarks on legislation I introduced today that is not directly \nSenator Boxer's and Senator Inhofe's highway bill, but it is about \nwater and sewer systems and infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S413-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S413-S417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, earlier today I was on a call with \nTony Parrott, executive director of the Metropolitan Sewer District of \nGreater Cincinnati. We talked about how communities in Ohio are \nstruggling to afford the necessary upgrades to improve sewer systems. \nIn parts of the State with something called combined sewer systems, \nevery time there are heavy rains waste and storm water overflows, the \nsewers overflow, and the water is dumped into our rivers and creeks and \nlakes.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 800 billion \ngallons of untreated wastewater and storm water from these combined \nsewage overflows, these combined sewer systems, are released into our \nrivers, lakes, and streams each year. It poses a threat to public \nhealth and the environment, and it undermines the competitiveness of \nour businesses. So not only do building these water and sewer systems \nand upgrades create jobs, but we also know if we don't, local \nbusinesses aren't going to expand. If they are not certain they are \ngoing to have good, clean water available at a decent and reasonable \ncost, they are not going to expand their businesses, especially if it \nis manufacturing.\n  The cost of addressing these combined sewage overflow systems in Ohio \nis some $6 billion according to the EPA, $1 billion in northeast Ohio, \nand $2 billion in the Cincinnati area.\n  So that is why today, because there are 81 Ohio communities requiring \nwater infrastructure improvements, I am reintroducing the Clean Water \nAffordability Act. In previous Congresses I introduced this legislation \nwith our Republican colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich. This bill \nwill protect ratepayers, lead to cleaner water, and promote economic \ndevelopment. It would invest $1.8 billion to be distributed over the \nnext 5 years through a grant program for financially distressed \ncommunities administered by EPA Administrator Jackson. I have spoken to \nher conveying the concern of Ohio's CSO communities. The program \nprovides a 75/25 cost share, similar to what we have done on highway \nissues in the past: 75 percent Federal Government cost, 25 percent \nlocal government cost.\n  It is estimated that every $1 billion invested in infrastructure, \nsimilar to the highway bill that Senators Inhofe and Boxer are working \non, will create--that for every $1 billion invested, upwards of 20,000 \njobs would be created.\n  It will promote green infrastructure. Cities such as Bucyrus or \nSteubenville should be encouraged to use green infrastructure if it \ncosts less than traditional construction and produces the same \nenvironmental benefits.\n  I will continue to work with mayors such as Dave Berger of Lima and \nBob Armstrong of Defiance, county commissioners, and others such as \nTony Parrot, who explained to me how years of reduced infrastructure \ninvestments have eroded their water and sewer systems.\n  When we were kids in the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s and into the \n1980s, the U.S. infrastructure was the envy of the world. Whether it \nwas the interstate system, whether it was the Federal, State, local \npartnerships on water and sewer systems, whether it was the building of \ncommunity colleges and the beginnings of technology and wiring for our \ntelecommunications systems in the 1950s and 1960s, we were the envy of \nthe world.\n  Today, because so many in this government think we need to cut \nspending at all costs on everything, we simply have not kept up with \nthe infrastructure. That is why countries such as China that are \ninvesting so much money in infrastructure--we run the\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nrisk of them passing us by in manufacturing and all the things we care \nabout that build a solid middle class.\n  This legislation is an economic development imperative. This \nlegislation is an imperative for citizens of our country--having clean \ndrinking water, safe drinking water, predictable access to water at a \nreasonable cost. It is important for our families. It is important for \nour communities. It is important for business development. It is \nimportant for a strong middle-class manufacturing country, which we \nstill are.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation I am \nintroducing today.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nlet us proceed on the reauthorization of the surface transportation \nact, S. 1813. This is a critically important bill, and I am proud to be \non two committees that have had jurisdiction over this bill. One is the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, where Senator Boxer and Senator \nInhofe have worked together to bring out a bill that received the \nunanimous support of our committee. I also serve on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, where Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch have worked together \nso we have the sufficient revenues in order to be able to finance the \nreauthorization bill during its 2-year reauthorization.\n  This bill is so important to our country. First, it gives \npredictability to our State and local governments. It gives \npredictability to the highway engineers. It gives predictability to \ncontractors to know the funding will be there in order to advance our \ntransportation programs. When we do these short-term extensions, it \nreally does cause significant problems for planners. If you are trying \nto plan a transportation project, you need to know the funding is going \nto be there for more than just a few months. You need to have some \ndegree of predictability. This legislation will allow us to give that \npredictability to those who are involved in the decisionmaking. It has \nbeen 2009 since we last reauthorized the surface transportation act. It \nis time for us to act.\n  This bill will also help us as far as American competitiveness is \nconcerned. We need to have modern transportation infrastructure, \nwhether it is our highways, our bridges, or our transit systems. We \nneed to make sure we can meet the challenges to today's society.\n  I could talk about just in this region our needs in the transit area. \nWe have one of the most congested communities in the Nation in \nWashington, DC. Many of my constituents who live in Maryland go to work \nevery day in Washington, DC, working for the Federal Government, using \nthe mass transit system. That system is aged and needs attention. We \nneed to provide the financing nexus in this area in order to be as \ncompetitive as we can with transportation options for the people of \nthis country.\n  This bill is important for jobs. You hear that over and over. In \nMaryland, the passage of this bill will preserve or expand 10,000 jobs \nfor its people. I expect the Acting President pro tempore would have \nsimilar numbers in New Mexico. It is important in every State in this \nNation.\n  It is also important for safety. I will give you one number in \nMaryland that really has me concerned. There are 359 bridges in the \nState of Maryland that have been rated structurally deficient and 4.6 \nmillion motorists travel over those bridges every day. The State of \nMaryland is taking steps to make sure the motorists are safe, but we \nneed to fix those bridges in a more permanent way. The longer we wait, \nthe more it costs. Deferred maintenance means we are not doing what we \nshould to protect the future needs of our communities. This legislation \nputs a heavy priority on maintaining our transportation infrastructure \nso it is safe and we can move forward into the future.\n  The legislation is balanced between transit and highway. I know that \nin certain regions of this country, highways are the principal means of \ntransportation, and their interest in transit is not quite as great as \nit is if you represent the people of New York or you represent the \npeople of Maryland or you represent the people in an urban center where \npublic transit becomes a very important part of our transportation \nneeds. This legislation is balanced to take care of the needs of our \nhighways and the needs of our transit systems. I think it is a credit \nto that balance that in the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nin the Banking Committee--the two committees that have principal \njurisdiction over the highway program and over the transit program--we \nhad unanimous support on bringing this bill forward. That is how we \nshould be proceeding to consider legislation. We have that type of \nbipartisan cooperation because this bill is properly balanced.\n  Let me also point out that we have received hundreds of letters from \norganizations that support the passage of the surface transportation \nreauthorization act. We have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, we have the \nAFL-CIO, we have businesses, we have labor groups, we have local \ncommunities, we have national groups.\n  This bill has been put together in a way where we can get it done \nthis year, and it would be very important for the people of this \ncountry and for our economy.\n  Let me talk a little bit about my State of Maryland and the Maryland \ndepartment of transportation. They have given us a list of projects \nthat will move forward if we can get this bill reauthorized, from the \nbeltway around Baltimore, to critical roads in Montgomery and Prince \nGeorge's Counties, to our rural areas. I could share some of those \nspecific examples. But this will affect the ability of Maryland to move \nforward with critical roads and transit needs, and we need to get that \ndone.\n  I want to talk a little bit about some of the specific issues that \nare in the bill that I want to highlight.\n\n  The Appalachian Development Highway System is one for which we have \nput a separate provision historically in the code because we recognize \nthat in bringing economic opportunity to that part of our Nation, which \nincludes West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania--and it also \nincludes some of our Southern States that are in the Appalachia highway \nregion--it is tough to get jobs there. I was just recently in the most \nwestern part of Maryland up in Garrett County, and I can tell you it is \ndifficult to get companies to move into that region. One of the \nproblems is that you have to go over the mountains. It is not easy to \nget over the mountains.\n  We have a real opportunity around Cumberland, MD, to be able to \nexpand dramatically the economic opportunities and jobs by completing \nthe north-south highway that goes through Pennsylvania, Maryland, and \nWest Virginia. Now there is reason to celebrate that in this bill that \ncan become a reality. There is an amendment I had offered that is \nincluded in this legislation that provides the toll credits so we can \nadvance this project. It was a major issue needed, particularly in the \nPennsylvania part of this north-south highway.\n  So we do have reason to celebrate that in this legislation we have a \nway of completing the Appalachian Development Highway System in my part \nof the country.\n  Senator Rockefeller has been working very closely on this issue, and \nI really applaud his leadership. We are going to be looking to see \nwhether we might be able to strengthen it more, through amendments to \nthis bill, to make sure these projects get the priority to which they \nare entitled.\n  For the sake of flexibility, we have combined many of the specific \nprograms into more general programs. That is part of the balance in \nthis legislation--to give greater flexibility to local governments. \nThat is important. But we also want to make sure the national \npriorities receive the attention they need, and the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System is a national priority. We want to make sure \nthat is, in fact, done.\n  I wear another hat as chair of the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and I want to do everything \nwe can to make sure the Federal\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nGovernment, as a partner in developing highways and roads and transit \nsystems, does what is important for clean water in our communities. A \nlarge part of the pollutants that enter into our waters comes from \nstorm runoff. In the Chesapeake Bay region, the largest growth source \nof pollutants going into the Chesapeake Bay comes from storm runoff. \nWell, highway construction can help or hurt storm runoff. If you do it \nthe right way, you actually can help keep pollutants out of our streams \nand rivers and bays. So I am hopeful that during the discussion of this \nbill on the floor of the Senate, we will look for ways we can make this \nbill helpful in the best practices being used in order to deal with \nstorm runoff, as we deal with major transportation programs in this \ncountry.\n  One of the programs I have spent a lot of time on is the \nTransportation Enhancement Program, the TE Program. That has been used \nby local governments to do what is critically important to our \ncommunities. I could talk about bicycle paths. I could talk about paths \nthat have connected communities, which has allowed us to take cars off \nthe roads. This is a small amount of money, but it becomes very \nimportant for getting motorists off the roads. We have the use of the \nTransportation Enhancement Program so it is safe for motorists who want \nto pull off to the side of the road to see the vistas. We have used \nfunds for that. That is a safety issue.\n  So transportation enhancements are important programs. We want to \nmake sure the flexibility and funding opportunities remain. Chairman \nBoxer has been very careful to work out an arrangement so we can \nadvance that, and I thank her for it. I have been working with Senator \nCochran, and we are hoping to offer an amendment that will make it \nclear we need to work with the local governments as we look at how the \ntransportation enhancement funds are being used.\n  Let me tell you about another opportunity I think we could have in \nthe consideration of this bill, and that deals with our veterans.\n  There is a way we could use the training veterans receive while in \nmilitary service to help when they come back here as far as \ntruckdrivers are concerned. We are looking for an amendment in regard \nto that area where we could advance that issue.\n  There are many areas in this bill that we think are extremely \nimportant to advance our needs. It is a bipartisan bill. We have to get \nthis done.\n  I know Senator Boxer is on the floor. Once again, I compliment her \nfor her patience and leadership in working through each of these \nissues.\n  We are looking forward to a robust debate on the floor of the Senate. \nI hope Members who have amendments will allow us to proceed. Let's take \na look at amendments, but let's proceed in the spirit in which the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the Banking Committee, and the \nFinance Committee reported the bills to the Senate; that is, listen to \neach other, do not lose sight of the prize of getting this bill done, \nand be willing to compromise so that we can maintain the type of \nbipartisan cooperation we need in order to get this bill enacted. If we \ndo that, we will be doing something so important to our country.\n  This bill will create jobs. This bill will help our economic \nrecovery. This bill will help our future. I am proud to be part of the \ngroup that has brought this bill forward to the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak in favor of \nmoving ahead for progress in the 21st century, something that most \nAmericans--almost all Americans--have to be in favor of, and if a lot \nof them knew about this legislation, I think they would be in favor of \nit too.\n  It has been 862 days since SAFETEA-LU expired--862 days. That \nlegislation was written in 2003, passed this body and signed into law \nin 2005. We have extended that legislation, SAFETEA-LU, eight times \nsince it expired in 2009, brought it back from the dead eight times.\n  John Chambers, who is the CEO of a big technology company called \nCISCO, likes to say that the key to global economic competitiveness is \nhaving the best workforce and the best infrastructure in the world. He \nhas said that is where the jobs will go in the 21st century--best \nworkforce, best infrastructure, you will get the jobs. We must continue \nto modernize--in the spirit of those words--modernize and maintain our \ninfrastructure if it is to remain the best.\n  I wish to start today by congratulating Senators Boxer and Inhofe for \npulling together--and their staffs and subcommittee staffs as well--I \nwish to start by congratulating them for pulling together a bipartisan \nTransportation bill that begins to address America's infrastructure \nneeds. This comes on the heels of our passing earlier this week a \nconference report, a compromise on the FAA reauthorization to bring the \nair traffic control system of our country into the 21st century and to \nalso begin rebuilding and improving our airports as well. This is a \npretty good one-two punch in the period of 1 week.\n  This legislation before us today makes key reforms to our Federal \ntransportation policy that will help make the best use of our \ntaxpayers' dollars. The legislation sets clear national goals for \ntransportation investment. We do not just throw money at these \nproblems; we actually strive to achieve a number of specific goals. And \nthis bill asks State transportation departments to do their part to \nachieve those national goals. It accomplishes this by implementing new \nperformance measures that will help to hold States accountable for the \noutcomes of the investments we are prepared to make. This will ensure \nthat we are building the most effective multimodal transportation \nnetwork we can by putting our dollars to the most productive use.\n  Passing this legislation is critically important to America's \neconomic health at home and our competitiveness abroad. We have heard \nthat here today, and we will hear it for the next several days. This \nlegislation, if adopted and signed into law, will create or save \nseveral millions of jobs, in a day when we need every job we can save \nor create, in States such as New Mexico, States such as Delaware, and \n48 other States as well.\n  In my State of Delaware, for example, we are planning significant new \ntransportation investments. We already have a bunch of them underway, \nbut new ones will contribute to our State's productivity. Some of those \nwill help to relieve the congestion along important corridors such as \nI-95. We have already done some good work in putting in highway-speed \nE-ZPass on I-95 through the toll plaza to expedite and move the flow of \ntraffic. We are now working on a big intersection where I-95 intersects \nwith State Route 1, a major north-south highway. That has been a big \nbottleneck for years. We have some good work going on with that. We \nwant to be able to finish that. Other improvements will allow shippers \nto move freight more quickly and reliably down roads such as Route 301, \nwhich comes up through Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula into \nDelaware on its way to I-95.\n  Each of my colleagues could no doubt talk about similar efforts in \ntheir State. Each of these projects is part of our national \ntransportation system. Taken together, the system is greater than the \nsum of its parts. Having a world-class transportation system has helped \nto make America what it is today. This bill will ensure that we have a \ntransportation system that allows America to return to prosperity and \nto grow that prosperity.\n  I am looking forward to debating this bill on the Senate floor. I \nappreciate the time to get started on that here today. As a Senator and \nas a recovering Governor, I know that everything I can do I can do \nbetter, and as good as this legislation is I think there is always room \nfor improvement.\n  I have never introduced a perfect bill. My friend who is presiding \nover the Senate may have, but I am not sure. As good as this \nlegislation is, there is room for improvement.\n  I plan to bring forward a couple amendments that I think will improve\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nthe bill. We talked about a few in the markup in the full committee. \nFor example, I believe we need to do more on the issue of traffic \ncongestion. I go back and forth on the train about every day and night, \nand in the morning I see traffic lined up for miles, trying to get from \nnorth to south and parallel to the Northeast corridor of Amtrak, as we \nzip along. This city is recognized as maybe the most congested city in \nAmerica.\n  In 2010 I am told that drivers in the United States in the more urban \nand suburban areas wasted some 1.9 billion gallons of fuel due to \ntraffic congestion. That is almost 2 billion gallons of fuel. \nCongestion is a major challenge in larger U.S. cities and increasingly \neven in smaller cities and towns too.\n  The burden and the cost of traffic congestion is felt by both \ntravelers and freight shippers, diminishing our quality of life and \ncosting us money. According to the Texas Transportation Institute--they \ncome up with this study that is announced every year--the average \ncommuter across the country spent 34 hours sitting in traffic--not \nmoving at 40, 30, 20, or 10 miles an hour but sitting in traffic. That \nis up from 14 hours in 1982. This burden lowers productivity and \nresults in wasted fuel and cost Americans more than $100 billion in \n2010, or nearly $750 wasted for every commuter. Traffic congestion is \nalso increasingly hurting the reliability of the transportation system, \nwhich is particularly important to freight shippers, where the value \neach minute can be as much as $5. It is about $300 an hour. As \nAmerica's economy continues to recover, we must make sure that traffic \nis not a drag on job growth. According to that same Texas \nTransportation Institute, by 2015--3 years from now--the cost of \ngridlock will rise from $101 billion to something like $133 billion.\n  That is the bad news. There is good news too. Fortunately, we have \nnew tools to address congestion. For example, better management of \naccidents, improved timing of traffic signals, real-time traveler \ninformation, and managed toll lanes--and I will talk more about that \nnext week--all provide low-cost congestion benefits. These are just a \nfew of the strategies that have been helping passengers and freight \nshippers to better anticipate, avoid, and manage the impact of \ncongestion. They are smart and are being successfully used on a smaller \nscale. They are ideas we want to replicate in cities and counties and \nStates across the country. I will offer an amendment that would, in the \nStates with the worst congestion, target funding for these cost-\neffective congestion-relief strategies. My amendment will help to give \nAmericans some of their time and money back. It will help shippers grow \ntheir businesses too. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Second, I believe that anything worth having is worth paying for. If \nwe will not raise user fees at the Federal level, we should at least \nstop prohibiting States from doing so if that makes sense. I will offer \nan amendment to give States more flexibility to use tolls and user fees \non their roadways. An increasing number of States are looking at tolls \nand user fees as a source of funding, and the Federal Government should \nnot stand in their way.\n  We have used tolls as a source of revenue in Delaware for years, and \nit has helped us to maintain and improve the critical I-95 corridor and \nto provide a north-south corridor that stretches from the northern part \nof the State past Dover, past Dover Air Force Base and the central part \nof Dover.\n  Toll revenue is also often a critical part of forming public-private \npartnerships, which I know many of my colleagues support. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  In closing, Congress needs to act on transportation legislation. The \nrest of the country is counting on us. The infrastructure of our \ncountry gets graded on an annual basis by, among others, the engineers \nof our Nation. They look at transportation more broadly than just \nhighways and bridges. And it is not just railroads, bridges, and ports, \nthey look at all of it. Last year, the grade they gave us was a D. That \nis not as in ``delightful,'' and that is not as in ``distinguished''--\nthat is maybe more in the area of ``derelict.'' We can do a whole lot \nbetter.\n  We have taken action this week with respect to our air traffic \ncontrol systems. We have taken a step toward beginning to rebuild and \nimprove our airports. The legislation will let us, in the next 24 \nmonths, make our roads, highways, and bridges safer, less congested, \nand something we can treasure as a real asset.\n  Lastly--and I have said this before and it bears repeating--the major \njob of government--not the only but a major job of government--is to \nprovide a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. \nIt is not the only job of government, but it is a big job of \ngovernment. A big part of creating that environment for job creation \nand preservation is a road, highway, and bridge infrastructure that we \ncan all be proud of in the 21st century. This legislation will help us \ngo in that direction. It is important to follow on the heels of this \nlegislation and not just waste 2 years but build on it to do smarter \nthings in the years to come.\n  That having been said, while the chairman is here, I thank her for \nher leadership. People say: Why can't Congress get anything done? I \nthink the way Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe have worked together on \nthis legislation, with the staffs, is a great model for the rest of us. \nWe thank them for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware because \nhe and the occupant of the chair are very important members of this \ngreat committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee. As one or \nour most senior Members, he has taken a tremendous interest in \neverything we do. I look to his leadership on a number of issues, \nincluding controlling mercury, which is dear to his heart and mine. He \nis a leader on nuclear plant safety and has been extremely helpful. I \nthank him for the good role he plays on that committee.\n  We will have a number of amendments. It is going to be delicate with \nthe amendment process. That is fine. I encourage everybody, if they \nhave an amendment, to go for it. But we have an agreement that the \nleadership on the committee--we are either all going to go for an \namendment or not. We don't want to stymie this.\n  I appreciate the Senator alerting us that he is going to offer those \ntwo amendments. I urge the Senator to get them to us so we can share \nthem with Senator Inhofe.\n  We have received another letter of support, which I am proud to put \nin the Record. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 9, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: The twenty nine national associations and \n     construction trade unions that comprise the Transportation \n     Construction Coalition (TCC) strongly urge all members of the \n     Senate to vote for the motion to proceed on S. 1813, the \n     ``MAP-21'' surface transportation reauthorization proposal. \n     This legislation would provide critical investments and \n     policy reforms needed to improve the nation's highway and \n     bridge network.\n       The federal highway and public transportation programs have \n     been operating under a series of temporary extensions for \n     more than two years. MAP-21 would end that dysfunctional \n     cycle and restore stability to the federal surface \n     transportation programs. In a very challenging budgetary \n     environment, the legislation would authorize current \n     (inflation-adjusted) levels of highway and public \n     transportation investment. Furthermore, the Senate Finance \n     Committee has developed a bipartisan plan to assure these \n     investments do not add to the federal deficit.\n       The TCC has long supported reforming the federal highway \n     and public transportation programs to focus on national goals \n     and deliver transportation benefits faster and at lower cost. \n     Specifically, we support steps to accelerate the \n     transportation project environmental review and approval \n     process through the use of deadlines, flexibility for state \n     departments of transportation, expedited reviews for projects \n     with no significant impact, and greater authority for the \n     U.S. Department of Transportation with other federal \n     agencies. The TCC also supports efforts to increase the \n     involvement of the private sector resources to help meet the \n     nation's transportation challenges.\n       We commend all senators involved in developing a \n     comprehensive, bipartisan reauthorization proposal that would \n     continue the strong tradition of federal leadership in the \n     area of transportation policy. We urge all members of the \n     Senate to vote to move the\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\n     surface transportation reauthorization process forward by \n     supporting the motion to proceed on S. 1813.\n           Sincerely,\n                            Transportation Construction Coalition.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is from the Transportation Construction Coalition. \nThey are urging all of us for an ``aye'' vote on the motion to proceed \nto the Transportation bill. They have said wonderful things about our \nbill--that they like the steps we have taken to accelerate all the \nreviews and flexibility for the States, greater authority for our \nStates, and the fact that we did this in a comprehensive way and in a \nbipartisan way. I am very grateful.\n  What I would like to do is read the names of these organizations \nbecause it shows you the depth in America of the support for this bill: \nThe American Road and Transportation Builders; Associated General \nContractors; the American Coal Ash Association; the American Concrete \nPavement Association; the American Concrete Pipe Association; the \nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies; the American Subcontractors \nAssociation; American Iron and Steel Institute; American Society of \nCivil Engineers; American Traffic Safety Services Association; the \nAsphalt Emulsion Manufacturers Association; Asphalt Recycling and \nReclaiming Association; Associated Equipment Distributors; Association \nof Equipment Manufacturers; Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute; \nInternational Slurry Surfacing Association; International Association \nof Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers; \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers; Laborers-Employers \nCooperation and Education Trust; Laborers' International Union of North \nAmerica; National Asphalt Pavement Association; National Association of \nSurety Bond Producers; National Ready Mixed Concrete Association; \nNational Stone, Sand & Gravel Association; National Utility Contractors \nAssociation; Portland Cement Association; Precase/Prestressed Concrete \nInstitute; the Road Information Program; and the United Brotherhood of \nCarpenters and Joiners of America.\n  The reason I read these 29 organizations--there are 1,000 \norganizations behind our bill--I want colleagues to understand how \npeople have come together from all sides of the aisle--union workers, \nnonunion workers, the businesses and union businesses. Everybody has \ncome together--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--on our \ncommittee. The reason is that we are coming out of a very tough and \ndeep recession where housing was hurt deeply, and we are having a very \ntough time coming out of the housing recession. Construction workers \nhave a 15-percent or more unemployment rate, compared to an 8.3-percent \nunemployment rate in the rest of the workforce. If you put them into \nSuper Bowl stadiums, they would fill 15 Super Bowl stadiums. Imagine \nthat.\n  We have an obligation to come together on behalf of jobs and the \naging infrastructure that needs to be fixed. We have bridges collapsing \nand roads that are not up to par. We have problems in this Nation, and \nwe can stop them and solve them only if we come together.\n  I will end here because my colleague would like the floor, and that \nis fine. I think we will have an opportunity at around the 2:15 hour or \nso to come together united and give a great vote of confidence to this \nbill, to move it ahead with an overwhelming vote. Maybe I am dreaming, \nbut I hope for well over 60 votes to go forward. Then let's get to the \namendment process and let's not offer extraneous amendments that have \nto do with everything but transportation. Let's keep this focused. Then \nwe can get to conference and get a bill to the President.\n  In closing, if our bill is the law of the land, we would save 1.8 \nmillion jobs and be able to create up to another million jobs. There is \na lot riding on this bill. I hope we will come together this afternoon.\n  Thank you for your indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S417-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S417-S420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF CATHY ANN BENCIVENGO TO BE A UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Cathy Ann \nBencivengo, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on the \nnomination, with the time already consumed counting toward the \nmajority's portion.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of magistrate judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo to the position of \ndistrict judge for the Southern District of California.\n  Judge Bencivengo will fill a judicial emergency vacancy in a judicial \ndistrict along the southwest border that has one of the highest and \nmost rapidly increasing criminal caseloads in the country.\n  The Southern District of California includes San Diego and Imperial \nCounties. It borders Mexico, and it consequently has a large \nimmigration caseload. It ranks fourth in the country in terms of \ncriminal case filings per authorized judgeship.\n  The district's former chief judge, Irma Gonzalez, wrote me a letter \nurging Judge Bencivengo's confirmation and highlighting the felony \ncaseload crisis in the district. As Chief Judge Gonzalez explained, \nsince 2008 criminal case filings in the district have increased by 42 \npercent and civil case filings by 25 percent. In the past fiscal year \nalone, criminal cases had risen 17 percent up to the time of her \nletter. It is, in fact, a judicial emergency.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is advised the previous \nallotted time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me tell everyone a little about Judge Bencivengo. \nShe is a consensus nominee who was approved by the Judiciary Committee \nby a voice vote. That does not often happen. There was no objection \nfrom any colleague on any side of the aisle.\n  She was recommended to me by a bipartisan judicial selection \ncommittee which I have established in California to advise me in \nrecommending judicial nominees to the President. This committee reviews \njudicial candidates based on their legal skill, reputation, experience, \ntemperament, and overall commitment to excellence.\n  Judge Bencivengo has been a U.S. magistrate judge in San Diego for \nthe last 6 years, and she has earned an outstanding reputation in that \njudicial role.\n  Throughout my advisory committee's process, Judge Bencivengo has \nactually set herself apart as a person who would be truly exceptional. \nShe was born in New Jersey. She began her undergraduate career at \nRutgers. She earned a bachelor's in journalism and political science \nand a master's from Rutgers as well.\n  She worked for a leading American corporation--Johnson & Johnson--in \nNew Brunswick. She then attended the University of Michigan Law School, \nwhere she excelled, graduating magna cum laude, and was inducted into \nthe Order of the Coif.\n  After law school, she joined the San Diego firm of Gray Cary, which \nlater became part of a major international law firm. She became a \nfounding member of the firm's patent litigation group. Her knowledge of \npatent law, which she honed in law school and in private practice, made \nher a valued resource for her colleagues and clients, so she quickly \nrose through the ranks at her firm. She was selected as the national \ncochair of her firm's patent litigation group, a role in which she \nmanaged 70 patent attorneys.\n  In 2005, she became a magistrate judge, a role in which she has \nserved as a serious and thoughtful jurist. Since her appointment, she \nhas published 180 opinions, over 190 reports and recommendations, over \n1,800 orders on nondispositive motions, and roughly 800 of her orders \ninvolved felony criminal cases.\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\n  She has substantial expertise in patent law, which will be welcome in \nthe district, which is part of a new Federal judicial program designed \nto assign more patent cases to judges who are experts in the field of \npatent law. So she will be helpful.\n  Judge Bencivengo has received high praise from any number of people. \nI know of no opposition to her confirmation. I think this advice and \nconsent process will yield a very good, seasoned San Diego magistrate \njudge for the district court, and I am very proud to recommend her and \nto have had unanimous consent of the Judiciary Committee for her \nconfirmation.\n  I see Senator Lee on the floor. Perhaps I could ask unanimous consent \nthat when Senator Lee concludes, and if there is time remaining, I be \nrecognized to speak for a couple minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a period \nof up to 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that time.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this nomination. I do \nso not because of the qualifications of this particular nominee, but \ninstead I do so in defense of the U.S. Constitution.\n  In opposing President Obama's appointments, I have repeatedly made \nclear this is a constitutional issue. Each time I have spoken--and I \nhave done so on numerous occasions--I have set forth in detail the \nreasons why I believe on a legal basis, on a constitutional basis, why \nPresident Obama's recent purported recess appointments are \nunprecedented and unconstitutional. I have also made absolutely clear \nthat my opposition to President Obama's appointments is not partisan \nand that I will hold a Republican President equally accountable \nwhenever any Republican President makes a similarly unconstitutional \nclaim of power.\n  This President has enjoyed my cooperation up to this point. I voted \nfor many, if not most, of his nominees. That cooperation cannot \ncontinue--not in the same way he has enjoyed it up to this point. In \nlight of the fact he has disrespected our authority within this body, \nhe has disrespected the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, many of my colleagues have refused to engage on the \nreal substance of this issue. Instead, they have repeatedly changed the \nsubject to partisan politics, the nominations process, and Richard \nCordray's qualifications to head the CFPB. Even worse, and despite my \nrepeatedly making clear I intend to hold any Republican President to \nthe same standard to protect the institutional and constitutional \nprerogatives of the Senate rather than the interests of any political \nparty--given those are at stake--the Democrats, including the President \nhimself, have accused me of playing politics. I wish to be clear again: \nThis is not the case. I am here to defend the constitutional \nprerogatives of the Senate and the separation of powers and the system \nof checks and balances that are at the heart of our constitutional \nsystem.\n  The Senate's advice-and-consent role is grounded in the \nConstitution's system of checks and balances. In Federalist 51, James \nMadison wrote:\n\n       . . . the great security against a gradual concentration of \n     the several powers in the same [branch of government], \n     consists in giving to those who administer each [branch] the \n     necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist \n     encroachments of the others.\n\n  Among those constitutional means is the Senate's ability to withhold \nits consent for a nominee, forcing the President to work with Congress \nto address that body's concerns.\n  The key conclusion of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal \nCounsel memorandum, on which President Obama relied in making these \nrecess appointments, is that the President may unilaterally decide and \nconclude that the Senate's pro forma sessions somehow do not constitute \nsessions of the Senate for purposes relevant to the recess appointments \nclause, in clause 3 of article II, section 2. If allowed to stand, this \ndeeply flawed assertion would upend an important element of the \nConstitution's separation of powers. Under the procedures set forth by \nthe Constitution, it is for the Senate, not for the President, to \ndetermine when the Senate is in session. Indeed, the Constitution \nexpressly grants the Senate that prerogative, the power to ``determine \nthe Rules of its Proceedings.''\n\n  Commenting on this very provision in his authoritative constitutional \ntreatise, Joseph Story noted:\n\n       [t]he humblest assembly of men is understood to possess \n     [the power to make its own rules,] and it would be absurd to \n     deprive the councils of the nation of a like authority.\n\n  Yet this is precisely the result of President Obama's attempt to tell \nthe Senate when it is or is not in recess.\n  I am saddened some of my colleagues in the Senate are not more \njealous of this body's rightful constitutional, institutional \nprerogatives. As they well know, the Constitution's protections do not \nbelong to any one party, and its structural separation of powers is \nmeant to protect against the abuses of present and future Presidents of \nboth parties. Acquiescing to the President in the moment may result in \ntemporary political gain for the President's party, but relinquishing \nthis important piece of the Senate's constitutional role has lasting \nconsequences for Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  It is on this basis, and because of the oath I have taken to uphold \nthe Constitution of the United States, that I find myself dutybound to \noppose this nomination. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to take seriously their obligation both to the Constitution \nand to the institutional prerogatives of the Senate and to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to \nSenator Lee's comments.\n  I understand the reasons for which he is opposing this nominee. I \nwould again point out that, in my opinion, based on what I heard the \ndistinguished Senator say, it has nothing to do with the nominee. It \nhas to do with a peripheral issue. I would hope a majority of the \nSenate would understand this is a totally noncontroversial, totally \ncapable, totally qualified, and totally good nominee. To hold her \nconfirmation hostage is something that doesn't redound well on this \nbody.\n  This is a judicial emergency in the Southern District of California, \nand we need to get this judge approved. So while I appreciate the \nSenator's comments--I think most of us are well aware of the feelings \non the other side--I think somehow, some way, we have to come together \nand prevent what is happening. And what is happening is, if I don't get \nmy way on something, I am going to hold up appointments, I am going to \nhold up confirmations, and I am going to do whatever I can to show I \nhave power to disrupt this body.\n  In essence, the body can be disrupted. We know that. There are very \nstrong minority rights in the Senate rules of order. But at the same \ntime, we have an obligation to see that qualified people who want to \nserve in this government--in this case in the judicial arm, in the \nFederal Court system--have an opportunity to do so, and where there is \nreal danger in terms of overly high caseloads, we can respond and get \nqualified nominees in place.\n  I appreciate what the Senator had to say. I understand it. But I \nappeal to this body: Please vote to approve Cathy Bencivengo to the \nSouthern District of California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will finally vote on the \nnomination of Judge Cathy Bencivengo to fill a vacancy on the the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California, where she has \nserved as a Magistrate Judge since 2005. An experienced judge and \nlawyer, with 17 years in private practice before becoming a Magistrate \nJudge, Judge Bencivengo received the highest possible rating from the \nABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, unanimously ``well \nqualified.'' Her nomination, which has the strong support of her home \nstate Senators, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, was reported unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee on October 6. Yet, despite the support of \nevery Member of the Judiciary Committee, Democratic and Republican, and \ndespite vacancies across the country in nearly one out of every 10 \nFederal judgeships, it has taken over 4\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nmonths for Senate Republicans to consent to a vote on Judge \nBencivengo's nomination.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for securing today's vote. There is no \nreason or explanation why the Senate Republican leadership will not \nconsent to vote on the other 18 judicial nominations waiting for final \nSenate action. All but three of them were reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee without opposition, just like Judge Bencivengo's nomination.\n  Earlier this week I urged Senate Republicans to join with Democrats \nand take long overdue steps to remedy the serious vacancies crisis on \nFederal courts throughout the country. Consenting to vote on a single \njudicial nomination, only the third such vote we have had this year, is \nnot much in the way of progress.\n  There is no reason or explanation for why Senate Republicans continue \nto block a vote on the nomination of Jesse Furman to fill a vacancy on \nthe Southern District of New York. His nomination was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee on September 15, nearly 5 months ago, without \nopposition from a single member of the Committee and a month before the \nnomination being considered today. Mr. Furman, an experienced Federal \nprosecutor who served as Counselor to Attorney General Michael Mukasey \nfor 2 years during the Bush administration, is a nominee with an \nimpressive background and bipartisan support. We should have voted on \nhis nomination many months ago, and certainly before the end of the \nlast session. Senate Republicans have now skipped over that nomination \nand stalled it for almost 5 months.\n  Senate Republicans continue to block even judicial nominations with \nhome State support from Republican Senators. Republican Senator Marco \nRubio and Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida both introduced \nJudge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Judiciary Committee when we \nheld his confirmation hearing last September for his nomination to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit, and both strongly \nsupport his nomination.\n  Judge Jordan is an experienced jurist who has served as a judge for \nthe Southern District of Florida since 1999. If confirmed, Judge Jordan \nwill be the first Cuban-born judge to serve on the Eleventh Circuit, \nwhich covers Florida, Georgia and Alabama. Born in Havana, Cuba, Judge \nJordan immigrated to the United States at age 6, going on to graduate \nsumma cum laude from the University of Miami law school. After law \nschool, he clerked for Judge Thomas A. Clark on the Eleventh Circuit, \nthe court to which he is now nominationed, and for Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, a President Reagan appointee to the United States Supreme \nCourt. Judge Jordan has been a prosecutor in the Southern District of \nFlorida, serving as Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Appellate \nDivision. Judge Jordan has been a professor, since 1990 teaching at his \nalma mater, the University of Miami School of Law, as well as the \nFlorida International University College of Law. It is no suprrise that \nthe ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nJudge Jordan ``well qualified'' to serve on the Eleventh Circuit, the \nhighest possible rating from its non-partisan peer review. It is also \nno surprise that his nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee nearly 4 months ago. The surprise is that Senate \nRepublicans continue to stall action on this nomination for no good \nreason.\n  Judge Jordan is the kind of consensus judicial nominee that should be \nwelcomed as one of the many examples of President Obama reaching out to \nwork with Republican and Democratic home State senators and the kind of \nsuperbly qualified nominee we should all encourage to serve on the \ndistinguished bench of Federal appeals court judges. In the past the \nSenate would have voted on his nomination within days or weeks of its \nbeing reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. Yet Republicans \nrefused to consent to a vote on Judge Jordan's nomination before the \nend of the last session and it has been stalled on the Senate Calenadar \nfor nearly 4 months. When we finally do vote on Judge Jordan's \nnomination I am certain he will be confirmed with broad bipartisan \nsupport, perhaps unanimously. There is no good reason the Senate is not \nvoting to confirm Judge Jordan today.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended when they filibustered the nomination last December of \nCaitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not continue to block \nus from voting on Judge Jordan's nomination to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit, one of the busier circuits \nin the country. They would not continue to block a vote on the \nnomination of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, reported last December to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, the busiest Federal \nappeals court in the country. They would consent to vote on the \nnomination of Paul Watford, a well-qualified nominee to fill another \njudicial emeregency on the Ninth Circuit. They would stop blocking us \nfrom voting on the nominations of David Nuffer to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the District of Utah, Michael Fitzgerald to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Central District of California, \nMiranda Du to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the District of \nNevada, Gregg Costa to fill a judicial emeregency vacancy on the \nSouthern District of Texas, and David Guaderrama to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Western District of Texas.\n  Of the 19 judicial nominations now awaiting a final vote by the \nSenate, 16 were reported by the Judiciary Committee with the support of \nevery Senator on the Committee, Democratic and Republican. Month after \nmonth and year after year, Senate Republicans find excuses to delay \nconfirmation of consensus judicial nominees for no good reason. These \ndelays are a disservice to the American people. They prevent the Senate \nfrom fulfilling its constitutional duty. And they are damaging to the \nability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around \nthe country.\n  The cost of this across-the-board Republican obstruction is borne by \nthe American people. More than half of all Americans, nearly 160 \nmillion, live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy \nthat could be filled today if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on \nthe nominations that have been reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is wrong to delay votes on these qualified, consensus \njudicial nominees. The Senate should fill these numerous, extended \njudicial vacancies, not delay final action for no good reason.\n  By nearly any measure we are well behind where we should be. Three \nyears into President Obama's first term, the Senate has confirmed a \nlower percentage of President Obama's judicial nominees than those of \nany President in the last 35 years. The Senate has confirmed just over \n70 percent of President Obama's circuit and district nominees, with \nmore than one in four not confirmed. This is in stark contrast to the \nnearly 87 percent of President George W. Bush's nominees who were \nconfirmed, nearly nine out of every 10 nominees he sent to the Senate.\n  We remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President \nBush's first term. By this date in President Bush's first term, the \nSenate had confirmed 170 Federal circuit and district court nominations \non the way to 205, and had lowered judicial vacancies to 46. By the \ntime Americans went to the polls in November 2004, we had reduced \nvacancies to 28 nationwide, the lowest level in the last 20 years. In \ncontrast, the Senate has confirmed only 125 of President Obama's \ndistrict and circuit nominees, and judicial vacancies remain over 85. \nThe vacancy rate is double what it was at this point in the Bush \nadministration.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to abandon their obstructionist \ntactics and do as Senate Democrats did when we worked to confirm 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in 17 months. I urge them to work to \nreduce judicial vacancies as we did by considering and confirming \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations late into the Presidential \nelection years of 2004 and 2008, reducing the vacancy rates in those \nyears to their lowest levels in decades. That is the only way we have a \nchance to make up some of the ground we have lost and to address the \nserious and extended crisis in judicial vacancies.\n  I congratulate Judge Bencivengo on her confirmation today and hope \nthat\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nwe can soon take up the rest of the 18 judicial nominations still \nawaiting a Senate vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nnomination of Cathy Ann Bencivengo to be U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of California. I support this nomination which will \nfill the vacancy that has been created by Judge Jeffrey Miller taking \nsenior status. I would also note that this vacancy has been designated \nas a judicial emergency.\n  After today, the Senate will have confirmed 126 nominees to our \narticle III courts. I would note that even as we continue to reduce \njudicial vacancies, the majority of vacancies have no nominee. In fact, \n46 of 86 vacancies have no nomination. Furthermore, 18 of the 33 seats \ndesignated judicial emergencies have no nominee. So when I hear \ncomments about ``unprecedented'' vacancy rates, I would ask my \ncolleagues and the other interested parties to look first to the White \nHouse. The fact is, the Senate is doing its job in providing advice and \nconsent to the President's judicial nominees.\n  Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo presently serves as a U.S. magistrate \njudge for the Southern District of California. She was appointed to \nthat court in 2005.\n  She received a bachelor of arts from the Rutgers University in 1980, \na masters from Rutgers in 1981, and her juris doctorate from University \nof Michigan Law School in 1988.\n  Upon graduating law school, Judge Bencivengo became an associate at \nthe law firm DLA Piper. There, she worked as a civil litigator, \nprimarily handling intellectual property cases. In 1996, she became a \npartner at DLA Piper. She also was the national cochair of patent \nlitigation for DLA Piper from 1993 to 2005.\n  In 1994, Judge Bencivengo was appointed as a judge pro tem for the \nSan Diego Small Claims Court. She served there until 2006, volunteering \napproximately six times a year and hearing judgments on about 100 \ncases.\n  Since becoming a magistrate judge in 2005, Judge Bencivengo has \npresided over two cases that have gone to final verdict.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Bencivengo with a unanimous ``well-\nqualified'' rating.\n  Mrs. BOXER: Mr. President, I am proud to vote for the confirmation of \nMagistrate Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of California. Judge Bencivengo was recommended \nto the President by my colleague, Senator Feinstein, and will be a \ngreat addition to the Federal bench.\n  Judge Bencivengo will bring to the bench her broad experience as a \nskilled lawyer and a Federal magistrate. A graduate of Rutgers \nUniversity and the University of Michigan Law School, Judge Bencivengo \nserved as a partner and the National Co-Chair of Patent Litigation \nGroup for the international law firm of DLA Piper. In 2005, she \nreceived an appointment to become a Magistrate Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of California, where she has authored more than 170 opinions.\n  I congratulate Judge Bencivengo and her family on this important day, \nand urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in voting to confirm this \nhighly qualified nominee to the Federal bench.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Cathy Ann Bencivengo, of California, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 85, the nays are \n11. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues. This is a \ntremendous vote here to move forward with one of the most important \njobs bills we could do in this session, because we are talking about \nprotecting 1.8 million jobs and the possibility of another 1 million \njobs being created through an expanded TIFIA Program which leverages \nlocal funds at very little risk to the Federal Government. So this is a \ngood vote.\n  I wish to take this opportunity now to thank colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, but also to thank the over 1,000 groups out there--\neveryone ranging from left to right and everything in between; from \nworkers organizations, to businesses, to the Chamber of Commerce, to \nthe AFL-CIO. It is rare we can walk down the aisle together.\n  But now the true test comes. We have a lot of work to do to complete \nthis legislation, to make it real, to give that certainty out there, \nget those jobs going. We have a lot of work to do. We have the Banking \nCommittee which, under the able leadership of Senators Johnson and \nShelby, has a title we have to add. We have to add a title from the \nFinance Committee. We want to add the title from the Commerce \nCommittee. Then we would have all four committees represented in this \nlegislation. Then we can move to get a strong vote and get it to \nconference, and, I have to say, tell the House side that we have a \ntruly bipartisan bill that deserves their consideration. But if we \nstart seeing amendments that go to issues that are unrelated to this--\nthe hot-button issues of the day, the issues where we have the \nideological divide--we are going to slow this down.\n  I guess I wish to say to my colleagues on the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side: Please do not mess up this bill and load this bill \nwith extraneous matters. Senator Inhofe and I are very happy to look at \ngermane amendments. We are ready to look at those. We have made an \nagreement that if we don't agree, we are going to oppose it. We are \nworking together. But extraneous matters don't belong on this bill \nunless they have overwhelming support and they are not controversial. I \nam very hopeful, but I have seen bills come to the floor and get loaded \ndown and at the end of the day the American people lose. We cannot \nafford to lose this bill.\n  I want my colleagues to imagine 15 Super Bowl stadiums and imagine in \nyour mind's eye what it looks like, and in all of those 15 Super Bowl \nstadiums every seat is filled, every seat is filled with a construction \nworker. That is how many construction workers are out of work--more \nthan 1 million. So we cannot fail these workers. We cannot fail these \nbusinesses. These are good jobs. The housing crisis is not yet behind \nus. We have a long way to go. Construction has slowed down. So we need \nto make sure our construction workers are back on the job. We need to \nmake sure we fix our bridges that are crumbling. We need to make sure \nwe keep goods moving. This is a 21st century economy with an \ninfrastructure that is not keeping up.\n  I want to take a moment to thank again the members of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. Senator Sanders, who is in the chair, is a \nvery important member who is focused like a laser beam on jobs. He \nfocuses on jobs, jobs, jobs. He knows, as I do, that we didn't get \neverything we wanted in this bill, not by a long shot. But we know \nthere are times you have to put that aside for the good of the people \nso we get something done; and something done here is protecting 1.8 \nmillion jobs and creating up to 1 million new jobs with our expanded \nTIFIA.\n\n  So I thank the Presiding Officer for his hard work on getting us to \nthis moment. I thank Senator Inhofe for his amazing cooperation; \nSenators Baucus and Vitter and all the members of the committee; \nSenators Johnson and Shelby of Banking; Senator Rockefeller, who worked \nso hard with Senator Hutchison, and we hope will resolve the \noutstanding issues in Commerce; Senator Baucus, who worked with Senator \nHatch, and we did get a good Finance piece.\n  We are so ready to go. We are going to wait to see whether our \ncolleagues on the other side will insist upon 30 hours going \npostcloture or whether they will yield back that time and allow us to \nget started on the amendment process.\n  So at this moment, I am going to put in a quorum call, note the \nabsence of a quorum, and hope we can quickly move to amend this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I come to the floor with a simple \nmessage about our economy. I know we are in the process of our \nTransportation bill, and the chairman of the committee may come out \nmomentarily, so I will yield when that moment happens so we keep that \nprocess going because that bill is about creating jobs and \ninfrastructure investment. But I just wanted to comment on the fact \nthat we have made incredible progress, and we continue to make \nincredible progress, when we think about where we were 3 years ago and \nwhere we are today.\n  I know some in Washington like to focus on scare tactics and talk how \nbad things are or how they could be worse if we continue on whatever \npath they think we are on. But the fact is we have to look at the \nrecent notifications produced not by a bunch of politicians but by \nother people who are looking at the economy or investing in the economy \nor participating in the economy in a pretty direct way. One statistic \nis reflected on this incredible chart. When we look at it, it speaks \nfor itself.\n  Just prior to 2009 and a little after, we had about 8 million jobs \nthat were lost. This chart shows we have now had 22 months of \nconsecutive growth, but actually we have had 23 months of consecutive \ngrowth. This number, which says we have had 3.2 million new jobs, is \nactually closer to 3.7 million new jobs in our economy since the great \nrecession started in late 2008, early 2009.\n  I know people come down and say: Oh, it could be better. I don't know \nabout you, but the way I see it, this was bad; this is better. Can we \ndo better? We always strive to do better. That is the American way. We \ntry to do better as we move on. But there is no question there is good \nnews and job losses are diminishing and now gone with job gains. These \nare private sector job gains, which is important but, more important, \nthe underlying issue of the job gains is small business.\n  If we watched the data this last month--when the unemployment rate \nwas estimated to be a little higher, but it actually came out at 8.3, \nlower than almost every economist thought--all we had to do was look \nunderneath the data point and it was very clear that small businesses \nwere hiring. They are the backbone of this economy. If they are hiring \nin December and January, in months when people expect--in January \nespecially--the economy will start slowing down, the reason they are \nhiring is because they see the future and they see increasing sales and \nthe potential.\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\n  Again, I know we hear people say: Oh, it is not as good as it could \nbe. But 8.3 is better than what everybody figured it would be. Do I \nwant it lower? Does the Presiding Officer want it lower? Of course, we \ndo. But the trend lines are clear.\n  We also had a 4-year low in U.S. jobless claims, again boosting \nspending in our economy. An article in CNN in late December noted \n``consumer confidence shoots higher again.'' Why is that important? The \nmore consumers are confident about the economy, the more they engage in \nthe economy.\n  It is interesting to note how low refinancing rates are--3.75 \npercent, 3.875 percent, unbelievably low. Yet people are still \nhesitant. But when we start looking at the data points from the last \nfew weeks--especially one that came out yesterday--more and more people \nare refinancing--a 21-percent increase last month in refinancing. Why \nis that important? Again, consumers feel confident. The rates are \nstrong for them so they can get a better rate on their home. Net \nresult: More money in their pocket for themselves to spend on their \nfamilies, on whatever they want to buy--vacations, a new remodel job \nthey want to do, the kitchen they have been holding off fixing up or \nthat fence that is tipping over a little bit. Now they will hire a \nsmall contractor to fix it. So consumer confidence is on the rise.\n  Again, we will hear it is not good enough. Yes, but it doesn't mean \nwe are done. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have done \nincredible things.\n  In an AP article on February 3, just last week or so, we saw the \nheadline ``Homebuilders See Stable Housing Market Ahead.'' Let me \nrepeat that: stable housing market. Some people will say: It is not a \ngrowing housing market. No, but before it was diving, it was sinking, \nit was disappearing. So ``stable'' is good. Because when we go from \nstable and we move to the next level, that is growth.\n  The automobile industry--GM. I know I talk about this one a lot. \nThree years ago, it was flat on its back. People said: It is not going \nto survive; let it go away. Today, GM, according to a January 19 \narticle in Forbes--not a very liberal magazine--``GM is No. 1 in the \nWorld Again in Auto Sales.'' No. 1. Why is that important? Because they \nare hiring more people, at all ranges in salaries. Their secondary \nfacilitator, the suppliers are hiring more people. People who ship \nthose cars are hiring more people; again, moving forward.\n  In the Budget Committee a couple days ago, Fed Chairman Bernanke was \nsurprised by this strong growth in manufacturing. Again, a few years \nago, people said: Oh, manufacturing, we are never going to get back to \nthe good old days. Again, we see growth. ``Industrial Suppliers Power \nUp Sales,'' says a Wall Street Journal article from January 21.\n  Here is another headline--this one from CNBC on December 8: ``US \nState Tax Revenues return to Pre-recession Levels.'' Why is this \nimportant? That shows subeconomies within States and within communities \nare growing--again, a stronger economy.\n  Back in my home State, we are making progress on the Chuckchi and \nBeaufort Seas, where we will see huge potential oil and gas \ndevelopment, with 26 billion barrels of known recoverable oil today. I \nthink it is a lot higher, but that is what we know about. It could \nprovide, once in production, 30,000 jobs and millions in payroll, not \njust throughout Alaska but throughout this country because that is U.S. \noil for U.S. consumption and utilization or export, if we are in the \nbusiness of selling it. But the point is, it is jobs for Alaskans, jobs \nfor Americans.\n  This month, Shell got a final air permit for its drillship, putting \nthem one step closer to exploration. There is no question in my mind we \nare going to make that happen. Three years ago, people were saying: We \nare never going to do anything in Federal waters. We will never develop \nour resources in Alaska because it is in Federal hands, and the laws, \nthe rules, the regulations don't allow it. I stand here to say that \nafter just 3 years, National Petroleum Reserve, Chuckchi and Beaufort, \nbillions of barrels of oil are in exploration and/or development. That \nhas happened in just 3 years.\n\n  People are right when they say in the last 30 years we have had a lot \nof sluggish opportunity in that field. But today it is moving forward. \nIn 3 years, there is new activity. That is powerful for our country \nfrom a national security perspective but also from an economic security \nperspective.\n  We know ConocoPhillips--again, I already mentioned National Petroleum \nReserve-Alaska--has now received its permit to move forward, and they \nhope to start developing in 2013.\n  In 2010, investments in Alaska's mining exploration totaled more than \n$264 million, a 47-percent increase, and one-third of the total spent \non mining exploration in the United States overall was in Alaska. There \nis a new gold rush in Alaska with continued increasing in gold prices. \nPlacer mining applications, generally submitted by small family-run \noperations, rose from 350 in 2005 to over 581 this year. Alaska even \nhas a reality show called ``Gold Rush.''\n  Exports to Alaska topped over $5 billion in 2011, and China is now \nour No. 1 top trading partner. There are liquefied natural gas \nopportunities in the Asian market that we are exploring. I can assure \nyou Alaska and Alaska companies have a strong interest in moving \nforward.\n  The good news is spreading across this country. But as I say, our \nwork is not done. We must continue to build on this progress and secure \na long-term economic stability that will protect our middle-class \nAmerican families and support our small businesses moving forward. We \nmust address the deficit. Unemployment is still too high. It is better, \nbut it is still too high, and our housing market is still a little \nweak. Europe's economic situation remains uncertain, and we continue to \ndepend on unstable sources of foreign oil.\n  All of that is why we must move forward on an agenda that will \ncontinue to strengthen our economy, protect middle-class families, and \nsupport small businesses, including extending the payroll tax cuts and \nunemployment insurance, developing a true energy plan that includes \ndomestic oil development, address tax reform to protect the middle \nclass, rebuild this country's infrastructure, and strengthen our \nhousing market.\n  We can and must improve our economy and address long-term fiscal \nchallenges at the same time. Even with hard work ahead, there is a lot \nof reason for optimism. We are moving in the right direction. We are \ncreating jobs, and we are turning this economy around.\n  I will end on this note. I spend time looking at every business \npublication and reading what is going on not just from a global \nperspective but from companies themselves, and I have been seeing \nheadlines--again, from the Wall Street Journal--such as ``Jobs Power \nMarket Rebound: Unemployment Rate Dips to 8.3% on Broad Gains,'' ``Dow \nat Highest Since May 2008.''\n  Some people say: It is hard to gauge that based on the market. But if \nyou are one of those people who put a little money aside for your \nretirement--in maybe a 401(k) or an IRA--or you have a little set-aside \nfor the kids to go to college, then you know 2009 was a sad year. You \nwere thinking you were going to have to work a lot longer just to make \nup some of that money. Today, the market is double what it was then. I \nwould challenge people to take their 2009 March-April statements, if \nthey have them--an education account for their kids or an IRA--and \ncompare that to what it is today. It is better. Can it be even better \nthan it is today? Absolutely. That is what we will continue to strive \nfor.\n  Again, I am going to continue to come to the floor and talk about \nthis great economic news. I know people want to see the worst in things \nsometimes, but I think what has made this country great is that, \ngenerally, we see the best in things. We see what the opportunities are \nand we take advantage of them. We risk a little bit--as we did with the \nauto bailout and the cash for clunkers. We took a little risk and \nwalked the road alone.\n  Today, that is almost all paid off and, guess what. There is a \nthriving industry providing jobs all across the country. So we have a \nlot to be proud of and a lot to look forward to. We just have to keep \non the path, take a little risk once in a while, push the envelope, and \nbank on the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, our country is unique in the world \nbecause it was established on the basis of an idea, an idea that we \nwere all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights--in \nother words, rights that were conferred not by a king or a President or \na Congress, but by the Creator himself. The State protects these rights \nbut it does not grant them. What the State does not grant the State \ncannot take away. That is what this week's debate on a particularly \nodious outcome from the President's health care law has been about.\n  Our Founders believed so strongly that the government should neither \nestablish a religion nor prevent its free exercise that they listed it \nas the very first item in the Bill of Rights, and Republicans are \ntrying today to reaffirm that basic right. But apparently our friends \non the other side do not want to have this amendment or debate. They \nwill not allow those of us who were sworn to uphold the U.S. \nConstitution to even offer an amendment that says we believe in our \nfirst amendment right to religious freedom.\n  Frankly, this is a day I was not inclined to think I would ever see. \nI have spent a lot of time in my life defending the first amendment but \nI never thought I would see the day when the elected representatives of \nthe people of this country would be blocked by a majority party in \nCongress to even express their support for it, regardless of the \nultimate outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished Republican colleague. The Senate just voted 85 to 11 to \ninvoke cloture on a motion to proceed to the surface transportation \nbill, a bipartisan bill the sponsors of which, Senator Boxer and \nSenator Inhofe--an unlikely pair--have joined together to move forward \non, a piece of legislation that is extremely important to this country, \na bill that will save or create 2 million jobs.\n  There are four parts of this bill within the jurisdiction of four \nSenate committees. The Environment and Public Works Committee is what \nwe are on now. I have sought to amend that with a provision that is \ncoming from the Banking Committee. We have one coming from the Finance \nCommittee--that has been approved on a bipartisan basis, and we will \nmove after we do those two to the Commerce section. We have not dealt \nwith the Finance Committee provision or the Commerce Committee.\n  I appreciate that the Republicans never lose an opportunity to mess \nup a good piece of legislation. We have had that happen now for the \nlast 3 years. We saw it in spades last year. Here is a bipartisan bill \nto create and save jobs. No one disputes the importance of this \nlegislation. Every State in the Union is desperate for these dollars. \nWe are not borrowing money to do it; it is all paid for. Whether it is \nthe State of West Virginia, the State of Missouri, or the State of \nNevada, all the departments of transportation are waiting to find out \nwhat is going to happen at the end of March. That is fast approaching. \nWe need to get this done.\n  Then I hope we can deal with other matters and not get bogged down on \nthis legislation. Let's do the Banking part of this bill. Let's do the \nFinance part of this bill. Let's do the Commerce part of this bill.\n  But to show how the Republicans never lose an opportunity to mess up \na good piece of legislation, listen to this: They are talking about \nfirst amendment rights, the Constitution. I appreciate that. But that \nis so senseless. This debate that is going on dealing with this issue, \ndealing with contraception, is a rule that has not been made final yet. \nThere is no final rule. Let's wait until there is at least a rule we \ncan talk about. There is not a final rule. That is all you read about \nin the newspapers, why there are discussions going on as we speak. \nThere is not a rule. Everybody should calm down. Let's see what \ntranspires.\n  Until there is a final rule on this, let's deal with the issue before \nus. That is saving jobs for our country. People can come and talk about \nthe Constitution, the first amendment--I have never seen anything like \nthis before, but I have never seen anything like this before, either. \nThere is no final rule. Why don't we calm down and see what the final \nrule is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am, of course disappointed not being able \nto offer this amendment today, but it is an amendment we talked about \nfor some time. It was a bipartisan amendment. It was a bipartisan piece \nof legislation. Senator Nelson from Nebraska and I wish to offer it and \nwish to offer it as soon as possible.\n  I have the highest regard for both of our leaders, both the majority \nleader and minority leader, and understand they have a job to do, but \nthis highway bill is clearly going to take some time. This is a 4-page \namendment that I would be glad to see voted on on Monday. It has been \nwidely studied all week, this week. I would have been glad to see it \nvoted on when I filed the bill in August. There was not a rule then \neither, but both Mr. Nelson and I, Senator Rubio, Senator Ayotte, and \nothers were anticipating that we were going to begin to see exactly the \nkinds of things this discussion this week has brought about.\n  This is about the first amendment. It is about religious beliefs. It \nis not about any one issue. In fact, this amendment specifically does \nnot mention a specific issue. It refers to the issue of conscience. In \nthe amendment itself the reference is made to the letter that in 1809 \nThomas Jefferson sent to the New London Methodist, where he says: of \nall the principles in the Constitution, the one that we perhaps hold \nmost dear, if I could paraphrase it a little bit, is the right of \nconscience and that no government should be able to come in and impose \nitself between the people and their faith-based principles.\n  In health care we have never had this before. Why didn't we need this \namendment or why didn't we need the bill that was filed in August 5 \nyears ago or 1 year ago or 2 years ago or 3 years ago? Because only \nwith the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act did we have the \ngovernment in a position, for the first time ever, to begin to give \nspecific mandates to health care providers.\n  This bill would simply say those health care providers do not have to \nfollow that mandate if it violates their faith principles, faith \nprinciples that are part of a health care delivery system. That could \nbe through any number of different faith groups, and I have talked to a \nlot of them. Frankly, some of those faith group views of health care do \nnot agree with my views or my faith's views of health care. But that is \nnot the point here. This is not about whether I agree with what that \nfaith group wants to do. It is whether they are allowed to do it; \nwhether the representative of that view of health care\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\nand how it affects people is able to say to their government: No, this \nis something that is protected by the Constitution. It is protected by \nthe first amendment. You cannot require me to provide a service--\nthrough a faith-based institution--that I do not agree with or you \ncannot require me as a health care provider to provide a service that I \ndo not agree with because of my faith.\n\n  It doesn't mean you cannot get it somewhere else if it is something \nthat can legally be done. It just means people of faith or institutions \nof faith do not have to do it. That is why in almost every Catholic \nchurch in America, the last two weekends, a letter has been read from \nthe bishop or the archbishop that said this is unacceptable, it should \nnot be complied with.\n  That is why the Chaplain to the Army, the Chief Archbishop to the \nArmy, Bishop Broglio, sent out a letter to be read at Catholic mass at \nArmy posts all over the country. Initially that letter was not going to \nbe read because it did not agree with the tenets the government was \npursuing at the time--which is the violation that people would see most \noffensive, I think, that the government would actually begin to say to \npeople of faith you cannot even talk about it. You cannot even have \nthat letter read on a military post, from the person who is responsible \nto the chaplains and the Catholic chaplains in the military.\n  Maybe it is a faith view of how to deliver health care that somebody \nin the Christian Science community has or somebody in the Seventh Day \nAdventist community has or the Southern Baptist community or whatever \nthat might be. The specific thing is not the issue here. The issue here \nis can government require a faith-based institution to go beyond the \ntenets of its faith.\n  I know the Democratic leader, the majority leader, said there is not \neven a rule yet. The White House said--the administration said there \nwould be a rule. And to make it even more offensive, they said: And, by \nthe way, here is what the rule is going to be and we are going to give \nyou a year to figure out how to adjust your views to accommodate the \nrule.\n  I would have been less offended if they said here is the rule and we \nunderstand it is in violation of your views but here is what is going \nto be the rule and you will have to comply with it. The idea they could \nchange your views, your religious views, your religious beliefs, in a \nyear or a lifetime because some Federal regulator says you need to is \nunbelievably offensive in our country based on the principles that we \nhold most dear in the Constitution itself.\n  So this amendment, which is bipartisan in nature and I think easily \nunderstood because it is so fundamental to who we are, is an amendment \nthat could be quickly debated, it could be quickly voted on. The Senate \nof the United States could express its view. I believe that view would \nbe one supportive of institutions of faith.\n  By the way, also, the administration saying we gave an exemption for \nthe church itself--No. 1, I do not know how long that exemption would \nlast. And, No. 2, I think that shows a lack of understanding of the \nwork of the church or the work of the synagogue or the work of the \nmosque or the work of people of coming together. If the only thing that \nmatters in their work is what happens within the four walls of the \nchurch or whoever works in the four walls of the church every day, \nthese institutions are not what I believe they are.\n  The great schools, the great hospitals, the great community-providing \ninstitutions of America have, so many of them for so long, been based \non faith principles. This amendment would say for health care, those \nfaith principles would still be the overriding principle. For health \ncare, if someone does not agree with the direction of the government, \nthey do not have to perform that service. They do not have to provide \nthat specific kind of insurance to their employees.\n  Remember, the underlying bill here, the underlying rule that has been \nannounced, even though it may not have been officially issued, is one \nthat talks about people who have chosen to go to work for, to get a \npaycheck for, to work at the direction of a faith-based community. Then \nto tell that community what your insurance has to look like--that is \njust one of the many steps. If the government can do that, what can't \nthe government do? If the government can do that, where does the \ngovernment stop? If the government can do that--when you say this is \nsomething I don't believe in so I don't want to be part of this \nparticular health care issue, this health care moment, this health care \nepisode--whatever you want to call it, you say, oh, well, you have to \ndo it because the government says you have to do it and the first \namendment does not matter, the protection of conscience doesn't matter, \nthe Jefferson letter to New London Methodist doesn't matter.\n  Until the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, this was never an issue and nothing would happen if this amendment \nwas approved and became the law of the land. Nothing would be different \ntomorrow than it was a year ago, because a year ago people were not \ndoing this. Five years ago nobody would have even thought it was \npossible, that the Federal Government would tell a faith-based hospital \nwhat their insurance plan exactly had to look like, the plan that they \noffered their employees or would tell faith-based health care providers \nwhat they could do and what they could not do or would say if you are \nnot going to do everything the government will pay for, we will not pay \nyou to do anything the government pays for.\n  This is an issue many people in the country feel strongly about, many \npeople in the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, feel strongly \nabout. We can let this go on and create the anxiety it creates for the \nfaith community or we can bring this amendment up, debate it--and, \nfrankly, I think it is pretty well understood--debate it, vote on it, \nand let the country know that we still support the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  While I am disappointed I did not get to offer this amendment today, \nI will be back and I am going to do my best to get this amendment \noffered at the earliest possible time, and I would be glad to see the \nSenate join me, and the majority join me, in saying let's get this \nimportant issue off the minds of the American people and let them know \nthe Constitution still matters and religious liberty is still the first \namendment to the Constitution in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 1 week ago we passed a very important \ngood government bill, the one that would make sure Members of Congress \ncannot benefit from insider trading information. I added to that an \namendment that I think is a good government amendment. It calls for \npeople who are involved in political intelligence gathering--we don't \nhear much about that profession, but it is quite a business. I asked \nthat they be registered just like lobbyists are registered, and I would \nlike to speak to the point of why that is very important and why it is \nimportant to bring it to the Senate's attention, even though it passed \nby a vote of 60 to 39 just a few days ago.\n  In the dark of night on Tuesday of this week, the House released its \nversion of the insider trading bill that goes by the acronym STOCK, \nwhich wiped out any chance of meaningful transparency for the political \nintelligence industry. Think about the chutzpah of the people in the \nHouse of Representatives--a small group of people--taking out the \nlanguage I put in that bill when similar language is cosponsored by 288 \nMembers of the House of Representatives, but it happened. So that bill \nis coming back without the Grassley amendment on it, and we need to \nthink about what we are going to do if we believe in good government, \nand if we believe there ought to be more transparency in government.\n  What we are faced with is a powerful industry that works in the \nshadows--\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\neconomic espionage. They don't want people to know what they do or whom \nthey work for. They are basically afraid of sunlight, I would guess. My \namendment was adopted in the Senate on a very bipartisan basis, kind of \na rare occurrence today. It simply requires registration for lobbyists \nwho seek information from Congress in order to trade on that \ninformation.\n  So isn't it very straightforward if trades are taking place based \nupon ``political intelligence''--that is their word, ``economic \nespionage'' is my word--obtained from Congress or the executive branch, \npeople in this country should know who is gathering such information. \nNot requiring political intelligence professionals to register and \ndisclose their contacts with government officials is a very gaping \nloophole that my amendment fixes. In fact, political intelligence firms \nactually brag about this loophole, and I will give an example about \nthat bragging. This is on the Web site of an organization called the \nOpen Source Intelligence Group, a political intelligence firm:\n\n       Our political intelligence operation differs from standard \n     `lobbying' in that the OSINT Group is not looking to \n     influence legislation on behalf of clients, but rather \n     provide unique `monitoring' of information through our \n     personal relationships between lawmakers, staffers, and \n     lobbyists.\n       Providing this service for clients who do not want their \n     interest in an issue publicly known is an activity that does \n     not need to be reported under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \n     thus providing an additional layer of confidentially for our \n     clients.\n       This service is ideal for companies seeking competitive \n     advantage by allowing a client's interest to remain \n     confidential . . .\n\n  Think about the words ``personal relationships,'' \n``confidentiality.'' Basically, what they are saying is do all this \nunder the radar.\n  I wish to go back, if you didn't hear it the first time, let me \nrepeat some of this for you, a much shorter quote:\n\n       Providing this service for clients who do not want their \n     interests in an issue publicly known is an activity that does \n     not need to be reported under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \n     thus providing an additional layer of confidentiality for our \n     clients.\n\n  We have it here on paper, and I just read it to you. This firm--\nprobably one of many firms; I don't know how many firms are doing \nthis--is telling potential clients: If you don't want anybody to know \nwhat you are asking of Federal officials, hire us. That is wrong, but \nthat is why firms such as this don't want to register. If someone on \nWall Street is trying to make money off conversations they had with \nSenators or staff, we should know who they are. It is that plain and \nsimple.\n  Since the passage of my amendment, which would require political \nintelligence lobbyists to register as lobbyists, I have heard a great \ndeal of ``concern'' from the lobbying community. Political intelligence \nprofessionals have claimed they should do their business in secret for \nseveral reasons.\n  Now, this is the explanation of why they need secrecy. First, they \nhave said if they are required to register, they will no longer be able \nto sell information to their clients because people will not want to \nhire them. That makes me wonder, what do they have to hide?\n  Second, they have said many of them have large numbers of clients, \nand it would take them a lot of time to register these large numbers of \nsecret clients. Again, that makes me think we actually need more \ntransparency to find out who are all of these people buying \nintelligence information.\n  Third, they have claimed it would not address the so-called ``20-\npercent loophole'' that allows people who spend less than 20 percent of \ntheir time lobbying from having to register under existing laws as \nlobbyists. Not too many people know of that 20-percent loophole, but \nthat is a pretty big loophole. A person can lobby, but they don't have \nto register if they don't spend more than 20 percent of their time on \nit. Well, on this issue I have some good news for these people. We \ndon't make the mistake that caused the 20-percent loophole. My \namendment requires anyone who makes a political intelligence contact to \nhave to register. No loopholes, no deals, no special treatment, just \neveryone registers.\n  Finally, I just want to assure people, particularly journalists, that \nthey would not have to register. Now, that information has been \nfloating around, and it has been floating around that some constituents \nlooking for information in order to make a business decision might have \nto register. Not so. Only political intelligence brokers, people who \nseek information so others can trade securities, would have to \nregister.\n  As I said before, if people want to trade stocks from what we do in \nCongress, we should know who they are. After all, the basic underlying \npiece of legislation prohibits Members of Congress from having insider \ntrading information and profiting from it. We ought to know with whom \nwe are dealing. The American people deserve a little sunshine from this \nindustry and on this industry.\n  Last night, the House turned away from transparency. They supported \nthe status quo. What we need is a full and open conference process so \nwe can take up this very important issue once again that the House \nbelieves was somehow not very important, even though 288 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives--that is two-thirds of the House of \nRepresentatives--have signed on to this principle that these people \nought to register. We can take that up then in conference, both the \nHouse and Senate, working together.\n  Is every word in this bill the way it ought to be? If somebody wants \nto point out some things that ought to be changed, I am open to that. \nBut don't forget, 288 people in the House have signed on. It can't be \ntoo bad.\n  So if we don't get to conference or if we have to debate this again \non the floor of the Senate, we might not get 60 votes again. So I worry \nwe will miss the best opportunity we have had for openness and \ntransparency in years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I am on the floor today to discuss \nsomething that has been a top priority for me in the Senate; that is, \nthe critical need to get serious about building a new energy agenda for \nAmerica, one that keeps our businesses competitive in the global \neconomy, preserves the integrity of our environment, and restarts the \nengine that has always kept our country moving forward--and that is \ninnovation. I am specifically focused on the energy tax extenders, \nthose that are so necessary for us to keep going in the area of \nhomegrown and renewable energy.\n  We all know there is no single solution for getting us there. What we \nneed is not a silver bullet; we need a silver buckshot, as we like to \nsay in Minnesota.\n  I have talked about the need with many of my colleagues to continue \ndeveloping alternative resources such as hydro, geothermal, biofuels, \nsolar, wind, and we have also talked about how we need to continue to \ndevelop existing technologies such as domestic oil and gas production \nwhile enforcing appropriate safeguards. This is the very ``all-of-the-\nabove'' approach we need to take in order to keep all options on the \ntable.\n  This means exploring some of the new proposals we have seen with \npromising technologies such as the smart grid. But it also means \nextending the critical tax incentives that have been so important in \nadvancing the development of the next generation of biofuels and the \nnext generation of renewable energy. That is why I have pushed to \nensure that we have the right policies in place for encouraging clean \nenergy innovation, including the biodiesel tax credit which supports \nover 31,000 jobs and has allowed domestic production to more than \ndouble since 2011. It means the production tax credit, which made it \npossible for wind power to represent over one-third of all new \nelectricity generation capacity in the United States last year.\n  Think of that figure. Think of the strides we have made and where we \ncan go in the future. The advanced energy manufacturing tax credit has \nleveraged\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\n$5.4 billion in private investment, boosting growth and creating new \nU.S. manufacturing jobs by producing components and equipment for the \nburgeoning global renewable energy industry.\n  Extending these critical tax credits will help strengthen our \ncountry's clean energy businesses so they can continue to grow and \nthrive. But they are just one part of the equation. Again, there is no \nsilver bullet solution to our Nation's energy challenges, and that is \nwhy we need to be willing to come together to hammer out a \ncomprehensive strategy for moving forward. We cannot afford to keep our \nheads buried in the sand. We cannot afford to let yet another golden \nopportunity pass us by. Sadly, too many have already come and gone.\n  Over the years, I believe there have been--especially in this last \ndecade--several moments when we could have acted but didn't when we had \nthe full support of the American people who had wanted a new direction \nin energy policy. The first was immediately after 9/11 when President \nBush--if he had made a new energy policy one of the challenges to the \ncountry in addition to invading Afghanistan and combating terrorism, I \nbelieve we could have moved forward. But that didn't happen, and there \nis no need to dwell on it today.\n  The second moment was before the arrival of the Presiding Officer in \nthe Congress, and that was in the summer of 2008 when we did take \naction to raise gas mileage and energy-efficiency standards--something \nI like to call building a bridge to the next century--but we didn't \nmake the kind of comprehensive progress on a comprehensive energy plan \nthat we should have made.\n  The third moment was when President Obama first came into office. At \nthat time, I advocated for a clean energy standard that I believe could \nhave passed in the first 6 months. It could have been combined with \nsome of the other comprehensive things we were talking about. We had a \nbipartisan group going at the time, a group of 14 of us. But, instead, \na decision was made to focus on cap and trade later, instead of \nstarting with that clean energy standard and building from that.\n\n  Those were missed opportunities, a chain of missed opportunities. But \nuntil we get serious about building a newer energy agenda for America, \nwe are going to continue to struggle with the consequences which have \ncreated a vicious cycle of economic and environmental costs, not least \nof all those caused by climate change.\n  Climate change, as the Presiding Officer knows, is not just about \nmelting glaciers and rising ocean levels. Shifting global trends have \nthe potential to wreak intense havoc on local economies, particularly \nthose anchored in agricultural. The facts stand for themselves.\n  In January 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said for \nthe first time that public companies should add climate change to the \nlist of possible financial or legal impacts that they actually disclose \nto investors.\n  The Bureau of Economic Analysis, at the Department of Commerce, \nestimates that at least one-third of the U.S. gross domestic product is \nweather and climate sensitive, with a potential economic impact of $4 \ntrillion a year. Much of that impact would be wrung out of our farm \ncommunities and from States with large rural populations, such as my \nown. Any farmer will tell you a change in weather can mean the \ndifference between a bumper crop and a complete disaster--regardless of \nhow hard that farmer works. So it goes without saying that any kind of \nsignificant swing in climate--paired with increasingly unpredictable \nrainfall--could pose a problem to Americans who make their living off \nthe land.\n  In 2008, Minnesota's farms, forests, and ranches produced $18 billion \nin goods and exported close to one-third of that. This is a sector that \nis critically important to our economy, and we cannot afford for it to \nbe jeopardized. We also cannot afford the rising costs of fire \nmanagement, as forest fires have become increasingly intense in recent \nyears.\n  The current path is not sustainable. That is why I am on the floor, \nin the hope that we can spark a meaningful conversation, but, most \nspecifically, that we look at extending those energy tax credits.\n  I believe we can take a page from our State, the State of Minnesota.\n  My home State is proof that policies promoting homegrown energy can \nalso promote business growth and job creation. The unemployment rate in \nthe State of Minnesota is 5.7 percent--well below the national \naverage--and part of that is thanks to our energy policies. In fact, a \nrecent report by the Pew Charitable Trust showed that in the last \ndecade Minnesota jobs in this sector grew by 11.9 percent, compared to \n1.9 percent for jobs overall.\n  As I travel around the State, I can see the progress that has been \nmade. I think of places I have visited, such as Sebeka, MN, where a \nsmall telephone company felt their customers who were in extremely \nrural areas needed backup power supplies. So what did they do? They \nfound a way to combine wind turbines and solar panels so their \ncustomers could actually purchase backup power. They did it themselves, \nand they sold it to their customers.\n  It was very popular, and at one point an 80-year-old man came to see \nthem, and he said: I would like to purchase more. I want to do my whole \nhouse in solar. The telephone company said: Sir, you can do that, but \nit will take you about 10 years to get your investment back, but it is \ngoing to be worth it. Do you mind if we ask how old you are? The man \nsaid: I am 80 years old but I want to go green.\n  That is one of those true stories from the State of Minnesota.\n  Then there is Pentair, a Minneapolis-based water solutions company \nthat has donated a custom-designed Rain Water Recycling System to the \nnew and great Target baseball field. That technology will capture, \nconserve, and reuse rainwater, saving the ballpark more than 2 million \ngallons of water each year.\n  In one of General Mills' manufacturing plants, they have developed \ntheir own innovative way to reuse water--diverting it to the local \nmunicipal golf course to water the grass.\n  These are just a few examples of Minnesota's commitment to energy \ninnovation. There are countless stories out there, but it is not just a \nMinnesota story, it is an American story.\n  I would note that the renewable energy standard in Minnesota--25 by \n25--is one of the most aggressive in the country--30 percent for Xcel--\nand yet our unemployment rate is so much better than the rest of the \ncountry.\n  The quest to develop clean, sustainable, homegrown energy is not \nspecific to just one part of the country or, for that matter, just one \npolitical party. Our renewable energy standard was actually nearly \nunanimously adopted by the legislature--Democrats and Republicans--and \nsigned into law by a Republican Governor, Governor Pawlenty. This is an \nissue I believe can and should unite us, and it is a way to address \nthese concerns because it builds a coalition across a broad spectrum; \nthat is, energy policy. It saves money. It is better for the \nenvironment. It is certainly better for our national security, \nproducing our own homegrown energy.\n  In the past, Democrats and Republicans have managed to come together \nto confront tough challenges--from the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s, \nto keeping Social Security solvent in the 1980s, to welfare reform in \nthe 1990s.\n  But perhaps the most fitting example, in the context of combating \nclimate change, is the Clean Air Act. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nthat landmark bill took the first steps to address acid rain and \nexpanded efforts to control toxic air pollutants.\n  When the bill passed in the 1990s, it had strong bipartisan support \nfrom Democrats and Republicans alike. It is worth mentioning that all \n10 Members of the Minnesota delegation at the time, which included 5 \nDemocrats and 5 Republicans--that was our Federal delegation--supported \nthe bill, including Republican Senator Dave Durenberger, who was among \nits chief authors and staunchest supporters.\n  Since then, the Clean Air Act has helped prevent more than 18 million \nchild respiratory illnesses and 300,000 premature deaths.\n  Policies to protect our rivers, lakes, and streams have also had a \npositive impact on people's health.\n  Coming from the ``Land of 10,000 Lakes,'' I have a unique \nappreciation for the importance of clean water. It is the resource that \nsustains our lakes and rivers, that provides critical habitat to \ncountless fish and millions of\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\nmigratory birds, that fuels our thriving outdoor economy.\n  Hunting and fishing are more than just hobbies in our State, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer. They are a way of life, and they are critically \nimportant to our economy.\n  Every year, nearly 2 million people fish our lakes and our streams, \nand close to 700,000 people hunt our fields and forests.\n  Nationwide, the hunting and fishing industry is valued at $95.5 \nbillion a year, and it brings in $14 billion in revenue. Clean water is \na fundamental pillar in supporting this economic sector and protecting \npeople against dangerous toxins such as mercury.\n  Minnesota has passed some of the most stringent mercury rules in the \ncountry. In 2006, our State legislature passed laws requiring our \nlargest powerplants to cut mercury emissions 90 percent by 2015. The \nFederal Government is finally catching up and will publish a \nrequirement in coming days to make similar reductions by 2016.\n  Yet despite everything we have done to combat mercury pollution, we \nare still grappling with its consequences. A recent analysis of 25 \nyears of data has found an unexpected rise in average mercury levels in \nnorthern pike and walleye from Minnesota lakes. After declining by 37 \npercent from 1982 to 1992, average mercury concentrations in these fish \nbegan to increase in the mid 1990s.\n  During the last decade of that period, 1996 to 2006, average mercury \nconcentrations increased 15 percent. These numbers make one of the \nclearest possible arguments for supporting Federal protection, because \nwe all have a stake in protecting the health of our fish and wildlife, \nand we cannot do that if we cannot keep dangerous toxins out of our air \nand water supply.\n  This is important to our economy, but it is also important to \nmaintaining a certain way of American life, a way of life that many of \nus grew up with that we ought to be able to pass on to future \ngenerations. I grew up in a family that valued the outdoors. I was 18 \nyears old before I took any vacation that did not involve a tent or a \ncamper in one way or another.\n  This did not just start with my parents. My grandpa was an avid \nhunter and fisherman. He worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in \nEly, MN. You can imagine why for him hunting was his way of life. This \nwas his way out. When he got above ground from those mines, it was \nsomething he loved to do. I want future generations of Minnesotans to \nbe able to enjoy these same pastimes. I want them to be able to fish in \nclean water, to hunt in abundant forests, and to camp out in our \nbeautiful wilderness. But I also want them to know the same America we \nknow, an America that is innovative, that is forward thinking, that is \nwilling to come together and hammer out hard-won solutions to tough \nchallenges.\n  Nowhere is this more important than our quest to move America forward \nthrough smarter energy and environmental policies. I cannot help but \nthink, this is our generation's version of the space race and energy \nrace. But the finish line will not be Neil Armstrong placing a flag on \nthe Moon. It will be building the next generation of energy-efficient \nwindows, and doing it in northern Minnesota instead of in China, or an \nelectric car battery factory in Memphis, TN, instead of Mumbai, India, \nor a wind turbine manufacturer in San Jose, CA, instead of Sao Paulo, \nBrazil.\n  This is my vision for an energy America that is energy independent, a \nstronger, more innovative America. I know you all want to same thing. \nThat is why I am here on the floor today, because I know we cannot \ncontinue to get by with piecemeal energy policy. We cannot play red \nlight-green light with our tax incentives as we are doing this year, \nand that is why we have to put them in place again.\n  What we need now is a comprehensive national blueprint for energy \npolicy, a solution that will serve the integrity of our air, of our \nwater and natural resources, that gives businesses the incentives to \nresearch and develop new sources of energy that invest in the next \ngeneration of American innovation.\n  That is our challenge. It is not going to happen overnight, but I \nbelieve we will get it done. We have before; we will do it again. One \nway to start is to make sure we extend these energy tax credits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an old political axiom that is \nattributed to Thomas Jefferson, more recently to Gerald Ford, that \nsays: A government that is big enough to give you everything you want \nis also big enough to take it all away.\n  Those words took on a whole new meaning this last week when we found \nout the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, Kathleen \nSebelius, was issuing new regulations with regard to the health care \nact that passed last year that would apply to religious-affiliated \nuniversities, charities, and hospitals.\n  I think we have to remember exactly why it was that many of our \nforefathers came to this country in the first place. They came, in many \ncases, because they were trying to get away from religious persecution \nin their homelands. So they came to the United States with the desire \nto start anew and to assert that in this new government they formed \nthat they would protect freedoms, basic freedoms, such as religious \nliberty.\n  So in the Declaration of Independence they said:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [the rights \n     to] Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.--[In order] \n     to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, \n     deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  So that was a foundational principle of our democracy, and it was \nenshrined, when they wrote the Constitution, in the first amendment of \nthe Bill of Rights, when they said:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .\n\n  It was the very first right they enshrined in the Bill of Rights in \nthe Constitution of the United States. That was the weight they \nattached to the important issue of religious liberty, and it was \nconsistent with the statement in the Declaration of Independence, where \nit says that those rights are endowed by our Creator. They are not \ngiven to us by a State. They are not given to us by government. They \nare something that is endowed by our Creator. The government is here to \nprotect those rights.\n  So when this issue popped up on many people's radar screen--and, of \ncourse, it has been percolating out there for quite a while, but there \nhad been an opportunity to weigh in and to provide comments, with the \nhope that the Department of Health and Human Services would come to the \nright conclusion and exempt religious-affiliated schools, hospitals, \nand charities--when that was not going to be the case and they were \ngoing to require these very organizations to do something that violated \ntheir consciences and violated the teachings and the practices of their \nfaith, many people across this country--we have all heard from them--\ngot very engaged on this issue.\n\n  It seems to me, at least, there is a very simple answer to this; that \nis, the administration could go back and revisit this issue and more \nbroadly make this exemption not just for churches--which is where it is \ntoday--but also for church schools, church hospitals, church \nuniversities.\n  It was interesting, Tuesday morning the minority leader in the \nSenate, Senator McConnell, was out here talking about this issue, and \nhe mentioned:\n\n       One out of six patients in America is treated at a Catholic \n     hospital. Catholic Charities is the largest private provider \n     of social services to poor children, families, and \n     individuals in America. The Catholic Church runs the largest \n     network of private schools in the country.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       These institutions have thrived because they have been \n     allowed to freely pursue their religious convictions in a \n     country that, until now, respected their constitutional right \n     to do so.\n\n  He went on to say in that statement:\n\n       If the rights of some are not protected, the rights of all \n     are in danger.\n\n  I think what has many of the churches across this country and many of \nthe\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\nuniversities and many of the hospitals concerned about is that this is \ngoing to become a finalized regulation.\n  The proponents of the regulation are saying there is a year to comply \nwith it. I would submit to you that asking people in this country to \ncheck their principles at the door not now but a year from now is not \nmaking any kind of an accommodation.\n  This needs to be reversed. This is clearly a violation of religious \nliberty, the protection and right we have in the first amendment of our \nConstitution in our Bill of Rights, and I hope the administration will \ndo the right thing and acknowledge that they have made a mistake, that \nthey have gone too far, that they have overreached, that they have \ntreaded in an area they should not tread and make this right. The way \nto make this right is to reverse this decision.\n  Some have argued: What is that going to mean? Does that mean people \nin this country are not going to have access to contraceptive services? \nThe answer to that is absolutely not. Contraception would be widely \navailable. It is just that religious-affiliated employers would not be \nforced to fund this coverage which violates the tenants of their faith. \nIt does not have anything to do with contraception. It does not have \nanything to do with that issue at all. What it has to do with is the \nissue of religious liberty and whether we are going to respect that or \nare we going to allow that to be eroded, and who knows where this goes \nnext.\n  The other point I would make is, this is also, I think, an example of \nwhat happens when you get a government that is so big it can give you \neverything you want but also big enough to take it all away. There are \na lot of people who, when this was debated, when the affordable care \nact was debated, argued--myself included--this would lead to government \nrunning more of our lives, making more decisions, intruding more, \nhaving more control, and making decisions with regard to people's \nhealth care.\n  I would submit this is an example--and perhaps example No. 1--of that \nvery fact. What we are seeing now is, the affordable care act--as it \ngets implemented, we are giving more and more power to the Federal \nGovernment, and when we do that, when big government gets bigger and \nbigger, it has more latitude when it comes to running over the rights \nof ordinary Americans. This is a perfect example of that.\n  I could go down the list of other regulations. I have come down to \nthe floor many times to talk about regulatory overreach, excessive \nregulations that go way beyond common sense, that do not deal with \nissues of public health and safety but are simply regulations for \nregulation's sake.\n  People have heard me come down and talk about the Department of \nLabor's efforts now to regulate the young people who work on family \nfarms and ranches and the overly proscriptive way in which they are \ntrying to keep young people from performing duties they learned growing \nup that they are trained to do, that contribute to the overall success \nand prosperity of family farms and ranches.\n  The Department of Labor's proposal right now would restrict young \npeople from working at elevations that are more than 6 feet, from \nworking with farm animals that are more than 6 months old, from working \naround grain elevators or stockyards or operating certain kinds of \nequipment, many pieces of equipment, types of equipment that are fairly \nstandard on a farming operation. It strikes at the very heart of what \nmakes a family farm and ranch operation tick. It is an assault on the \nheartland of this country and the culture and values that have helped \nshape it and make it great.\n\n  So this issue of regulatory overreach and big government is an issue \nthat I think is symbolized by this current debate. What we are having \nis a debate about the reach of government to where they can start \ncoming up with regulations under the new health care law that clearly \nviolate the religious liberty protections that are afforded for people \nin this country under the first amendment and which I think our \nFounders, if they were around today, would find incredibly offensive.\n  This is an affront, an assault on these very liberties. It is an \nassault on our Bill of Rights, our Constitution. It is something the \nadministration should walk back from and make right. They can do that \nvery simply by reversing this or widening or broadening this exemption \nto cover religious-affiliated schools, universities and charities. And \nthey could do that right now.\n  I would hope that would be the case. If it is not, there is \nlegislation that has been proposed here. A number of my colleagues have \nalready filed bills. In fact, Senator Blunt was down here earlier today \nand asked to call up an amendment that would address this issue. It was \nobjected to on the grounds that it is not related to the underlying \nbill, the highway bill. Well, if it is not related to the highway bill, \nthen let's provide an opportunity for Congress to weigh in on this. I \ncan tell you one thing, the American people are weighing in on this. \nThis Congress of the United States, as their representatives, needs to \nstand for the American people and, more importantly, needs to defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. If the administration is going \nto take this step, and if the administration is not going to walk back \nfrom this, this Congress of the United States needs to be heard.\n  There will be numerous attempts until that opportunity is presented \nby my colleagues and me to make sure this wrong is fixed, is corrected, \nand that the religious liberties for which our Founders came to this \ncountry and for which so many have fought and died over the years to \ndefend are protected, and those rights that are enshrined in our \nDeclaration of Independence and our Constitution and our Bill of Rights \nare protected for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S490-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S490-S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   OBSERVING NATIONAL INVENTORS' DAY\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I would like to focus \nattention on inventors. Senate Joint Resolution 140, Public Law 97-198, \ndesignated February 11, the anniversary of the birth of the inventor \nThomas Alva Edison, as National Inventors' Day.\n  Each year we recognize the contributions of those who use their \nimagination and skills to conceive, create, concoct, discover, devise, \nand formulate new devices, machines, and processes in order to receive \npatents, trademarks, and copyrights.\n  Inventors play an enormously important role in promoting progress in \nevery aspect of our lives. Invention and innovation are basic to the \ntechnological and manufacturing strength of the United States and our \neconomic, environmental, and social well-being.\n  The Constitution specifically provides for the granting of exclusive \nrights to inventors for their discoveries. During the First Congress, \nPresident George Washington prevailed upon the House and Senate to \nenact a patent statute and wisely advised that ``there is nothing which \ncan better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science.''\n  In our State, since our Nation's bicentennial, over 1,600 patents \nhave been issued to Alaska residents. The ingenuity of our citizens is \nreflected in the variety of patents issued such as a vehicle escape \ntool; an ocean spill and contaminated sea ice containment, separation, \nand removal system; an audible fishing weight; and a fish pin bone \nremoval apparatus--just to name a few.\n  In recent years, over 500 new applications have been received by the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office from Alaskans involving wells, \nhydraulic and earth engineering, and electric conductors and \ninsulators.\n  I applaud the efforts of support groups in Alaska such as the \nInventors Institute of Alaska, Alaska Inventors and Entrepreneurs, and \nthe Patent and Trademark Resource Center.\n  The genius of inventors is key to our future. The next great American \ninvention could be among the patent applications pending at the Patent \nOffice.\n  On the observance of National Inventors' Day, I urge all Alaskans to \nreflect on contributions of inventors and to take part in appropriate \nprograms and activities.\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S491-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        REMEMBERING CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT LUTHER JEFFERSON, SR.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to salute the life and \nservice of retired CMSgt Luther Jefferson, Sr., who served as a \nTuskegee Airman in the 332nd Fighter Group. Chief Jefferson will be \nremembered not only for his valor and service to his country but also \nfor his compassion, optimism, and generous spirit. He died at his home \nin Victorville, California on January 19, 2012.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S491, February 9, 2012, the Record reads: . . . retired \nCMSAF Luther Jefferson, Sr. . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . retired \nCMSgt Luther Jefferson, Sr. . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Luther Jefferson was born March 23, 1923, in Cotton Valley, LA, and \nwas the fifth of 11 children born to Andrew and Sue Willie Curry \nJefferson. Reared in poverty on a sharecropper's farm, Luther was \ndetermined to work hard, study diligently, and maintain a positive \noutlook on life.\n  In March 1943, Luther Jefferson was drafted into the U.S. military. \nWhile completing basic training at the Army Air Base in Greenberg, NC, \nhe learned of an experimental training program for African-American \npilots, based at the Tuskegee Institute and Tuskegee Army Air Field in \nAlabama. After passing the required examination and being accepted into \nthe program, he was assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group's 99th Fighter \nSquadron--part of an elite group now known as the Tuskegee Airmen. \nLogging more than 5,000 hours in aircraft that included the P-40 \nFighter and B-25s, he helped protect Army Air Corps bombers in Italy \nduring WWII and participated in the post-WWII Berlin Airlift. Following \nthe war, Jefferson was assigned to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at \nDayton, OH in the Research and Development Section of New Aircraft and \nHuman Characteristics--as one of a select few chosen to test new \naircraft and combat simulations. Luther Jefferson also participated in \nthe Dugway Proving Ground atomic test in Utah. By the time he retired \nfrom the U.S. Air Force in 1972, Luther Jefferson had become one of the \nbranch's first African-American chief master sergeants.\n  As a civilian, Chief Jefferson remained active in his community and \nvolunteered as a Little League umpire and a Meals-on-Wheels driver for \nhomebound seniors.\n  Luther Jefferson, Sr., passed away at 88 years of age. I extend my \nheartfelt condolences to his two siblings Avis Jefferson and Alice \nShaw; three children, Deborah Jefferson, Yvonne Atkinson, and Andrew \nJefferson; and his six grandchildren, extended family, and numerous \nfriends.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Tuskegee \nAirman CMSgt Luther Jefferson, Sr.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S491, February 9, 2012, the Record reads: . . . the life \nof Tuskegee Airman CMSAF Luther Jefferson, Sr. . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . the life of \nTuskegee Airman CMSgt Luther Jefferson, Sr. . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S491-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING CAPTAIN CARLTON JACOB HOLLAND, JR. USA\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I honor Captain Jake \nHolland, United States Army, for his service in defense of Wyoming and \nour Nation.\n  Captain Holland of Casper, WY, was an Army Ranger assigned to the \n48th Army of the Republic of Vietnam, Advance Team 88, Headquarters, \nMilitary Assistance Command--Vietnam Advisors, Military Assistance \nCommand. He was stationed in the Central Highlands of Phuoc Long \nProvince as a MACV advisor to the South Vietnamese.\n  The Central Highlands were a critical supply route for the Viet Cong \nthrough the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The MACV mission was infamously known as \none of the most dangerous missions for ground troops. They deployed \ndeep into the jungle in small teams of four to train and assist the \nSouth Vietnamese Army and the indigenous Montagnard fighters.\n  Early in the morning on February 9, Captain Holland and his men came \nunder attack. They were outmanned and outgunned by the Viet Cong but \nthat did not dissuade their determination to resist the attack on Bu \nDang Compound.\n  As the enemy advanced closer to the compound demanding surrender over \nloud speakers, Captain Holland established a perimeter with his \nremaining forces. He picked up a .50 caliber machine gun and moved from \nposition to position, exposing himself with each burst of fire. After \nall of the ammunition ran out, Captain Holland and his men succumbed to \ntheir wounds but they never gave up the fight. He was 36 years old.\n  Forty-seven years ago today, on February 9, 1965, Wyoming suffered \nits first casualty of the Vietnam War. For his valiant actions on this \nfateful day, Captain Holland was awarded the Distinguished Service \nCross, the second highest honor in the Army. His decorations also \nincluded the Purple Heart Medal, National Defense Service Medal, \nVietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n  Today, Captain Holland lays in rest with his brothers in arms at \nArlington National Cemetery in Section 35, site 3621. His name is \nengraved on Panel 01E, Line 86 at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  In Wyoming we never forget. It is through this tradition that we make \nevery effort to honor and remember those who have selflessly made the \nultimate sacrifice. We hold Captain Holland's service and valor \nhigh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S491-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING WEST NOTTINGHAM ACADEMY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 200th \nanniversary of the chartering and relocation of West Nottingham Academy \nin Colora, MD. West Nottingham Academy is recognized as the oldest \nboarding school in the nation 267 years after the school's original \nfounding. West Nottingham Academy was founded in 1744 by Samuel Finley, \na young Presbyterian minister from Ireland who later became president \nof Princeton. The school prepared boys for university study, and two \nearly graduates, Benjamin Rush and Richard Stockton, went on to sign \nthe Declaration of Independence. In 1812, West Nottingham Academy was \ngranted a Charter by the State of Maryland, and moved to its present \nlocation. Notable alumni include Maryland Governor Austin Lane \nCrothers, Cincinnati founder John Filson, North Carolina Governor \nAlexander Martin, and Pennsylvania Congressman Peter Kostmayer.\n  West Nottingham Academy has evolved from its humble beginnings as a \nlog cabin addition to Samuel Finley's home to a modern campus that is \nhome to 120 boarding and day students in grades 9-12 representing eight \nStates and ten countries. Student life is enriched outside the \nclassroom by interscholastic sports teams, service learning \nopportunities, student-led clubs, and educational excursions to \nBaltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington.\n  West Nottingham Academy uses an innovative, student-centered academic \napproach which celebrates students' many learning styles through a \nvariety of teaching methods. The student-centered approach is \nexemplified in West Nottingham's Chesapeake Learning Center, where \nstudents with learning differences receive support services uniquely \ntailored to help each student reach his or her full potential.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating West \nNottingham Academy on the bicentennial of its chartering and \nrelocation, and on over 200 years of providing educational opportunity \nand leadership to Maryland and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S491-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S491-S492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JEREMIAH MOCK\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor SFC Jeremiah \nMock on the occasion of his oath of reenlistment in the Nevada Army \nNational Guard. His commitment to the citizens of the Silver State is \nunwavering, and Nevada is honored by his service.\n  I would first like to recognize all of our Nation's service men and \nwomen. Each and every day, our troops are serving the United States to \nprotect our freedom. They dedicate their lives to serve this great \nNation and constantly make grave sacrifices to ensure the safety of our \ncountry. Our servicemembers and their families deserve our gratitude \nand thanks.\n  Before serving in the Nevada National Guard, Sergeant Mock served 9 \nyears in the Army Reserve, where he was deployed repeatedly on combat \ntours to Iraq and Afghanistan. His continued dedication to service led \nhim to join the Nevada National Guard in 2007, and he continues to \nserve his State, despite becoming the innocent victim of a brutal \nshooting in Carson City, NV, on September 6, 2011. I will never forget \nthis tragic event, and I continue to send my thoughts and prayers to \nthe victims and their families.\n  I commend Sergeant Mock for his bravery and thank him for his \nfaithful\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\nservice to his State and country. I also wish to recognize Sergeant \nMock's wife, SSG Stephanie Mock, who enlisted in the Nevada Air \nNational Guard shortly after the tragic events of September 6, 2011. \nThe Mock family is a true inspiration and illustration of a proud \nNevada family who have overcome great hardship through faith and \ndetermination.\n  I congratulate Sergeant Mock on his reenlistment and am humbled by \nhim and all of our courageous service men and women. Let us continue to \nbe mindful of our dedicated servicemembers who fight to protect and \npreserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S492-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MIYAKE RESTAURANTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, one of the proudest American \ntraditions is that of an individual who starts out on his or her own, \ntakes a risk, and opens a successful business. Such entrepreneurs are \nthe true drivers of our economy, creating jobs and supporting other \nsmall enterprises while revitalizing the areas in which they operate. \nToday I commend chef Masa Miyake of Miyake Restaurants, who has done \nexactly this in the city of Portland, ME.\n  In 2007, Masa was working as a chef in New York City and living in \nQueens with his wife and two young children. He dreamt of relocating to \na place that offered a better quality of life for his children and \nsomewhere with savory seafood. Maine offered him all of these things, \nand having vacationed on Maine's coast in the past, the State reminded \nhim of the beauty of his native Japan. Coincidentally, Masa actually \ngrew up in Japan's Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan, Maine's sister \nstate.\n  When Masa opened Food Factory Miyake later that year in Portland, he \nand his wife and eventually one other person were the sole employees of \nthe operation. As a small firm starting out, they did not have a liquor \nlicense, and initially the business was BYOB--bring your own beverage. \nBut through hard work and ingenuity, Masa grew the business and built a \nrespected brand, not to mention an excellent selection of authentic \ndrink pairings including wine and sake.\n  Today, Masa's two restaurants--the revitalized original Miyake and \nthe new Pai Men Miyake noodle restaurant--employ over 38 individuals. \nMaine is well known for its first-class seafood, and is really \nbeginning to make a name for itself in the trendy world of sushi and \nhaute Asian-fusion cuisine, thanks in no small part to chef Masa \nMiyake.\n  Further, Masa has developed his 3-acre backyard into a small farm. \nHere, Masa and his staff grow vegetables and raise livestock to \ndirectly supply his restaurants and other local Maine businesses, \nincluding Rosemont Markets, Hugo's, and the Barn on Walnut Hill. These \ninclude rare animals such as blue Swedish ducks, Freedom Ranger \nchickens, and guinea hens. This dynamic blend greatly enhances the rich \nculture of our State, and I congratulate Chef Miyake for his innovative \napproach to food and hope other budding entrepreneurs will follow his \nlead.\n  I am proud to extend my congratulations to chef Masa Miyake not only \nfor his substantial contribution to the culinary scene in Maine but \nalso for recognizing and highlighting the appeal of Maine as a great \nplace to raise a family and start a business. Job creators with vision \nand big ideas like Chef Miyake are exactly what Maine needs as we work \nto restore and improve the economy in our small but vibrant and \nbeautiful State. I offer my best wishes for continued success to Miyake \nRestaurants and look forward to Chef Miyake's future succulent \ndishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S492-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1734.

A bill to authorize depository institutions, depository \ninstitution holding companies, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to lease \nforeclosed property held by such entities for up to 5 years, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, when our Nation's economy was thriving, \nNevada was at the heart of the construction boom. Buildings and homes \nwere going up across the State. Neighborhoods were growing, schools \nwere being built at record rates, and the construction industry was \nflourishing. All of this activity drove investments into other areas of \nthe economy, and for many life was good in Nevada. But when the crisis \nhit, the highs that my State experienced were matched by the lows that \nfollowed.\n  Nevada now leads the Nation in unemployment with more than 160,000 \nNevadans looking for a job. Many can no longer afford their homes. \nNevadans are being forced into bankruptcy and facing foreclosure. While \nNevada is home to some of the most resilient, hard-working people in \nthe country, almost one-quarter of Nevadans are so frustrated that they \nhave simply given up hope for better employment.\n  Much of the difficulty Nevadans are experiencing can be traced back \nto the crisis in my State. The ill effects of the depressed housing \nmarket are widespread. High rates of foreclosures are devastating to \nfamilies, neighborhoods, and entire communities. Families who have been \nforeclosed upon are already having a hard time paying their bills. Add \nto those difficulties the time spent finding a new place and the costs \nof moving and their problems are compounded. Time spent fighting the \nbank to avoid foreclosure and relocating would likely be better used to \nfind a job or better paying employment.\n\n  One of the biggest problems distressed home owners are facing is the \nprograms that have been put into place to help keep people in their \nhomes that have not lived up to expectations. My office spends a great \ndeal of time with Nevadans on the cusp of losing their homes, looking \nfor help, and trying to keep families in their homes. It is truly heart \nwrenching to hear some of these stories. These homeowners do not want \nto foreclose, and obviously they do not want to lose their homes.\n  I recently received this e-mail from a constituent in Reno who is \nfighting to keep their home. I would like to share that with you.\n\n       We hoped for a win-win situation but in the end all we got \n     was a nightmare in which everyone loses: my sister and I \n     obviously lose, our neighborhood loses as another house sits \n     vacant with a rusting metal sign in the front, our State \n     loses as the housing plight increases again, the bank loses \n     because they lose a customer who just needed another chance \n     and, most importantly, democracy loses as the plutocrats roll \n     over another family.\n\n  When families move, their children often have to change schools. So \nnow not only are children forced to move from their homes, they are \nalso leaving behind their schools and their neighborhoods. This kind of \ndestabilization is harmful for families who are already struggling.\n  Consider the effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods and \ncommunities. The widespread availability of housing is flooding the \nreal estate inventory in Nevada. This is forcing down home values and \nmaking it difficult for other people to sell their homes as well. In \nFebruary 2006 the average home in Nevada was valued at $309,000. Today \nthe home values have dropped to $120,000.\n  Homes left vacant and uncared for can quickly become an eyesore, \npushing low home values even lower. This means others in the \nneighborhood can have a difficult time selling their homes if they want \nto move. If they find a better job elsewhere, for example, they may not \nbe able to take it because they cannot sell their homes for a \nreasonable price, if they are able to sell them at all.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to help reverse these \ndestabilizing forces. The bill I am introducing today, the Keeping \nFamilies in their Home Act, will help address large unsold housing \ninventories and give families a chance to stay in their homes. This \nbill would allow banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to enter into long-\nterm leases, including an option to purchase properties acquired \nthrough foreclosure with the prior homeowner or any individual.\n  By providing an opportunity for the homeowner to stay in their home, \nthe bank is giving families a chance to regain sound financial footing. \nThis commonsense solution helps provide some much needed stability is \navailable for all families.\n  While I believe this bill is a good step in the right direction, let \nme be clear: much more needs to be done to help the housing problems \nfacing Nevada. The programs already in place simply have not done \nenough and have not lived up to expectations.\n  I was pleased to see reports of growth in our economy, but people in \nmy State continue to suffer. Back home Nevadans still believe there are \nno jobs. Small businesses are trying to survive while gridlock in \nWashington is making it harder for employers to know what is expected \nin the coming year. Crushing regulations are bringing Nevada's growth \nindustries to a halt. In order for Nevada to experience real long-term \nrecovery, Washington needs to fundamentally change the way it works. \nCongress needs to stop overspending. Republicans and Democrats should \ncome together to close unfair loopholes and make the Tax Code easier \nfor businesses to understand and to follow. This bill is just one \nsolution to help turn around this housing crisis. It is also an idea \nthat both Republicans and Democrats can support.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and \nothers into law so that we can help families dealing with foreclosures \nacross the country. As I have said before, moving forward I welcome any \nand all ideas on how to fix the housing crisis in this country. \nNevadans cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to seriously consider \nsupporting this bill. This legislation can go a long way toward helping \nfamilies, stabilizing neighborhoods, and stem\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\nany further reduction in home prices. I hope Senators will join me in \nthis endeavor so the President can sign this bill into law and help \nfamilies who badly need it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2088. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently double the amount of start-up expenses entrepreneurs can \ndeduct from their taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small \nBusiness Start-up Support Act of 2012, legislation that will promote \nsmall business growth in my home state of West Virginia, and around the \ncountry.\n  Since the recession, I have met with countless business owners, as \nwell as those who dream of starting a small business. One of the common \nthemes of these conversations is the difficulty these individuals have \nraising capital, particularly when a business is in its infancy.\n  This legislation helps those individuals out, by expanding a \nsuccessful provision of the tax code that allows business owners to \ndeduct up to $5,000 of start-up costs. These start-up costs are things \nlike legal and marketing costs that are necessary to get a business up \nand running, but put a strain on an already tight budget. My bill would \nexpand this deduction so that individuals can deduct up to $10,000 of \nstart-up costs.\n  For a business to survive, and thrive, its owner has to do their \nhomework during its infancy. They have to study things like supply \nchains and distribution models. They have to develop marketing plans. \nEach of these things has a cost that is incurred before a business \nmakes dollar one. That is when a business owner is most in need of \nassistance and that is why this credit was first enacted.\n  A temporary expansion of the start-up deduction was enacted in 2008, \nand it was one of many actions this Congress took to help business \nowners weather the recession and keep their doors open. President Obama \nincluded a permanent extension of this provision in his ``Startup \nAmerica'' legislative agenda and I am committed to seeing it become \nlaw.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation and thank the chair for allowing me to speak on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 2091. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe international tax system of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill I am \nintroducing today, the United States Job Creation and International Tax \nReform Act of 2012. The name says it all. This is a bill that would \nincentivize American companies to create jobs in the United States \nwhile at the same time leveling the playing field for U.S. companies in \nthe global marketplace. This bill would reform and modernize the rules \nfor taxing the global operations of American companies and would help \nAmerica become a more attractive location to base a business that \nserves customers all over the world.\n  Unfortunately, our current tax rules do just the opposite. In fact, \nmany businesses could be better off if they were headquartered outside \nthe United States. That is not right, and Congress should fix it. This \nbill would do that.\n  I wish to thank Senator Hatch and members of his staff who have been \nhelpful in working through the complexities of this international tax.\n  I also wish to mention Eric Oman, a member of my staff and a CPA, who \nworked with me in developing this legislation. He has lived overseas \nand worked with the U.S. tax laws overseas. That is the kind of \nexpertise we need to reform international tax law.\n  I wish to thank all who testified before the Finance Committee, \nespecially Scott Naatjes, who is the vice president and general tax \ncounsel of Cargill. This man has dealt with the complex accounting of \nforeign earnings and the money to be repatriated to the United States, \nan actual practitioner whom we relied on. He gave us insight into years \nof records that have to be reviewed for a single item in the complex \nweb of the current international tax system in order to bring the money \nback to the United States.\n  Finally, I wish to thank Dave Camp, the chairman of the House, Ways, \nand Means Committee, who kick-started the discussion on tax reform when \nhe released his discussion draft last October.\n  Enacted in the 1960s, our current international tax rules have passed \ntheir expiration date. Many of the U.S. major trading partners, \nincluding Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and most of Europe have \nmoved to what are called territorial tax systems. That is actually a \nword for a global tax system. These types of tax systems tax the income \ngenerated within their borders and exempt foreign earnings from tax.\n  The United States, on the other hand, taxes the worldwide income of \nU.S. companies and provides deferral of the U.S. tax until the foreign \nearnings are brought home. Deferral of the tax until the earnings are \nbrought home encourages them not to bring the money home. It actually \nincentivizes them to leave their money abroad and to expand over there. \nBecause the United States has nearly the highest corporate tax rate in \nthe world, companies don't bring those earnings back and, as I said, \nreinvest outside the United States. That certainly is not a recipe for \nU.S. growth and U.S. job creation.\n  The dominance of U.S.-headquartered companies in the global \nmarketplace is waning. Thirty-six percent of the Fortune Global 500 \ncompanies were headquartered in the United States in 2000. In 2009, \nthat number dropped to 28 percent. That is from 36 percent to 28 \npercent among the Fortune Global 500 companies headquartered in the \nUnited States. Clearly, America is losing ground and our current \ninternational tax rules are a big part of the problem.\n  The bill I am introducing would help to right the ship by pulling our \ninternational tax rules into the 21st century so U.S. companies are not \nat a competitive disadvantage with foreign companies because of \nAmerican tax rules that are outdated by changes most other countries \nhave already made. The bill would give U.S. companies incentives to \ncreate jobs in the United States and undertake activities in the United \nStates in order to win globally.\n  First, if the foreign earnings have already been subject to a tax in \na foreign country, this bill would provide a 95-percent exemption from \nthe U.S. tax on those foreign earnings. This would allow for American-\nmanaged capital to be put to the most productive use and help stabilize \nour economy.\n  Second, this bill would allow foreign earnings that are currently \nsitting overseas to be brought back to America at a reduced rate--not a \nzero tax rate but a greatly reduced rate--and with the ability to pay \nthat, the taxes that are owed in installments. That gets the cash back \nnow and still gets some taxation for us instead of leaving it all \noverseas. This provision would serve as a transition to the new \nterritorial system by allowing U.S. companies to unlock a significant \namount of capital currently being held offshore and quickly move into \nthe new territorial system, and that means more jobs and a better \neconomy. It also emphasizes one of the things I talk about with any of \nthe tax changes--as one of the few accountants--we have to transition \ninto these things if we want the companies stable enough that they can \nexist through the change in the Tax Code, and that provides for a \ntransition as well.\n  Third, this bill would reduce the U.S. tax burden on income generated \nby American companies from ideas and innovations. This bill would \nencourage companies to develop and keep rights to ideas and inventions \nin the United States. When families tune in to ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday \nevenings, they would hear fewer stories about how U.S. companies are \nmoving their profits to tax haven countries and avoiding U.S. tax on \nthose earnings. Families would hear fewer stories about how the U.S. \nmultinational companies set up post office boxes in the Cayman Islands \nand Switzerland without a single employee or officer of the company \nanywhere on site and attribute a significant portion of their foreign \nearnings to those jurisdictions.\n  Instead, families would hear more stories about how U.S. companies \nare generating the ideas and inventions of tomorrow right here in \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n  This bill can be a first step in tax reform. We have a lot of work to \ndo in many other areas of tax law in order to make it simpler, fairer, \nand more transparent. We need to be looking at the individual tax \nsystem, the corporate tax system, and particularly how we tax the \npassthrough entities such as partnerships and S corporations that have \nto pay the tax on the money when it is still invested in the business.\n  I also recognize, as we move forward in these other areas, it may be \nappropriate to make changes to this bill. This is exactly how the \nlegislative process should work, and I look forward to getting back to \nconducting the Senate's business in regular order, where we work \nthrough the issues in the committee first and offer amendments to \nimprove the bills that ultimately come to the Senate floor, where there \nis a shot for everybody else to make amendments.\n  But today with the introduction of this bill, we move from discussion \nto action with respect to a single piece of the tax reform. The \nSimpson-Bowles deficit commission recommended a move to a territorial \nsystem, and I am glad to be moving the conversation forward on this \nrecommendation with the introduction of this bill. I hope this bill \nwill begin a discussion, a discussion of fairness that needs to begin \nyesterday.\n  I hope Members and their staff will review the bill and the detailed \nexplanation we have prepared. I also ask that all interested \nstakeholders review the bill and reach out to my staff and the staff of \nthe Finance Committee to discuss what they like, what they don't like, \nand their suggestions for improvements. That is the way bills are \nsupposed to work.\n  The international tax rules are not easy or simple and reforming them \nwill be a heavy lift. But those things are worth doing, and when they \nare worth doing, they are rarely easy or simple.\n  I look forward to joining with my colleagues to pass international \ntax reforms that our American companies and our country desperately \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to support statewide individual-level integrated \npostsecondary education data systems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when we went to college, usually things \nwere different. Often a student took out a loan, but those loans were \nmanageable, and usually there were jobs waiting. Today, too often that \nis not the case. In fact, the students today who take out loans will \nleave school weighed down, on average, with $25,000 worth of debt. They \nare going to be trying to get into a labor market where there are more \nthan four unemployed Americans for every available job.\n  It has been noted that for the first time student loan debt exceeds \ncredit card debt, and that now totals over $100 billion. Now, clearly, \ninvestment in higher education is an economic imperative. Education is \nthe great equalizer. It enables upward economic mobility, and it breaks \ndown class structures that impair many countries' ability to grow their \neconomies. A highly-skilled and educated workforce is the basis for a \nhealthy economy, and it is the linchpin to our economic future.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S502, February 9, 2012, the Record reads: . . . now \ntotals over $1 billion.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . now totals \nover $100 billion.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  In every major economic decision our people make, they try to \nevaluate the value of that decision. Like prospective homeowners who \ninspect and assess the potential value of their future home, in my view \nfuture students should be able to comparison shop and choose a school \nand a program based on what their return on investment will be.\n  Our capital markets work best when we can accurately measure the \nvalue of the things we choose to invest in. We saw what happens when \nthis is not the case when the housing bubble burst, and our economy is \nstill struggling to recover from the mortgage meltdown. In many \ninstances, consumers who didn't have all the facts bought a product \nbased on misleading information and fell victim to predatory lenders \nlooking to make a profit off that growing bubble.\n  Consumers must know what they can expect from their investments, and \nstudents are entitled to know the value of their education before they \ngo out and borrow tens of thousands of dollars from the banks and from \nthe government to finance their choices. Right now, consumers don't \nhave this information, though the information exists. It is unavailable \nto students and families too often when they are making perhaps the \nmost important decisions that affect their future--both their financial \nfuture and their career.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Student Right to Know Before \nYou Go Act, which would help college students get the information they \nneed about their education. This proposal would ensure that future \nstudents and their families can make well-informed decisions by having \naccess to information on their expected average annual earnings after \ngraduation; rates of remedial enrollment, credit accumulation, and \ngraduation; the average cost, both before and after financial aid, of \nthe program, and average debt upon graduation; and, finally, the \neffects of remedial education and financial aid on credential \nattainment and a greater understanding of what student success can \nmean.\n  For markets to work, there has to be good information available, and \nuntil now it has been extremely hard for students and families to \ncollect this data in a cost-effective way while at the same time \nensuring student privacy. However, the States, as we have seen so \noften--the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have talked about this \nfrom time to time--the States have piloted their own programs and \nproved that the technology exists to enable our ability to generate and \nshare this information in a way that students and consumers can use \nwhile at the same time protecting their privacy.\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\n  This technology, in my view, makes it possible to ensure a return on \ntheir investment for students, for parents, for policymakers, and \ntaxpayers. It is going to help us create a workforce that meets the \ndemands of the businesses that employ it and ensures that our workers \ncan successfully compete in the global economy.\n  One last point, if I might. I think it is clear that access to higher \neducation is an integral part of the step ladder to success and \nparticularly success for the middle class who built this country. \nChairman Harkin, of course, the chairman of our committee who deals \nwith these issues, has probably done more than any other Member in the \nSenate to put a focus on this issue and how important it is to grow the \nmiddle class and address the big concerns they have faced.\n  Middle-class people haven't had a pay raise in a full decade. It \nseems to me as part of the agenda--and Chairman Harkin has had some \nexcellent hearings on these higher education issues--one of the best \nways we can come together on a bipartisan basis is to empower students \nand empower families to be in the best possible position to make the \ncollege choices that are going to pay off in the years ahead.\n  That is what this legislation, the Right to Know Before You Go Act, \nwould do. I hope my colleagues will consider it in the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S503-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S503-S504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 370--CALLING FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN SYRIA\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nIsakson, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 371\n\n       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has \n     designated the week of February 6 through 10, 2012, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week'';\n       Whereas the importance of school counseling has been \n     recognized through the inclusion of elementary- and \n     secondary-school counseling programs in amendments to the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.);\n       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the \n     education system of the United States must provide equitable \n     opportunities for all students;\n       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased \n     academic achievement;\n       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded \n     students by guiding the students through academic, personal, \n     social, and career development;\n       Whereas school counselors assist with and coordinate \n     efforts to foster a positive school culture resulting in a \n     safer learning environment for all students;\n       Whereas school counselors have been instrumental in helping \n     students, teachers, and parents deal with personal trauma as \n     well as tragedies in the community and the United States;\n       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, \n     including peer pressure, depression, the deployment of family \n     members to serve in conflicts overseas, and school violence;\n       Whereas school counselors are one of the few professionals \n     in a school building who are trained in both education and \n     mental-health matters;\n       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors \n     are often misunderstood;\n       Whereas the school-counselor position is often among the \n     first to be eliminated to meet budgetary constraints;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     counselors of 459 to 1 is almost twice that of the ratio of \n     250 to 1 recommended by the American School Counselor \n     Association, the American Counseling Association, the \n     National Association for College Admission Counseling, and \n     other organizations; and\n       Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week \n     would increase awareness of the important and necessary role \n     school counselors play in the lives of students in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 6 through 10, 2012, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities that \n     promote awareness of the role school counselors play in the \n     school and the community at large in preparing students for \n     fulfilling lives as contributing members of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/09/senate-section/article/S504-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1513.

RESPECT FOR RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) As Thomas Jefferson declared to New London Methodists \n     in 1809, ``[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be \n     dearer to man than that which protects the rights of \n     conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority''.\n       (B) Jefferson's statement expresses a conviction on respect \n     for conscience that is deeply embedded in the history and \n     traditions of our Nation and codified in numerous State and \n     Federal laws, including laws on health care.\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\n       (C) Until enactment of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148, in this section \n     referred to as ``PPACA''), the Federal Government has not \n     sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements that \n     infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, purchasers \n     of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and other \n     stakeholders, such as individual or institutional health care \n     providers.\n       (D) PPACA creates a new nationwide requirement for health \n     plans to cover ``essential health benefits'' and ``preventive \n     services'' (including a distinct set of ``preventive services \n     for women''), delegating to the Department of Health and \n     Human Services the authority to provide a list of detailed \n     services under each category, and imposes other new \n     requirements with respect to the provision of health care \n     services.\n       (E) While PPACA provides an exemption for some religious \n     groups that object to participation in Government health \n     programs generally, it does not allow purchasers, plan \n     sponsors, and other stakeholders with religious or moral \n     objections to specific items or services to decline providing \n     or obtaining coverage of such items or services, or allow \n     health care providers with such objections to decline to \n     provide them.\n       (F) By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n     causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n     inflexible mandates in PPACA jeopardize the ability of \n     individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and their \n     ability to freely participate in the health insurance and \n     health care marketplace.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that health care stakeholders retain the \n     right to provide, purchase, or enroll in health coverage that \n     is consistent with their religious beliefs and moral \n     convictions, without fear of being penalized or discriminated \n     against under PPACA; and\n       (B) to ensure that no requirement in PPACA creates new \n     pressures to exclude those exercising such conscientious \n     objection from health plans or other programs under PPACA.\n       (b) Respect for Rights of Conscience.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 42 U.S.C. \n     18022(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(6) Respecting rights of conscience with regard to \n     specific items or services.--\n       ``(A) For health plans.--A health plan shall not be \n     considered to have failed to provide the essential health \n     benefits package described in subsection (a) (or preventive \n     health services described in section 2713 of the Public \n     Health Service Act), to fail to be a qualified health plan, \n     or to fail to fulfill any other requirement under this title \n     on the basis that it declines to provide coverage of specific \n     items or services because--\n       ``(i) providing coverage (or, in the case of a sponsor of a \n     group health plan, paying for coverage) of such specific \n     items or services is contrary to the religious beliefs or \n     moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity \n     offering the plan; or\n       ``(ii) such coverage (in the case of individual coverage) \n     is contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of \n     the purchaser or beneficiary of the coverage.\n       ``(B) For health care providers.--Nothing in this title (or \n     any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to \n     require an individual or institutional health care provider, \n     or authorize a health plan to require a provider, to provide, \n     participate in, or refer for a specific item or service \n     contrary to the provider's religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, a health plan shall not be considered to have failed \n     to provide timely or other access to items or services under \n     this title (or any amendment made by this title) or to \n     fulfill any other requirement under this title because it has \n     respected the rights of conscience of such a provider \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(C) Nondiscrimination in exercising rights of \n     conscience.--No Exchange or other official or entity acting \n     in a governmental capacity in the course of implementing this \n     title (or any amendment made by this title) shall \n     discriminate against a health plan, plan sponsor, health care \n     provider, or other person because of such plan's, sponsor's, \n     provider's, or person's unwillingness to provide coverage of, \n     participate in, or refer for, specific items or services \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(D) Construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) or (B) \n     shall be construed to permit a health plan or provider to \n     discriminate in a manner inconsistent with subparagraphs (B) \n     and (D) of paragraph (4).\n       ``(E) Private rights of action.--The various protections of \n     conscience in this paragraph constitute the protection of \n     individual rights and create a private cause of action for \n     those persons or entities protected. Any person or entity may \n     assert a violation of this paragraph as a claim or defense in \n     a judicial proceeding.\n       ``(F) Remedies.--\n       ``(i) Federal jurisdiction.--The Federal courts shall have \n     jurisdiction to prevent and redress actual or threatened \n     violations of this paragraph by granting all forms of legal \n     or equitable relief, including, but not limited to, \n     injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages, costs, and \n     attorney fees.\n       ``(ii) Initiating party.--An action under this paragraph \n     may be instituted by the Attorney General of the United \n     States, or by any person or entity having standing to \n     complain of a threatened or actual violation of this \n     paragraph, including, but not limited to, any actual or \n     prospective plan sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering a \n     plan, any actual or prospective purchaser or beneficiary of a \n     plan, and any individual or institutional health care \n     provider.\n       ``(iii) Interim relief.--Pending final determination of any \n     action under this paragraph, the court may at any time enter \n     such restraining order or prohibitions, or take such other \n     actions, as it deems necessary.\n       ``(G) Administration.--The Office for Civil Rights of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services is designated to \n     receive complaints of discrimination based on this paragraph \n     and coordinate the investigation of such complaints.\n       ``(H) Actuarial equivalence.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall prohibit the Secretary from issuing regulations or \n     other guidance to ensure that health plans excluding specific \n     items or services under this paragraph shall have an \n     aggregate actuarial value at least equivalent to that of \n     plans at the same level of coverage that do not exclude such \n     items or services.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall be effective as if included in the enactment of Public \n     Law 111-148.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1521.
