Madam President, 60 years ago this Nation's Armed Forces \nwere segregated by race. Thirty-five years ago women were not allowed \nto attend our Nation's military academies. Until today--in fact, last \nnight at midnight--thousands and thousands of qualified, dedicated men \nand women were barred from military service or expelled from the Armed \nForces because they were honest about their sexual orientation. Today I \nam glad to say the time has passed when Americans, willing to give \ntheir lives to defend this great Nation, could be turned away from \nservice because of who they loved. Today, don't ask, don't tell is no \nlonger the law of the land. For 17 years we have asked our soldiers to \ndefend a flag that stands for liberty and justice for all, and then \nrequired some of those soldiers to keep who they were a secret. In too \nmany cases we have robbed them of their right to fight for their \ncountry altogether.\n  Listen to this staggering number: More than 13,000 American\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nservicemembers have been discharged because of this law. The law has \nbeen in effect just a short period of time but more than 13,000 have \nbeen discharged because of this law which institutionalized \ndiscrimination against openly gay soldiers, sailors, marines, and \nairmen. I say ``openly gay.'' This wasn't the case. Some were suspect. \nThere was a long interview on Public Broadcasting this morning about a \nwoman who was discharged at age 22 because of someone reporting they \nhad seen her in a bar with another woman. We will never know how many \npeople; that is, capable men and women, were never offered patriotic \nservice. They could not because the law exposed them to career-ruining \ndiscrimination. We have the 13,000-plus, plus thousands of others who \nsaid there is no need to do this because I would have to live a lie.\n  The military's highest commanders and a vast majority of \nservicemembers agree our fighting force is better off knowing we will \nhave the best and brightest volunteers, regardless of sexual \norientation, race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. There is no place \nfor intolerance in our great Nation and certainly not in our Armed \nForces tasked with protecting them.\n  I am happy to say that today our military policies and our national \nvalues are in line. From today forward, no qualified man or woman \nwilling to fight for a nation founded on the principles of tolerance \nand equality will ever again be denied the right to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on Wednesday the House, we are told, will \nsend us a continuing resolution to fund the government through November \n18. I was disappointed to see the House shortchanged the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. We have been told specifically what they \nintend to do and it is a real shortchange, by failing to provide the \nfunding to adequately help Americans whose lives have been devastated \nby floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. It is staggering to understand \nthe depth of the concern people have.\n  Yesterday morning I received a call from Kent Conrad, Senator from \nNorth Dakota, who proceeded to explain to me about a city in North \nDakota by the name of Minot, a town of about 40,000 people. Twenty-five \npercent of the homes in Minot, ND, are underwater. Most of those \nunderwater are ruined forever. These are not big mansions. They are \nhomes people have lived in, sometimes for a very long period of time.\n  Yesterday I was speaking to Senator Hoeven, who certainly knows North \nDakota as well as anyone. He served as Governor there and is now in the \nSenate. We were talking about the flood. Of course, one of the things \npeople are saying is: Why didn't Congress and the President plan for \nall this? As Senator Hoeven described in some detail, how do you \nestimate something that has never, ever happened before? Not a 50-year \nflood took place in North Dakota, not a 100-year flood, not a 500-year \nflood--it is something that has never happened, ever. This in spite of \nthe fact that they built some dams, even some in Canada, to stop the \nflooding. It didn't matter, this was so immense. It had never happened \nbefore in North Dakota. A sparsely populated State has been devastated \nby these floods--natural, you say, but certainly unusual floods that \nhave ravaged that State.\n  That is not the only State. Many States have been hammered hard. Who \nwould ever have thought, a year ago, that a relatively small community, \nJoplin, MO, would be hit by almost 300-mile-an-hour winds. The winds \ndidn't just whip through, they roiled around there for such a time that \nthey basically destroyed that town.\n  There are many other examples of what has happened, being unable to \ndetermine what would happen in the future. Suffice it to say we \nprovided funds last week here in the Senate to help Americans whose \nlives had been devastated by floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other \nnatural calamities. In a bipartisan bill for FEMA and other agencies, \nwe passed that help disaster victims need--an additional $6.9 billion. \nThat is probably not enough, frankly. After the Appropriations \nCommittee did their work, reported the bill out, a bill of some $6 \nbillion, I asked the different subcommittees to find out what \nadditionally was needed. They came back with another $3 billion. We \npared that down because we wanted to keep within the agreement we had \nfrom the Deficit Reduction Act which set that at $7 billion, and we are \nslightly under that. That is why we came in with that figure.\n  That funding, $6.9 billion, while it does not give everyone \neverything, will help rebuild after several costly natural disasters, \nnot the least of which is Hurricane Irene.\n  Tomorrow when the Senate receives the House bill to fund the \ngovernment for 6 more weeks, we will amend it with the language the \nSenate passed, the Senate FEMA legislation. This year President Obama \nhas declared disasters in all but two States, and FEMA is quickly \nrunning out of money to help American families and communities recover.\n  I talked to Mr. Fugate, the head of FEMA, last Thursday. He said they \nhave enough money to last probably until September 25th. That is even \non a very narrow plane that they are working on. They have stopped the \nwork in Joplin, MO. They have stopped the work because of the \ndevastation that happened in the gulf previously. The only money they \nare spending now deals with Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene. \nThey have no more money. They are out of money. So it is desperate.\n  I know this amendment will enjoy the support of my Republican \ncolleagues as it did last week. We had 10 who stepped forward and it \nwas very important that they did that. Last week, a bipartisan group of \nSenators agreed that helping communities destroyed by natural disasters \nwas too important to let politics get in the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5732-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5732-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Americans have sent a message to Congress \nthat no issue is more important to them than jobs. But for Republicans, \njob creation is less important than slashing spending on initiatives \nthat create jobs and the Social Security and Medicare benefits seniors \nhave earned. Democrats believe we can reduce the deficit without \nabandoning job creation. We can make smart, strategic cuts that will \nnot further slow down our struggling economy, while protecting and \nadvancing initiatives that create jobs. That is why President Obama has \nreleased detailed proposals to create 2 million jobs now while reducing \nthe deficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade.\n  But many Republicans have criticized both proposals even before \nlooking at their substance. It seems they are more concerned with \nprotecting millionaires, billionaires, hedge fund managers, and private \njet owners than fighting for the middle class. They claim it is class \nwarfare to ask the wealthiest 400 Americans who made an average, these \n400, of $271 million each to pay the same tax rate as librarians, \npolice officers, air traffic controllers, and others--secretaries, as \nMr. Buffett talked about.\n  The truth is, Republicans are just defending the economic policies \nthat besieged the middle class for years. It is class warfare to ask \nmiddle-class Americans to get by on less while those same 400 Americans \nare paying less than 18 percent in their taxes, lower than the \nsecretaries and janitors who work for them.\n  Let me explain this as well as I can. We will do whatever it takes to \nprotect the middle class and seniors, even if it means the richest of \nthe rich in America have to contribute a little bit more than they do \nnow. We will fight for the policies that create American jobs even if \nit means CEOs and hedge fund managers making hundreds of millions of \ndollars every year have to contribute the same amount as teachers or \nfirefighters, whose salaries are a fraction the size of theirs. It is \nsimple fairness.\n  With 14 million Americans out of work, we have 14 million reasons to \nput job creation ahead of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. \nAs the economist and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said:\n\n       True patriotism isn't cheap. It's about taking on a fair \n     share of the burden of keeping America going.\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, everyone knows the top issue on the \nmind of most Americans right now is jobs. What I have said is that the \none thing we could all do right now to help spur job creation is to \npass the three free-trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South \nKorea. Republicans in Congress have been urging the President to pass \nthese agreements for nearly 3 years. Yet they have languished on his \ndesk for no good reason. It is time to send them up so we can act. At a \nmoment when 14 million Americans are looking for work, it is \nindefensible for the White House to demand a vote on trade adjustment \nassistance as a condition for action.\n  Still, I and others have agreed to allow it so we can finally move \nahead on these vital trade deals. It is my expectation, based on the \nunderstanding I have with the administration, that the President will \nstop dragging his feet soon and submit all three of them for a quick \napproval. At long last, U.S. businesses that want to expand here at \nhome but which have been held back by the President's refusal to act \nwill be able to compete on a level playing field in these markets, and \nit will create jobs in the process. These agreements, while helpful, \nare not enough.\n  In order to create the kind of jobs we need, we need more trade deals \nthan these three. That is why I have been a strong advocate for \ngranting this President the same trade promotion authority every other \nPresident has enjoyed since 1974. Also known as fast track, TPA creates \nexpedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade \nagreements that the administration negotiates with our trading \npartners. TPA has long had bipartisan support and led to numerous trade \nagreements with 17 new countries during the Bush administration, \nincluding the 3 we hope to consider shortly.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats and their union allies allowed TPA to expire \nin 2007. This President has made no effort whatsoever to revive it. \nWithout TPA, the United States will likely never agree to another deal. \nThe unions will make sure of that. We have seen what happens next. \nAfter the North American Free Trade Agreement passed in 1993, TPA \nexpired, and in the 8 years that followed the United States did \nnothing, while other countries moved ahead integrating themselves in \nthe global economy. We cannot let that happen again. We cannot miss \nmore opportunities to compete in foreign markets with U.S.-made \nproducts just because unions do not want to.\n  Consider this: According to the Business Roundtable, while our trade \nagenda has lapsed, the European Union is negotiating 16 trade \nagreements with 46 countries. Japan is negotiating 7 agreements with 38 \ncountries, and even China is negotiating 11 agreements with 18 \ncountries.\n  What about the United States? We have signed none since this \nadministration began, and we are actively negotiating only one, a pact \nthat will open opportunities to American businesses and workers across \nthe Pacific Rim. I and many of my colleagues and many of our allies \noverseas want to know what is the President's plan to enact that one \ndeal if he does not ask for, has not received, and does not even seem \nto want trade promotion authority; is he ready to watch all these \nopportunities vanish? We cannot allow these opportunities for American \njobs to simply drift away.\n  We must reauthorize TPA, along with TAA. Historically, TPA and TAA \nhave moved together; in 1974, when TPA was created; in 1988, when it \nwas reauthorized; and again in 2002, when TAA was expanded to its \ncurrent prestimulus levels. That is why I am offering an amendment that \nwill grant this President trade promotion authority through 2013. It is \nthe same term the Democrats are insisting we reauthorize trade \nadjustment assistance. My amendment builds into it the same \naccountability to Congress and the need to consult with Congress that \nprevious TPAs have had. It is based on legislation offered by a \nbipartisan pair of trade leaders, Senator Portman and Senator \nLieberman.\n  We are going to hear Democrats arguing we have not had enough time to \ncarefully consider this expansion of trade promotion authority and work \non the negotiating objectives we generally include in the bill. I would \nremind them I first called for TPA last May. Since that time, I have \nheard nothing from my Democratic colleagues or the White House about \ntheir interest in renewing this authority. There has been zero \noutreach. When I suggested I would be willing to support an extension \nof TAA if we could reauthorize TPA, there was nothing.\n  In my view, if the White House will not show leadership on this \nissue, if they are too worried about owning other free trade agreements \nor as being seen by some of their allies as promoting them too \naggressively, it is my view we ought to help them get there. That is \nwhy I am offering this amendment to show the world some in Congress are \nready to move forward and lower the barriers that keep American goods \nout of foreign countries and which American consumers all benefit from \nour integration into the world economy.\n  With 14 million Americans out of work and thousands of Americans \nlooking for opportunities to sell American-made goods around the world, \nwe cannot afford to wait, as we did on these three free-trade \nagreements, while the administration makes up its mind that American \njobs are more important than appeasing their union allies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5733-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank my friend of 40 years, the \nRepublican leader, for being here for these remarks I am about to make. \nI thank my colleague, Senator Corker, and several other of my \nRepublican colleagues for, on very short notice, coming to the Senate \nfloor for these brief remarks.\n  Next January, following the annual retreat of Republican Senators, I \nwill step down from the Senate Republican leadership. My colleagues \nhave elected me as Republican conference chairman three times, and I \nwill have completed 4 years or the equivalent of two 2-year terms at \nthat time. My reason for doing that is this, stepping down from the \nRepublican leadership will liberate me to spend more time trying to \nwork for results on issues I care the most about. That means stopping \nrunaway regulations, runaway spending, but it also means confronting \nthe timidity that allows health care spending to squeeze out support \nfor roads, support for research, support for scholarships, and other \ngovernment functions that make it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs.\n  I wish to do more to make the Senate a more effective place to \naddress serious issues. For 4 years in our caucus, my leadership job \nhas been this: to help the leader succeed, to help individual \nRepublicans succeed, to look for a consensus within our caucus, and to \nsuggest a message. I have enjoyed that. However, there are different \nways to offer leadership in the Senate, and I have concluded, after 9 \nyears, this is now the best way for me to make a contribution.\n  It boils down to this: Serving in this body, as each one of us knows, \nis a rare privilege. I am trying to make the best use of that time \nwhile I am here. For the same reason, I plan to step down in January \nfrom the leadership, I will not be a candidate for leadership in the \nnext Congress. However, I do intend to be more, not less, in the thick \nof resolving issues, and I do plan to run for reelection in the Senate \nin 2014.\n  These are serious times. Every American's job is on the line. The \nUnited\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nStates still produces about 23 percent of the world's wealth, even \nthough we only have about 5 percent of the world's people. All around \nthe world people are realizing there is nothing different about their \nbrains and our brains and their using their brain power to try to \nachieve the same kind of standard of living we have enjoyed in the \nUnited States.\n  As a result of this, some have predicted that within a decade, for \nthe first time since the 1870s, the United States will not be the \nworld's largest economy. They say China will be. My goal is to help \nkeep the United States of America the world's strongest economy.\n  There are two other matters that are relevant to the decision I am \nmaking that I would like to address. The first is this: When I first \nran for the Senate in 2002, I said to the people of Tennessee--and they \nwere not surprised by this--that I will serve with conservative \nprinciples and an independent attitude. I intend to continue to serve \nin the very same way.\n  I am a very Republican Republican. I grew up in the mountains of \nTennessee and still live there in a congressional district that has \nnever elected a Democrat to Congress since Abraham Lincoln was \nPresident of the United States. My great-grandfather was once asked \nabout his politics. He said: I am a Republican. I fought for the Union, \nand I vote like I shot.\n  I have been voted five times by Tennessee Republicans to serve in \npublic office. I have been elected three times by Senate Republicans as \nconference chair. If I could get a 100-percent Republican solution of \nany of our legislative issues, I would do it in a minute. I know the \nSenate usually requires 60 votes for a solution on serious issues, and \nwe simply cannot get that with only Republican votes or only Democratic \nvotes.\n  Second, by stepping down from the leadership, I expect to be more, \nnot less, aggressive on the issues. I look forward to that. The Senate \nwas created to be the place where the biggest issues producing the \nbiggest disagreements are argued out. I don't buy for 1 minute that \nthese disagreements create some sort of unhealthy lack of civility in \nthe Senate. I think those who believe the debates in our Senate are \nmore fractious than the debates in our political history simply have \nforgotten American history. They have forgotten what Adams and \nJefferson said of one another. They have forgotten that Vice President \nBurr killed former Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton. They have \nforgotten that Congressman Houston was walking down the streets of \nWashington one day, came across a Congressman from Ohio who had opposed \nAndrew Jackson's Indian policy and started caning him, for which he was \ncensured. They have forgotten there was a South Carolina Congressman \nwho came to the floor of the Senate and nearly killed, by hitting him \nwith a stick, a Senator from Massachusetts. They have forgotten that \nanother Senator from Massachusetts, named Henry Cabot Lodge, stood on \nthe floor and said of the President of the United States, Woodrow \nWilson: I hate that man. They forgot about Henry Clay's compromises and \nthe debates that were held during the Army-McCarthy days. What of the \nWatergate debates? What of the Vietnam debates?\n  The main difference today between the debates in Washington and the \ndebates in history are that, today, because we have so much media, \neverybody hears everything instantly. If one would notice, most of the \npeople who are shouting at each other on television or the radio or the \nInternet have never been elected to anything.\n  It would help if we in the Senate knew each other better across party \nlines. To suggest we should be more timid in debating the biggest \nissues before the American people would ignore the function of the \nSenate and would ignore our history. The truth is, the Senators debate \ndivisive issues with excessive civility.\n  I have enjoyed my 4 years in the Republican leadership. I thank my \ncolleagues for that privilege. I now look forward to spending more time \nworking with all Senators to achieve results on the issues I care about \nthe most--issues that I believe will help determine for our next \ngeneration what kind of economy we will have, what our standard of \nliving will be for our families, and what our national security will \nbe.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say to my friend of 40 years \nthat even though there are a number of colleagues on the Senate floor, \nI am confident we all agree this is not a eulogy in which we are about \nto engage. Really, I have a great sense of relief that my friend is \ngoing to run again in 2014 and continue to make an extraordinary \ncontribution to the Senate and to America.\n  When I first met Lamar he was at the White House. I had just come \nhere as a legislative assistant to a newly elected Senator. He had \nalready accomplished a lot. He had been elected Phi Beta Kappa at \nVanderbilt and graduated from New York University Law School. He had \nclerked for a well-known circuit judge, been involved in Howard Baker's \nfirst campaign, had helped him set up his first office, and that was \nbefore I met him.\n  Since I have met him, as many of my colleagues are already aware, it \nis hard to think of anybody--it is hard to think of anybody--who has \ndone more things well. He went home in 1970 and ran a successful \ncampaign for, I think, the first Republican Governor of Tennessee \nelected, certainly, since the Civil War. He ran for Governor himself in \na very bad year in 1974. It didn't work out too well. But one of the \nthings we know about our colleague Lamar is that he is pretty \npersistent. So he tried it again in 1978. He was elected Governor, \nreelected Governor in 1982--a spectacular record.\n  Then he did something very unusual. I remember knowing about it at \nthe time. I kept up with him since we had met years before when we were \nin Washington. He took his entire family and went to Australia for 6 \nmonths. He put the kids in school there and actually wrote a book \ncalled ``Six Months Off,'' which I read then. I don't know how many \nbooks Senator Alexander sold, but it was a fascinating review of \nbasically just taking a break, going somewhere else, doing something \nentirely new before getting back on the career treadmill that we, of \ncourse, knew he would do.\n  So once the Australian experience was over, this extraordinarily \naccomplished and diverse individual became president of the University \nof Tennessee. That was back when they used to play football, and then-\nPresident Bush 1 asked him to become Secretary of Education. So he was \na Cabinet member.\n  Oh, by the way, I think I left out that at his mother's insistence he \nbecame quite proficient at piano. He is a fabulous piano player and \nmusician. My mother let me quit. That was the only mistake she made in \nan otherwise perfect job of raising me. But Senator Alexander's mother, \nby insisting that he continue to take piano, gave him that dimension as \nwell.\n  So here we have a guy who has been Governor, president of his \nuniversity, a member of the Cabinet and, as if that were not enough, he \nwent into the private sector and started an extraordinarily successful \nbusiness, which did very well. I expect our colleague from Tennessee \nthought his public career was over, but then Fred Thompson decided he \nwanted to go do something else. All of a sudden he was in the Senate--\nnot just in the Senate but then became a leader in the Senate in a very \nshort period of time.\n  We have had an opportunity to get to know our colleague. It is hard \nto think of anybody more intelligent, more accomplished, as well as \nmore likeable than Lamar Alexander.\n  So I must say to my good friend from Tennessee, I am relieved he is \nnot leaving the Senate. This is not a eulogy, but it is an opportunity \nfor those of us who have known and admired the Senator from Tennessee \nfor a long time to just recount his extraordinary accomplishment during \na lifetime of public service. It has been my honor to be his friend, \nand I will continue to be his friend, and I am glad he will continue to \nbe our colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Republican leader. I am \ndeeply grateful for his comments, with one single exception. I have \ngreat confidence in Derek Dooley. He is a fine\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nfootball coach at the University of Tennessee. They are playing very \ngood football, and I intend to be at my usual seats at the Georgia game \nin 2 weeks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wish to say to my colleague I \ncertainly have enjoyed his comments, and I am excited for him. I sit \nvery close to him in the Senate, and I am with him a great deal. I do \nplan on keeping a cane out of the reach of my colleague for a few days.\n  I very much appreciate his service and leadership to the Republican \nParty in the Senate. I think in his position he has brought out the \nbest in all of us in the best way he could. I am excited for him. I \nlook at this as a great day for the Senate. It is a great day for our \ncountry. This is a great day for the State of Tennessee.\n  I can tell my colleague, based on the conversations we have had and \nthe way I know my colleague, the Senate is going to become very quickly \na more interesting place to serve. For all of us who have been \nconcerned about our lack of ability to solve our Nation's greatest \nproblems, I look at what the Senator has done today as a step in the \ndirection toward us being able as a body to more responsibly deal with \nthe pressing issues he outlined in his talk.\n  So I thank my colleague for having the courage to step down from a \nposition that many Republican Senators would love to have. I thank my \ncolleague for the way he serves our country. I thank him for the \nexample he has been to so many in his public service in our State and \nin our country, and I thank the Senator for being my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise today to echo the comments of \ncolleagues earlier about the contribution of Lamar Alexander, our \nfriend and colleague, as well as somebody who has had an impact not \njust on the State of Tennessee but on the United States of America. I \nthink one of the toughest things a Member of the Congress can do is to, \nNo. 1, step down from leadership, or, No. 2, voluntarily leave the \nbody.\n  I think it says more about Lamar Alexander than any comments that can \nbe made; that he understands where he is going, and I think he stated \nit very well. His contribution to the future of this country is what he \nis most concerned with, and that is why this country is blessed to have \nleaders such as he. We welcome him back into the ranks of the normal, \nthe general population of what has been the asylum of late. I hope \nLamar will be a great influence in our ability to get the body of \ndeliberative debate and participation back, and that is certainly his \nquest.\n  One of his passions, though, is education. I was shocked he didn't \nmention that in his litany of areas he would delve into. But I know \nearlier last week he and I and others introduced five reforms to K-12 \neducation.\n  When we talk about the future, whether it is Senator Alexander or \nmyself or others, we say the future of this country is conditional upon \nhow well we educate the next generation and how we make sure the next \ngeneration has the foundational knowledge they need to compete in a \n21st-century economy.\n  I think it is safe to say today our record is not good. Just 70 \npercent of our high school seniors graduate on time. Let me say that \nagain: 70 percent of our high school seniors will graduate on time. \nMany of those will never go back. They will not cross the goal line. In \ntoday's economy, their likelihood of being invited for a job interview \nis slim to zero.\n  We have Federal laws that require an employer to accept an \napplication from whoever walks in the door. However, when it gets down \nto the interview process, I can assure my colleagues that when \nemployers look at that resume and it doesn't have high school \ngraduation on it, they will certainly invite others who at least have \nthat threshold of education, if not further degrees. So I think we owe \nit to the next generation to be candid with them and tell them that \nthis is a minimum to have an opportunity for unlimited success.\n  If we ever get to a point that this is not about an opportunity of \nunlimited success, America will have changed greatly, and I think that \nis one of the passions Senator Alexander has. That is why he is so \ninvolved in issues such as education and why he is willing to sacrifice \nleadership for greater involvement in the policies.\n  In the bills we introduced last week, there were two that Lamar and I \ndid together. Let me share with my colleagues what those bills do.\n  Today, we have 97 authorized programs and 59 of them are funded. They \nare all funded individually. That means we make money available to a \nState and consequently to a school district. But their requirement to \naccess that money is they have to do exactly what we structured in the \nprogram. Many schools do not need that program, and they forego that \nmoney. Yet on the Senate floor we have debated frequently the need to \nget more resources into especially at-risk school districts to bolster \nthat foundational education.\n\n  We simply leave title I alone--it is targeted at a specific \npopulation--but we take all these other 59 programs that were funded \nlast year and meld them into two pots of money: One pot is designed for \nimprovement in teaching and learning; the other pot is designed for \nsafe and healthy student block grants.\n  You might say: Well, what if a school system does not need a fund for \nimprovement of teaching and learning, but they do need more money for \nsafe and healthy students? We allow 100 percent transferability between \nthose two areas. So if a school system purely needs teaching and \nlearning, and they want to focus on all of that, they will take that \nsafe and healthy student block grant money and put it over into \nteaching and learning. By the same token, for school systems that might \nnot see the benefits there, but they have a growing title I population, \nwe allow 100 percent transferability up to the title I program.\n  What are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to do what school \nsystems have told us year after year, decade after decade: Give us more \nflexibility. Let us decide what it is we need for our students to \nlearn. This is not about input. This is about output. This is about \nfocusing on how we improve education to where every child crosses that \ngoal line of success; that then the foundational knowledge base is so \ngreat that they are marketable in whatever direction our economy \ndecides to go.\n  The challenge for us--a lot like what Senator Alexander did today; he \ngave up power, a position in leadership--it means the Congress has to \ngive up the power of deciding exactly how every school system is going \nto implement programs. We have to be big enough to realize that the \none-size-fits-all structure from Washington does not work; that every \nschool system in America is a little bit unique; and, yes, we recognize \nthe fact that not every State is necessarily the best fiduciary of the \nfunds. This legislation only requires the States to siphon off 1.5 \npercent of the money. We are not going to build a palace or create a \nbureaucracy in State capitals in education off of these programs \nanymore. The intent is to take this money and put it into the \nclassroom; make sure the skills of the teacher are better; make sure, \nin fact, we are teaching teachers the right way to teach today.\n  I know we are not allowed to have electronics on the Senate floor. We \nhide them in our pockets real well. Kids are not allowed to have \nelectronics in school. They hide them in their pockets real well. When \nwe all leave where it is prohibited, this is the first thing we pull \nout of our pockets. We check our messages. We check sports scores. We \ncheck the news. Some of us old people make phone calls. But we have a \ngeneration that does nothing but text.\n  They are different than I am. I am a little bit different than Lamar. \nEvery generation is going to be different. But walk in a classroom \ntoday, and the first thing a teacher says is, Open your book to page \n44. Yet in between the covers of a book we have a generation that has \nnever delved into it. They have gone between the covers of their iPad, \ntheir Kindle, their PDA in their pockets. They read books, they play \ngames, but they do it in a different way.\n  It is time for us to recognize the fact that they learn differently \nbecause they communicate differently. Our ability is to take somebody \nmy age who still has a passion for the classroom and to change the way \nthey teach\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nthrough how we take them through continuous education. You see, \neffectiveness is, in part, connecting with the people we are trying to \nteach. If we do that in the right way, we are going to be successful.\n  I am not trying to create the model in Washington and to say to the \nStates and localities: Here is the only way you can do it. We are \ntrying to give them the flexibility of the money, and let them design \nthe programs they think will work. Again, with that, though, it \nrequires us to let go of that power of accountability. There is no \nreason for Washington to be accountable for every K-12 system in this \ncountry. We can be a partner, and I think the appropriate role is a \nfinancial partner. But as to accountability, I do not want to be in \nWashington determining whether a school is a pass or a fail or whether \na teacher is highly qualified. At best, it is arbitrary that we would \ncome up with something.\n  I want to empower communities, I want to empower parents, I want to \nempower the business community to say: You determine success and \nfailure. I want to empower principals and administrators: You determine \nwhether teachers are qualified.\n  I do not want to sit in Washington and define how pharmacists who \nhave lost their passion to work in a drugstore cannot shift over and \nbecome chemistry teachers in a high school because I have determined \nthey are not qualified to do it. Yet, day in and day out, I would go \ninto the pharmacy, and I would allow them to compound drugs for me. But \nthey cannot go in a classroom and explain to kids how that works or, \nmore importantly, how the interaction of compounds actually happens. \nThat is not my role. It is not our role. Our role is to encourage, by \nmaking sure the tools are there for those closest to the problem to \ncome up with solutions.\n  Well, what we did last week was a minor step in the right direction. \nI hope my colleagues will look at the legislation and will entertain \ncosponsoring it. I hope the Secretary of Education will look at it, \neven though we have had conversations that have continued since the \nfirst of the year, and we have a ranking member and a chairman engaged \nin the reauthorization of elementary and secondary education right now. \nI hope we influence their ability to get some type of an agreement.\n  But I think it is also important to understand that within the \ncontext of this issue are things that all of us know work. Let me give \nyou a couple examples.\n  Senator Kirk introduced a bill on expansion of charter schools. Why \nis that important? It is not important because we simply want to create \ncompetition with the public model. Charter schools have become an \nincubator of new ideas, of new ways to teach.\n  In Houston, TX, some former Teach for America students created KIPP \nAcademy and immediately had such success that they exported KIPP \nAcademy to New York. Their intent was to go from New York to Atlanta, \nand somehow they happened to stop in Northampton County, NC, in a \nlittle town called Gaston. It is in the middle of nowhere. But like all \nof North Carolina, it is beautiful. Its students are at risk. There is \nno economic driver in that county. But for some reason, KIPP stopped \nthere and created a school. Now we have taken underperforming students \nand through KIPP all of them excel.\n  I can take you to Charlotte, NC, where KIPP finally found a home and \nwas located next door to the elementary school. There is no way anybody \ncan claim they draw from a different population. They draw from the \nsame school neighborhood. Yet if we compare KIPP to the traditional \nelementary school next door, the performance of those students is off \nthe charts. At some point, we have to look at it and say: This model \nworks. How do we replicate it? But we are hung up in that one is public \nand one is charter.\n  Well, let me tell you, if we could replicate all of them to be KIPP, \nI would not care what we call them, and I would care less about how we \nfunded them. I would only care about the outcome, how many students \nhave the education foundation we need. In KIPP's case, it is almost 100 \npercent.\n  One big component of KIPP is the fact that they plug in to Teach for \nAmerica graduates, teachers who enter the system knowing that for a \nperiod of time their agreement is they are going into at-risk areas; \nthey are going in dealing with students ``somebody'' has deemed hard to \ncomplete the process. They go in with a different passion. They do not \ngo in surprised with the makeup of the students in their classroom on \nthe first day. They go in expecting this job to be tough, knowing their \ncreativity and their innovation is going to be challenged.\n\n  What we have found so far is that for those Teach for America \ngraduates, they end up staying longer than, in fact, the contractual \nperiod of time. They find it is much easier, but also much more \nsatisfying, to take the most at risk and to make sure they have that \neducation foundation that is needed.\n  That is incorporated into these bills. It is not just left to a \nsimple line item that, in this particular case, I think, has been \nzeroed out in the President's budget. But it can be incorporated into \nthis where we cannot only fund but we can expand Teach for America. \nWith Senator Kirk's bill we can expand what KIPP is doing. We can \nchallenge other individuals in other areas of the country to create \nKIPP-like models that work.\n  My challenge today is to assure all Members of the Senate and all \nAmericans. Our kids deserve us to try. We have been dictating from \nWashington for decades, and we continue to see 30-plus percent of our \nkids not reach that goal line. If they do, they do it in a way that is \nnot necessarily advantageous to their future.\n  If we want our country to continue to prosper, if we want to continue \nto be the innovator of the world, then we have to create a pool, a \ngeneration of kids, where 100 percent of them are prepared to compete. \nI think that is exactly why Senator Alexander stated he was willing to \ngive up the rein of leadership, to be more integrally involved in the \nsolutions that are crafted on this floor and in this Congress. That is \nwhy I said earlier, America has benefited because we have people such \nas Lamar Alexander here.\n  I am convinced that over the next several months, the reauthorization \nof elementary and secondary education will be front and center. I can \nonly ask my colleagues that they spend the time looking at some of the \nsuggestions that are on the table already. Authorship means nothing to \nme. It is outcome. Change the bill in a way that still stays within \nthis framework--I will be a cosponsor of anything. Start to make \nWashington more dominant in the control of how the money is used or \nwhat the programs look like--I have been there. We have tried that. Not \nonly does it not work, educators have told us it is increasingly more \nfrustrating for them and they will drop out of the system.\n  We have to create a system that is a magnet for talent, a magnet for \npeople who are as passionate as Lamar Alexander, something that gives \nus hope in the future that our kids have a better chance of succeeding \nthan they have had over the past few decades. I think the Empowering \nLocal Educational Decision Making Act of 2011 is a start, and I think \nthe next generation is worth the investment of time on the part of our \nMembers to look at this legislation and to get behind it.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FEMA FUNDING\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I would like to talk a little \nabout the upcoming FEMA bill. As I understand it, the House intends to \nsend us a CR with FEMA funding only at the level of $3.65 billion, \nwhich is a level that is completely inadequate to meet FEMA's needs. \nThey intend to put $1 billion in for 2011, which is more than is \nactually needed in 2011, but then they ask that it be paid for with \n$1.5 billion, which is not the way mathematics is supposed to work.\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\n  The real problem is that the total amount of $3.65 billion is \ninadequate given the terrible tragedies we have had over the last \nseveral months and years. We are still rebuilding from Katrina, the \nJoplin tornado was devastating, and, of course, the storms that hit the \nNortheast, including my beloved State of New York, were just awful. \nJust in New York State alone, it is estimated that cleanup costs will \nbe closer to $2 billion. So you can imagine that $3.65 billion is not \neven close to enough.\n  The good news is what we intend to do here under the leadership of \nMajority Leader Reid, which is to take the CR they send us and add to \nit the very bill that passed last Thursday night, which adds \napproximately $7 billion to FEMA. That is the amount of money that is \nneeded. It adds some money to the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, and other places the Governors of the States \nhave told us are needed. And given the fact that 10 Republicans voted \nfor it, we have every expectation that amendment will pass and we will \nsend it back to the House. So the House should understand there will be \na measure to adequately fund FEMA, and we will do that this week. \nAgain, we have every expectation that the 10 Republican Senators who \nvoted with us last Thursday night will cast the same vote on the same \nexact measures because the disasters in their States are not any less \nthis week than they were last week.\n\n\n                             Budget Deficit\n\n  I also wish to address the President's proposal on the budget \ndeficit, particularly on the tax side, and the many arguments being \ntossed around by many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Yesterday, the President put forward a blueprint for the joint \ncommittee to consider this fall, and it included a very commonsense \nprinciple; that is, those very few among us who are fortunate enough to \nmake over $1 million a year should pay the same effective tax rates at \nthe end of the day as middle-class households.\n  A number of Republicans rejected the President's plan before he even \nannounced it. As soon as it was suggested that we should ask the \nwealthiest few among us to pay their fair share, many on the other side \nbegan labeling it class warfare. Apparently, they think they can slap \nthat old label on the President's proposal and be done with it. But \ntheir refusal to address the proposal on the merits is revealing. They \nknow they will lose any argument about the policy itself because it \nmakes sense economically and because the American people support it. \nEven Republicans in the country--59 percent in a recent poll I saw--\nsupport the wealthiest among us paying a fair share and support not \ngiving them the continued Bush tax breaks at a time when we have record \ndeficits and we are asking everybody else to sacrifice.\n  This is, emphatically, not class warfare. It is not class warfare to \nfight for the middle class, that is for sure. It is not class warfare \nto say we need funding for roads and bridges and teachers and that the \nwealthiest among us should pay their fair share to do it. Let me ask a \nquestion, Madam President. Is it class warfare when Republicans \nadvocate tax cuts for the wealthy? Do we call that class warfare?\n  The debate about the progressivity of the Tax Code has existed for \nover 100 years in this country, and there are different policy \nprescriptions. Most Democrats and most Americans believe the wealthy \ndon't pay their fair share. That is not to begrudge the money they have \nmade. There are a lot of wealthy citizens in my State, and I am proud \nof them. I am proud they made a lot of money. And many of them believe \nthey should pay a fair share. It is not just Warren Buffett. It is not \nclass warfare to ask that. It is not class warfare to advocate tax cuts \nfor the wealthy or tax increases for the middle class. That is not \nclass warfare. To try to call it this name is unfair.\n  Let me make a second point. We have a need to do this. The President \nis not proposing things such as the Buffett rule out of vengeance. He \nsaid yesterday: ``It's not because anybody looks forward to the \nprospects of raising taxes or paying more taxes.'' But we do have a \nconsensus that has been reached here--it is one of the few--that we \nshould reduce the deficit. We all know we have to. There are two ways \nto do it. One is by cutting spending, and when we cut spending, it \nhurts middle-class citizens. Middle-class citizens need help to pay for \ncollege; wealthy people don't. So if you cut student loans or Pell \ngrants or Stafford loans that go to the middle class, it is not going \nto affect wealthy citizens--they can afford college themselves--but it \ndoes affect the middle class. When you cut Medicare, it doesn't hurt \nthe wealthy. They can afford any doctor or hospital they want. God \nbless them. They have earned their money, and they deserve that. We \ndon't have a system that mandates everyone must have the same. But it \nsure hurts the middle class.\n  So the bottom line is very simple: If everyone has to pay their fair \nshare so we can get the deficit down, the only way the wealthy pay \ntheir fair share is by making sure their tax rates are at least the \nsame as average Americans, and perhaps they should be a little bit \nhigher. So there is a choice.\n  We don't do this because we want to raise taxes and certainly not \nbecause we think the wealthy have gotten an unfair advantage. That is a \ndifferent argument, and I don't believe that. I am proud when New \nYorkers or Americans climb the ladder and make a lot of money due to \nhard work and their ideas. We do it because we don't want to lay off \nmore teachers, because we don't want to see our infrastructure crumble, \nbecause we don't want to say we can't create jobs, and yet we don't \nwant to increase deficit spending. If we want to keep the deficit down \nbut keep our schools good and our infrastructure good and our basic \nresearch good, the only way to do it is to ask the wealthy to pay a \nfair share. That is why we do it. And that is not class warfare; that \nis a policy debate which we welcome.\n\n  To sum up that point, either we ask big oil companies to give up \nspecial subsidies or we gut education or medical research. Either we \nask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share or we will have to \nask seniors to pay more for Medicare. We can't do both if we want to \nkeep the deficit in line. America's middle class knows this. We know \ntheir median income is declining. We know the only place on the \neconomic spectrum where incomes are going up is at the high end, and we \nknow the right policy is to make those folks at the high end pay their \nfair share.\n  My colleagues are in for a rude awakening. I have talked to a couple \nof the people who study the polling data and what the average American \nthinks. And let me tell you, they think the phrase ``class warfare'' \nmeans war on the middle class. They think it means the wealthy get away \nwith what they do not. So when our colleagues talk about class warfare, \nmaybe it resonates with a few on the hard right among the very wealthy \nwho don't want to pay any taxes at all--and Lord knows we have heard \nenough from them in this place--but to the middle class, it means the \nmiddle class is being beleaguered, not being helped, and even being \nattacked by circumstances beyond their control. So when we say the \nwealthiest should pay their fair share, middle-class Americans will not \nsee that as class warfare. They will not. They will understand what we \nare doing.\n  I am so glad the President has decided to take this fight to the \nAmerican people. It is a fight where we are on their side. That is what \nall my experience shows when I go around New York, and that is what the \npolling data shows. We are doing what is right for the future of this \ncountry and for our children and grandchildren.\n  So let's have the debate and let's dispel this idea that simply \nbecause we want the wealthy to pay a fair share, we dislike them and it \nis class warfare, that it is negative toward them. It is not. It is the \nright way for all Americans to make the pie grow in America and not \nhave the various parts of America fight with one another because \nMedicare is being cut, because teachers are being cut and the deficit \nis going up and hurting our children and grandchildren.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Let me thank my colleague from New York for his statement \nabout the challenges we face. I have been involved for over 1\\1/2\\ \nyears in deficit reduction talks on a bipartisan basis with the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission, the Gang of 6, now the Gang of 38--I believe was \nthe last number of Democratic and Republican Senators who have publicly \nstated they are willing to move forward in a process based on the \nprinciples of the Bowles-Simpson Commission.\n  At a time when most Americans have given up hope that Congress will \never work on a bipartisan basis to solve our problems, I hope our \neffort will be viewed as positive and helpful to the supercommittee's \nwork. We are doing everything we can to make sure they are successful \nand they have a very difficult assignment and a difficult timetable.\n  In the meantime, though, I understand, as the Senator from New York, \nmy colleague who spoke earlier, that if we are serious about deficit \nreduction, it not only must involve cuts in spending, but it also must \ninvolve revenue and a serious look at the future of entitlement \nprograms.\n  Currently, Social Security untouched will pay every promised benefit \nfor the next 25 years with a cost-of-living adjustment; then it runs \ninto trouble--a 22 percent cut in benefits, if we don't do something. \nThe same cannot be said for Medicare. As strong as it is, as important \nas it is, it has about 12 years of solvency before we have to do \nsomething significant. Medicaid, which is a very critical health \ninsurance program for millions of Americans, is threatened by State \nrevenue declines and all the problems we have in Washington with our \nown deficit.\n  So these three entitlement programs need to be viewed in an honest \ncontext to keep them strong, to protect the basic benefit structure \nthat underlies each of these bills and laws, and we need to do that as \nwell. We need to put it all on the table. It is spending cuts. It is \nrevenue. It is entitlement reform. It all has to come together. When \nthe President says the wealthiest among us should be willing to help us \nthrough this crisis by sharing part of the burden, that is not \nunreasonable.\n  I have yet to hear the Republican plan for getting this economy \nmoving forward. It appears they have no plan and are dedicated only to \nprotecting those with the highest incomes in America. That is not a \nrecipe for success. It may be somebody's ideas of a campaign platform, \nbut it isn't a platform to build the economy.\n  I also heard this morning when the Republican leader came to the \nfloor, Senator McConnell, and talked about the need to pass trade \nagreements. I voted for trade agreements. I believe the U.S. workers \nand businesses can compete in this world successfully if the rules are \nfair and we are given a chance with the markets, and I voted for trade \nagreements in the past.\n  The Senator from Kentucky asked for us to pass more as soon as \npossible, but he did say something which caught my attention:\n\n       In a moment when 14 million Americans are looking for \n     work--\n\n  Senator McConnell said--\n\n     it is indefensible for the White House to demand a vote on \n     trade adjustment assistance as a condition for action.\n\n  I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that. Trade adjustment \nassistance is designed to put people who have lost their job because of \ntrade agreements back to work. So it is totally defensible, totally \nconsistent, and an important part of economic recovery.\n  The Alliance for American Manufacturing released a report this \nmorning that 2.8 million jobs have been lost or displaced in America \nbetween 2001 and 2010 due to our growing trade deficit with China--2.8 \nmillion jobs. As we speak about expanding trade adjustment assistance \nso those who have lost their jobs to nonfree-trade agreement countries \nsuch as India and China, we are talking about putting Americans back to \nwork. This should not be viewed as an obstacle, a diversion or \ninconsistent with economic recovery.\n  I couldn't follow the logic of the Senate Republican leader this \nmorning when he was talking about trade adjustment assistance being \nindefensible at a time of high unemployment. It is totally defensible, \ntotally consistent with putting Americans back to work.\n  For the record, since 2009, trade adjustment assistance has provided \nassistance to 447,235 workers in America who have been displaced due to \ntrade agreements. It helps their families with income, with health \ncare, with opportunities for retraining and education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5738-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5738-S5739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was 10 years ago when I introduced \nthe DREAM Act. It is an important piece of legislation for thousands of \npeople who are living in America who are literally without status, \nwithout a country.\n  The DREAM Act says, if one came to the United States as a child, if \nthey are a long-term U.S. resident, if they have good moral character, \nif they have graduated from high school and they are prepared to \ncomplete 2 years of college or enlist in our military, we will give \nthem a chance to be legal in America. That is what it says.\n  The young people who are affected by it are many times people who \nhave never known another country in their lives. They got up at school, \nas Senator Menendez has said so artfully, they pledged allegiance to \nthe only flag they have ever known. They sing the only national anthem \nthey have ever known. They speak English and want a future in America. \nYet they have no country. Because their parents brought them to this \ncountry as children, because their parents did not file the necessary \npapers, they are without a country and without a future. The DREAM Act \ngives them a chance--a chance to excel and prove they can make this a \nbetter nation.\n  The Obama administration recently made an announcement that I think \nis not only the right thing to do but paves the way for us to give \nthese young people a chance.\n  We think we have 10 million undocumented people in America, and it is \nvery clear the Department of Homeland Security is not going to deport \n10 million people--that is physically impossible--nor should we. I \ncertainly would be opposed to that notion. But what they are trying to \ndo is to remove those people from America who are undocumented who pose \na threat to our Nation.\n  They have been criticized by some. The deportations under the Obama \nadministration are even higher than the Bush administration. They have \ntried to go after those with criminal records and those who are not \ngoing to be a benefit to the United States, and I think that is the \nright approach to use. But they said recently that they were going to \nmake it clear that those eligible for the DREAM Act, these young \npeople, of good moral character, graduates of high school, and those \nwho are pursuing college degrees, are not going to be their targets. \nThey have limited resources. They are going after the people who can \nthreaten our country, those whom we don't want in the United States. I \nthink that was the right thing to do, and I think that was a policy \nconsistent with keeping America strong and building for America's \nfuture. But we need to do more.\n  In addition to having a sensible policy when it comes to deportation, \nwe need a sensible immigration policy, and I think it starts with the \nDREAM Act.\n  I have come to the floor many times and told the stories about the \nyoung people who would be affected by the DREAM Act. Let me tell you \ntwo stories this morning that I think are illustrative of why this is \nmorally important and important for us as a nation to consider as \nquickly as possible.\n  This wonderful young lady whom I have met is named Mandeep Chahal. \nShe was brought to the United States from India 14 years ago, when she \nwas 6 years old. Today, Mandeep is 20. She is an academic all-star. She \nis an honors premed student at the University of California, Davis, \nwhere she is majoring in neurology, physiology, and behavior.\n  Mandeep has also been dedicated to public service. In high school, \nshe helped to found an organization known as One Dollar for Life, for \npoverty relief around the world. She was voted\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nthe member of her class ``most likely to save the world.'' At her \ncollege, Mandeep is the copresident of STAND, an antigenocide group.\n  Mandeep has so much to offer America. But, unfortunately, she was \nplaced in deportation proceedings earlier this year. Mandeep and her \nfriends responded the way many young people do today--they went to \nFacebook and asked for help.\n  The response was amazing: 20,000 people sent faxes to the Department \nof Homeland Security to save this young lady from deportation. On the \nday she was scheduled to be deported, she was granted a 1-year stay.\n  Her first thought was to try to prevent other people from going \nthrough what she had just experienced. So just 1 week after her \ndeportation was suspended, she came to the U.S. Capitol, where I had an \nopportunity to meet her. She spoke publicly about her experience, and \nshe called for the deportations of all DREAM Act students to be \nsuspended.\n  I met her while she was here and asked her to explain to me why she \nwants to stay. She said: ``I will send you a letter,'' and she did. \nHere is what it said:\n\n       I have spent years in the United States, and consider it my \n     only home. My family, friends, and future are in the United \n     States, which is where I belong. My dream is to become a \n     pediatrician so I can treat the most helpless and innocent \n     among us. I hope to serve families in low income communities \n     who are otherwise unable to afford medical care. I wish to \n     remain in the United States so that I can continue to make a \n     positive difference and give back to the community that has \n     given me so much.\n\n  Would America be better off if we deported Mandeep Chahal back to \nIndia? I don't think so. She left that country when she was 6 years \nold. In her heart, she is an American. She just wants a chance to prove \nit and to make this a better nation.\n  Let me introduce to you one other person whom I have also met, \nanother wonderful story.\n  Fannie Martinez, brought to the United States from Mexico 9 years ago \nwhen she was 13. She lives in Addison, in the State of Illinois, a \nstraight A student in high school. Earlier this year, she graduated \nsumma cum laude at Dominican University in River Forest, IL, with a \nmajor in sociology. This month she is beginning to work on a master's \ndegree at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.\n  Keep in mind, these students who are excelling get no help--none--\nfrom the Federal Government. If we think college is a burden now for \nthose who borrow the money or are given grants, most of these students \nhave to earn the money if they are going to go through school.\n  Let me tell you something else about Fannie Martinez. She is married \nto David Martinez, who has served in the U.S. Army Reserves for the \nlast 8 years. Here is a picture of the two of them together. David is \ncurrently deployed to Afghanistan, putting his life on the line for our \ncountry. Yet his worry is not just the enemy in Afghanistan. His worry \nis that his wife Fannie is going to be deported while he is serving \noverseas.\n  Fannie sent me a letter, and here is what she said about her \nsituation:\n\n       My husband is constantly worried about my status in this \n     country. He knows that I am always at risk of being placed in \n     deportation proceedings and he is afraid of not having his \n     wife with him once he returns from Afghanistan. The passage \n     of the DREAM Act will give me the confidence to live without \n     fear and frustration. It will allow me and my husband to plan \n     our future without having to deal with the possibility of my \n     deportation and my lack of opportunities. I care about my \n     community--\n\n  Fannie wrote--\n\n     and I know I can help improve society if I am allowed to live \n     in the U.S. and am given lawful permanent residence.\n\n  David Martinez, her husband, is willing to give his life for our \ncountry. We should give him and his wife Fannie a chance to pursue \ntheir dreams--the American dream.\n  I don't know that I have ever dealt with an issue that has meant so \nmuch to me personally because there isn't a place I go in America--\nanywhere--that I don't have some young person come up and look me in \nthe eye and say: I am a DREAMer. I am counting on you.\n  They are counting not just on me, but they are counting on the \nSenate, they are counting on the Congress, they are counting on our \ngovernment and our Nation to step forward and realize this is the \nmorally right thing to do and that these dynamic, wonderful young \npeople will make this a better nation.\n  I urge my colleagues, please, put partisanship aside, support the \nDREAM Act. It is the right thing to do for the future of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the amendment \nthe majority leader just called up. The Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram in particular is what I will focus on in my remarks. I want to, \nfirst of all, thank the majority leader for his leadership on this \nissue, helping us get started today. I am particularly grateful for the \nstrong leadership Chairman Baucus has provided, the chairman of our \nFinance Committee. I thank him and his staff for their tireless \nefforts, not just leading up to today but over a long period of time. \nHe has been such a strong advocate for this program.\n  For many months Chairman Baucus has led the charge to assure that a \nstrong Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is reinstated because it is \nimportant public policy for our workers, to get them retrained and to \nmake sure they have the skills needed to compete in such a tough \neconomy. I appreciate his work.\n  I also appreciate Chairman Baucus's work for many years fighting for \nworkers, especially when their jobs are at risk, their livelihoods and \ntheir families' economic security. I thank Chairman Baucus and so many \nothers. My colleague Senator Brown of Ohio has been a tremendous leader \non this issue as well.\n  One thing we all understand, whether we are Democrats or Republicans \nor Independents, is that we are still in the midst, still in the grip \nof a jobs crisis all across the country. It knows no geographic \nboundaries, it knows no party. People are worried, concerned that their \njobs will continually be at risk. Some, of course, have already lost \ntheir jobs--almost 14\\1/2\\ million Americans at last count.\n  In the midst of that crisis, it is critically important that we take \nthe steps here to make sure those who want to get back into the \nworkforce, those who want to improve their skills or be retrained in \nsome way or another, have that opportunity. We know in the next couple \nof weeks the Congress will be taking up free trade agreements. But \nbefore we do that, before we begin the debate, before we consider those \nagreements, we have to make sure our workers have the protections they \nneed to deal with the ravages of unfair foreign competition.\n  There are lots of ways to talk about this program and this issue. \nSome of them, frankly, get a little academic. The best way for me to \nunderstand the importance of trade adjustment assistance is very much \nconsistent with the recent and unfortunate economic history of my home \nState of Pennsylvania. In our Commonwealth--by way of one example, but \nit is the best example I can cite because of the numbers of workers \naffected--in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1970s and 1980s, \nin a short period of time, in less than a decade, we had tens of \nthousands of steelworkers lose their jobs. These were folks who worked \nin steel mills, not just for a couple of years but in many instances \ndecades. They would graduate from high school, go into the steel mill \nand be virtually guaranteed of a job for the rest of their lives--a \ngood job with good benefits on which they could support their families.\n  Then we know what happened to those workers and that industry. A lot \nof their jobs were destroyed in the 1970s and 1980s because of the \ndecline of the steel industry. It is at times such as that, when \nsomeone who has worked their whole life and put all of their energies \ninto a job and that job goes away in a matter of weeks or months or a \nfew short years, we have to make sure we are there for them at that \nmoment. One of the ways we can be there for them is with trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  I and every Member of the Senate could point to other examples as \nwell, but I remember that horrific history in Pennsylvania where \nfamilies were destroyed because of the loss of a job.\n  Our trade policies have hit a lot of American workers very hard. \nEspecially today we are seeing that. I mentioned Pennsylvania's \nmanufacturing jobs as an example. According to an analysis by the Joint \nEconomic Committee, of which I am the chairman, from 1997 to 2010--just \n13 years--manufacturing went from 16.4 percent of the gross State \nproduct of Pennsylvania down to 12.1 percent. In 13 years, a short \nperiod of time, there was that kind of decline in manufacturing jobs, \nfrom roughly 16.5 to 12. In total, the job loss in Pennsylvania \nmanufacturing was nearly 300,000 good-paying jobs.\n  While trade adjustment assistance cannot bring those jobs back, we \ncan take steps to help those workers in a tough time as they transition \nto new employment, to new skills and to new opportunities. Many \ndisplaced workers need considerable training to reenter the labor \nmarket. Imagine if any one of us did the same job for years or decades \nand then had to turn on a dime to adjust to the difficulties in the \neconomy. It takes a while. According to a report by the Joint Economic \nCommittee as well, many of these folks who have lost their jobs are \nmuch older than the rest of the workforce. They need to gain a number \nof skills. Fifty-seven percent of current participants in the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program are 45 years of age or older--57 percent. \nTrade adjustment assistance can better address the needs of these \ndisplaced workers by requiring training and giving additional time for \nworkers to gain the skills necessary to reenter the workforce to \nprepare to compete in a tough economy, in a world economy.\n  We know these programs work. We know, based upon the JEC report I \ncited earlier, 53 percent of those who participated in Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Programs were reemployed within 3 months; 53 percent were \nreemployed after 3 months after leaving the program itself. These \nparticipants also\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nfound lasting employment, with 80 percent of those workers employed \nwithin the first 3 months remaining employed by an additional 6 months.\n  We know that in 2009, several reforms were made to the program to \nreflect the realities of the modern workforce and the modern labor \nmarket. The amendment I offer today with my colleague Senator Brown of \nOhio would reinstate these reforms, including the following, by way of \nan economic summary: No. 1, providing trade adjustment assistance \nbenefits to service sector workers; No. 2, covering workers whose firms \nshift production to non-free-trade agreement partner countries--for \nexample, China and India. We hear a lot of people talking around here \nabout how we have to compete with China and India and keep our workers \nat a high skill level to do that. This is one way to do that. No. 3, \nfinally, increasing the health care tax credit subsidy to 72.5 percent \nand hereby addressing one of the most significant costs for those \nwithout a job, the cost of health insurance.\n  We all know, and I know firsthand, the benefits of a strong trade \nadjustment assistance program based upon what has happened in \nPennsylvania over many years.\n  According to the Department of Labor, from May of 2009 through June \nof 2011--a little more than 2 years--nearly 10,000 additional workers \nqualified for assistance due to these essential reforms in \nPennsylvania. So the reforms we made in 2009 have helped nearly 10,000 \nworkers in Pennsylvania. If you look at it nationwide, 185,783 \nadditional workers were certified for TAA participation because of \nthose reforms. In total, trade adjustment assistance has assisted \nnearly half a million people over this time period. Our action this \nweek will ensure that thousands of American workers will be able to \ncount on retraining and other support if they lose their job through no \nfault of their own.\n  More and more jobs--and we all know this but it bears repeating--have \nbeen sent overseas, leaving workers out in the cold. Nothing they did \nhas caused outsourcing of their job, and yet they are left with the \nconsequences and their families suffer with those same consequences. To \nget jobs in new industries, workers need new skills. They need to be \nretrained and introduced to new skills. Trade adjustment assistance \nhelps those workers hurt by foreign trade get back to work, while also \nensuring workers have a skilled workforce at the same time.\n  Finally, let me urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. \nTrade adjustment assistance has a long and proud history of bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, and I hope we can continue that with this \namendment and with this work. Those who have been affected by this know \nthis story better than I or better than any of us, and it is about time \nwe stood with those workers when they and their families are suffering.\n  I would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following my \nremarks, if it is all right with the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nthe former Trade Representative, the other distinguished Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Portman, be allowed to give his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I apologize to Senator Brown, but Senator Portman was \npromised he would be able to speak at 11:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thought Senator Hatch said that the senior \nSenator from Ohio, then the junior Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The UC request is for the Senator from Utah, \nthe junior Senator from Ohio, then the senior Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I didn't understand that from my conversations, \nbut I do not object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the TAA amendment offered \nby my good friend and colleague from Montana, Chairman Baucus. Before I \nget into the specifics, I think it is important to put this debate in \ncontext. For years I have been working to ensure that our pending trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea receive fair \nconsideration in the Senate. Unfortunately, while I worked to get these \nagreements approved, others placed obstacles in the way. As a result, \ndays, weeks, and months passed. Eventually those months turned into \nyears. Now 4 years later, we are taking out the sixth renewal of trade \nadjustment assistance in the time these trade agreements languished. To \nme, it is highly ironic that we not only passed but expanded \nlegislation to help workers who are allegedly harmed by trade \nagreements five times over the last 4 years, while we have yet to pass \na single trade agreement.\n  This March President Obama made himself perfectly clear: Unless \nCongress agreed to spend more money for this pet trade priority, he \nwould never send a trade agreement to Congress and U.S. workers would \nnever benefit from these agreements. Basically, the President held U.S. \nexporters hostage while he squeezed more spending out of Congress.\n  Despite my deep disappointment in the President's failure to make \nthese agreements a priority, I am pleased we are having this debate \ntoday. Earlier this summer the administration tried to jam the domestic \nspending program into the Korea Free Trade Agreement implementing bill. \nI strongly opposed this move. I believe it violated longstanding trade \nrules and seriously jeopardized approval of the South Korea agreement.\n  I strongly encouraged the White House to reconsider so we could have \na robust debate with TAA considered solely on its merits. After all, if \nthere is such a strong bipartisan support for the program, it should \nnot be shielded from a debate and vote in an open forum. It appears the \nadministration realized their position was untenable in the face of \nunequivocal Republican opposition. Thankfully they chose to heed my \nadvice and today we have an opportunity to consider and fully debate \nTAA.\n  If TAA passes the Senate, it should remove what we hope is the last \nobstacle the President and his party placed in front of FTAs. We will \nsee. To date there is little evidence that the President is finally \nready to step up to the plate. It has not been for lack of effort on \nour part. House leadership made it clear that TAA will be considered in \ntandem with the FTAs, as the President requested. Chairman Camp worked \nwith Senator Baucus to develop a substantive deal on TAA, as the \nPresident requested. Despite my deep reservations about the program, a \nnumber of my Republican Senate colleagues stepped up in support of the \nTAA compromise negotiated by Chairman Baucus and Chairman Camp and even \nput their assurance in writing to support TAA. Before the August work \nperiod, Senators McConnell and Reid articulated a process for \nconsideration of TAA and the FTAs, as the President agreed or \nrequested.\n  Still the administration refuses to provide any real assurance that \nit will actually send the pending free trade agreements to Congress for \na vote. I am very disappointed we still have not heard definitively \nfrom the White House that they will send up the three FTAs. As for the \ntrade adjustment assistance amendment before us today, I wish to \nsummarize for my colleagues my concerns with the proposed expanded \nprogram, and my objections to additional domestic spending for this \nprogram at a time of immense budget difficulties.\n  First, there is little evidence that the TAA Programs actually work. \nIn fact, the opposite is true. Recent studies by professors at American \nUniversity have found that the TAA program:\n\n       . . . has no discernible impact on the employment outcome \n     of the participants.\n\n  If that is the case, I cannot understand why we would expand this \nineffective program.\n  This summer I was surprised to learn from an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal that the Department of Labor is 4 years late on \nproducing a report to Congress intended to demonstrate that the \nnumerous Trade Adjustment Assistance Programs actually improve the \nemployment outcome for TAA participants. Yet today we are considering \nan amendment to not only reauthorize the program for 3 years but to \nmake many of the benefits retroactive. Before we authorize $1 billion \nmore in\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\ntaxpayer spending, shouldn't we know if the program actually improves \nthe job prospects for TAA beneficiaries?\n  My friend and colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, has made it a \npriority to identify and eliminate wasteful government programs. In his \nfirst report on the subject, the Government Accountability Office \nidentified dozens of programs without any identifiable metrics on \nwhether they actually succeeded in their mission. At a time of crushing \nbudget deficits and increasing debt, Congress could easily start by \neliminating these programs that have no proven track record of success \nand, in my opinion, we would have to put TAA at the top of that list. \nConsider that we are still waiting on the report from the Department of \nLabor on TAA's efficacy. I suspect if the facts and data clearly \ndemonstrated benefits to workers participating in the TAA Programs, the \nreport would have been issued years ago. I am sure this report will be \nissued, but only after TAA has been passed. I cannot support increasing \nfunding for a program without any real evidence that it works. Some \nwill argue more people are using the program, therefore it must be \nworking. I strongly reject that argument. Spending more money and \ncertifying more workers does not mean a program is succeeding. It \nsimply means the program is expanding, and that is my second concern. \nLike many Federal Government programs, this domestic spending program \ncontinues to grow and grow. TAA money now goes to farmers, firms, \ncommunity colleges, and service workers. Even more troubling, the \ncritical nexus between job loss caused by trade agreements and TAA \neligibility has been jettisoned. Today all workers who lose their jobs \nallegedly due to ``globalization'' could be eligible. As the global \neconomy and global supply chains become more integrated, I suspect the \npotential number of beneficiaries and the cost to the U.S. taxpayer \nwill grow enormously.\n\n  Third, at a time when we need to severely constrain Federal spending, \nthis program increases it. In 2009, TAA was significantly expanded as \npart of the President's failed stimulus bill. Most of those increased \ncosts are included in the TAA amendment before us today, but there may \nbe additional hidden costs. Because the income support and the health \ncoverage tax credit are entitlements, there is no cap on future \nspending. Although the health coverage tax credits are to expire when \nObamaCare goes into full effect, I have serious doubts that they \nactually will. History shows again and again it is much easier to \ncreate an entitlement than to end one.\n  As I said, I suspect this program, like most Federal programs, will \ncost more than expected, especially after unemployment insurance \nreturns to its traditional 26-week level, which will consequently \nincrease the use of trade reallocation allowances and increase the TAA \nProgram's cost.\n  Fourth, the program is fundamentally unfair. Suppose one of our \nfellow Americans loses their job or his job because their factory burns \ndown, another loses their job because his or her company could not \ncompete with a domestic competitor, and a third loses his or her job \nbecause of foreign competition. How can we tell two of our fellow \nAmericans ``tough luck''? Two can only use the general job training and \nunemployment insurance programs while the third worker is provided with \na host of more training, income support, and health care benefits. This \ndoes not seem right to me. Why are we picking winners and losers \namongst the other 14 million Americans looking for work?\n  I am also troubled that although union workers are less than 7 \npercent of the private sector workforce, union workers receive over a \nthird of TAA certifications. I do not see why we should support this \nvicious cycle. Unions drive industry after industry into bankruptcy by \ninsisting on restrictive work rules and overly generous compensation \nand benefits plans, and the taxpayer gets to clean up the mess by \nproviding the now unemployed workers with a new set of benefits far \nmore generous than those received by others. Unfortunately, encouraging \nvicious cycles appears to be an objective to this administration when \nit comes to TAA.\n  Let me share with you another one. By now most of you have heard of a \ncompany called Solyndra. It was held up by the President and his \nadministration as an example of the wonders of the stimulus and its \nability to transform taxpayer dollars into green jobs. Here is how \nPresident Obama described it:\n\n       And we can see the positive impacts right here at Solyndra. \n     Less than a year ago, we were standing on what was an empty \n     lot. But through the Recovery Act, this company received a \n     loan to expand its operations. This new factory is the result \n     of those loans.\n\n  Well, the President was right about that. The new factory was a \nresult of the taxpayer-provided loans. According to the Wall Street \nJournal, those very same taxpayer loan guarantees also were a prime \ncause of Solyndra's bankruptcy. The ``taxpayer dollars to create green \njobs'' alchemy worked about as well as medieval attempts to turn lead \nto gold.\n  That is not the end of the story. To ensure the circle of taxpayer \nlosses remains unbroken, the former Solyndra employees have now applied \nfor trade adjustment assistance. That is right. As reported first by \nAmericans for Limited Government, and then confirmed by Investors \nBusiness Daily, Solyndra employees have applied to the Department of \nLabor for trade adjustment assistance.\n  To recap, the administration provides loan guarantees to a failing \ncompany and in the process saddles the taxpayer with over $\\1/2\\ \nbillion in potential liability. These same loan guarantees precipitate \nthe demise of said company, and this, in turn, justifies the receipt of \nnew taxpayer-funded benefits for the now unemployed workers, benefits \nthat go beyond and cost far more than those the other unemployed people \nin this country receive.\n  The administration likes to talk about the multiplier effect of new \nFederal spending, but I don't think this is what they had in mind. For \neach initial wasted taxpayer dollar, the government multiplies the \nlosses and manages to waste another quarter. Solyndra tried to make \nsolar panels but ran up their costs far higher than even domestic \ncompetitors. Ultimately, with costs above the competition, the company \nfailed. Of course, the failure was blamed on China. If you cannot even \noutcompete U.S. companies, it wasn't foreign competition that ruined \nyour business, it was simply a failed business model.\n  During our hearing on the South Korea Trade Agreement, Deputy U.S. \nTrade Representative Marantis testified that the purpose of the TAA \nProgram is to help workers manage the transition to globalization and \nhelp workers train to be able to take advantage of the opportunities \npresented in the new economy.\n  Well, according to President Obama and Vice President Biden, green \njobs such as those found at Solyndra were supposed to be the jobs of \nthe new economy. Now that the new economy venture failed, those very \nsame workers are going to be retrained, at taxpayers' expense, for \nother jobs in the new economy. Government, under the President's green \nagenda, picks winners and losers and then pays off the losers when it \nmakes the wrong picks. Pardon the American taxpayer for jumping to the \nconclusion that this plan doesn't make sense.\n  Let's not forget that a handful of States receive the lion's share of \nTAA money. Again, this is unfair on its face and represents a distorted \nallocation of Federal resources.\n  President Reagan did not graduate from an Ivy League college and he \nwas not the editor of any law review, but the man understood how the \neconomy grows and what types of programs waste precious government \nresources. This was his assessment of TAA:\n\n       The purpose of TAA is to help these workers find jobs in \n     growing sectors of our economy. There's nothing wrong with \n     that, but because these benefits are paid out on top of \n     normal unemployment benefits, we wind up paying greater \n     benefits to those who lose their jobs because of foreign \n     competition than we do to their friends and neighbors who are \n     laid off due to domestic competition. Anyone must agree that \n     this is unfair.\n\n  That was President Reagan.\n  I certainly do, as do most of my constituents, think the last thing \nthis economy needs is another big spending program.\n  Another important point is that TAA fuels the fire of virulent \nantitrade propagandists. TAA supporters say the program keeps faith \nwith American\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\nworkers and helps build support for trade. I think just the opposite is \ntrue. Unions and other antitrade zealots gleefully use TAA data to make \nthe case that trade causes outsourcing and job loss. After all, the \nnumber of trade-dislocated workers is certified by the government.\n  As the program is expanded to include more and more people and \nentities, including community colleges, firms, farmers, and fishermen, \nthe myth that trade is bad for the American worker finds ready fodder \nand continues to build. Instead of helping build the case for trade, \nTAA certifications are used to show that trade is bad. In the end, TAA \nis really just a government subsidy for an antitrade propaganda.\n  Many of those dedicated to fighting a market-opening trade \nliberalization agenda and who are hostile to a thoughtful and ambitious \ntrade policy cite each TAA certification and each TAA benefit conferred \nas further evidence that trade and trade agreements are bad for \nAmerica. These same groups use TAA certifications and TAA workers to \nattack the companies that laid those workers off as outsourcers, even \nattempting to name and shame the CEOs of those companies. For goodness' \nsake, why should we expand a program that arms the harshest trade \ncritics with more fodder for their ill-informed and relentless attack \non trade?\n  Finally, TAA should move with TPA. Despite what many of my colleagues \nand many so-called trade experts say, TAA does not move with trade \nagreements. In fact, historically significant expansions and reforms to \nTAA have moved with omnibus trade legislation that included grants of \ntrade negotiating authority to the President.\n  There is a myth that TAA has always received strong bipartisan \nsupport. Again, the historical record does not bear this out. A simple \nreview of a very helpful history of TAA provided by CRS this August \nshows just how controversial TAA has always been and continues to be \nand confirms that TAA reforms traditionally move with TPA.\n  Inexplicably, this President doesn't want TPA trade promotion \nauthority--and the White House is actually encouraging Leader Reid and \nDemocratic Senators to vote down a TPA amendment Leader McConnell will \noffer. Leader Reid and Chairman Baucus and the White House have also \napparently asked the business community to oppose an amendment on TPA \nas well, despite the fact that the business community has uniformly \nsupported the granting of trade negotiating authority to every \nPresident, regardless of party.\n  This is all baffling to me. But I agree with Leader McConnell that \nthe President needs TPA whoever the President is--as soon as possible, \nand I can't imagine any President not wanting that authority. As I \nsuspect the Democrats will vote down granting their President trade \nnegotiating authority, I must also be inclined to vote against this TAA \namendment.\n  Much has been said about TAA and that it is the price for free-trade \nagreements. But we are paving new and dangerous ground by holding three \ntrade agreements hostage to expanded TAA. Each time we have tried to \nmove these agreements, a new roadblock has been erected. And while we \ndilly and dally, our trade competitors take more of our market share \naround the world, and American businesses and farms lose more money and \nmore jobs.\n  There has to be a better way. I urge the President to reconsider his \ntrade priorities. Instead of expending his political capital on \nexpanding the Federal Government, he should liberate the U.S. worker by \naccepting our offer to provide him with the authority to open new \nmarkets to U.S. exports. Our economy is in dire straits, unemployment \nis sky high, and Federal spending is out of control. We need the \nPresident's leadership, and we need it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, let me start by thanking the senior \nSenator from Ohio for his generosity in allowing me to speak now. I \nalso commend Senator Hatch, who has been a leader in expanding exports \nand therefore creating jobs for many years, and again he is standing \ntoday talking about the importance of us moving forward on a progrowth \ntrade agenda, including giving the President the ability to have trade \npromotion authority. That is what I wish to talk about today.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, introduced an amendment to \nthe underlying legislation saying that, along with trade adjustment \nassistance, for the same 3 years there also be trade promotion \nauthority given to this President, which all of his predecessors have \nhad. That makes sense. The legislation in the amendment is actually \nidentical to legislation I introduced my first week here in the Senate \non a bipartisan basis with Senator Lieberman to provide the President \nwith trade promotion authority. It is incredibly important.\n  I think it goes without saying that we live in an increasingly \ninterconnected world where the movement of goods and services and \npeople across borders is part of our economy. It is very much an \neconomy where the United States is connected to our global competitors. \nWe are moving forward around the globe on various arrangements, export \nagreements at a rapid pace. Yet I am sorry to say the United States is \nsimply not a part of that because we do not have trade promotion \nauthority.\n  These agreements that are being negotiated open markets for workers \nand farmers and service providers to be able to expand exports, again, \nof goods and services.\n  By the way, there are over 100 of those bilateral agreements being \nnegotiated today. Guess how many the United States is party to. None, \nnot a single one. The reason is that we don't have the ability through \ntrade promotion authority to have the United States at the table \nnegotiating to open these markets for our workers and our farmers and \nour service providers.\n  There is one agreement on which we are negotiating, a regional \nagreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I support the continued \nnegotiation there, but, frankly, it is not a bilateral agreement that \nis likely to reduce barriers significantly.\n  The United States is getting left behind. We lost trade promotion \nauthority in 2007. It expired. At that time, President George W. Bush \ncame to the Congress and asked for it to be renewed. Then a \nDemocratically controlled Congress said: No, we don't want to give you \nthe ability to negotiate these agreements that help, as Senator Hatch \nhas said, expand jobs in this country.\n  President Obama's administration has not asked for the authority. In \nfact, as Senator Hatch has just indicated, they don't seem interested \nin having it, which is unbelievable to me--that you would not want the \nability to negotiate with other countries to knock down barriers to \nhelp our workers, our farmers, and our service providers here in this \ncountry. But that is where we are right now.\n  Before the 2007 expiration of trade promotion authority, the United \nStates was active and involved in agreements that knocked down barriers \nto our exports. There were three agreements negotiated now 3 and 4 \nyears ago, and these were agreements with Panama and Colombia and \nKorea. Those are the three agreements that have been talked about a lot \non this floor over the last day because the trade adjustment assistance \nwe are talking about is related to those three agreements. We need to \nget them done. They have been languishing for too long. Obviously, the \nUnited States, not being able to negotiate anything in the interim \nperiod, has fallen behind, but at the least, we should move ahead and \nratify these three agreements. The President's own metrics tell us \nthese three agreements alone will generate 250,000 new jobs in this \ncountry. Look, with unemployment at over 9 percent, we need those jobs, \nand the jobs tend to be better paying jobs with better benefits.\n  What has happened in the interim while we have not moved forward with \nthese agreements? Well, Korea has started a negotiation with the \nEuropean Union since our agreement was finalized and completed that \nagreement and now made that agreement effective in July of this year. \nExports from the European Union to Korea increased 36 percent in July \nalone. Our exports to Korea during that time period, by the way, \nincreased less than 3 percent.\n  What is happening? We are losing market share. We are losing jobs \nwhile we sit back and allow these other countries to negotiate. \nRemember, over 100\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nagreements are being negotiated, and we are not parties to any of them.\n  The same thing is happening in Colombia. Since we negotiated the \nagreement with Colombia, Colombia started negotiating with other \ncountries, including Argentina and Brazil, and guess what has happened. \nThey have completed that agreement, it has gone into effect, and, \nagain, our market share has diminished. We used to provide about 71 \npercent of the agricultural exports, including corn, wheat, and \nsoybeans, to Colombia when we completed the agreement. Today, that \nmarket share is down to 26 percent. That means farmers in Ohio, \nMontana, Utah, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere are being disadvantaged by \nour trade policy.\n\n  We have to move forward with these agreements. Instead of having \nincreased exports from Seoul, Bogota, Calgary, and Munich, they should \nbe coming from Cincinnati and Cleveland and Columbus and Dayton. \nInterestingly, Korea and Colombia have now started negotiating an \nagreement with themselves. Again, we are not moving forward because we \nare not part of these agreements because we do not have trade promotion \nauthority.\n  I think these three agreements that I hope the President finally \nsends to the U.S. Congress for ratification are examples of the kinds \nof agreements that we could have been negotiating over the past 3 or 4 \nyears and that we should start negotiating tomorrow, by this Senate and \nthe House, giving the President the trade promotion authority he needs \nto be able to have those negotiations and to open those markets for \nU.S. products.\n  The reality is that trade promotion authority is vital for any \nPresident to have. Why? Because if you don't have trade promotion \nauthority, the other countries will not sit down at the table and \nbargain with you. It is a pretty simple concept. If you want to get the \nbest deal from another country, you have to have trade promotion \nauthority because here in America, after we negotiate an agreement at \nthe executive branch level, it has to come to Congress, and other \ncountries don't want to renegotiate an agreement with the U.S. Congress \nthat would be full of amendments and changes. So in order for us to \nensure we can get the best deal, we have to give the President trade \npromotion authority.\n  Every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has asked for this \nauthority and received it. It is unbelievable to me that this President \ndoes not want that. I believe he must want it--any President would--and \nhe should ask for it, and we should provide it to him. This amendment \ndoes exactly that.\n  Congress has given TPA authority to Democrats and Republicans alike. \nIt is not a partisan issue. So a Republican Congress has given it to a \nDemocratic President and vice versa.\n  I stand as a Republican telling my colleagues that I would like to \ngive it to President Obama. The underlying amendment we are talking \nabout provides trade promotion for 3 years, so it would be for the \nremainder of the President's term and, if he is reelected, for the next \ncouple of years or, if a Republican is elected, for that person. It \nshould not be about party; it should be about our country.\n  The President has been talking in the last couple of weeks about the \nfact that he wants products stamped with three words: ``Made in \nAmerica.'' I couldn't agree with him more. He is saying they should be \nexported all around the world? How is that going to happen? It is going \nto happen by opening these markets, by leveling the playing field for \nus as Americans so we can compete and win.\n  When we open these markets, we expand exports dramatically.\n  Think about this: Countries with which we currently have trade \nagreements which comprise less than 10 percent of the global GDP--think \nabout it. We do not have an agreement with China or the European Union. \nIt is about 10 percent or less of the global economy. Yet that is where \nwe send about 41 percent of our exports.\n  These agreements are good for us, which is why the Colombia \nagreement, the Panama agreement, and the Korea agreement, in my view, \nwill be able to pass this floor easily because the facts are there, if \nthe President will just send them. By giving the President trade \npromotion authority, we could go on and, indeed, make good on his \npromise to have more products stamped with those three words, ``Made in \nAmerica,'' sent all over the world.\n  It is a little bit ironic to me that the underlying bill we are \ntalking about, the TAA, the trade adjustment assistance, is attached to \nthe generalized system of preferences, GSP. It is not legislation I \noppose, but it is legislation that opens the United States more to \nproducts from other countries. So here we are talking about opening up \nthe United States more with the GSP bill, and yet we are not willing to \nput in place measures to open up other markets more for the United \nStates of America through trade promotion authority. How does that make \nsense? But that is where we are.\n  To my colleagues, I will say, if we are not engaged in opening \nmarkets, we are falling behind. America needs to get back in the game \nagain. We need to take a leadership role in global trade. That means \ngiving this President and all future Presidents the ability to \nnegotiate, just as all of their predecessors have had. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to give to this President \nthe same authority other Presidents have had of both parties. Our \neconomy and the future for our children and our grandchildren depend on \nit.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his generosity, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for \nhis kind words. I appreciate his support, his public support--he did \nnot speak specifically on the Casey-Brown-Baucus amendment, I do not \nbelieve; I had to step out for a moment, but I know he has said \npositive words about restarting, if you will, trade adjustment \nassistance, and with some expansion, not quite as good as it was 2 \nyears ago, but still a very important program.\n  I appreciate Senator Portman's words and his support of expanding it, \nand I hope he joins with some other Republicans in actually supporting \nthe Casey-Brown-Baucus amendment.\n  I particularly thank Chairman Baucus for his strong support of trade \nadjustment assistance. Senator Casey, especially, has pushed for this \nfor, well, almost a year now, when in December we did everything but \nbeg our colleagues to renew this program that helps workers who are \nunemployed through no doing of their own.\n  In early 2009, we had written a very good trade adjustment \nassistance: If you lose your job because of a trade agreement, or if \nyou lose your job because of trade, even if it is a service job--it \nused to just be manufacturing--you will get two things: One, you will \nget trade adjustment assistance so you can continue with your life and \nnot get foreclosed on, you can continue to provide for your kids, and \nyou can have a little bit of money to get retrained.\n  I met a woman in Youngstown not too long ago who lost her \nmanufacturing job to trade. She got TAA. She used that money to go to \nnursing school at Youngstown State University, and she was in school \nwith her daughter who was also getting a nursing degree. You think: \nThat is exactly how TAA works. There are those examples, I am sure, in \nPhiladelphia and Harrisburg, and I will bet you there are even examples \nin Provo of trade adjustment assistance working in that way. That is \nwhy it is so very important.\n  At the same time, the language we wrote also gives help for people to \ncontinue their health insurance. I was at a place in Columbus not too \nlong ago that specializes in helping people get back on their feet and \nget work. To hear someone tell a story: First, they lose their job. \nThey do not get much assistance. Then they lose their health care. Then \nthey have to talk to their 12-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter \nabout moving because they lost their home.\n  Does nobody here--I should not say ``nobody'' because a lot of my \ncolleagues do care, but does nobody here care about somebody who has to \nsit down with their kids and say: Sorry, honey, we are going to lose \nour home because of foreclosure because we lost our jobs and we are not \ngetting retrained and finding any work? That, to me, is what this is \nall about.\n  I want to talk a little bit about trade adjustment assistance beyond \nwhat I said, but I also want to talk about\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\nsome of my colleagues' statements about trade and what it has done for \nthis country, to this country. I hear all the theories. Every country \nin the world practices trade according to its national interests. The \nUnited States of America practices trade according to an economics \ntextbook that is 20 years out of date.\n  In my first year in the House of Representatives, the Congress passed \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, something I know if Senator \nCasey had been here he would have voted against it. I voted against it. \nI remember the promises, the promises from the free-trade-at-any-cost \ncrowd, that NAFTA would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. They said \nit with NAFTA. They said it with PNTR with China. They said it with the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement: If you pass this, it is going to \nmean more manufacturing and more high-tech jobs and stronger \ncommunities. Look what it has meant.\n  Go to Springfield, OH, go to Ashtabula, go to Lima, go to Mansfield, \ngo to Zanesville, go to Chillicothe, go to Xenia. Look at these medium-\nsized cities of 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 people, and look at what \nhas happened to them. Often in smaller communities--the Senator from \nMontana, the Presiding Officer, knows this--a husband and wife both \nwork at a plant.\n  In Jackson, OH, I was walking a picket line with some workers who \nwere locked out, and then the plant ultimately closed. For a number of \nthe people I saw, the husband and wife both worked at this \nmanufacturing plant, each making about $12 or $13 or $14 an hour. They \nwere middle class with their combined income. When this plant moved \noverseas, their family income was wiped out.\n  It happens over and over in small towns. It happens in Dayton and it \nhappens in Cleveland and it happens in Columbus and Philly and \nPittsburgh and Harrisburg. It happens in small towns and big cities.\n  Then we see this free-trade-at-any-cost crowd come to the Senate \nfloor and say: If we only had trade promotion authority, we could do \nmore of this because it works so well. Free trade has worked so well \nfor our country.\n  Why have we lost these hundreds of thousands of jobs? Do you know \nwhy? Because the business plan in this country, the business plan, \nnever in world history--I do not think we have seen this ever in world \nhistory--is where a business plan for a company is to shut down \nproduction in Steubenville, shut down production in Toledo, move that \ncompany to Shanghai, move that company to Mexico City, make those \nproducts, and sell them back into the United States. So their business \nplan is to shut down manufacturing in this country, go overseas, hire \ncheaper workers, in places where there are weaker environmental laws, \nnonexistent worker safety laws, and sell the products back into the \nUnited States.\n  That is what our manufacturing policy has been. That is why this \nwhole idea of Korea and Colombia and Panama--as if Mexico and Central \nAmerica and China were not enough--this whole idea of free trade at any \ncost is bankrupting our country. That is why wages during the last 10 \nyears, during the Bush administration and since--since 2001, wages in \nthis country have gone down. We have lost jobs in this country, almost. \nWe have not grown jobs in this country. It is about what we had in \n2001, with a much larger population.\n  Wages down, job growth flat, and the trade policy is working? So our \nanswer is, let's do more of it, as if NAFTA and CAFTA and PNTR were not \nenough? Let's do more trade agreements? Let's send more jobs overseas? \nAlso, we can practice trade according to what the Washington Post and \nthe New York Times and the rightwing papers and the leftwing papers and \nthe Harvard economists and the economic elite in this country say? \nAlso, they can follow what they learned in economics 101, taught with a \ntextbook that is 20 years out of date? It is not working for our \ncountry.\n\n  I was talking on the phone today with a retiree in eastern Ohio, and \nshe had just been with her son who was about to be deployed at his \nbase. She and her husband went and visited her son. He is a marine. She \nwent to the commissary, and do you know what. She bought a hat that \nsaid ``Marines.'' I think it said ``Marines.'' She bought a hat. She \nbought a bunch of stuff at the commissary. Where was it made? Guess. It \nwas not made in Helena. It was not made in Harrisburg. It was not made \nin Columbus. This is insane. We have American flags that are made \nabroad. We have products in commissaries that are made abroad. We have \nproducts Senator Sanders spoke out against sold here in the U.S. \nCapitol that are made abroad. Why? Because we have a trade policy that \nis morally bankrupt, politically bankrupt, economically bankrupt, and \nit is not working for our country.\n  That is why this whole idea of trade promotion authority so we can do \nmore of the same makes no sense at all. But it is also why we need to \npass the Casey-Brown-Baucus amendment. When we made the reforms to TAA \nin 2009, 185,000 additional trade-affected workers became eligible in \nevery State. Mr. President, 227,000 workers in 2010 alone participated \nin TAA. They got trained for new jobs that employers are looking to \nfill. I think we all know that we have, even in these bad economic \ntimes, jobs that remain unfilled because they cannot find workers with \nthe right skills. This will help to fill that gap. We should all be for \nthis.\n  According to the Peterson Institute, before the recession hit, \nbetween 2001 and 2007, two-thirds of TAA participants found jobs within \n3 months of leaving the program. Ninety percent stayed at these jobs \nfor at least a year. It is a program that works. It helps people get \nhealth care. It helps people stay in their homes. It helps people get \nnew skills so they can work.\n  The last comment I will make: I have said enough about the bankruptcy \nof American trade policy, its moral bankruptcy and economic bankruptcy \nalike. Our trade deficit in 2010--I do not like to come to the floor \nand use a lot of numbers--if this is not reason enough, in 2010 our \ntrade deficit was $634 billion. You do know what that means. That \nmeans, basically, every day we buy almost $2 billion more worth of \ngoods made abroad than we sell abroad--almost $2 billion a day.\n  If one-tenth the attention was paid to the trade deficit as we pay to \nthe budget deficit, this would be a better country. We would see more \nmanufacturing in places such as Cleveland and Columbus and Dayton.\n  Our trade deficit with China was $273 billion in 2010. Ten years \nbefore--before PNTR--our trade deficit with China was $68 billion. It \nwent from $68 billion to $273 billion in one decade. That works so well \nthat we should do more of it? President Bush said $1 billion in trade \nsurplus or trade deficit translates into 13,000 jobs, a $1 billion \ntrade surplus means 13,000 additional jobs, $1 billion trade deficit \nmeans 13,000 fewer jobs.\n  So our trade deficit with China last year was $273 billion. You do \nnot have to be good in math to know that translates into a lot of jobs. \nMaking products sold at the Capitol, making products sold at \ncommissaries, making products sold all over--until we figure this out \nand pass trade agreements that are actually in our national interests, \nwe are simply, pure and simple, betraying our national interests and \nbetraying the middle-class families and the families in our country \nthat aspire to be middle class.\n  I support the Casey-Brown-Baucus amendment and thank Chairman Baucus \nagain for his work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5745-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5745-S5747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 1094\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to pursue a \nunanimous consent request on something that is critical to families in \nmy home State of New Jersey, which has the highest rate of autism, but \nis also critical to families across the country who have a loved one \nwho faces--in the spectrum of autism and other developmental issues--\nthe need to get the help, so their child, their loved one, can fulfill \ntheir God-given capabilities.\n  Last Tuesday morning, a full week ago from today, I sent this bill \nbefore the Senate for unanimous consent, and that unanimous consent was \ncleared on the Democratic side, but it has not been cleared on the \nRepublican side,\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nwhich has prevented this bill from passing.\n  This legislation was reported out of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee on September 7 without amendment and with \nunanimous support, Republicans and Democrats together. This result, the \nresult of a bipartisan effort with Senator Enzi, who is the ranking \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, is \nvital to ensuring that the programs created under the landmark \nCombating Autism Act of 2006 continue.\n  That bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush after \npassing the Senate on a unanimous consent. This long history of \nbipartisan support only adds to my confusion as to why there are \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who are currently preventing \nthe bill from passing.\n  This legislation has unanimous support from Democrats and strong \nbipartisan support throughout the Senate, including nine Republican \ncosponsors.\n  Without Senate approval, the Combating Autism Act will sunset at the \nend of next week, leaving countless families across our Nation without \nthe support they need in caring for their children with autism.\n  This bill provides an additional 3 years of guarantees simply in the \ncontext of an authorization. Obviously, we would have to go through the \nappropriations process and there would have to be debate and it would \nbe voted on the floor, but that authorization for 3 years at the fiscal \nyear 2011 appropriated levels for the programs for the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration is vital to continuing \nour efforts on diagnosing autism spectrum disorder, advancing \nbehavioral therapies to improve social abilities with those with \nautism, providing families with education and support services to \nbetter understand autism, and to coordinating Federal efforts on \nresearching autism.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Enzi, who has been a cochampion in \nregard to this legislation and addressing all concerns. Since it \ncleared the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with full \nbipartisan and unanimous support, I thought we had succeeded in \naddressing those concerns. I have not been approached or heard a single \nobjection from any Republican as to why they might hold this bill, and \nI have been open in my willingness to work with the other side in \naddressing their policy concerns. Having not heard a single objection \nto the merits of this legislation--which, by the way, is an exact \nreplica of what is being offered by the Republican majority in the \nHouse--I have to assume this is for reasons other than policy.\n  We have had a week to bring this forward. It has caused incredible \nuncertainty and unnecessary worry for the parents of children with \nautism as they wait anxiously to learn if the government is going to \ncontinue to reauthorize the very essence of the programs that have \nhelped their children be able to fulfill their God-given potential to \nthe maximum ability they can. I have met family after family who tell \nme this legislation has made an enormous difference in their lives. So \nI don't understand any reason, considering all the work that has been \ndone, considering the bipartisan support, considering the House \nRepublican majority is offering the same legislation, why we have not \nbeen able to pursue this.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 163, S. 1094, the Combating Autism \nReauthorization Act; that the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and several \ncolleagues, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague for his \nattention to this issue. Autism is a very difficult issue for many \nfamilies, and the incidence of autism in our country is growing. I am \nthankful Congress, in its wisdom, a number of years ago, established \nagencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and the National \nInstitutes of Health, where we have scientists and physicians and many \nothers who are dedicating themselves to researching not just autism but \ncures for many diseases.\n  I appreciate again my colleague bringing this up, but I am afraid \nthis is another example of political good intentions having many \nunintended consequences. The lobby to support autism is definitely very \nstrong, and we appreciate that, but there are many diseases that \nchildren and people throughout our country face. We have put experts in \nplace to determine where we can spend the money we allocate for medical \nresearch, and we need to leave that to the experts.\n  We have seen unintended results when our government tries to pick \nwinners and losers. We tried to do it in the solar business 1 year or \nso ago. There are many companies in the solar business, but we picked \none, and we didn't exactly know what we were doing. We gave $\\1/2\\ \nbillion dollars to an effort that turned out not to be the best place \nto send taxpayer money.\n  Autism research will continue, and I think that is something we need \nto make very clear. The people we have put in charge of doing medical \nresearch will continue to do that medical research. The Congress does \nnot have to decide how much we are going to spend on all the different \ndiseases that affect Americans. There are many children facing diseases \nwe don't understand, and they do not have the lobby many other diseases \nhave. We cannot, from a political perspective, in an attempt to \ndemonstrate our compassion, try to direct all the scientific and \nmedical research from the floor of the Congress.\n  So I wish to make it clear that all of us who object support autism \nresearch. We will continue to try to make sure the funding for medical \nresearch is there. But it makes absolutely no sense for us, from where \nwe sit, to try to play scientists and physicians and to know where the \nbest outcomes will be and where we get the most for our money. If we \nare going to do that, we might as well decide what kind of medical \nequipment is going to be used or what kind of drugs are going to be \nused, and we certainly don't have that capability.\n  I am very thankful Dr. Coburn has taken up this issue for years and \nurged us to leave the decisions for medical research in the hands of \nthose who understand it. Our job, as a Congress, is to continue to \nappropriate the money, which we will, for medical research. Autism \nresearch will continue, as well as research for many other diseases. \nHopefully, we can make sure that funding is there because many families \nare suffering and we need to make sure we do our part in the research \narea.\n  So I welcome my colleagues in the majority bringing this bill to the \nfloor for debate. We certainly are not blocking debate on this issue. \nBut passing something such as this, without any debate and without any \nopen vote, is not what Congress should be doing right now.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition, and \nI wish to recognize the good work my colleague, the Senator from New \nJersey, has done on this issue.\n  I have been in the Senate a little over 6 years and I was cajoled \ninto allowing this to pass the last time it passed. I have blocked \nevery other disease-specific piece of legislation, and there is a \nreason for that. Both the last Director of the NIH and the current one \ncaution against us being specific in what we demand them to do. There \nis a reason for that. Our science is changing enormously--enormously. \nWe are now at the molecular level, at the genetic level, and at the \nimmune level of thousands of diseases. What we research in diabetes now \nhas prevalence for neurosciences. What we research in neurosciences now \nhas prevalence for tons of other diseases. Dr. Zerhouni has said: \nPlease don't do this.\n  I am known in this body to be a stickler on spending, but if there \nwere two areas I would increase spending in our budget it would be to \nthe NIH and to the National Science Foundation--both of them--and I \nrecently reported out a report that was somewhat critical of some of \nthe spending on the National Science Foundation. We can do\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\neverything better. But the important aspect is no one who is opposing \nthe reauthorization of this bill right now is opposed to autism \nresearch or the ideas behind it. What we are opposed to is tying the \nhands of the researchers and the Directors at NIH and telling them what \nthey should do and how they should do it.\n  I would also dispute the fact the money will go away. The CR we are \ngoing to consider this week will continue this funding at the level it \nis until November 18, which gives us plenty of time to work with \nSenator Menendez to work out some of our problems with this piece of \nlegislation. So we come to this debate in good faith. We recognize the \nemotional ties associated with such a devastating disease. As an \nobstetrician and pediatrician, I have diagnosed it. I have treated it. \nI have sat with the families as they have suffered through the \nconsequences of this disease. I don't take it lightly. But I also don't \ntake lightly our inability to make the clear choices and ratchet around \nthe moneys for the NIH.\n  What we should do is say: NIH, here is your money. Go where the \nscience helps the most people in the quickest way and where the science \nleads us. At a time when our country is desperate to get our fiscal \nhouse in order, what we want is the most efficient NIH. What we want is \nnonduplicative grants at the NIH. What we want is no fraud in the \ngrants associated with autism, which have been published and which \npeople are now in jail for. We want that eliminated. We want the \noversight on the NIH to be across the board in every area. Are they \ndoing what we are asking them to do to spend the money wisely and what \nthe science would tell them to do, not what any one particular interest \ngroup would tell them to do?\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 1094, the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act, and \nthat my amendment at the desk related to requiring the Secretary of HHS \nto identify and consolidate duplicative and overlapping autism funding \nthroughout the Federal Government be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that. My commitment is to work with the \nSenator from New Jersey to try to solve this problem before any funding \nwould change, and I don't think it is going to change.\n  I would also note for my colleagues that last year we had over $450 \nbillion appropriated by the appropriators that was not authorized for \nanything. There were no authorizations at all. So this money isn't \ngoing to go away. There is no hurry. There is no tragedy. We can \ncontinue, and we can work as colleagues to try to solve our problems as \nwell as meet the demands the Senator from New Jersey thinks must be \nmet.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. First of all, I appreciate my colleague's offer and \ncertainly we will take him up on it--to have a discussion to see if we \ncan come to a common understanding because the issue is far more \nimportant than anyone's ideological views. I look forward to working \nwith him and others who are concerned.\n  Let me say, however, there are some inconsistencies. If you do not \nbelieve there should be a disease-specific reauthorization, then the CR \ndoes exactly that. It will be for a more limited time, but it will, in \nfact, reauthorize this bill but only to November 18. So whether that \ndebate is about reauthorizing a disease-specific allocation, which is \nwhat I was trying to accomplish, or whether in the CR, I assume it will \nbe the thinking of my colleagues to object to the CR on the basis it \nhas a disease-specific reauthorization for a much smaller period of \ntime, until November 18. I am not quite sure how that logic follows at \nthe end of the day.\n  Secondly, I think it is rather cruel to use an analogy that talks \nabout loan guarantees to some energy entity and talking about autism \nand families. When I hear the word ``lobby,'' that, of course, creates \na pejorative description. What is the lobby here? The lobby here is \nparents--American citizens, husbands and wives, taxpayers who advocate \nfor their children before their representatives. I thought, in a \nrepresentative democracy, citizens have the right to go to their \nelected representatives and advocate for a point of view--even if, \nadmittedly, that point of view is on behalf of the welfare of their \nchild.\n  So I have a problem when I hear, in this context, the word ``lobby,'' \nas if it is a negative when a universe of parents in our country who \npay taxes are simply trying to accomplish getting their government's \nattention on a disease that afflicts their children and their ability \nto function in this society to the maximum potential their God-given \nabilities give them. I don't care about listening to a lobby. The last \ntime I checked, this is what democracy is all about.\n  Finally, I would simply say there is no guarantee--I know my \ncolleague suggested there is a guarantee--that research into autism \nwill continue. There is no guarantee of that. There is no guarantee of \nthat. The reason why I objected to the other unanimous consent by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma is because, in fact, we have a set of \ncircumstances, if we read that unanimous consent request, where there \nwould be a diminution of funds at the end of the day. So we either \nbelieve in a disease-specific reauthorization, which to some degree \nwould be allowed, but then we take away all the funds.\n  The whole reason this legislation came to being was to coordinate the \nvery efforts of the Federal Government together to, in essence, meet \nthe challenge of autism.\n  Even when we listen to debate on disease-specific legislation and the \nopposition to disease-specific legislation, I would emphasize that \nwhile the name would suggest this is only about autism, this improves \nservices for children with many different developmental disorders and \nconditions--from autism, yes, but Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina \nbifida, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy.\n  So it is a program that involves a number of efforts, broadly based, \nto prevent and detect and improve the health infrastructure for all \nchildren who might face any of these developmental disabilities, not \njust autism.\n  Every year this program trains thousands of professionals to better \ncare for individuals with a broad range of developmental disabilities, \nincluding but not limited to autism spectrum disorders. Given the long \nwaiting lists that families often endure to receive diagnostic and \ntreatment services, these programs are essential in addressing an \nurgent national health need.\n  So, Mr. President, I don't quite understand the opposition. It \nboggles my mind. They are against disease-specific legislation even \nthough this has passed by voice vote in the past? Even though this \npassed unanimously out of the committee? Even though a disease-specific \nprovision will be in the CR, which I assume they would oppose if they \ndon't want legislation to move forward? Then they tell families they \nare lobbyists, and they have no right to lobby, that we shouldn't \nlisten to their voices? Then they say there will be--don't worry, there \nwill be money for research, when there is no guarantee? That is cruel, \nin my view, and there is no reason for it.\n  I would only hope we can have a change of heart so we can have \nfamilies who have an incredible challenge and who love their children \nand want to do everything they can to help them fulfill the maximum of \ntheir potential to be able to do so. That is what we have done for \nseveral years now under this legislation.\n  My God, if we can't get things like this passed, I don't know where \nwe are headed in the Senate. But I hope for a better day, and I am \ngoing to continue and insist until we achieve this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5747-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5747-S5748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REQUEST\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues activities that will take place this week in New York \nat the United Nations and the request that has been made by the \nPalestinians that they seek status as an independent state with full \nmembership in the United Nations.\n  It is clearly the position of the United States, it is clearly I \nthink the position of the international community, that there needs to \nbe two states, a Jewish State of Israel along with an independent \nPalestinian State, living side by side in peace. But the only way that \nwill take place is through direct negotiations between the Palestinians \nand the Israelis. Prime Minister Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of \nIsrael, was here in Washington and spoke before a joint session of \nCongress. He laid out very clearly how peace in the Middle East needs \nto evolve, through the recognition by the international community of \nthe Jewish State of Israel and an independent Palestinian State through \ndirect negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\n  Israel has been one of our strongest allies. They have been a loyal \nally to the United States. We share common values. It is strategically \ncritical to the United States, particularly in that part of the world. \nIt is clear to all that the only way we will achieve the two states \nwill be through direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the \nIsraelis. The Palestinians have been reluctant to have these direct \nnegotiations and tried to use intermediaries. They need to do it \ndirectly. Sit down with the Israelis. Negotiate the issues. That is the \nway to move forward to accomplish their goal.\n  The action they are seeking in the United Nations will be \ncounterproductive. We have gone on record, every single one of us in \nthe Senate of the United States, in S. Res. 185, a resolution I brought \nforward with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. It was passed \nunanimously by the Senate. It stated very clearly that if the \nPalestinians were to pursue this unilateral action through the United \nNations, that would not advance the peace process, that it would be \ncounterproductive to the objectives of the Palestinians to establish an \nindependent state.\n  This past week, Senator Collins and I sent a letter to President \nAbbas, the President of the Palestinian group. We told him that we \nbelieved trying to go directly to the United Nations, circumventing the \npeace process, would be a lack of good faith in peace negotiations and \nthat it would have repercussions on United States foreign policy.\n  What we have been told by the Palestinians is they will seek full \nmembership as a state in the United Nations, going to the Security \nCouncil. That is not going to succeed. We hope the Security Council \nwill recognize the inappropriateness of such action and will not take \nit up or will not provide the necessary support to forward it to the \nGeneral Assembly. In the unlikely case that it were to get the \nnecessary support in the Security Council, the United States has made \nit clear that it would veto any such action, for good reason--because \nit would be counterproductive to achieving the objectives of two states \nliving side by side in peace.\n  The Palestinians may go to the General Assembly. Although they cannot \nget full membership, they could try to advance a resolution within the \nGeneral Assembly in the United Nations. We know the numbers. We know \nwhat could happen. But I must tell you, seeking some form of \nrecognition through the General Assembly, circumventing the peace \nprocess and the Security Council, will be harmful to advancing the \npeace process and the objectives of the Palestinians for an independent \nstate.\n  Let the parties negotiate directly, in good faith. Israel has \nindicated they are prepared to do that. We have been prepared to do \nthat--negotiate in good faith through direct negotiations. There are no \nshortcuts to achieving this. Moving through the United Nations will not \nachieve those objectives.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is an honor serving the people of the great State of \nNevada, and today I am speaking on their behalf for the first time in \nthe Chamber of the Senate. Before I begin, I would like to take a \nmoment to reflect on two tragic events that have taken place in Nevada \nrecently.\n  In Carson City, our Nation lost three Nevada National Guard members \nat a local restaurant shooting. Those members were MAJ Heath Kelly, SFC \nMiranda McElhiney, and SFC Christian Riege.\n\n  The other was the horrific crash at the Reno air races this weekend. \nAs with the shootings in Carson City, this terrible event not only \nimpacted the communities in northern Nevada but the entire State and \nthe Nation. Having visited the scene where the crash occurred, it is \ndifficult to describe the amount of damage that took place there.\n  Our State's first responders and medical personnel did an amazing job \nin a very difficult situation. My thoughts and prayers go out to all \nthe victims and their families, and I wish the injured a quick \nrecovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5748-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5748-S5750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REENERGIZING AMERICA\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I am deeply humbled by the opportunity to \nstand here today and to address the body as Nevada's 25th Senator. \nNevada is a small State, but it is one that has provided many with a \ngreat chance to succeed. Most people know that it was in Nevada where \nSamuel Clemens began to sign his writings as Mark Twain and reported on \nthe territorial legislative sessions. However, the reason Samuel \nClemens came to the Nevada territory was to follow his older brother, \nOrion Clemens, who served as the first and only secretary of the Nevada \nTerritory. That position would later become secretary of state, a \nposition which I held prior to my service in Congress.\n  Similar to the Clemens brothers who sought greater opportunities, it \nis in a State such as Nevada where a son of a mechanic can have the \nopportunity to interact with those who are responsible for governing \nthe State. For instance, as a boy I delivered the newspaper to then-\nGov. Mike O'Callaghan. For a time, I went to Sunday school with then-\nLt. Gov. Harry Reid's sons, and I was educated at the same public high \nschool as Senator Paul Laxalt. Our current Governor, Brian Sandoval, is \nsomeone whom I used to play organized basketball with. I wish to thank \nSenator Laxalt for his support and Senator Reid for being here today. I \nalso wish to thank Senator McConnell for being here as well.\n  My father's automotive shop was across the street from the Nevada \nState legislature, so many of the legislators would come into my dad's \nbusiness. I spent a lot of time there as a kid working in that garage, \nsweeping floors, repairing cars, fixing engines and transmissions. In \nthat shop, I learned the value of hard work and responsibility and the \nimportance of family.\n  I am proud of what I learned growing up in Nevada: values from two \ngreat parents, good teachers, and good neighbors. Nevada values such as \nfaith in God, hard work, honesty, and commitment to family--these are \nthe values I try to bring to Washington, DC, every day.\n  Although Nevada has changed over the years, in many ways it is very \nmuch the same place as when I grew up. I bring this up because I recall \nwhat it took for my father to keep his\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nbusiness in operation, and I think about what might have happened if he \nwere still in business today. During this time when so many people are \nhurting and our economy is so fragile, it is important to understand \nhow government impacts our economy and businesses across the Nation. \nWhile Washington politicians tarnish one another, Americans are still \nout of work. My home State of Nevada, in particular, leads the Nation \nin unemployment, foreclosures, and bankruptcies. Nevadans do not want \nfinger-pointing; they want jobs. Nevadans do not want political talking \npoints; they want to keep their homes. Nevadans do not want to hear all \nthe promises; they want to pass on a better future to their children \nand grandchildren.\n  Job creation and economic recovery should be a bipartisan value. \nUnfortunately, Washington is paralyzed by politicians and has been \nreduced to sound bites. Too often it seems we cannot move beyond the \npolitics of today. It appears we are more interested in press \nconferences than solving our Nation's most pressing problems--issues \nsuch as Medicare, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. Instead of \nstrengthening and preserving the program, it is often used as a \npolitical weapon.\n  The truth is, Washington has not done enough to get our Nation back \non track and the American people know it. I recently received a letter \nfrom a small business owner who had this to say:\n\n       My business had to dramatically cut our spending and \n     unfortunately lay off half of our good employees. Many of our \n     customers have lost their jobs and their homes due to \n     government intervention in the housing market and massive \n     mismanagement of our tax dollars . . . government employment \n     has gone up, while private sector employment has dropped.\n\n  These are the kinds of stories I hear from Nevadans far too often.\n  For over 4\\1/2\\ years I have done weekly telephone townhall meetings, \nwhere I have the opportunity to speak with thousands of households \nacross my great State. During a recent round of phone calls, I have \nbeen asking participants if they believe their children and \ngrandchildren will have a better economic future than we have today. \nMore than two-thirds of these respondents say no. Many Nevadans believe \nthe economic burden of our national debt and the impact it will have on \nfuture generations will lead to fewer opportunities and less upward \nmobility. I am certain Nevada is not alone in this sentiment.\n  Do we want to be the first Congress that hands our children and \ngrandchildren a lesser quality of life? This should serve as a wake-up \ncall for Washington.\n  Passing a better life to our children and grandchildren is a value we \nall share as Americans. From all corners of Nevada and our Nation, the \nmessage is clear. The status quo is not working. We can no longer \nafford to ignore the biggest problems facing our country: government \nspending and the national debt. The choices are clear. We can continue \ndown this path which leads to bigger government, higher taxes, less \njobs, and rationed health care for our seniors or we can decrease \ngovernment spending, create jobs, and fulfill our promises to future \ngenerations. Washington needs to place its trust in the American people \nto reenergize our economy, not the Federal Government. It was Reagan \nwho said:\n\n       From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that \n     society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, \n     that government by an elite group is superior to government \n     for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is capable \n     of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to \n     govern someone else?\n\n  Our debt will serve as an anchor on future prosperity if we do not \nwork today to solve this problem. Business as usual is not an option. \nWhat we do as Senators and the decisions we make are critically \nimportant to those whom we wish to represent. Sometimes the results of \nour actions are seen immediately and sometimes the full ramifications \ntake decades to unfold. Record deficits, high unemployment, an anemic \nrecovery, and inflation are fueling anxiety over our Nation's fiscal \nhealth. The key to recovery is to create an environment where economic \ngrowth can flourish and provide certainty and stability to our Nation's \njob creators.\n  I evaluate legislation through what I call the entrepreneurial \nstandard or the ``more, higher, less test.'' Does this bill provide \nmore competition with higher quality at less cost? What would a small \nbusinessman do? If the Federal Government approached problems through \nan entrepreneurial perspective, we would have a more efficient \ngovernment at less cost to the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, our government is not providing that certainty today. \nWe have a temporary Tax Code, overly burdensome regulations, and an \never-increasing national debt. There is no question the Federal \nGovernment must stop spending money we do not have. If we are going to \nkeep America exceptional, we have to chart a new direction for our \ncountry.\n  As families across Nevada struggle to pay their bills and fight to \nkeep their homes, government spending has grown exponentially. This \nmust end if we are going to turn this economy around. We must focus on \nthe long-term health of our economy and remove impediments that have \ncaused economic stagnation and disabled businesses from creating new \njobs.\n  The Federal Government has been on a massive spending spree, and it \nis time for this reckless behavior to end. History offers little \nevidence that massive deficit-financed spending leads to economic \nrecovery. As an opponent of the stimulus and the Wall Street bailout, I \nbelieve reining in government spending is critical to economic recovery \nand the future of our country.\n\n  The unemployment rate, foreclosures, bankruptcies, all represent \npeople who have become victims of this recession. There are those who \nhave endured pay cuts to keep their jobs, individuals who are \nunderemployed, and seniors on fixed incomes dealing with the increases \nin cost-of-living expenses. No question, times are tough.\n  So the question we must answer is, Do we have the courage to overcome \npartisan divides and work together to solve our Nation's problems?\n  While we all may not be members of the same political party or share \nthe same philosophy of government, I believe we are all here to do what \nis right. In these difficult times, it is more important than ever that \nwe work together, find common ground, and make tough decisions to \ncreate jobs and get people back to work.\n  Every day I go to work to advocate for the great State of Nevada, and \nevery day I let Nevadans know there is someone in Washington who is on \ntheir side. There is not a day goes by that I do not think about what \ncan be done to create jobs and get our economy moving again.\n  This is not the first time Americans have endured tough times, and it \nprobably will not be the last. There will be better days ahead. \nHowever, it is incumbent upon us to effect change in difficult times to \ncreate a better future.\n  Today, we are at a crossroads, possibly a defining moment in our \nNation's history, where we must change the way we govern. The window of \nopportunity is available, but it is growing smaller every day. Mark \nTwain wrote: ``You are a coward when you even seem to have backed down \nfrom a thing you openly set out to do.''\n  I ask another question: What is it that we set out to do? I ran for \noffice to make a difference, to leave this place better than I found \nit. We still are the greatest Nation on Earth, with the greatest form \nof government. Our best days are yet to come--if we act now to return \nour Nation to what made us great: families, entrepreneurs, community, \nthe American dream.\n  We must stop the mindset that we have all the answers here in \nWashington because I can assure my colleagues we don't. The answers are \nout there. They are in places such as Nevada, Alaska, Ohio, and perhaps \nKentucky; in small towns and large cities across this country. Let the \nAmerican engine fire again. Tear down the barriers to growth and \nopportunity and launch this great Nation to its great next chapter. I \nstand ready to serve and ready to bring us all together.\n  When my children and grandchildren look back many years from now, it \nis my hope that history will show we rose to the occasion to ensure \ntheir future and the future of our great Nation. I am confident we can \nmeet those challenges. Our strength as a nation is bigger than the \ntroubles of today. May God bless the State of Nevada and may God bless \nthis great country.\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, under the leadership of Chairman Baucus, I \nhave the honor of chairing the Senate Finance Subcommittee on \nInternational Trade. That is why I wish to take a few minutes to \noutline some of the issues I think are relevant to this important \ndebate, about going to bat for workers under the trade adjustment \nprogram.\n  In my home State, about one out of six jobs depends on international \ntrade. The trade jobs tend to pay better than the nontrade jobs. So I \nhave said my philosophy about international trade is, what we ought to \ndo is everything possible to grow things in Oregon and in the country, \nto make things in Oregon and across America, add value to them here, \nand ship them somewhere because this is an extraordinary opportunity we \nhave in front of us in terms of expanding exports.\n\n  The fact is, the American brand--the brand that is attached to \nAmerican goods--the exports we send all over the globe are something \nconsumers worldwide want. That is my first point. More than 90 percent \nof the world's consumers live outside the United States--90 percent--\nand they are all potential customers for the products we make in the \nUnited States. More customers for American products means American \nbusinesses have to make more products. To make more products, they go \nout and hire more workers. Hiring more workers to make more products to \nsell to more consumers is the upside of the trade debate we are \nstarting today.\n  Dismantling trade barriers to American exports gives our businesses \naccess to those new consumers. Doing that creates and supports good-\npaying jobs--jobs people can support a family on, with a family-wage \njob.\n  As I mentioned, trade-related jobs provide better benefits and pay \nthan many of those jobs unrelated to international trade. That is why \nwhen we have an opportunity to open markets to American products and \nAmerican exports we ought to take advantage of it.\n  Point No. 2 is that our successful efforts to open markets are \nundermined when foreign governments and foreign competitors cheat. I \nuse that word specifically because cheating is exactly what engaging in \nunfair trade practices that work to undermine our producers and our \ninnovators is all about. So a central component of our trade policy \nalways has to be enforcement--enforcement of U.S. trade laws and global \ntrade rules.\n  Senator Snowe, Senator Portman, Senator Blunt, Senator McCaskill, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Brown, and I have been focused specifically on \nstopping foreign suppliers from laundering their merchandise to evade \nU.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. These are the duties \nthat are put in place to remedy the damage that unfairly traded imports \ncause to American producers. Those foreign trade cheats, especially \nthose from China, have been found guilty of dumping their goods in our \ncountry. Instead of stopping the dumping or paying the appropriate \nduties, the Chinese goods are shipped into a country such as Korea \nwhere the goods get repacked into boxes that say ``Made in Korea'' in \norder to avoid the U.S. trade remedy laws.\n  All of this has been occurring under the sleepy eyes--the sleepy \neyes--of our customs agency. Fortunately, with bipartisan support, the \nSenate is positioned to act on this matter and address the issue. It \nwill not come a minute too soon.\n  I was stunned when the staff of my Subcommittee on International \nTrade basically set up a sting operation, set up a dummy company, and \nwe were amazed at the number of firms, particularly from China, that \nbasically said: Look, we are plenty interested in figuring out how to \nget around American trade laws.\n  So these foreign trade cheats are out there. They are looking for \nways to exploit the fact that the customs agency has not been tough, \nhas not been relentless, particularly not with respect to protecting \nour manufacturers.\n  So point No. 2 is to make sure in the days ahead we put in place a \nstronger response to trade cheating, where cheats from China and other \ncountries literally launder their merchandise, stamp it as coming from \nsomewhere else, in order to avoid our trade laws.\n  The third point speaks to the bill we discuss today, and especially \nto the valuable Casey-Brown-Baucus amendment that I hope we will be \nvoting on shortly. America's ability to compete in the global economy \nrests on opening foreign markets, enforcing the trade rules, and \npreparing our workforce--the American workforce, the workforce on which \nAmerican businesses depend--to be globally competitive for the jobs of \ntomorrow.\n  That is what the TAA, trade adjustment assistance, Program is all \nabout. Just as over 90 percent of the world's consumers live outside \nthe United States, so does over 90 percent of the world's workers. \nAlthough we have the most productive, innovative workforce in the \nworld, sometimes a foreign producer finds a way to do something better \nor produce something more efficiently than an American one. The result \nis, we can have Americans losing jobs through no fault of their own.\n  So the Congress decided long ago that the best way to respond to \nglobal competition was to meet it head on, to meet it directly, and \nthat is what a trade agenda with a robust Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram does.\n  Trade adjustment assistance throws a lifeline to the workers who lose \ntheir jobs, and to their families, because we have been open, we have \nbeen free, we have been expansionist in the area of trade, particularly \nwhen it comes to creating exports. Trade adjustment assistance provides \nAmerican workers with an opportunity to acquire the skills they need to \nnot just become reemployed but to help American businesses better \ncompete in the global marketplace while those families make their way \nback to the American economy, where they can earn a wage at which they \ncan support their families.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is a pretty modest program. The lifeline \nthat is thrown to these workers is modest--just a few hundred dollars a \nweek on average--and the job training that is provided to those workers \nis typically provided through existing infrastructure such as our \ncommunity colleges. Trade adjustment assistance provides just enough \nassistance for resourceful and thrifty and industrious workers to \nrebound from a trade-related job loss. That, in effect, is what I hope \nwe can start looking at programs such as trade adjustment assistance as \nbeing.\n  What we want these programs to be all about is to be something of a \ntrampoline, where, in effect, people can get a modest amount of \nassistance, and through that modest amount of assistance be in a \nposition to bounce back to the American economy with skills that have \nbeen improved and be in a position to again make a good wage at a \ncompany that can be involved in areas such as exports and productivity \nand innovation-driven services.\n  For much of the last half of the century, the United States \nvigorously promoted an open and global economy. As a result, our \ncountry launched an effort to become the largest, most dynamic market \nin the world. Today that global market is more competitive than ever \nbefore. The rise of China and India and other emerging markets,\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nsuch as Brazil and Russia, provide extraordinary opportunities to our \ninnovators and our producers. But we do not get to be the top economy \nas a result of some kind of entitlement program. We have to constantly \nwork at it. We have to constantly work at the task of making more \ninnovative and more productive goods and services.\n  Together, Federal Government officials, businesses, and workers have \nthe opportunity to seize the possibilities that a global economy \nprovides and also overcome its challenges. Certainly, it is more \nimportant than ever to do that in the face of growing foreign \ncompetition. That means joining again now, on a bipartisan basis, to \nsupport trade adjustment assistance.\n  I would just like to note, having been involved in these issues since \nI came to the Senate, trade adjustment assistance has historically been \na bipartisan program. It has been a program where the Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, consistently said we can look at trade, we \ncan look at exports as a vehicle for more family-wage jobs in our \ncountry--making things here, growing things here, adding value to them \nhere, and shipping them somewhere. But certainly, in an ever-changing \nworld, we are going to see some of our workers needing the \nopportunities to upgrade their skills that trade adjustment assistance \nallows.\n  So I very much hope my colleagues will support the Casey-Brown-Baucus \namendment. It has my full support. It is very much in the spirit of the \nbipartisan work that has been done on trade adjustment assistance in \nthe past.\n  Mr. President, I see other colleagues waiting to speak, and with \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            Fiscal Planning\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, yesterday, the President provided a \nfiscal plan on paper that he said reflects his latest fiscal vision for \nthe country. It seems to be about the fourth vision we have had this \nyear, and he has said we need to be honest with the American people and \ntalk straight to them. I certainly believe that is correct, and I would \nshare some thoughts about the President's plan and express \ndisappointment that he has not been honest and direct with the American \npeople, has not discussed in sufficient depth, in my opinion, the \nNation's need to reduce spending because our debt is surging larger \nthan it ever has in our history and presents a danger today and in the \nfuture.\n  The President needs to talk more about that. If we are going to ask \nthe American people to reduce their spending, to take less from the \ngovernment, to tighten belts, then we need to know why. I do believe he \nhas not been sufficiently informative in his conversations because many \nof them emphasize increasing investments in various programs, in \nspending programs he has advocated, but with regard to the plan that \nwas introduced yesterday he claims it would increase the fiscal year \n2012 deficit by $300 billion; that is, next year it would increase the \ndebt by $300 billion, but he says it would reduce deficits over the \nnext 10 years, in the outyears, by $3.2 trillion.\n  We know what happens now happens. Spending that occurs today--the \nmoney is out the door--and promises to raise revenue in the future \nbecome less certain as each year passes by.\n  But assuming this is true, assuming we would actually do in the next \n10 years the kind of things that would pay for this short-term \nspending, I would advise my colleagues that the fundamental claim the \nPresident is making--assuming his numbers are correct, and we do the \nthings he suggests--it overstates by $1.8 trillion the amount of the \nsavings. Mr. President, $3.2 trillion, no. Mr. President, $1.8 trillion \nreduced from that, and we are looking at about $1.4 trillion in savings \nand not $3.2 trillion. That is the fact. I will share with my \ncolleagues the sad, grim fact of that.\n  How did it happen? Well, the bill, as the Washington Post said, is \nbeing criticized because of gimmicks that are in it.\n  First gimmick: The war-funding gimmick. The plan shows $1.1 trillion \nover 10 years in savings from putting a cap on war-spending costs. But \nthose costs are going to decrease as the war effort unwinds whether or \nnot this proposal is in place. They have been long been planned.\n  The President's proposed caps on war spending manipulate baseline \nconcepts to show the savings that have been long planned and new--\nsomething he came up with this week, I suppose--new choices which \ninflate the spending cuts in his plan. In other words, it inflates the \namount of spending he has cut by $1.1 trillion.\n  The Congress has dealt with this little gimmick in the budgetary \nprocess. I serve as ranking member on the Budget Committee, and we \nwrestled with these baselines and scoring possibilities. But that \ngimmick--the $1.1 trillion gimmick--was rejected during the recent debt \nceiling debate, raising the debt limit. We talked about that and we \ndidn't do it because it is not an accurate explanation of the cutting \nof spending. We don't have any plan to continue to spend in Iraq and \nAfghanistan the $158 billion we spend this year. And for 10 years? Give \nme a break. That has never been our plan and shouldn't be assumed as a \nbaseline for spending. Claiming credit for not continuing that is not a \nlegitimate way to analyze how much you have cut spending.\n  Some have said Paul Ryan and the House Republicans, when they passed \ntheir budget, included the $1.1 trillion when they said they reduced \nspending by $6.2 trillion. They proposed a budget to cut $6.2 trillion. \nThey also proposed a growth-oriented tax reduction and simplification \nplan that would create economic growth, netting out $4 trillion in \nactual savings. But Paul Ryan and his committee did not--I have checked \nthe numbers--consider $1.1 trillion in war savings--which no one has \ndisputed should occur--off the present amount we are spending. He did \nnot include that in the $6.2 trillion. He did have an alternative \nanalysis that showed that, and people have seized upon that to say his \nfundamental proposal of a $6.2 trillion spending reduction included it. \nIt did not.\n  Another big gimmick--one used too often in this body--is what we call \nthe doc fix of Medicare. The Balanced Budget Act, in the late 1990s, \nproposed substantial reductions in physician fees. As the years have \ngone by, it has become more and more plain that doctors cannot sustain \na 20-percent reduction or more in their fees for doing Medicare work. \nSo each year we put that money back in. But it is part of the plan of a \nlong-term budget. The statute itself has not been changed. So every \nyear we have this little problem: Are we going to cut the doctors 22 \npercent or are we going to avoid cutting the doctors 22 percent? Well, \nwe don't want to cut the doctors that much. They can't function. That \nis too big a cut for them. So we find the money some way every year. \nMostly, we have borrowed it.\n  The President's plan assumes that money will be found for the doc fix \nand they will do it over 10 years to the tune of $293 billion. This \ntrick counts the higher spending as a given rather than as a policy \nchoice that needs to be offset. Without this gimmick, the President's \nhealth care savings of $320 billion the plan suggests will occur \nbecomes health care savings of only $27 billion. You don't save $293 \nbillion because of this gimmick because it is unpaid for. There is no \nsource of income to pay for the President's assumption. We will pay \n$293 billion, which means he only saves $27 billion in health care, not \n$320 billion.\n  I believe this is a truly honest and fair analysis of the President's \nproposal. It is incorrect, putting it kindly.\n  There is another little gimmick. When the President talks about \ncutting spending--when he says we are cutting spending--what does he \ninclude in that? He is counting as spending reductions the net interest \neffects of his proposed policy changes, even though interest costs are \nthe secondary effect of his proposed tax hikes.\n  For example, if you raise taxes and don't cut spending--and spending \nhas not been cut in this plan--you raise taxes and you reduce projected \ndeficits, we think about $1.4 trillion under the plan, less than half \nof what was projected, then you don't pay as much interest because you \ndon't accrue as much debt. And you don't pay as much interest on a debt \nthat is not accrued. They are scoring that as if they cut spending, \nwhen it is a natural by-product of increased taxes.\n  So when you remove the accounting tricks and the Washington gimmicks\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nthat have contributed to this country being in the fiscal condition we \nare in, you are left with only half of the $3 trillion in deficit \nreduction the White House promised.\n  The White House also claims the President's plan has $2 in spending \ncuts for every $1 in tax hikes--$2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax \nincreases. Indeed, early in the year he suggested we should have a plan \nthat would have $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax hikes. But is \nthis accurate? Is it true we are achieving $2 in spending cuts for $1 \nin tax hikes?\n  If you eliminate the gimmicks, you will see it is absolutely not \ntrue. Under the plan, total Federal spending--including the jobs plan's \nstimulus bill--the new stimulus bill--will increase. The President's \nplan will not decrease total Federal spending. It will increase, not \ndecrease. There is no cut in spending. On balance, there is not a penny \nof net spending that is cut--on net.\n  In a speech, the President said:\n\n       I'm proposing real serious cuts in spending. When you \n     include the $1 trillion in cuts that I've already signed into \n     law, these would be among the biggest cuts in spending in our \n     history.\n\n  Well, that is not true. It is not accurate. I don't think it bodes \nwell for us to be able to reach an agreement on these very serious \nissues if the President is pretending his plan cuts war costs or counts \ninterest that shouldn't be counted or proposes we have a doc fix \nwithout any money with which to fix it. Those are the kinds of things \nthat get us into trouble.\n  Despite the substantial increase in taxation under the President's \nplan, deficits would not be tamed. At no point over the next 10 years \nwould deficits be smaller in nominal terms than the $459 billion \nrecorded before he became President. That is the highest deficit in \nhistory. President Bush was roundly criticized for the $459 billion \nduring his time. The lowest deficit under today's plan--the lowest over \n10 years--would be $476 billion in the outyears, and it would start \ngoing back up again under the plan they propose, leading to a $565 \nbillion deficit in 2021. And by the way, the last 3 years of deficits \nhave been $1.3 trillion, $1.2 trillion, and this year will be $1.4 \ntrillion in debt. So next year's deficit will actually surge beyond the \ncurrent projections. We had hoped they would come down. But because of \nthe new spending in this plan, $350 billion will be added to the \ndeficit next year, putting us well over $1 trillion in deficit again \nnext year. At a time when we should be reducing deficit spending, the \nimmediate impact of the plan will be to increase spending, fostering \nmore fear and uncertainty in our economy and the conclusion among the \nfinancial investors here and worldwide that we still haven't gotten the \nmessage and we are still out of control.\n  Over the next 10 years, deficits would total $6.4 trillion, and gross \nFederal debt would grow by $9.7 trillion. Gross Federal debt would grow \nby $9.7 trillion, exceeding $24 trillion in 2021, when last year we had \nabout a $13 trillion debt. That would put our debt over 100 percent of \nGDP.\n  Properly accounting for the effect of the President's proposed policy \nchanges, the actual amount of debt reduction proposed by the President \nis $1.4 trillion, consisting of $146 billion in spending increases that \nwould increase the debt and $1.5 trillion in tax increases. So we may \nhave raised a few weeks ago our legal debt limit, allowing us to run up \nmore debt, but we have breached our economic debt limit. America's \n$14.5 trillion gross debt we have today is 100 percent of our economy.\n  A prominent study from economists Rogoff and Reinhart--praised by \nSecretary Geithner as ``excellent''--shows when a nation's gross debt \nreaches 90 percent of GDP it loses, on average, a percentage point or \nmore in GDP growth that year. Our debt is depressing growth. Our debt \nis now 100 percent of GDP, and our growth is unexpectedly slow this \nyear. Could that be a part of the cause? Some economists say no, but it \ncertainly is consistent with the projections in their plan.\n  So the plan that was presented, I have to say, is gimmick piled upon \ngimmick, adding up to little more than a tax hike camouflaged as fiscal \nrestraint. Promised spending control is nowhere to be found. When you \nare in a crisis, you must deal honestly with the American people. You \nmust present the facts, along with a credible solution, and call on the \npeople to respond and sacrifice together. Americans are good, decent, \nhard-working people who will accept a difficult choice if given to them \nin honest terms. But the White House is trying to be clever at the \nexpense of being credible.\n  The debt is destroying jobs today, I believe. If we are going to \nrestore confidence in growth, credibility in the President and in \nCongress is one asset we cannot afford to borrow against.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, can I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate my colleague \nSenator Wyden on his work on this legislation, and also would thank him \nfor his efforts to reach an agreement to improve our Tax Code. It is a \nbig deal. A lot of expert witnesses have appeared before the Budget \nCommittee. Senator Wyden is a member of the Budget Committee. Those \nwitnesses have told us that properly improving our Tax Code could \nimprove growth, create jobs, and make America stronger. I appreciate \nthe Senator's hard work and am looking at his proposal and thank him \nfor contributing positively to the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just before he leaves the floor, let me \ntell Senator Sessions how much I appreciate the kind words and enjoy \nworking with him. We serve on the Budget Committee together and talk \noften about economic issues. I wish to tell my colleague that I look \nforward to working with him on tax and budget issues in the days ahead \nespecially.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 626\n\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do now is take just a couple \nminutes to talk about the amendment offered by the distinguished \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, to extend trade promotion \nauthority--what is known as TPA--for 2 years.\n  I am certainly interested in working with the leader. Certainly, \nChairman Baucus has made it very clear that he wants to continue to \nwork on this issue. But I would oppose the McConnell amendment this \nafternoon, and I want to outline specifically why.\n  The last time Congress passed trade promotion authority was in 2002, \nessentially almost one decade ago. The McConnell amendment would simply \ncontinue Congress's instructions that were formulated back then, as I \nsaid, almost one decade ago. But the fact is, the American economy has \nchanged dramatically since TPA was adopted last, and the overseas trade \nbarriers have changed dramatically. Yet the McConnell amendment simply \nhasn't kept up with the times. What I wish to do is outline a few \nexamples of areas where we face very different economic challenges.\n  I would also like to say we talked about this very briefly in the \nSenate Finance Committee. It was raised by the ranking minority member \non our subcommittee, Senator Thune. So it is clear there is an interest \nin the Finance Committee in working on this issue.\n  Trade promotion authority is a hugely important and complicated \nissue. When it was considered the last time, there were extensive \nhearings in the Finance Committee. Many amendments were authored. There \nwas considerable time devoted to it. That has not been the case at all \nwith respect to reauthorization, and it is why, in particular, I wish \nto make sure that when the Congress next deals with trade promotion \nauthority, we deal with some of the most important challenges. I am \ngoing to outline a few of those.\n  Digital goods and services would be of special concern that we have \nlooked at in our community. Digital goods, for an example, would be \nsoftware. Digital services would highlight cloud computing. I know it \nis something that has been of great interest in Minnesota. It is all \nabout the Internet playing an increasing role in the American and the \nglobal economy. It is a platform for global commerce.\n  I believe the Internet represents the shipping lane of the 21st \ncentury. It is\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nthe shipping lane for goods and services, and the 2002 version of trade \npromotion authority doesn't have the kinds of policies that are \nnecessary to address today's challenges that affect our ability to \nexport American goods and digital services.\n  A second example would be the question of labor and environmental \nstandards with respect to our trade goals and intellectual property \nprotection for pharmaceutical drugs.\n  In May of 2007, congressional Democrats and Republicans got together, \non a bipartisan basis, to update trade goals with respect to key issues \nsuch as labor and the environment and intellectual property protection \nas it related to pharmaceutical drugs and therapies. These agreements \nthat were entered into in 2007 aren't reflected in the 2002 version of \ntrade promotion authority. So extending the 2002 version of trade \npromotion authority is another area where, if we simply support the \nMcConnell amendment this afternoon, trade policy has not kept up with \nthe times.\n  Finally, I would just like to mention China. The fact is, in 2002, we \nhad a relatively short experience with China at the World Trade \nOrganization and, more than ever before, state-owned enterprises play a \nrole in global commerce, particularly given the rise of China. I think \nall of us agree our trade agenda ought to include promoting discipline \nso state-owned enterprises do not undermine the American private \nsector. That requires reconsidering, again, the provisions found in the \n2002 version of trade promotion authority.\n  What it comes down to is that this issue deserves more consideration \nthan a floor amendment with just a modest number of Senators even being \naware of the history and the issues and the complexity of the issues. \nIn fact, it would be fair to say that a significant number of Senators \non both sides of the aisle weren't even a member of this body back when \ntrade promotion was considered last in 2002.\n  So what it comes down to for me is, American trade policy is too \nimportant to construct on the back of a galloping horse. That, in my \nview, would be what the Senate would be doing if it simply adopted the \nMcConnell amendment. Chairman Baucus is opposed to this amendment. He, \nsuch as myself, has made it clear he is interested in working with \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis on this issue, and it is an important \npart of the role of both the executive branch and the Congress in terms \nof looking at trade policy, and it is particularly important right now \nwhen, in a host of areas--I will give another example.\n  I cited already digital goods and environmental labor standards and \nstate-owned enterprises. We had a very valuable hearing in the \nSubcommittee on Trade Finance on fishing issues, which are also playing \nan increasingly important global role in trade agreements and trade \npolicy. That also was not part of any discussion back in 2002. Those \nissues and others need to be aired. They ought to be aired on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I thought Senator Thune, when we were in the Finance Committee, was \nright to ask about this issue. There is going to be an opportunity in \nthe days ahead to work on this. Chairman Baucus has made it clear that \nhe wants to work with colleagues on a bipartisan basis on trade \npromotion authority. I do as well. I already made that pledge to the \nranking member of our subcommittee, Senator Thune, who has been very \neasy to work with on a host of these trade issues. He has made some \nparticularly important points with respect to digital goods and \nservices and the opportunity for our high-tech sector--wrote a good \narticle on it just a couple days ago.\n  Suffice it to say, there is a lot of interest on our side of the \naisle in working on this issue. But I would urge colleagues to resist \nthe McConnell amendment this afternoon when it comes up for a vote for \nthe reasons I have outlined, and there will be time for the kind of \ndebate on trade promotion that I think is appropriate, one that \nreflects the opportunities and challenges of an economy in 2011 that is \nvery different than the one we were addressing when we last did trade \npromotion authority in 2002.\n  In an effort to come up with a unanimous consent agreement that can \nresolve the question of the upcoming votes, I would just say to \nSenators on both sides of the aisle that certainly the next hour would \nbe a very good time for Senators who would like to speak on the Casey-\nBrown-Baucus amendment or the McConnell amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iraq Deadline\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, during a trip to Baghdad this past \nJanuary, I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the \nMontana National Guard's 163rd Combined Arms Battalion. That day, I \ntold them that I was proud of each and every one of them, from unit \ncommander LTC T.J. Hull and SGM John Wood, right on down the line. \nThrough courageous service to our country, they were making tremendous \nsacrifices on our behalf, and they were representing the very best of \nMontana.\n  This month, these folks have been coming back home to Montana from \ntheir demobilizing station in Washington State. Today, I join their \nfamilies, their friends, and their neighbors in welcoming the last \ngroup of those citizen soldiers back to Montana.\n  Job well done, soldiers. And I thank you.\n  For nearly a year, these 600 Montanans served in some of the harshest \nconditions imaginable--escorting numerous convoys across dangerous \nterrain and conducting other critical security missions throughout \nIraq. At one point over the last 12 months, this unit accounted for \nmore than half of Montana's best and brightest serving overseas. They \ngave up the comforts of their families, their homes, and their \ncommunities to bring stability to a nation on the other side of the \nworld. Through it all, they showed courage in difficult times. They \nremained strong. And they were always in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Now they are home. It is our duty to continue our support by \nproviding the benefits, quality care, and services they need as they \ntransition back to their families, to their jobs, and to their \ncommunities. Many Iraqi veterans make that transition with success, \ncoming home to good jobs and welcoming communities. But for others, \nmaking that transition is no easy task. It is no secret that there is a \npotential for higher rates of substance abuse, higher divorce rates, \nhigher unemployment rates. The effects of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injury can impact entire families. \nThankfully, veterans often look after each other. We should recognize \nthe important role of America's veterans service organizations and \ntheir willingness to help with that transition.\n  Montana was one of the first States in the Nation to adopt the Beyond \nthe Yellow Ribbon Program. It involves entire families of National \nGuard soldiers and airmen, preparing them for the changes that come \nbefore, during, and after deployment. The Beyond the Yellow Ribbon \nProgram is a success, and I am pleased that in the last Congress my \ncolleagues gave all States the resources to implement it.\n  Furthermore, I will do my best to make sure we keep up our end of the \nbargain. Whether it is college education, health care, or compensation \nfor an injury suffered on the field of battle, we will honor our \ncommitment to our heroes. We make this promise to the men and women of \nthe 163rd and to Montanans who make up the many other units of the \nMontana National Guard that were deployed this year and to those folks \nwho are part of Montana's Red Horse Squadron, now in Afghanistan. To \nour reservists and to the folks serving in the Active-Duty military \ntoday, we make the same commitment.\n  Even as we make this commitment, many folks in Montana are wondering \nwhat should happen next in Iraq. Since 2003, our Nation has sent \nhundreds of thousands of young men and women to\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\nfight in Iraq. We have done so at an enormous cost--4,474 Americans \nhave given their lives, and more than 32,000 have been wounded. We \ncannot put a number on those who suffer from the injuries that are \nunseen. And let's not forget that the price tag of this war that was \nput on our children is quickly approaching $1 trillion, and then there \nare the tens of billions of dollars in waste and fraud.\n  The war in Iraq started with political leaders who had their own \nagenda. They went there looking for weapons that never existed. But \nthrough it all, the professionalism of our military never faltered. \nThey provided security and democracy to a nation that had never known \nit.\n  But for far too long, Iraqi politicians did nothing to secure their \nown future. I first went to Iraq in 2007 and returned there again this \npast January. I was struck by how much it changed in those 4 years. \nIraq was finally moving forward after too many wasted years, too many \nwasted dollars, and too many lives lost. There are many reasons for the \nchange. The improved security from our military and the training \nprovided by our troops played a big role. But American diplomats and \nmilitary leaders told me that the biggest reason for the progress in \nIraq was this: The Iraqis were told in no uncertain terms that the \nUnited States was leaving. Our military presence would end on December \n31 of this year. That was what galvanized Iraqi politicians to take \ncontrol of their own country.\n  Today, I am sending a letter to the President calling on him to stand \nby his commitment to pull all U.S. Operation New Dawn troops out of \nIraq by the end of this year. We should bring the last of them home on \nschedule. U.S. marines will still guard our embassy, as they always \nhave, and we will still maintain a strong diplomatic presence in Iraq.\n  Despite this year's deadline, I know there is talk of the possibility \nof keeping a sizable force of U.S. troops in Iraq through next year. If \nthat is the case, it is not good. We cannot afford moving the \ngoalposts. Across Montana and this Nation, people are saying: Come home \nand come home now. I know sectarian violence in Iraq will continue. We \nshould not be asking American troops to referee a centuries-old civil \nwar. That conflict is likely to continue into the distant future \nregardless of our presence.\n  Iraq now has the tools it needs to secure its economy. Iraq must \nsolve the problems for its own people. Keeping thousands of U.S. troops \nin Iraq would needlessly put them in more danger, it would cost \nAmerican taxpayers more money, and it would further distract us from \nour core objectives of protecting U.S. citizens and further dismantling \nal-Qaida and other terrorist groups. That is where our focus must be, \nand that is why I am saying let's end this war for good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                      Sergeant Joshua J. Robinson\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Joshua J. Robinson of Douglas, Nebraska. \nSergeant Robinson was killed in action on August 7, 2011, while \nconducting patrol operations in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. He \nwas in his third tour of duty. His story of service comes to us at a \ntime when many are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the September \n11th terrorist attacks--a fitting time to recognize the patriotism of a \nfallen hero.\n  Sergeant Robinson enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2003, a time when \nOperation Iraqi Freedom was in the beginning stages and many were \nunsure of what was to come. He felt the call to serve and was \nrightfully proud of his commitment to defend and protect our country. \nSergeant Robinson's love of the outdoors provided him with many of the \nskills needed to be the best Marine he could be.\n  Sadly, his life was cut short too soon, and the Robinson family laid \ntheir Marine to rest in Hastings, Nebraska on August 16, 2011. Sergeant \nRobinson returned to his birthplace with valor and honor, having been \nawarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Medal, the Iraq Campaign \nMedal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, and many other decorations during his military \ncareer. He died a brave and most honorable death. We are proud to call \nhim one of our own.\n  The tradition of military service is strong in our great state of \nNebraska, but strong soldiers are not possible without the support of \nfamily. I am confident Nebraskans will rally around Sergeant Robinson's \nfamily during this difficult time. He is mourned by his wife, two sons, \nmother and stepfather, sisters, and many others. It is the strength of \nhis wife Rhonda that will remind Wyatt and Kodiak of the love their \nfather had for them and for his country.\n\n  His mother Misi provided insight into her son's position to serve \nwhen she said:\n\n       Our freedom was put on the line. It takes young men like \n     Josh to enlist and protect the USA.\n\n  I know his family is proud of him and will always remember his \nspirit, his competitiveness, and his enthusiasm for adventure.\n  May God bless the Robinson family and all of our fighting men and \nwomen in harm's way.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to mark a momentous day and \nto stand with the millions of Americans for whom the end of don't ask, \ndon't tell means the beginning of a real era of new equality for our \nNation. It has been 60 days since Secretary Panetta, Chairman Mullen, \nand President Obama certified the U.S. Armed Forces were ready for the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell. After 18 long years, today that policy \nfinally comes to an end.\n  This is an important day. It is a good day. Today is a good day \nbecause our Nation, in my view, is taking a major step forward not just \nin the pursuit of equal rights but in the pursuit of equal \nresponsibility. Today is a good day because we always talk about equal \nrights, but with don't ask, don't tell we are talking about Americans \nwho sought equal responsibility, Americans who wanted to serve their \nNation.\n  Nearly 14,000 LGBT Americans wanted to serve their Nation in their \nmilitary but were deemed unfit to serve not because of what they did \nbut because of whom they loved, as if loving another man made a soldier \nunable to aim a rifle or unwilling to die for his country. But for as \nmany servicemembers who were drummed out--both literally and \nfiguratively--under don't ask, don't tell, I cannot help but wonder how \nmany more served in silence, proud of their uniform but made to feel \nashamed of the person underneath.\n  LTC Charles George served his country for more than 30 years, \nincluding 28 years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army. His \nuniform is decorated with a wide range of medals and ribbons for \ndedicated service. When he graduated from ROTC in 1980, Charlie's \nboyfriend Dennis was there, and he wrote to me recently about his \nexperience. He said:\n\n       I sat next to his mother, keeping quiet so I wouldn't draw \n     attention to our relationship. During his actual pinning, my \n     eyes never left his for the entire process. I was so proud of \n     him. At one point, his eyes found me in the audience and we \n     smiled to each other. I still remember that moment.\n\n  That was the last of those moments they would have. In 30 years of \ndedicated Army service, that ROTC ceremony was the only military \nactivity of Charlie's that Dennis would be able to be a part of. \nCharlie was determined to serve our Nation, and so they had to keep \ntheir relationship a secret.\n  Charlie steadily rose through the ranks to first lieutenant and then \nto captain. He was promoted to major and ultimately lieutenant colonel. \nThese were all proud moments for Charlie,\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nbut Dennis could not be in the room for any of them. ``The only thing \nharder than being a soldier is loving one,'' they would later recall \nhearing. I would offer the only thing harder than loving a soldier \nwould be having to keep that love a secret from the world for a decade.\n  After 9/11, then-MAJ Charlie George was activated from Reserve duty, \nand like so many military families they discussed their now uncertain \nfuture. If Charlie had died in the service of his country, there would \nbe no call on Dennis's phone from the Army, no knock on his door. \nDennis would receive no crispily folded flag presented by a military \nhonor guard. Dennis would never be able to be buried next to Charlie at \nthe Arlington National Cemetery.\n  For 31 years they kept their relationship and their love a secret. \nColonel George retired this year--a milestone he will celebrate next \nmonth in Rehoboth Beach, DE. For the first time since that ROTC \nceremony more than three decades earlier, Dennis will be there proudly \nlooking on. No more secrets, no more hiding, just the respect and \ndignity they both deserve--not just because of Charlie's long and \ndedicated service to the U.S. Army or because of Dennis's silent \nsacrifice but because they are both Americans.\n  I was proud to cosponsor the repeal of don't ask, don't tell last \nfall. I was even prouder to vote for it. Madam President, 3 months ago \nI was 1 of 13 Senators to record a video telling the gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, and transgender youth of this country that it gets better. As \nAmericans we tell our kids that equality for all is a founding \nprinciple of our Nation, but our actions in so many ways have in the \npast failed to live up to these brave words. Our video was a promise to \nthis generation of Americans, to the generation of my children, a \npromise that we are working to build an America free of legal \ndiscrimination, free of discrimination in our society; that LBGT youth \nhave a future in this country where they will be entitled to the same \nrights, privileges, and responsibilities as every other American.\n  Bit by bit we are going to tear down these walls of \ndiscrimination. This is how we make it better. Don't ask, don't tell \nwas discrimination, plain and simple. But today it is no more. Today is \na good day.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Blunt pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1583 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few minutes today \nabout the bill that is on the floor, the amendment, in fact, to the \ngeneral system of trade preferences bill. That amendment is trade \nadjustment assistance. Frankly, it is not a bill I would have drafted \non my own, but my guess is neither would have the two people who \nnegotiated the bill. This is a compromise between Chairman Camp in the \nHouse and the Senator from Montana here. It is a compromise that \nreflects exactly that. It is not what either one of them may have come \nup with, and certainly not what I would have come up with. But, based \non the President's determination, it is essential to move on to the \nthree trade agreements that have been waiting to be voted on for 3 \nyears now.\n  I intend to vote for this. I am looking carefully at the amendments. \nI am supportive of the two amendments we will vote on today. But if \nthey would disrupt the balance of this agreement that has been made, I \nam going to look very carefully at that as these votes are cast.\n  Certainly, I wish for this President and all of his successors to \nhave trade promotion authority. I think we have seen the difficulty of \nthe President being able to negotiate a treaty as an agreement. A trade \nagreement that comes to the Senate and that could be amended by the \nSenate and which takes two-thirds of the Senate to approve--those days \nare over. Before trade promotion authority, we had essentially gotten \nout of the treaty agreement on trade because who wants to make that \nkind of agreement? Who wants to get into a room and negotiate a trade \nagreement only to see the thing maybe they thought was the biggest \nthing they had given up or the biggest thing they had gotten taken out \nof the agreement before the Senate votes on it?\n\n  So this up-or-down, yes-or-no, majority-in-the-Senate and majority-\nin-the-House trade promotion authority is very important. I wish we had \nan agreement that this President wanted right now, and that the next \nPresident--whoever that is and whenever that is--would have the ability \nto continue, because since we ran out of the trade promotion authority \nlaw, we have not had any agreements negotiated.\n  In fact, the three we have negotiated now, I want to talk about for a \nminute, but they have been available for 3 years and I am eager for the \nPresident to send them up. The President says this TAA issue, this \ntrade adjustment assistance issue, has to be understood to be completed \nand will be completed, or at least he has to be assured it will be \ncompleted, before we get those three agreements.\n  It would be fine with me if we could adjust this some. I want to see \nthe bill of my good friend from Oregon, who is on the floor, Mr. Wyden, \nconsidered, of which I have cosponsored, on transshipments, where many \nof us in this body have problems in our States--I have two major \nproblems I could talk about for a long time, but I will not today--\nwhere the proper authority has looked at what is happening, and they \nsaid: No, you have unfair trade practices. So there is a penalty on the \ncountry that is using those unfair practices to compete. But then what \nthat country does is they start labeling the product as if it were from \nsomewhere else, and they may ship the product through that other \ncountry and get it labeled there or they may short circuit that and put \nthe label on it in their own country and say it was made somewhere else \nso when it comes in here, suddenly it does not have that penalty. \nWhether that is relabeling or I think, as my good friend from Oregon \ncalls it, merchandise laundering, where you make the merchandise appear \nto be something it is not, so you no longer pay the penalty, I would \nlove to see that on a bill here in the near future.\n  The other Senator from Oregon and I have a bill on affordable \nfootwear that has trade impact I would love to see on a bill. This is a \nbill that potentially might have jurisdiction to go on. But that is not \nthe agreement that has been made between the House and the Senate. I am \ngoing to be supporting that agreement and not doing anything that makes \nit impossible for us to get these three trade agreements. I am \nabsolutely banking on the commitment by the President of the United \nStates that if this happens, the three trade agreements come to the \nCongress. When they come to the Congress, I believe they pass the House \nand Senate, and they create great opportunity for American workers to \nsend their products to other countries.\n  One of these agreements that has been there for a long time is the \nagreement with Colombia. Colombia already is able to ship its products \nin here without tariff under something that routinely passes the \nCongress called the Andean Preferences Act. So this is not about \nwhatever labor conditions there are in Colombia. Their products already \ncome here. This is about whether U.S. workers are going to have every \npossible advantage in Colombia. This is about whether Caterpillars made \nin the United States or John Deere tractors or moving equipment made in \nthe United States has the same advantage in Colombia that the same \npiece of equipment made in Canada has. Right now, they do not have that \nadvantage. We need to see that they do.\n  As to Korea, the European Union negotiated a trade agreement long \nafter we negotiated this agreement, but it went into effect the first \nof July, and the year-to-year comparison, July over July, is, I think, \n38 percent bigger this July than it was last July. The only difference \nbetween this July and last July is the trade agreement.\n  These are three countries where all of their trading history, all of \ntheir buying history--Panama being the third of the three--would be \nthat given the choice of an American product to buy or a product from \nany other country but their own, they would give preference to the \nAmerican product.\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nBut we are giving away that market advantage by not creating this \nopportunity for American workers and American companies, big and small.\n  Agriculture is a huge beneficiary of these agreements. Lots of \nagriculture, lots of grain crop agriculture, lots of meat crop \nagriculture--whether it is chickens or poultry of all kinds or pork or \nbeef--is very dependent on American family farmers who will see a great \nopportunity in each of these countries, given the opportunity to get \ntheir product under these agreements.\n  I am hoping that enough of my colleagues and I are able to get this \ngeneral system of preferences bill, as amended with the TAA, done so we \ncan get on to the job-creating work of these three trade bills. These \nare opportunities to create more private sector American jobs. Over and \nover, almost every Member of the Senate says that should be our No. 1 \npriority. The President says that is his No. 1 priority.\n  This work, combined as we get to the trade agreements, lets us do the \neasiest part of job creation and our No. 1 priority, which is to let \nAmerican workers compete in places where the consumer wants to buy \nAmerican products, eliminate those barriers, and move forward with \nthese agreements and the bill on the floor today. Then, hopefully, we \ncan get to the transshipment bill; hopefully, we can get to the \nAffordable Footwear Act, and, hopefully, we will eventually see TPA. \nThe Senator from Utah has a bill that would synchronize trade \nadjustment assistance with any trade bill. And, of course, we should do \nthat.\n  But let's get this work done. I look forward to this being done, and \nthe President sending the bills up so that before the next month \npasses, hopefully, we will be seeing American products have the \nadvantage they have been waiting for now or at least eliminate the \ndisadvantage they have had needlessly for the 3 years since these \nagreements were all negotiated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I want to respond very briefly to my \nfriend from Missouri, and then I know the Senator from California is \nhere, and she wishes to speak for about 10 minutes. I am going to be \nvery brief.\n  First, I want to thank Senator Blunt for working with us in a \nbipartisan way. He played a key role in trying to advance this issue \nand worked very closely with all of us in the Finance Committee, \nChairman Baucus, myself, and others.\n  The Senator from Missouri is absolutely right with respect to the \ntariff issue. The fact is, the American market is open. We essentially \nhave some of the lowest tariffs around. In many of the markets around \nthe world--and certainly in a number of areas with these three \ncountries--we face much higher tariffs. So if we come up with an effort \nto, in effect, level the playing field, that means American companies, \nparticularly American exporters, benefit more than do the folks around \nthe world. So I think the point the Senator from Missouri has made is a \nvery valid one.\n  I also want to thank him for his comment with respect to the trade \ncheats. We are going to have further discussions with respect to TPA, \nand I see the distinguished ranking minority member. When we talked \nabout this in committee, I made it very clear I intend to keep working \nwith Senator Hatch and Senator Thune, who is the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. The challenge is to make sure TPA keeps up with the \ntimes. Because if we just reauthorize in 2011 TPA of 2002, we are not \ngoing to be dealing with digital goods and digital services, we are not \ngoing to be dealing with State-run enterprises, we are not going to be \ndealing with labor and environmental issues. That is why we are going \nto have to continue that work in a bipartisan way.\n  Madam President, Senator Boxer was going to speak next. Then I \nunderstand Senator Hatch wants to discuss his amendment, and I intend \nto remain for that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, first, I want to say thank you to the \nleadership on this bill. This trade adjustment assistance is so \ncritical. When we talk about creating jobs, we also want to talk about \nretraining those who need, in this century, the new kinds of training \nit takes to keep up in this economy and this world economy. So I want \nto thank them for their leadership.\n\n\n                       Jobs and Deficit Reduction\n\n  Madam President, I want to talk about jobs and deficit reduction. The \ngood news on this front is that President Obama has presented to the \nNation both a jobs plan and a deficit reduction plan. He has shown the \nNation, through this plan, that while we must cut the deficit and the \ndebt in the long term, we have to focus on jobs in the short term. His \nplan ensures that middle-class Americans get the jobs and the \nopportunities they need to continue to move ahead. It also makes sure \nwe have a fair tax system in place so everyone pays his or her own fair \nshare--not too much, not too little, but fair. So this approach is \nwelcome.\n  I will tell you why I welcome it. Because the approach outlined by \nPresident Obama--deficit and debt reduction, investments in jobs--was \nthe same vision that worked before when Bill Clinton was the President. \nI had the honor of being here in this body to support those policies. \nPeople forget that when Bill Clinton became President, there were \ndeficits and debt as far as the eye could see, and this country was \ngoing on the wrong path. What he did was to make sure everyone paid his \nor her own fair share so we had the revenues we needed to make the \ninvestments we needed to create the jobs we needed.\n  In those years, the investments were in high-tech and biotech, and we \nreally broke through on the global scene. Madam President, 23 million \njobs were created and deficits were turned into surpluses. I remember \nlooking back at the record. Some of my Republican colleagues who are \nstill here today said: The Clinton approach is going to lead to the \nworst deficits, no job creation. They were incorrect.\n  We lived through it, and we know that vision of cutting spending on \nwhat does not work, increasing spending on investments, everyone paying \ntheir fair share--all that turned into prosperity, 23 million jobs. \nWhat perplexes me is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwant to go back to the Bush years, trickledown economics, more tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires, no investments, so we even \nlose funding for our teachers, our firefighters, our nurses, and even \nour transportation stakeholders.\n  I am so grateful we passed an extension of the highway bill for 6 \nmonths. But, believe me, we face perils ahead because the House cuts \nthat bill by a third, and we have to make sure that does not happen \nbecause 1.8 million jobs are at stake.\n  So I am perplexed that my Republican friends only evidence compassion \nand concern for the millionaires and the billionaires, but not for the \nmiddle class. Their compassion for the wealthiest is overwhelming. \nTheir expressions of concern for billionaires--mind boggling. They call \nthem the job creators, even though they are not the ones creating the \njobs. The jobs are being created, if they are at all, by the way, by \nthe small businesspeople. For 64 percent of new jobs, the creation \ncomes from small business. They do not earn a million dollars. No \nway. So they call millionaires and billionaires job creators, which \nthey are not, and they cry bitter tears that we might ask a millionaire \nor a billionaire to pay a fair share.\n\n  When I was young--and maybe I shouldn't tell the truth because this \nis going to date me--there was a show on television called ``Dragnet.'' \nThe star of it was Joe Friday. Joe Friday used to say: ``Just the \nfacts.'' So let's look at just the facts. Let's look at the facts. Why \nare my Republican friends defending the wealthiest among us? Since \n1995, the wealthiest 400 Americans have seen their tax rates fall by 40 \npercent, while their average income has quadrupled. Let me say that \nagain. The wealthiest 400 families saw their income go up by four times \nand their tax rates went down by 40 percent. Why do they have to cry \nfor that situation? Why the tears?\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\n  Here is another fact and this is amazing. The wealthiest 400 families \nare worth more than 50 percent of American families. Let me say that \nagain. The wealthiest 400 families in America are worth more than 50 \npercent of America's families. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont \nbrought that fact to us. Why the tears for those 400 families?\n  One of those people, Warren Buffett, came forward. Bless his heart. \nHe said his effective tax rate is lower than his secretary's. His \neffective tax rate is lower than his secretary's. Why are we crying for \npeople who earn millions and billions and pay a lower effective tax \nrate than their secretaries? I thank Warren Buffett for coming forward \nand other millionaires and billionaires have come forward and basically \nunderscored that. Here is what he said:\n\n       My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a \n     billionaire-friendly government. It's time for our government \n     to get serious about shared sacrifice.\n\n  I think he is right. Why should a millionaire or billionaire pay an \neffective lower tax rate than firefighters who risk their lives every \nday, than nurses who save lives every day, than their own assistants \nand secretaries who are so important in running their enterprises? Our \nPresident Obama has suggested millionaires and billionaires pay the \nsame effective tax rate as their employees. That should be embraced, \nnot attacked as class warfare.\n  I ask, is it class warfare to say to a millionaire or a billionaire \nthey should pay the same effective tax rate as their secretary or is \nthat just the moral thing to do? It is the moral thing to do. Is it the \nfair thing to do? It is the fair thing to do. Our country needs \neveryone to help us as we tackle the deficit. So why the tears? Why the \ntears? These are not the job creators. These are not people who have \ngiven the last 10 years. We have seen their incomes rise exponentially \nand their taxes go down.\n  So I don't think it is class warfare at all. It is just a talking \npoint for Republicans. But since they have raised it, I would say this. \nI don't think it is class warfare to ask millionaires and billionaires \nto pay the same effective tax rate as their secretaries, but I think \nRepublican policies are class warfare on the middle class. Look at \ntheir policies. They would end Medicare and put middle-class senior \ncitizens in jeopardy. They want to privatize Social Security and put \nmiddle-class seniors in jeopardy. They want to cut one-third of the \nfunds from transportation, which would mean 600,000 layoffs for middle-\nclass workers.\n  They stopped us from helping small business by blocking Senator \nLandrieu's Small Business Innovation Act. They blocked the EDA--the \nEconomic Development Act--which would have created 1 million jobs over \n5 years. They have taken no action on the FAA bill. They have not \nappointed conferees, and we can't get that bill done that is hundreds \nof thousands of jobs.\n  When Republicans took control of the House, gross domestic product \nhad grown at an average of 2.5 percent after the Recovery Act. Now it \nis down to 0.7 percent--from 2.5 percent of growth to 0.7 percent. The \nRepublican Congress put the brakes on job creation, and that is a \nstrong reason why this economy has slowed.\n  Even before they have read the fine print of President Obama's \nproposal, they say it is dead on arrival. So let us be clear: Again, \nasking millionaires and billionaires to pay the same as their \nsecretaries is not class warfare, it is moral. Mark Cuban, the owner of \nthe Dallas Mavericks, says it is the most patriotic thing we can do.\n  So instead of crying for millionaires and billionaires, I am thinking \nof sending a box of Kleenex tissues over there to Paul Ryan, who is \nlamenting this attack on millionaires and billionaires. Poor thing. \nPoor guys, poor gals. Instead of doing that, let's fight for the middle \nclass around here. Let's get our arms around deficit reduction by \nasking everyone who can to pay their fair share.\n  By the way, let's give tax breaks to the middle class. Do you know \nthese same Republicans who are crying their tears for the millionaires \nand billionaires say they do not want to give a tax break to working \npeople? They are against the payroll tax proposal which would suspend \nthat payroll tax for a period of time. I ask them to stop blocking \nbills that would create jobs. Stop blocking tax breaks for the middle \nclass. Stop going after middle-class seniors. Stop crying for \nbillionaires and help us pass elements of the Obama jobs plan which \ninclude bipartisan proposals all of us have supported in the past.\n  I think that is critical. We did this before with Bill Clinton--we \ncreated jobs, we strengthened the middle class, and we created \nsurpluses by asking everyone to pay their fair share. Remember, when \nour President took over, this country was bleeding 700,000 jobs a \nmonth. I remember that--700,000 a month. We were on the verge of losing \nour automobile industry. This President took action. He doesn't get the \ncredit for that, and that is OK. There will be time enough to spell it \nout. But all we have to do is look back to those days. Credit was \nfrozen.\n  The Presiding Officer remembers that. Capitalism was coming to an \nend. This President acted. I have to say this: I don't want to go back \nto those days of bleeding 700,000 jobs a month. I don't want to go back \nto the days of credit freezes. I don't want to see these deficits \ncontinue. I want everyone to pay their fair share. Most of all, I want \njobs for the American people.\n  So if we can stop crying tears for the people who have it all and we \ncan roll up our sleeves and work together for the middle class, we will \nstrengthen this Nation. We will solve our problems, just as we did when \nBill Clinton was President. We have the roadmap. President Obama has \ntaken steps to follow that roadmap. We know it works. We will get these \ndeficits down, we will get the debt down, we will help the middle class \nand, yes, the wealthiest among us will pay the same tax rate \neffectively as their secretaries. You know what, if we do that, \nDemocrats and Republicans can feel good about this country again. Let's \nwork together and let's not say now that we can't ask billionaires to \npay their fair share and let's not keep the middle class from getting \ntheir tax cuts and their jobs. That is what is important.\n  I wish to thank the leaders on this issue for letting me have the \ntime to talk about this middle-class attack that we are seeing, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to talk about an amendment I \nintend to offer linking TAA expansion to enactment of the three pending \nfree-trade agreements.\n  I will send an amendment to the desk in the near future for \nconsideration. This amendment makes the effective date for additional \nTAA funding contingent upon the enactment of our free-trade agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  It is unfortunate this amendment is necessary. Supporters of this \ntrade adjustment assistance bill tell us that TAA is a necessary \nprecondition to submission of our pending free-trade agreements--a \nnecessary precondition of the President. The President and his \nsupporters say if TAA does not pass, the free-trade agreements will \nnever be sent to Congress for our consideration.\n  I find this logic disturbing. It basically boils down to this: Spend \nmore taxpayer money on one of our pet trade priorities or we will \nrefuse to allow Congress to vote on trade agreements that we know will \ncreate jobs. The administration has said it will create 250,000 new \njobs. By the way, at a time when unemployment is over 9 percent, I \nsimply can't understand why the President continues to hold up these \nFTAs and their consideration.\n  Even today, we don't know if the President will actually send the \nFTAs to Congress if we pass TAA. So my amendment is very simple. It \nallows TAA to be approved, but it will only go into effect once the \nPresident submits the trade agreements to Congress, they are all \napproved, and when they are signed into law.\n  To me, this amendment is about fundamental fairness. If we are to \nmeet the President's demands, we can at least ensure our top priorities \nare addressed as well.\n  I think it is worth taking a moment to review how we got here.\n  In December 2010, the President announced he had finally reached \nagreement with South Korea to renegotiate parts of that trade \nagreement. Touting the benefits of these changes, the President seemed \npoised to immediately begin working with Congress\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\ntoward its quick implementation; that is, the implementation of the \nKorean Free Trade Agreement.\n  In February, Senator McConnell and I wrote to the President \ncommending him for his strong support for the South Korea agreement but \nalso expressing disappointment we did not see the same level of \ncommitment to our pending free-trade agreements with Colombia and \nPanama. At that time, we warned that further delay would mean lost \nmarket share and alienation of key Latin American allies. We also made \nit clear each agreement would receive broad bipartisan support once the \nPresident submitted them to Congress for approval.\n  Three days later, the President responded when Ambassador Kirk \ntestified before the Ways and Means Committee that the President had \ndirected him to immediately intensify engagement with Colombia and \nPanama to resolve the administration's outstanding issues with these \ntwo agreements.\n  Senator Baucus and I welcomed that development when we wrote to \nAmbassador Kirk on February 14 and asked that he be prepared to provide \ntestimony regarding what additional steps the administration believed \nColombia and Panama should take and to provide a clear and expeditious \ntimeline for moving both agreements through Congress.\n  Shortly thereafter, in early March, Ambassador Kirk notified Congress \nthe administration was ready to begin technical work on the South Korea \nimplementing bill with the intent to seek approval in the spring of \nthis year. Senator Baucus and I welcomed this development but again \ncalled for a specific timeline for resolution of the outstanding issues \nwith Colombia and Panama.\n  During our March 9 hearing on the administration's trade agenda, I \nmade it clear that consideration of the South Korea agreement, without \na clear path for the Colombia and Panama agreements, was simply not \nacceptable and that should the President ignore the will of Congress \nand send the Korea agreement without Colombia and Panama, I would do \neverything I could to make sure those two agreements were considered at \nthe same time as Korea.\n  Shortly thereafter, in early April, the President finally took steps \nto fully engage with the Government of Colombia, announcing an \nagreement on a labor action plan that would enable the administration \nto begin working with Colombia to achieve benchmarks that, if met, \nwould then enable the President to submit the agreement to Congress. A \nfew weeks later, Panama met one of President Obama's preconditions for \nconsideration of their FTA when they approved a tax information \nexchange agreement and finalized additional modifications to Panama's \nlabor laws.\n  So there we stood in May, on the cusp of victory. Months of intense \ncongressional pressure appeared to have finally resulted in an \nopportunity for Congress to consider our trade agreements with these \nimportant allies. But alas, it was not to be.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? \nBecause 5 o'clock is coming.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. Certainly, when I am done, the \nSenator is next to continue his comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending McConnell amendment No. 626 \nbe modified with the DeMint language which is at the desk; and Senator \nHatch or his designee then be recognized to offer amendment No. 641; \nthat the time until 5 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees for debate on the McConnell amendment, as modified; \nthat at 5 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing judicial nominations: Calendar Nos. 169 and 170; that there \nbe up to 15 minutes of debate on the nominations, equally divided, in \nthe usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, \nCalendar No. 169 be confirmed and the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on Calendar No. 170; the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nany of the nominations; that any statements related to the nominations \nbe printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session; \nthat upon disposition of the judicial nominations, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the McConnell amendment, as modified; that \nthere be no amendments, points of order or motions in order to the \nMcConnell amendment prior to the vote on the amendment, other than \nbudget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that the \namendment not be divisible and it be subject to a 60-affirmative vote \nthreshold; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, on the cusp of victory, the President \nsacrificed it by demanding more government spending on a controversial \ndomestic training program.\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\n  After first asking Colombia, Panama and South Korea to take \nunprecedented steps to solve our President's concerns with each \nagreement, the administration held a press conference and, with no \nprior cngressional consultation or notice, announced that they would \nnot submit our pending trade agreements to Congress unless Congress \nfirst agreed to continue funding a domestic spending program at near \nstimulus levels.\n  This was an astounding development. Instead of working with Congress \nto seek approval of these job-creating trade agreements the President \nchose to try and force Congress to agree to additional domestic \nspending first. In an opinion editorial, the Wall Street Journal called \nthis move ``extortion.''\n  Weeks of intense negotiations followed between the White House, \nSenator Baucus and Chairman Camp to develop a package that would expand \nand renew trade adjustment assistance through 2014.\n  Meanwhile, committee staff worked with the White House to prepare the \nimplementing legislation for quick congressional consideration. It \nappeared that we were once again close to successfully considering \nthese important trade agreements.\n  But yet again, it was not meant to be. Upon reaching an agreement on \nthe substance of a trade adjustment assistance package with Chairman \nCamp the White House again changed course, turning its back on a \nwilling Congress and instead trying to force through consideration of \ntrade adjustment assistance by including it in the implementing bill \nfor the South Korea FTA.\n  And, once again, this was done with virtually no notice or \nconsultation with Congress.\n  The reaction by the Republican caucus was predictable. We fought the \nadministration's efforts to abuse trade promotion authority for its own \nnarrow purposes and pushed for consideration of trade adjustment \nassistance on its own merits.\n  Our position was made clear in a letter--signed by every Republican \nmember of the Finance Committee--to the President, in which we \nexpressed our united opposition to inclusion of expanded trade \nadjustment assistance in an implementing bill submitted to Congress \nunder trade promotion authority.\n\n  The administration ignored our concerns, and pushed forward on a \npartisan path to force a vote in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  As a result, while the implementing legislation for the Colombia bill \nand Panama bills received strong bipartisan support, the South Korea \nimplementing bill moved through committee on a strict party line vote--\nthe first time a trade agreement has done so in over 25 years.\n  The administration then vowed to move forward on this path within \ndays.\n  After that we heard remarkably little from the administration about \ntheir intentions regarding these trade agreements. Until August, of \ncourse, when the President repeatedly called upon Congress to take the \nagreements up ``right now'' to help create jobs.\n  This hollow call for action typifies the President's approach to the \ntrade agenda. By calling upon Congress to act, he appears to be \nembracing the agreements and pushing for their quick approval. But, \nlike so many of the President's trade initiatives his words do not \nmatch his deeds.\n  In reality, Congress cannot take up these agreements ``right now.'' \nPresident Obama is relying upon a trade law called trade promotion \nauthority to protect each of these agreements from being blocked or \namended by Congress.\n  In order to take advantage of this statutory authority, it is not \nCongress but the President who must take the first step and submit each \nagreement for consideration. If the President does not submit them, \nCongress cannot act under trade promotion authority.\n  The President and his team know this. In fact, here is a chart which \noutlines the TPA process called ``How A Trade Agreement Moves Through \nCongress Under TPA.''\n  This was taken directly from the Web site of the Office of the United \nStates Trade Representative. It clearly shows Congress cannot act until \nthe President submits the agreements.\n  But why take responsibility for moving the agreements when it's much \neasier to blame their continued delay on Congress? The fact is the \nPresident wants all the benefits of trade promotion authority but none \nof the responsibility.\n  Once they were called out on the mismatch between their words and \ndeeds, the administration finally reined in their rhetoric but provided \nlittle guidance as to what their actual plans are.\n  In the meantime, Republicans continued to push for consideration of \nthe three pending FTAs. Back in July, a group of Republican Senators \nsigned a letter vowing to help the administration achieve its objective \nof gaining approval of trade adjustment assistance in exchange for \nsubmitting the FTAs. Despite a clear path forward the President remains \nsilent to this day.\n  As the President continues to delay, our country cedes each of these \nmarkets to our foreign competitors. Our economy and our workers are \nsuffering under horrific levels of unemployment--almost one in ten \nAmerican workers is out of a job under this administration. We can't \nafford to throw away any opportunity to create jobs. Yet this is \nprecisely what the President is doing.\n  While our economy remains troubled, and while the rest of the world \nwatches in bewilderment as the United States lets other countries take \nover our export markets, we hear nothing but silence from the \nPresident.\n  A case in point: the European Union's exports to South Korea \nincreased almost 45 percent in the first 20 days since that agreement \nwent into force on July 1. Their share of Korea's import market \nincreased from 9.5 percent to 10.3 percent in just 3 weeks.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. share of Korea's import market dropped from 10.5 \npercent to 8.4 percent. Unless we act soon, these trends are likely to \ncontinue.\n  In an open letter to the President and Congress, over 120 food groups \nand companies wrote that ``if there is any doubt about the seriousness \nof the problem for U.S. agricultural exports, one need only consider \nthe damage that has already been done by the delay in implementing the \nColombia FTA.\n  ``Argentina and Brazil have negotiated trade agreements . . . with \nColombia that have given them preferential access . . . as a result, \nU.S.-produced corn, wheat and soybeans have been hit hard, with the \ncombined share of Colombia's imports for these products falling to 28 \npercent from 78 percent since 2008.''\n  On August 15, 2011, an agreement between Canada and Colombia entered \ninto force, which will only make the problem worse for U.S. exporters.\n\n  I appreciate the President's goal of doubling exports. Having goals \nis great. But we all know that, if you don't do the work or take \naction, goals become little more than false hope--they never become \nreality.\n  The President and his cabinet admit that these agreements are key to \ntheir goal of doubling exports. Yet the action necessary to reach that \ngoal, submission of the agreements, still remains in the distant \nfuture. Instead, we watch the days slip by, and with each day our \noverseas markets erode.\n  The fact is that each of these agreements is critically important to \nour economy. For my home State of Utah and for workers across the \ncountry they mean more opportunity and jobs.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that U.S. workers \nlose $8 million in wages and benefits every day these agreements are \ndelayed.\n  I for one stand ready to continue to fight for their consideration \nand approval. We have come a long way since January of this year, but \nwe are not done yet.\n  I hope the President will heed my call and submit these agreements to \nCongress so we can approve them. But history has shown that this \nPresident won't act unless he is forced to. This amendment I am \noffering will continue to put pressure on him to act and to act soon.\n  The time for dithering and deliberation is over. Let's adopt this \namendment and ensure that our work in moving TAA forward leads to the \npromised result--submission of the three pending free trade agreements \nby the President and their quick enactment in to law.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 641 to Amendment No. 633\n\n  Madam President, I send amendment No. 641 to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

CAIN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                     THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will go into executive session and the clerk will report the \nnominations.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of John Andrew Ross, of \nMissouri, to be United States District Judge and Timothy M. Cain, of \nSouth Carolina, to be United States District Judge.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while I am pleased we are going to \nconfirm the nominations today, they have been pending in the Senate for \n117 days for no reason or justification.\n  More troubling, the time of vacancies in courts around the country \nhave remained at or above 90 for 2 years. We should be acting on the \nother 27 judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee and ready for an up-or-down vote. Never during either \nRepublican or Democratic administrations have I seen a time when \nnominations, approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, then wait \nmonth after month after month to be considered on the floor.\n  Mr. President, President Obama came to Congress 2 weeks ago and made \na compelling case for passing the American Jobs Act. The bill he asked \nus to pass includes bipartisan proposals that have received broad \napproval in the past from members of both parties, including extensions \nof tax relief for businesses to encourage hiring. They are consensus \nproposals we can enact today. We should answer the President's call and \nact right away to help get Americans back to work and grow the economy. \nWith the unemployment rate at an unacceptable 9 percent, we in Congress \nshould be doing all we can to help our fellow Americans.\n  There is another unacceptable rate that we can help change to the \nbenefit of all Americans. That is the judicial vacancy rate. It now \nstands at 11 percent, with 94 vacancies on Federal courts around the \ncountry. We can act today to bring down that rate dramatically by \nconsidering and confirming 29 judicial nominations approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that are awaiting final Senate action. With \nvery few exceptions, the judicial nominations now on the calendar are \nnot controversial and could be confirmed today.\n  Twenty-five of the 29 judicial nominations on the Senate Calendar \nwere reported unanimously, and all but 1 of the 29 was reported with \nsignificant bipartisan support. All 28 of these consensus nominees have \nbeen favorably reported after a fair but thorough process, including an \nextensive background material on each nominee and the opportunity for \nall Senators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, to meet with \nand question the nominees. They have a strong commitment to the rule of \nlaw and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. These are the \nkinds of consensus nominees that in past years would have been \nconsidered and confirmed within days or weeks of being reported, not \ndelayed for weeks and months.\n  Certainly this was the practice we followed during President Bush's \ntwo terms, when consensus judicial nominees reported without any \nobjection by the Judiciary Committee were confirmed an average of 28 \ndays after they were reported. In President Obama's nearly 3 years in \noffice that wait time for unanimously reported nominees to be \nconsidered by the Senate has nearly tripled to 78 days, and that number \ncontinues to climb as the delays continue. It is taking nearly three \ntimes as long for nominees that are by every measure consensus, \nnoncontroversial nominations. They are nearly all confirmed unanimously \nwhen the Senate is finally allowed to vote. We should act today and not \ndelay further.\n  The effects of these unnecessary delays have been dramatic and \ndamaging. During the first years of the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations, we were able to reduce vacancies significantly by \nconfirming judges. The vacancies that had numbered over 100 early in \nthose administrations were dramatically reduced by this juncture. By \nearly September in the third year of the Bush administration judicial \nvacancies had been reduced to 54. By early September in the third year \nof the Clinton administration they had been reduced to 55. In contrast, \nthe judicial vacancies now in September of the third year of the Obama \nadministration stand at 94, with a vacancy rate of 11 percent, nearly \ndouble where it stood at this point in President Bush's third year.\n  As the Congressional Research Service confirmed in a recent report, \nthis is a historically high level of vacancies, and this is now the \nlongest period of historically high vacancy rates on the Federal \njudiciary in the last 35 years.\n  Even though Federal judicial vacancies have remained near or above 90 \nfor more than 2 years, the Senate's Republican leadership continues to \ndelay votes on qualified, consensus nominations. Republican obstruction \nhas led to a backlog of over two dozen judicial nominations pending on \nthe Senate's Executive Calendar, nearly half of them to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies. No consensus nomination to fill a judicial vacancy \nshould be left to languish on the calendar 1 day longer than necessary, \nlet alone for months and months.\n  Millions and millions of Americans are directly affected by this \nobstruction. More than half of all Americans--nearly 170 million--live \nin districts or circuits that have a vacancy that would be filled today \nif the Senate would act. More than half of all States--27--are served \nby courts that have nominations currently pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. The Republican leadership should explain to the \nmillions of Americans in these States why they will not vote. They \nshould explain to the people of Louisiana, Maine, New York, Texas, \nArkansas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wyoming, Alaska, California, Delaware \nand Arizona why there continue to be vacancies on the Federal district \ncourts in their States that could easily be filled if the Senate would \nvote on the President's qualified, consensus nominees. They should \nexplain to the people of the many States that comprise the Second \nCircuit--Vermont's circuit--and the Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Circuits \nwhy those important Federal appeals courts are short on badly needed \njudges who could be confirmed today.\n  These 170 million Americans should not have to wait more weeks and \nmonths for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the \nability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around \nthe country. They should not have to bear the brunt of having too few \njudges available to do the work of the Federal courts. At a\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\ntime when judicial vacancies remain above 90, these needless delays \nperpetuate the judicial vacancies crisis that Chief Justice Roberts \nwrote of last December and that the President, the Attorney General, \nbar associations and chief judges around the country have urged us to \njoin together to end. The Senate can and should be doing a better job \nworking to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice \nto Americans across the country.\n  Some have pointed to delays on judicial nominations in the past, real \nor imagined, to justify the continuing failure to take serious action \nto address the vacancies crisis. They recall selected instances where \nDemocrats voted against some of President Bush's controversial nominees \nto justify the across the board freeze on dozens of consensus nominees. \nThey forget the progress we were able to make in those years to confirm \njudicial nominees and fill vacancies. We confirmed 100 judges in the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002. The Senate \nhas yet to confirm 100 judges in this, the 32nd month of the Obama \nadministration. This is another issue on which I hope that we can rise \nabove what the President called ``the political circus'' to return to \nSenate's tradition practice of quickly considering and confirming \nconsensus judicial nominations.\n  At the end of President Bush's first 4 years in office, the Senate \nhad confirmed 205 of his judicial nominees. We have a long way to go to \nreach that total before the end of next year. At this point in the \nPresidency of George W. Bush, 149 Federal circuit and district court \njudges had been confirmed: On September 19 of the third year of \nPresident Clinton's administration, 162 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges had been confirmed. By comparison, although there are 29 \njudicial nominees stalled and awaiting final consideration by the \nSenate--many of them stalled since May and June--we have yet to confirm \neven 100 of President Obama's circuit and district court nominees.\n  I hope that we can come together to return to regular order in the \nconsideration of nominations as we have on the Judiciary Committee. I \nhave thanked the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator \nGrassley, many times for his cooperation with me to make sure that the \ncommittee continues to make progress in the consideration of \nnominations. Regrettably, it has not been matched on the floor, where \nthe refusal by Republican leadership to come to regular time agreements \nto consider nominations has put our progress--our positive action--at \nrisk.\n  The two judicial nominations we consider today are the kind of \nnominees we can and should consider more quickly.\n  The nomination of Timothy Cain to fill a judicial emergency in the \nDistrict of South Carolina has the support of both his Republican home \nState Senators--Senators Graham and DeMint. Senator Graham was a law \npartner with Judge Cain in the 1990s, and he has spoken to the \ncommittee with enthusiasm about Judge Cain's experience and \nqualifications. During his 25-year legal career, Judge Cain has served \nas a city and county attorney, as an assistant prosecutor and a public \ndefender, and as a judge in family court for the past 11 years. He has \nbeen selected to sit by designation on the South Carolina Supreme Court \non five occasions. Judge Cain has seen the practice of law from all \nsides, and he will be a strong addition to the Federal bench.\n  John Ross is nominated to fill a judicial emergency in the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri and has the bipartisan support of his home State \nSenators. Judge Ross has served as a State judge in Missouri for over a \ndecade. Since 2009, he has been the presiding judge for Missouri's 21st \nJudicial Circuit. He previously spent 9 years as the St. Louis County \ncounselor, and 12 years as a State prosecutor, where he rose through \nthe ranks to become the chief trial attorney in the St. Louis County \nProsecutor's Office. Judge Ross has served the people of Missouri for \nhis entire professional career. I am glad that the Senate will vote on \nhis nomination today.\n  Both of these nominees will fill judicial emergency vacancies. Both \nhave the support of their home State Republican Senators. Both were \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, without any \nobjection from a single Republican or Democratic member of the \ncommittee. They are both by any measure consensus nominees. Yet, their \nnominations have been pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar for \n117 days, since May 26, with no reason or justification given for the \ndelay.\n  While I am pleased we will consider these two nominations today and \nconfirm them, this has taken far too long. More troubling still, these \nnominations are only 2 of the 29 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the committee and ready for final Senate action. Despite a \nserious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country, \nwhere vacancies have remained at or above 90 for over 2 years, Senate \nRepublicans refuse to consent to consider nominations more efficiently. \nI hope that this month Senators will finally join together to act to \nbring down the excessive number of vacancies that have persisted on \nFederal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. We can and must \ndo better for the nearly 170 million Americans being made to suffer by \nthese unnecessary delays.\n\n\n                     Vermonters Helping Vermonters\n\n  Mr. President, I will continue because I am not taking time from \nanybody on this. The time has been reserved to talk some more, to talk \nabout what has been happening in Vermont.\n  I have spoken many times about my native State and what we went \nthrough with Tropical Storm Irene.\n  I was born in Vermont. My family came to Vermont in the 1800s. \nNothing in my lifetime has approached the devastation we see in our \nState. Vermonters have continued to struggle to regain a sense of \nnormalcy. Bridges, railroads, and roads remain damaged or wiped out. \nThose many homes, businesses, and schools that were not entirely washed \naway are in need of profound repairs. Farmers are struggling to salvage \nwhat they can of their livelihoods.\n  It is late September. In Vermont, October can bring snow. But amid \nthe din and destruction of the debris of this horrific natural disaster \ncome hundreds of heartening stories of either things I have seen \nfirsthand or I have heard about Vermonters rising to the occasion to \nhelp their neighbors and friends, even strangers, to mobilize to \nrecover.\n  I saw a man shoveling out a store. I asked him if it was his store. \nHe said: No. I said: Do you live here? He said: No; I live two towns \nover. I said: Do you know the store owner? He said: No. But, he said, I \nwasn't damaged. I wasn't hurt; he was. I would hope that if I was hurt, \nsomebody would help me.\n  Vermonters are known for our sense of community. We are known for our \nplentiful determination. Our State's people have proven their fortitude \ntenfold in the aftermath of this disaster.\n  The Weston Playhouse, a renowned playhouse, where actors from around \nthe country come in the summertime, had half their theater performance \nstage wiped out by the floods. The theater group stripped the entire \nplayhouse, set up a temporary stage so they could perform their \nupcoming show.\n  The Town Meeting House in Pittsfield has been converted into a \nmedical clinic. The Air National Guard dropped more than 14,000 Meals \nReady to Eat in the town so that those stranded had enough food. In \naddition to those meals, many others have donated meat and other goods \nso there is plenty of food to go around. Schools have fundraised to \nhelp provide free hot breakfasts to students, and Vermonters around the \nState have opened their homes to those who have lost theirs during the \nstorm.\n  Various fundraisers, including some college students who are \nclassmates of my son, have a group called Phish. They did their first \nlive concert in years and they raised over $1 million--just one thing \nafter another. But then, there are also bake sales and car washes to \nraise money.\n  One way where the indomitable Vermont spirit has endured is through \nthe remarkable efforts of Vermont students and schools. Schools have \nstarted. I know; I have grandchildren going to school there. The \nschools faced tremendous challenges to open their doors just days after \nIrene descended on us. Many had to delay opening for a few\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\ndays because the school buildings were serving as community centers for \nfamilies who had lost their homes and children who had lost everything \nin the storm. But let me show a couple examples of students making the \nmost.\n  Look at this New York Times picture. This is the Barstow Memorial \nSchool students in Chittenden. Chittenden is actually in Rutland \nCounty, down in the southwest part of our State. They used this trail \nto navigate on their way to school. They were going to go to school. \nThey were cut off. There was no road to go to school, to get to the \nschoolbus. The parents of these children said: They are going to \nschool.\n  Look at the mud on this child's legs. Look at the people. Look at \nthem walking, carrying things. ``We are going to school.''\n  The washout on Route 4 took weeks to fix, so these students slogged \nalong a muddy trail to meet vans and cars half a mile away, whether it \nwas raining or dark or cold or anything else, and these cars carried \nthe students to buses to take them the rest of the way to school. \nCommunity members helped chaperone the children on the trail. The whole \ncommunity turned out. They stood there and they passed out snacks and \nrefreshments.\n  When these students arrived at school, they were caked with mud. They \ndidn't look like the children who normally come to school, but they \nwere proud of their twice-a-day routine. They made it to school.\n  Moretown Elementary. This is one town over from where I live. I had a \ngrandmother born there. They fared worse than many schools in the \nState. The buildings sustained damage and flooding overtook the \nschool's septic system. The principal and teachers came together. They \norganized a series of field trips to get the kids out of the devastated \ntown so they could continue in their studies. They visited Shelburne \nFarms and Montshire Museum, just to name two venues. Last week, with \nthe school still closed, they met. They met. Look at that. The baseball \nfield was covered by donated tents, as seen in this photo from the Web \nsite of the Vermont Public Radio, where teachers held classes. The \nschool's offices operated from popup trailers. Kids took well to their \nnew school schedule, and teachers there are glad to provide the support \nthey need.\n  The children of Vermont and their families and teachers are doing \ntheir utmost to make their way through these extremely difficult times. \nBut these inventive measures are not permanent solutions. Vermonters \nare doing all they can and more to help each other recover, which makes \nit all the more dismaying that some in Congress seemed determined to \nplay politics with disaster relief. Millions of American families and \nbusinesses, not just in Vermont but across the country have been \ndevastated by an unprecedented series of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, \nwildfires and other natural disasters this year, reaching into nearly \nevery single State of our Union. This is no time to dawdle or to ignore \nthe urgent needs of fellow Americans. We are one Nation, and until now \nwe have willingly and generously come to the aid of our fellow \nAmericans in times of need.\n  This is the time to help our fellow Americans who have suffered \ntremendous losses. Many of our states will take years to recover. I am \npleased the Senate passed this essential bill last week, and I urge the \nHouse to send this emergency disaster relief bill to the President, \nwithout further delay.\n  We Americans are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild \nIraq and Afghanistan. Let's spend this money amount to rebuild America \nfor Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are on judicial nominees; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to, first of all, yield such time as he \nmight consume, before I speak, to the Senator from South Carolina so he \ncan speak about one of the judges that are up for nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to thank you and Senator Leahy for bringing the \nnomination to the floor.\n  Very quickly, colleagues, this is a confirmation vote for Timothy \nCain to be a Federal judge in South Carolina. Tim was my law partner, \nso I will just put my biases right out on the table.\n  He has been a family court judge since 2000 in the Tenth Judicial \nCircuit, dealing with the most complicated and emotional issues in the \nlaw, and we will not find one person who has practiced before Tim Cain \nas a lawyer who has anything other than high praise for the way he \nhandles himself.\n  Tim has been a prosecutor, a public defender. He was assistant county \nattorney. He has a very distinguished record in the law. But, more \nimportant, he is one of the most decent people I have ever met. His \nwife Renee and son Martin are the most charming, decent people one \ncould ever hope to meet. I thank President Obama for nominating him. I \nappreciate the support from Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley working \nthis nomination through the process.\n  This will be a big win for the State of South Carolina and all who \ncome before Judge Cain. He is a total package of intellect, character, \nintegrity, common sense, judicial disposition and demeanor, and I could \nnot be more proud. This is probably one of the most satisfying moments \nI have had as a Senator, to get up and recommend to my colleagues the \napproval of Tim Cain to be a Federal judge in the State of South \nCarolina. I just can't wait to see him take over in our courts and \nadminister justice.\n  So I say to Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy, thank you both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of John Andrew Ross to be U.S. district judge for the \nEastern District of Missouri, and also Timothy M. Cain, to be district \njudge for the District of South Carolina.\n  Both seats have been deemed to be judicial emergencies. With these \nvotes, we have confirmed 67 article 3 judicial nominees during this \nCongress. Of these, 23 have been for such judicial emergency type \ndistricts. I am pleased that we continue to have great progress in \nlessening the burden of our overworked courts, particularly \nconcentrating upon judicial emergencies.\n  I am somewhat surprised in the delay in bringing these votes we are \ngoing to have today to the full Senate, at the majority leader's \nrequest.\n  Senate Republicans cleared these votes nearly 2 weeks ago, with the \nanticipation that the Senate would vote on these nominees last Monday, \nSeptember 12. So I hope everyone understands these nominees could have \nbeen confirmed 8 days ago. It was not the Republicans then holding up \nthese for the last 8 days.\n  As I noted, we continue to make great progress in proceeding to \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees. These votes today are somewhat of \na milestone. They are the 99th and 100th confirmation of President \nObama's judicial nominees. As of today the Senate has confirmed 63 \npercent of President Obama's judicial nominees since the beginning of \nhis Presidency.\n  Earlier today the Senate Judiciary Committee held its 14th nomination \nhearing. We have now heard from 82 percent of President Obama's \njudicial nominees this Congress. At this point in the 108th Congress, \nonly 79 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees had received a \nhearing. We have also reported 69 percent of President Obama's judicial \nnominees compared to 67 percent of President Bush's.\n  I am pleased with the progress and will continue to move forward with \nconsensus nominees.\n  Now I would like to say a few words about these two nominees.\n  John Ross is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri. He presently serves as a circuit judge for the \n21st Judicial District in Missouri. Appointed to that position by the \nGovernor in January 2000, Judge Ross was retained by the voters in \nMissouri in the retention elections of 2002 and 2008. During his \ntenure, Judge Ross was elected assistant presiding judge by his \njudicial colleagues in that circuit and served in that office from 2005 \nto 2009. He was subsequently elected as presiding judge and has served \nin that capacity from 2009 until now.\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\n  Prior to his appointment to the State bench, Judge Ross served as \ncounty counselor for St. Louis County and in the St. Louis County's \nProsecuting Attorney's Office. He is a graduate of Emory University and \nthe Emory School of Law. The American Bar Association Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Ross ``well \nqualified.''\n  Timothy M. Cain is nominated to be U.S. district judge of South \nCarolina. Judge Cain presently serves as a South Carolina Family Court \njudge in the Tenth Judicial Circuit. The South Carolina General \nAssembly elected him to that position in 2000 and reelected him in 2004 \nand 2010. In 2005 the chief justice of South Carolina's Supreme Court \nappointed Judge Cain to serve as the chief administrative judge for the \nFamily Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit. By designation of the chief \njustice, Judge Cain also served as acting associate justice for the \nSouth Carolina Supreme Court on several occasions.\n  Prior to his judicial service, Judge Cain had a distinguished private \npractice in South Carolina. He maintained a general practice and \nassisted in representing several local governments and municipal \nclients. During his years of private practice he also served the public \nsector. Judge Cain served as a part-time assistant public defender with \nthe Oconee Defender Corporation in that State.\n  From 1988 to 1990 he served as assistant solicitor general for the \nSolicitor's Office of the Tenth Judicial Circuit, where he represented \nSouth Carolina in prosecuting child abuse and neglect cases and various \ncriminal cases.\n  In 1992 the county supervisor appointed Judge Cain as county attorney \nfor that home county.\n  He is a graduate from the University of South Carolina and the \nUniversity of South Carolina School of Law. The ABA Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Cain ``qualified.''\n  I congratulate both nominees and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Calendar No. 169 is \nconfirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Timothy M. \nCain, of South Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of South Carolina?\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the next vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 626\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my amendment on which we are about to \nvote would grant to the President something no President has had since \ntrade promotion authority expired back in 2007. Without trade promotion \nauthority, there will be no other trade agreements. We all know that. \nIf America wants to be the leader of the world in trade, we have to \nhave trade agreements.\n  What I have done here is offered trade promotion authority--what we \nused to call fast-track--as an amendment to trade adjustment \nassistance. They have been historically linked going back to 1974. I \nthink it is a big mistake for our country, even if we provide trade \nadjustment assistance, to just operate as if there are not going to be \nany more trade agreements in the United States. We used to be the \nleader in world trade.\n  My party does not occupy the White House. I want the President of the \nUnited States, whoever that is, to have trade promotion authority \nbecause I would like to see us have an opportunity to have trade \nagreements in the future. All of our competitors have taken advantage \nof the fact that we have not had a trade agreement for years.\n  These three agreements were actually negotiated by the previous \nadministration. So if we would like for this President or the next \nPresident--because this would extend TPA to the end of 2013, so it will \ngrant this authority to the next President, whoever that is, in \naddition to this President--if my colleagues think we ought to have \nanother trade agreement sometime in the future for the United States of \nAmerica, I urge them to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree with much of what the minority \nleader said. I very much believe we should negotiate free-trade \nagreements with other countries. I think we are behind the curve. Other \ncountries are negotiating. We are being left behind. We should \nnegotiate agreements that are good agreements.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, however, is the \n2002 version. A lot has changed in the last 10 years. There are \nenvironmental provisions, labor, and China is very much a competitor. I \nthink it would be unwise to extend TPA because there are changes in the \nworld today that this version does not reflect. It has to be updated to \nthe current times.\n  Second, if this amendment would pass, then we wouldn't be getting \nfree-trade agreements. The Speaker has made it very clear he wants a \nclean bill and then he will take up TAA--this bill--which many of us \nsupport by a large margin, and then he will take up the free-trade \nagreements. So if this body wants TAA and wants the FTAs, we have to \nvote against this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n626, as modified, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 141 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 626), as modified, was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). On this vote, the yeas are 45, \nthe nays are 55. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the \nadoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate for about 6 \nor 7 minutes on a trade issue that normally I would be offering an \namendment on. I am not going to offer an amendment during this debate \nbecause I think it is very important we move forward with this \nlegislation so, hopefully, the President will stop moving the goalposts \nand send to the Senate Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.\n  But the reason I address the issue of the general system of \npreferences is because, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of a lot of \nnations--that may not be considered developed yet but advanced very \nrapidly in the last 20 years--taking advantage of our GSP system. I do \nnot mind them taking advantage of our GSP system, but what irritates me \nis a lot of times in WTO negotiations, they are the very same countries \nthat are finding fault with the United States and Europe not giving \nenough on agricultural issues, as an example, at the very same time \nthese countries have very high tariffs on our products getting into \ntheir country, when they get, under GSP, their products into our \ncountry duty free.\n  So, Mr. President, I want you to know I appreciate the fact we are \nfinally debating the merits of trade legislation.\n  Most people agree that one way we can help our economy is by opening \nand expanding markets for American-made products. I look forward to the \nPresident, as I just said, sending us the free-trade agreements. In the \nmeantime, much of the discussion has centered on the bill before us, \nthe GSP and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.\n  While it is important for us to have a discussion on the merits of \nTAA, I do not want my colleagues to overlook the significance of the \nunderlying bill. This bill extends the general system of preferences. \nThis program provides one-way--and I want to emphasize--duty-free \naccess to U.S. markets. So over a period of several decades, we have \nbeen awfully good to a lot of countries that we think we ought to help \nand we have been helping.\n  The basic principle, then, behind the GSP is to provide certain goods \nmade in developing countries with preferential market access to the \nUnited States in the form of this duty-free status. The intention is to \nhelp spur economic growth in developing nations.\n  I support the premise that we can help developing countries by \npromoting trade. But I can also tell you that our patience is getting \nvery thin with some of those countries, particularly when we see them \nnot reciprocating in a way that they have the capability of \nreciprocating. Our trade relations, however, should increasingly be \nbased upon reciprocity by which other countries will provide the same \nopen access to U.S. exports. In other words, as those countries become \nmore developed, we need to require that they move toward operating on a \nlevel playing field with the United States.\n  Congress needs to take, then, a hard look at GSP and scrutinize \nwhether it is helping accomplish the U.S. trade agenda. I think we \nwould find some of these countries coming up short. In another \nenvironment of discussing trade, I would be taking a different \napproach: that we would send a clear signal to some of these countries \nof our impatience, and they are going to have to graduate off GSP. If \nother nations believe they will always enjoy GSP, then what incentives \ndo they have to open their markets to U.S. goods? That is why we ought \nto very much advance the system of graduating off GSP with some of \nthose countries.\n  There are nations that benefit from GSP that, quite frankly, have \nmoved beyond what I consider to be developing countries. I continue to \nquestion why we provide preferential treatment at all to the products \nfrom countries such as Brazil and India. These countries have at times \nworked against the trade interests of the United States, including \nresistance to reducing high tariffs on U.S. exports. Both of these \ncountries have countless products competing in the global market with \nU.S. products.\n  I am not offering an amendment, as I have already said, to this GSP \nbill, not because I do not think my position is good but because I want \nto see the pending trade agreements submitted and approved by the \nCongress. I am not interested in raising any barriers that make that \ntask more difficult than the President has already made it.\n  However, I will continue to push for reform of GSP. I urge my \ncolleagues to take a close look at this program and consider the points \nI have raised in the past and I am raising right now but not raising in \nthe form of an amendment that ought to be offered at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And those issues are very important.\n  But I come to the floor today to talk again about another important \nissue that is pending before the Congress right now that is of extreme \nimportance to millions and millions of Americans who are following this \ndebate through the viewing of the procedures here on the Senate floor \nand in the House, and also following on Twitter and other Internet \nsites and opportunities on their local news and radio stations about \nwhat we are doing on disaster relief.\n  That is a good question because I think--and many of the Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, as well, on the Senate side; particularly 10 \nof my colleagues from the other side who stood with us last week to \nsay--it is time to fund the disasters in America today.\n  We are questioning why the House of Representatives is dragging its \nfeet on this important issue or why the leadership, the Republican \nleadership in the House would be even hesitating to fund the ongoing \nneeds of FEMA, the Corps of Engineers, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development through community development block grant funding and \nagricultural disaster relief, which is so important.\n  In disasters, sometimes the pictures are focused on cities or \nsuburbs, and it is heartwrenching.\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\n  It is heartrending.\n  I will show you some of those pictures now. This is Joplin, MO, \nearlier this year. A third of the city was literally destroyed by a \ngroup of tornadoes that came through. Some of the weather specialists \nsaid they had never clocked winds of this speed and power in the entire \ntime they have been recording this data. They said they believe some of \nthe winds exceeded 300 miles per hour. This is horrifying.\n  For those of us who shudder at category 4 and 5 hurricanes which can \nblow up to 150 miles an hour, the idea of 300-mile-an-hour winds is \nbeyond our comprehension. But that is what happened in Joplin, MO.\n  Then, here we have the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It is \nheartbreaking to see the water come up on barrier islands. We have many \nbarrier islands where people live safely. When the water rises, \neverybody doesn't just pick up and leave the island forever. They use \ntheir engineering and might to come up with better technology. They \ninvest wisely. That is what we have to do to help these families.\n  These fires could be California, and it could also be Texas. Texas \nhas had over 20,000 wildfires this year, I understand.\n  Here is a rural community. Sometimes we see pictures of these urban \nareas and these coastal areas that make for great television, but we \ndon't always see farm communities underwater. This is what happened \naround our country. Why the Republican House leadership says that now \nis the time to try to find offsets for these disasters--had we insisted \non that for the Katrina and Rita recoveries, the gulf coast would still \nbe devastated. But year after year as a country, when our people have \nbeen harmed by natural disasters this National Government has come \ntogether and said: Yes, we as a nation, the United States of America--\nwe are not a divided nation--is going to come to help our brothers and \nsisters who need help.\n  Why is this different? The House Republican leadership can't run fast \nenough to spend money and send money to Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild \nthose communities and those cities. Yet when our own people from these \ncommunities ask for help, they want to now throw up the smokescreen \nthat we have to find an offset.\n  Let me give two good reasons: One, we are eventually going to have to \npay for everything the Federal Government shells out. We are going to \nhave to find the money to pay for it. But we don't have to find it this \nweek. We don't have to find it next month. We can debate that as the \nprocess of legislation goes on. We can say yes to full funding for \ndisasters now, not an inadequate amount of money, which is what the \nHouse wants to do.\n  Let me tell you how ridiculous the House position is. Not only do \nthey want to partially fund FEMA and basically fund it for only 6 \nweeks, which is the extension of the continuing resolution, they want \nto basically say we will extend the Government of the United States to \noperate for 6 weeks at the current level of spending, and we will agree \nthat FEMA can operate for another 6 weeks.\n  If they don't already know this, let me remind them that Governors, \nmayors, and county commissioners who are struggling to rebuild \ncommunities after disasters such as this need a little more than 6 \nweeks to do planning. They need a year or two sometimes to actually \ncome out of shock, to have public meetings with people.\n  I have been through this and lived through this. You have to organize \ncommunity meetings neighborhood by neighborhood. Sometimes in a \ncommunity--let's say in Joplin--I don't know how many schools they had, \nbut in our case out of 147 public schools in New Orleans we had 100 \nthat were damaged beyond repair, uninhabitable. We could not decide in \n4 weeks what we were going to do. We had to take a long time, and we \nneeded to know that the Federal funding would be there. This government \nacted--not as quickly as I would have liked, but it acted under the \nprior administration.\n  Finally, we got the long-term funding commitments that our Governors \nand mayors needed--Democrats and Republicans alike--to lay down good \nand smart plans because they knew what they could count on. Why the \nHouse doesn't want to do that, I don't know.\n  Second, I have heard criticism of the Senate approach, which I am \nproud to lead. They say things in the press such as: Well, the Senate \njust picked a number out of the air.\n  Let me be very clear. We picked no number out of the air. The clerks \nof the Appropriations Committees, who are steeped and knowledgeable \nabout what these agencies need now and what they may need in the years \nahead, met and crunched the numbers. Senator Reid looked at those \nnumbers, took them down a bit to try to accommodate the anxiety on the \nother side of the aisle about spending too much money, and came up with \na rational, reasonable number for FEMA, for agricultural relief, and \nfor community development block grants. I think under the circumstances \nthat is about the best we could do.\n  Do you know what the House of Representatives did, which makes no \nsense whatsoever? I hope some of the print press are listening to this \nso they might write this in the newspapers tomorrow. They took last \nyear's number. These disasters are happening now. They took the number \nthat was in the bill before the disasters happened and plugged that in, \nlike they are doing something good for the country, and basically said: \nTake 6 weeks of it, and then we are out of here. We are going home for \nthe week.\n  I don't take kindly to any kind of criticism that the Landrieu \nnumbers or the Senate numbers might not be crunched or reviewed \ncarefully enough. I have done the best review I can possibly do, and I \nhave every confidence that the numbers I have presented to this \nSenate--about $6.9 billion--are as accurate an assessment I have at my \nfingertips to say what we are going to need in the next year.\n  At least I am dealing in reality. In what land do they live? This \nisn't about a year and a half ago; this is about now. Their number is \nwrong, their approach is wrong, their approach is totally insignificant \nand inadequate, and it is morally wrong.\n  I will not even ask the clerk to do a beautiful job trying to type \neverything we say--and sometimes it is hard to keep up--because we \ndon't have everything written down, and I am not even going to ask them \nto print this in the Record because it is really too long. I want to \nread a little bit from this.\n  This is the whole list of projects that the Republican House \nleadership, with all their--I will say what it is; it is shenanigans. \nThese are the projects they have stopped. We all know about big cities \nsuch as New Orleans and Chicago and New York. We hear about all these \nbig cities such as Denver and Birmingham, AL, but we don't hear about \ncities like this so often. I will read some of them into the Record \nbecause these taxpayers deserve to have their cities read into the \nRecord. That is where these projects are going on that the Republican \nleadership in the House says they don't really need the money now and \nthey can wait. These have all been put on hold.\n  Here is a town I have never been to, Crooked Creek, AL. There is a \npublic building there--a vehicle maintenance shop--that is on hold. \nHere are Florence, AL, and Lipscomb, AL, and Evergreen, AL. There are \nfive pages for little towns in Arkansas that maybe don't make the front \npage of the New York Times or the Washington Post, but they are \nimportant communities. They are important to our country. Here is \nHerbert Springs. I have never heard of it, but I am sure it is a lovely \nplace to live. They have several projects that have been held up.\n  I could go on and on through every State in our country--small towns \nand counties that have been devastated--roads, bridges, public \nbuildings, and water-sewer control facilities.\n  Again, I think people at home are looking at and reviewing this \ndebate and saying: Let me get this straight. Speaker Boehner and \nMajority Leader Cantor rush to fund rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand didn't require offsets when we went into war and this rebuilding \neffort. But now we have to debate for weeks and months over finding \nproper offsets to rebuild here?\n  I hope people will let their voices be heard in the next couple of \ndays. It is very important.\n  We had a very important vote on the floor of the Senate last week. We \ndon't often have bipartisan cooperation. I thanked by name the 10 \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nSenators who helped on this effort because they said: Party politics is \nimportant, and sometimes party politics dictates the way that I should \nlook and vote and feel, but not on this because this is disaster aid \nthat is either going to my State--or, potentially, in Senator Rubio's \ncase, who knows what disasters are like in Florida. He said: It could \nhappen, Senator Landrieu, and if it happens in Florida, I certainly \nwant to come back and ask the Nation to help and not have to be engaged \nin a debate in finding an offset. I would rather work with my mayors \nand county commissioners to find a way to rebuild.\n  I have embellished a little bit of the conversation, but I know that \nis what was on his mind. He said: I can't think of what Florida would \ndo.\n  Senator Vitter from Louisiana, who has been shoulder to shoulder with \nme in helping with our disaster recovery--we have pages. Jefferson \nParish called me the other day--a Republican mayor of Jefferson \nParish--and said he has $100 million in help for Jefferson Parish \nstopped up because of this unnecessary debate.\n  We have the two Senators from Maine, Ms. Collins and Ms. Snowe, who \nmost certainly felt the effects of Hurricane Irene up the east coast. \nWe also had Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania whose State also received \nrecord amounts of flooding. We had Senator Blunt from Missouri--the \npeople of Missouri not only are desperate for FEMA money, they need \nagricultural help immediately, community development block grant \nfunding, and they need Corps of Engineers funding. Is there Corps of \nEngineers funding in the House approach? Zero. Zero for the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  If you are representing a community that has had flooding because \nyour levee failed or you don't have a levee and you need one or because \nyour runoff or streams were not regulated appropriately, you most \ncertainly don't need to call Craig Fugate. You need to call the Corps \nof Engineers. They are going to tell you they are out of money. We have \ngrossly underfunded the Corps, in my view, in capital projects year \nafter year. And, frankly, both Republican and Democratic Presidents \nhave been guilty of underfunding the Corps of Engineers and their \nbudgets because in the old days, when we could earmark, we would add \nback money to the Corps. But those days are over, A, because we are not \nearmarking and, B, because we are on tight constraints.\n  The Corps of Engineers has no emergency funding. If you are \ninterested in protecting your communities and levees and flood control, \nand you vote against the Senate position, you are going to have a lot \nof explaining to do because even when you go home and pound your chest \nand say: I voted for the House number that was last year's number, \nthere is no money there for the Corps of Engineers. So good luck \nexplaining that to your constituents. I could not explain it to mine \nand remain a Senator from Louisiana.\n  This is an example of what some of my coastal levees look like.\n  The other thing we have to battle--but this is a battle for another \nday--is when the levees break up like this--and this is the coastal \nbarrier--the Corps of Engineers is actually prohibited from building \nthem better. We have had solutions for this. We are going to try to get \nthat changed. But this is a constant battle and a big issue not just \nfor the State of Louisiana but for the gulf coast, the eastern \nseaboard, and the west coast as well. So we will continue to work in \nthat regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 \nminutes. I don't see anyone else on the floor wishing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me show what some of the Republican leaders who are \nnot in the House of Representatives are saying. And we should listen to \nthem because this is from the Governor of New Jersey, Governor \nChristie, a leader in the Republican Party, a conservative leader of \nthe Republican Party. No one would accuse him of not being a strong \nvoice for conservative philosophy. He said: Now is not the time, ladies \nand gentlemen in Congress, to argue for weeks and weeks or months and \nmonths about finding offsets for these disasters. Let's fund them. \nLet's fund them robustly. These are job-creation opportunities for our \ncommunities. It is about smart planning and being a reliable partner \nwith the State of New Jersey and my counties. He said: Let's get about \nthe business.\n  In fact, he specifically said:\n\n       You want to figure out budget cuts, that's fine. You expect \n     the citizens of my State to wait? They're not going to wait, \n     and I'm going to fight to make sure that they do not. Our \n     people are suffering now and they need support now. We need \n     support now here in New Jersey, and that is not a Republican \n     or a Democratic issue.\n\n  I just got off the phone with Governor Christie within the hour, and \nthis is still his position. He said he is not backing down, and he is \ngoing to continue to give voice to this issue. I wish the Republican \nleaders in the House would listen to him.\n  We have had Republican leaders in the Senate--I named about six of \nthem--and I want to compliment the others later on when I get back to \nthat point.\n  This is what Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia said:\n\n       My concern is that we help people in need. For the FEMA \n     money that's going to flow, it's up to them on how they get \n     it. I don't think it's the time to get into that deficit \n     debate.\n\n  I want people to think about this. Let's say we have another \nhurricane season like we had--I believe it was right before Hurricane \nKatrina. I believe it was in 2004 that we had four hurricanes hit the \nState of Florida--four in 1 year. It was devastating to the State of \nFlorida.\n  Does anyone think it would be the right thing to do to get the \nGovernor of the State of Florida, the Senators of the State of Florida, \nthe entire congressional delegation of the State of Florida and every \naccountant working for every county to come up to Washington and go \nthrough the Federal budget to find where they can cut, right there, \nthat week, while the winds have just died down? Would we have to get \nthe Florida accountants to come up here to find an offset so we could \nsend the help to Florida?\n  That argument is ludicrous on its face. I wouldn't want Senator Rubio \nworrying about that. I wouldn't want Senator Nelson worrying about \nthat. I would want them comforting their people. That is what I would \nwant to see them do because I had to do an awful lot of that. And I am \nsure they would do it naturally. I would want them going shelter to \nshelter and telling people it is going to be OK. I would want them \nvisiting with businesspeople, pleading with them not to pick up stakes \nnow but to invest in Florida because it can be a good place to come \nback to. I would want them saving their universities and working on \nthat as well. The last thing they would need to be doing--and their \nstaff--would be taking out a pencil and putting on their green \neyeshades and going through the Federal budget to see where we could \neliminate this from Colorado, with no time for hearings or oversight \nbecause we have to act now. Let's just cut out all these programs.\n  That is hogwash. It is ludicrous on its face. It is not the way a \ngovernment should be run. It is not about conservatives or liberals; it \nis truly just stupidity. It makes me so angry that anyone would suggest \nthis.\n  So, again, let's send the help now. We can find a way to pay for \nthis. We are finding a way to pay for Katrina now. We do it through the \nordinary budget process. We are finding a way to reduce the deficit \nsubstantially. That is what the committee of 12 is about. That is what \nall our debates are about. That is what the appropriations process is \nabout. But not now.\n  Tom Ridge. If you don't think the Governor of Virginia is an expert \non this or the Governor of New Jersey--though I think they are pretty \nstrong public figures--how about the first Secretary of the department \nthat oversees disaster response, Tom Ridge himself? Here is what Tom \nRidge said last week when this debate started:\n\n       Never in the history of the country have we worried about \n     budget around emergency appropriations for natural disasters. \n     And frankly, in my view, we shouldn't be worried about it \n     now. We're all in this as a country. And when Mother Nature \n     devastates a community, we may need emergency appropriations \n     and we ought to just deal with it and then deal with the \n     fiscal issues later on.\n\n  Thank you. That is exactly what we should be doing.\n  So, Mr. President, I have tried, as the leader of this committee, not \nto make\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nthis a Democratic or Republican issue. I have asked and succeeded in \ngetting 10 of my Republican colleagues to join the effort. So this \nisn't trying to make one party look good or one party look bad. All we \nwant to do is help disaster victims and help the Governors and the \nmayors and the county commissioners who, right now, believe me, are \njust pulling their hair out. They have very limited tools. They are not \nsure what they can do.\n  People are angry, they are devastated, and they are shocked. Families \nare having to bunch in and live together. Some people are still in \nshelters. I have been through this nightmare. I know what they are \ngoing through. And then they have to hear from Washington that the Eric \nCantor crowd decided now is the time for us--even though for 50 years \nwe have been doing emergency funding--to figure out where to get \noffsets before we can send them help. This is no way to run a railroad, \nand it is no way to fund disaster assistance.\n  As I said earlier, this color is too pleasant--this green on this \nmap--to really reflect what this map shows. These are all the States in \nthe Nation that are experiencing disasters this year. For the first \ntime in a very long time--maybe in our history--we have had \nPresidential disasters declared in all but two States. They are \ndifferent kinds of disasters--some fire, some floods, some \nearthquakes--but nonetheless devastating to the communities trying to \nrebuild. So this isn't a Texas or Louisiana or just a west coast issue, \nthis is an entire nation that is waiting for Congress to act and to \nsend not just FEMA money but FEMA, the Corps of Engineers, Agriculture, \nand community development block grant funding. For the life of me, I \ncannot understand why we are having this debate at all.\n  Just to recap, here is the list. And I will not ask that it be \nsubmitted for the record because it is too long and comprehensive. It \nis very fine print of project after project that has now been stopped--\nstopped--because FEMA is operating on fumes. They are virtually out of \nmoney.\n  Now, yes, the new fiscal year for the Federal Government starts next \nweek, but, remember, the House of Representatives only offered 6 weeks \nof help based on last year's reality. They are not even taking into \naccount what actually happened. They are just saying: Well, we budgeted \n$2.65 billion last year; that must be good enough for this next year--\nnot taking into account any of the realities of what I have just talked \nabout. And by the way, you can have basically a 6-week rate--no money \nfor the Corps of Engineers, no money for Agriculture.\n  Please, if you hear one thing--any of the Members of the House who \nare considering voting for this--please don't try to go home and \nexplain this to your constituents because hopefully they will be smart \nenough by listening to this debate and understanding that you really \ndidn't vote to help them. You voted for some philosophy that is hard \nfor even some in your party to understand, but you did not vote to help \nyour constituents.\n\n  One final point. People on the other side will say: Well, I voted for \nthis $2.65 billion, and I know it is not a real number, but it is sort \nof enough to get everybody through, and then we will pass the regular \nappropriations. Mr. President, I have heard that as well. And then when \nthe regular appropriations bills come, this money can be tucked into \nthese bills and help will be on the way, they will say.\n  Well, I want to say again that 1994 was the last time this Congress \npassed all 13 appropriations bills on time and got them to the \nPresident's desk. So that is wishful thinking. That is not going to \nhappen this year, no matter how hard we try, because it hasn't happened \nsince 1994.\n  So don't think you can fool your people and say: Well, I voted for \nthis, but we are going to help you through the appropriations process. \nI am on the Appropriations Committee. We have had a very difficult time \nbecause of all sorts of reasons in getting our process back on track. \nWe are supposed to be finished with all of our bills in November. It is \nalready the end of September, and we still don't have all our bills out \nof committee. And even if the House has their bills out of committee, \ngetting those numbers reconciled between the House and the Senate \nsometimes takes months. Sometimes, Mr. President, as you know, we never \nget to it and we just do a continuing resolution. So there is not \nenough appropriations in the regular bills.\n  So for all the reasons I spoke of--and I will end where I started--\nlet's fund disasters now. Let's fund the help to our people now. We are \ngoing to be here until Friday--potentially our leadership will keep us \nin until we get this resolved. But the Senate has made a great \nbipartisan effort, with Senators such as Senator Blunt and Senator \nToomey and Senator Vitter and the Senators from Maine and other \nSenators from the other side who have joined this effort.\n  I am asking the House: Please reconsider your position. Please fund \ndisasters now. We will figure out the way to pay for this over time. We \nhave already made provision for this in the negotiations that were done \na month ago between the Republican and House leaders. Our people are \ndepending on us to act.\n  Mr. President, again I urge my colleagues in the House, please \nreconsider your position. Join the bipartisan work underway in the \nSenate to get this job done for the people we represent and the people \nof our country who are truly desperate for us to act right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5767-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nKentucky's most successful educational institutions, Southeast Kentucky \nCommunity and Technical College, SKCTC. Beginning last year, SKCTC \ncelebrated its 50th anniversary of providing higher education in \nsoutheastern Kentucky across five full-service campuses. To commemorate \nthe event, SKCTC's Pineville campus held an open house for over 500 \nhigh school students from the area. To highlight the school's success \nover the years, President Dr. W. Bruce Ayers gave a presentation of \nSKCTC's history to all who attended.\n  SKCTC's Pineville campus was originally launched in the early 1960s \nas a nursing school. Over the years, the school expanded its buildings \nand curriculum and has become the main location for many of SKCTC's \nmedical programs.\n  The campus is home to about 50 percent of the school's allied health \nstudents, who are enrolled in programs such as respiratory therapy, \nradiologic technology, surgical technology, clinical lab technology, or \none of several nursing programs to become a licensed practical nurse or \na registered nurse. As a whole, SKCTC holds a remarkably high pass rate \non licensing exams for graduated students--some of the medical programs \nmaintain a pass rate of 100 percent. As a result, the majority of SKCTC \nstudents leave the school with a medical license of some kind.\n  The people of southeastern Kentucky are privileged to have such a \nreputable institution that continues to provide future generations of \nKentuckians with a quality education year after year. To help celebrate \nthis landmark occasion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \narticle describing the anniversary celebration at SKCTC--Pineville be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Middlesboro Daily News, Mar. 22, 2011]\n\n            SKCTC Anniversary Celebrated at Pineville Campus\n\n                           (By Lorie Settles)\n\n       Pineville.--The fiftieth anniversary of Southeast Kentucky \n     Community and Technical College (SKCTC) was commemorated at \n     the Pineville campus on Friday with an open house for area \n     high-school students.\n       Members of the faculty and staff of SKCTC Pineville \n     welcomed nearly 500 teens on Thursday and Friday, reported \n     Kim Ayers, the college's recruiter. The guests hailed from \n     high schools including Jellico, Harlan Independent, \n     Cumberland Gap, and Knox Central.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n       Students enjoyed guided tours of the campus on Thursday and \n     Friday, and were presented with facts and demonstrations \n     about the programs available at the Pineville Campus.\n       ``We are delighted to be able to celebrate the fiftieth \n     anniversary on the Pineville Campus and we are equally \n     delighted to have so many folks visit us,'' said Dr. W. Bruce \n     Ayers, President of SKCTC. ``This campus has meant so much to \n     the area and so much to the college for a number of years.''\n       The southeast division of the University of Kentucky was \n     launched in 1960, and has been an important facet of the Bell \n     County community since the birth of the Pineville and \n     Middlesboro branches of the college.\n       At the open house, Dr. Ayers shared some of the history of \n     the institution. The Pineville campus, he explained, joined \n     the SKCTC family in 1998, but had been in the area for some \n     time.\n       ``This particular campus actually began as an LPN nursing \n     school down in Pineville, and moved here after they were \n     flooded out in the 1970s. They moved up here, got a new \n     building and expanded the curriculum. They've been doing a \n     splendid job here in allied health since that time,'' said \n     Dr. Ayers.\n       Although the building situated on Log Mountain is \n     relatively small compared with many other campuses, it is \n     able to house a number of programs in the medical field. Each \n     year, students begin programs in Respiratory Therapy, \n     Radiologic Technology, Surgical Technology, Clinical Lab \n     Technology, or enroll in a nursing program to become a \n     Licensed Practical Nurse or Registered Nurse.\n       The Pineville campus is a vital part of the SKCTC family, \n     serving as a main location for many medical programs.\n       ``We train probably about 50 percent of our allied health \n     students for the entire college here,'' remarked Dr. Ayers of \n     SKCTC Pineville.\n       The majority of those students leave the school with a \n     medical license. Ayers reported that the campus boasts \n     ``remarkably high pass rates'' on licensing exams, and that \n     several programs maintain a pass rate of 100 percent.\n       Those numbers serve as proof, he says, that students in the \n     area are as bright and capable of success as students \n     anywhere in the country.\n       SKCTC's anniversary was celebrated in Middlesboro in \n     December.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REPEAL OF DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the repeal of \nthe Don't Ask, Don't Tell law. Today marks the end of the 60-day \nwaiting period following notification to Congress that the necessary \ncertifications were made by the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding this change in \npolicy. I am pleased that this discriminatory law was relegated to the \npast early this morning at midnight.\n  I am proud to have played a role in this repeal, and I thank my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman who, when prospects seemed most dire, \nworked with me to develop a strategy to pass a stand-alone version of \nthe bill that ultimately resulted in repeal of DADT.\n  It was almost 4 years ago when I first asked ADM Michael Mullen, then \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the Don't Ask, Don't Tell \npolicy. That was the first, but not the last, time that Admiral Mullen \ncourageously testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nabout the need to debate and evaluate the DADT policy.\n  It seemed to me then--as it does now--that our Nation should not \nrefuse the service of patriots who willingly answer the call to arms, \nsimply on the basis of their sexual orientation. If individuals are \nwilling to put on the uniform of our country, to be deployed in war \nzones like Iraq and Afghanistan, to risk their lives for the benefit of \ntheir fellow citizens, then we should be expressing our gratitude to \nthem, not trying to exclude them from serving or expelling them from \nthe military.\n  Since 1993, more than 13,000 men and women have been dismissed from \nservice and countless more have been barred from serving. Society has \nchanged a great deal in the last 18 years since President Clinton \nsigned the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' law, and I am proud Congress took \nthe lead to repeal the law.\n  I thank the LGBT community for their outreach and support of this \neffort. I especially was honored by the number of servicemembers both \nactive duty and retired who have thanked me for this effort, or who \nhave shared their personal story of how the law was affecting their \nlives. I recently received one of those stories on a postcard with a \nstamp from overseas that was signed ``An Army Soldier.'' I would like \nto have his message printed in the Record because his words represent \nthe sentiment of so many other brave men and women of our fighting \nforces.\n  His postcard says this:\n\n       Dear Senator Collins, I will still be deployed in \n     Afghanistan on 20 September when [Don't Ask, Don't Tell] is \n     finally repealed. It will take a huge burden off my \n     shoulders--a combat zone is stressful enough on its own . . . \n     I will repay your courage with continued professionalism.\n\n  With a spirit of service such as this, is there any doubt we should \nbe welcoming this warrior into our military? I want to thank this \nanonymous soldier for taking the time to share this important message \nwith me and with my colleagues. Because of soldiers like him, our \ncountry remains strong and our military united in a common cause with \nthe freedom of individual expression guaranteed by the liberties they \nfight to preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5768-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5768-S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mike Mullen \nwho is retiring as the 17th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after \nmore than 43 years of distinguished service to our country.\n  Admiral Mullen began his rise in the Navy as a midshipman at the U.S. \nNaval Academy, where he became a proud graduate in 1968. Upon \ngraduation, then Ensign Mullen reported aboard the USS Collett, \ndeploying to the Western Pacific and participating in combat operations \noff the coast of Vietnam. Eventually, his career at sea would include \nserving aboard six other warships, including command of three, as well \nas command of the George Washington Carrier Strike Group and U.S. \nSecond Fleet.\n  He supplemented his systems engineering degree from Annapolis with a \nmaster of science degree in operations research from the Naval \nPostgraduate School in Monterey, CA, and a business degree from the \nadvanced management program at Harvard.\n  Ashore, he similarly distinguished himself with tours at the U.S. \nNaval Academy, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the staff of the Chief of \nNaval Operations as well as in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n  With an already exemplary career of service at sea and ashore, \nAdmiral Mullen became the Navy's 32nd Vice Chief of Naval Operations in \n2003. During the first half of 2005, he served as Commander of NATO's \nJoint Force Command Naples and Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe, \nleading the Alliance's peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and its \ncritical training mission in Iraq.\n  In July of 2005, he became the top uniformed leader in the Navy as \nthe 28th Chief of Naval Operations. With the Nation fighting two wars, \nhe oversaw the service's efforts to man, train, and equip our Navy to \nfulfill its traditional missions at sea. Facing innovative and \nnontraditional enemies, Admiral Mullen conceived and championed the \nNavy's vital contribution to the fight on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Dedicated to keeping the sea lanes free, deterring aggression, and \nmaintaining our Nation's maritime superiority, he also led efforts to \nstabilize the Navy's shipbuilding program to support a 313-ship fleet.\n  On October 1, 2007, Admiral Mullen assumed duties as the 17th \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Facing a myriad of challenges, \nand with ongoing conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan, he worked \ntirelessly with our Nation's leadership to oversee multiple, sustained \njoint military operations. Admiral Mullen's efforts played a vital role \nin disrupting terrorist networks, providing humanitarian assistance at \nhome and abroad, and improving the security and stability in Iraq.\n  Recognizing the danger of an Allied failure in Afghanistan, he became \nan early and vocal proponent of resourcing the war by expanding \ncounterinsurgency capabilities and fostering closer ties with \nstrategically vital Pakistan.\n  Never forgetting that those who return from war often continue to \nbear scars--both seen and unseen--Admiral Mullen and his wife Deborah \npassionately represented the interests of the\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nmen and women returning from the battlefield. He initiated an \nunprecedented nationwide dialogue to advance awareness and support for \nthe many issues facing our warriors, veterans, and their families.\n  Many have recognized Admiral Mullen's dedication to service with a \nwide range of awards and decorations. But I know first hand that his \ntruest reward is the satisfaction he must feel for a lifetime of \nservice to a country he so deeply loves. Admiral Mullen's commitment to \nthe Americans who have given so much will endure well beyond his days \nin uniform.\n  I will add that Admiral Mullen's legacy will continue in another way \nafter retirement. He and Deborah continue to proudly support their \nsons, John and Michael, as they pursue their own uniformed service in \nsupport of the world's greatest Navy.\n  The U.S. Navy and our military will never forget the service of Mike \nMullen, one of its most respected and valued leaders, who took the helm \nduring a dynamic and uncertain time in our Nation's history. And none \nof us will ever forget how he led--with humility, a selfless devotion \nto others, and integrity.\n  Please join me in recognizing and commending ADM Mike Mullen for a \nlifetime of service to his country and to wish him the best in his \nretirement. May God bless Mike and Deborah, and their family, for all \nthey have given and continue to give our country. We remain in their \ndebt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5769-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL ENGEMAN\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Bill will be leaving Cincinnati \nlater this year for Lancaster, OH, and I would like to thank Bill for \nhis years of selfless efforts to encourage the sport of rowing.\n  Since the early 1980s, Bill has been a leader in advancing rowing in \nsouthwest Ohio. In the fall of 1981, Bill helped found the University \nof Cincinnati Rowing Team. Bill also has helped develop many rowing \nprograms and build many boathouses at East Fork State Park and along \nthe Ohio River. He also worked to bring the Men's and Women's National \nCollegiate championship to the region multiple times in the 1980s and \n1990s. Bill was inducted into the National Rowing Hall of Fame in 1998.\n  In 2008, I had the opportunity to work with Bill to construct the \nMatt Maupin Memorial Pavilion at East Fork State Park, named in honor \nof a local high school rower and brave soldier who was killed in the \nline of duty in Iraq. Over the last 3 years Bill has worked to help \nrebuild the national rowing program in Iraq and assist in its journey \nto qualify young athletes for the London Olympics in 2012. This latest \nproject is having a global impact and illustrates his commitment to \nrowing and the youth of the world.\n  Bill Engeman has given tremendously to the Cincinnati area and the \nsport of rowing over the years, and thousands of area residents have \nbenefited from his legacy. Bill will be honored for his efforts on \nTuesday, September 27, 2011. I would like to join with his many friends \nin congratulating Bill and thanking him for all he has done. While he \nmay be moving to another city, he will always be considered the father \nof rowing in Cincinnati.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5769-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING HENRY SMITH, JR.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring the life of Mr. Henry Smith, Jr. The people of \nLouisiana lost a giant of a man when Henry A. ``Buster'' Smith, Jr. \npassed away on Friday, September 9, 2011, at age 82 after a lengthy \nillness.\n  Born in St. Charles Parish and raised in an area outside of New \nOrleans known as the River Parishes, Mr. Henry, as we affectionately \nknew him, was a confident and self-made man who had an optimistic \noutlook on life that would lift you when you were in his presence. He, \nand others like him, helped build this Nation.\n  Mr. Henry was a product of the River Parishes whose people draw their \nstrength and sustenance from the Mississippi River, and whose ingenuity \nand hard work built the incredible industrial complex along the river \nthat fuels so much of our Nation's energy and commerce. He was the \nguiding force in the development of what became the Magnolia Companies, \na multicompany conglomerate in the fields of construction, housing, \nmaterial sales, real estate, finance, disaster recovery and consulting. \nHe traveled the world in order to help people recover from disasters on \nsix continents, but always returned home to Louisiana and his beloved \nRiver Parishes. Mr. Henry assisted with securing the futures for \nhundreds of families by creating opportunities for meaningful and \nrewarding work for them to pursue.\n  Mr. Henry was a champion for his community and the surrounding \nregion. He supported numerous charities, churches and schools in and \naround the New Orleans area, including the Ursuline Academy, Sacred \nHeart Catholic Church, First Baptist Church of Norco, and the Mahalia \nJackson Early Childhood Development Center. He was a leader who was \nsincere and steadfast in his drive to help others. He truly believed in \nthe spirit and generosity of mankind and thought that everyone deserved \na chance.\n  He was very passionate about politics and immersed himself in \nsupporting candidates for local, State, and Federal office. I was \nfortunate enough to have Mr. Henry's support and counsel through my \nyears in politics. Even though Mr. Henry was opinionated, he always \nsaid that no matter what, there were two sides to every story. He was a \nDemocrat but was always more interested in the merits of a debate \nrather than partisanship. He believed most of all in moving his \ncommunity, State, and Nation in a positive direction. We could \ncertainly use more people like Mr. Henry.\n  Above all else, Mr. Henry was devoted to his family his sons, Glen \nand his wife Marilyn and Gary and his wife Pam, along with his \ngrandchildren, Representative Gary Smith, Jr. and his wife Katherine, \nRebecca Smith Tassin and her husband Justin, and Madison Elizabeth \nSmith-just as they were to him and each other. The Smith family is one \nof the most loving families I have ever known. Mr. Henry worked \njoyfully with his two sons Glen and Gary every day for more than 40 \nyears. Never have I seen two sons more devoted to their father.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me along with Mr. Henry's family in \nhonoring and celebrating the life of this most extraordinary son of \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5769-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5769-S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAN FLOWERS\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life \nand career of Dan Flowers, who is retiring as director of the Arkansas \nHighway and Transportation Department after a lifetime of service and \ndedication to the State.\n  Dan Flowers began his career with the Arkansas Highway and \nTransportation Department more than 40 years ago after spending his \nsummers in college as an employee in the departments Resident Engineer \nOffice in his hometown of Batesville. He held this position for 4 years \nuntil he graduated in 1969 from the University of Arkansas at \nFayetteville with a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering. \nEnjoying his time with the department, Dan went on to complete the \nengineering orientation program and was assigned as a planning engineer \nin the Planning & Research Division. He has worked in a total of eight \nother engineering and management positions within the Department before \nbeing promoted to director in 1994.\n  Dan Flowers has had many achievements during his career as the \ndirector, and in announcing his retirement to his staff he was quick to \npoint out the collaborative effort ``we plan, we build, we maintain, \nand we manage--but the key word in all of that is WE.''\n  Perhaps one of Dan's greatest accomplishments was the 1999 interstate \nrepair program and one that he says was the most interesting. The 5-\nyear, $1 billion repair program overhauled the Arkansas interstate \nsystem which included 54 projects and more than 350 miles of \ninterstate. Dan has truly helped make Arkansas roads safer and his work \nhas touched countless lives.\n  Not only was he active in transportation on a regional level but also\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nhighly active on a national level. As a new member on the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee I quickly learned how well \nrespected Dan was not only in Arkansas but across the country as \nwitnesses would tell me of their appreciation for his work. He has \nserved on numerous organizations from president of the Southeastern \nAssociation of State Highway & Transportation Officials and the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation to chairman of \nthe American Associations Special Committee on International Activities \nCoordination, and prior to being president Dan served as chairman of \nthe Associations Subcommittee on Design, Standing Committee on \nHighways, and as the associations vice-president.\n  Dan has also earned many accolades for his work. In 2001, the \nArkansas Chapter of the Associated General Contractors presented \nFlowers with its most prestigious award, the Skill, Integrity, and \nResponsibility Award, SIR, for his outstanding contributions to the \nindustry, and in 2004 the University of Arkansas Department of Civil \nEngineering dedicated the Dan Flowers Education and Training Facility.\n  Dan has displayed dedication, perseverance, and commitment to \nexcellence.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nreflecting on the life, accomplishments, and service of the late Jackie \nLee Houston--a prominent businesswoman and philanthropist in the \nCoachella Valley. She passed away on September 14, 2011.\n  Jackie Lee Houston was born and raised in Seattle, WA. She began \nmodeling as a pre-teen and continued to do so through graduation from \nthe University of Washington, from which she earned a degree in \neconomics and fashion design in 1956. Her modeling led to a television \ncareer as Seattle's first female weathercaster, as well as hostess of \nthe ``Hoffmann Easy Vision Talent Show.'' For a brief period, she \npursued a professional career in Los Angeles as a model for Oscar-\nwinning fashion designer Edith Head; but eventually she returned to \nSeattle to marry her college sweetheart, James Houston.\n  In 2005, Jackie and James purchased CBS affiliate KPSP located in \nThousand Palms--at the time, Jackie was one of only two women in the \nUnited States who owned a television station. Through public service \nannouncements and profiles, they utilized their community-focused \nstation to promote causes across the Coachella Valley--from helping the \nhomeless to supporting food banks to AIDS research.\n  A passionate philanthropist, Mrs. Houston quietly helped struggling \nindividuals and her efforts benefitted a wide array of organizations, \nprojects, and endeavors--including Angel View Crippled Children's \nFoundation, Palm Springs Stroke Recovery Center, Desert AIDS Project, \nPalm Springs International Film Festival, Palm Springs Art Museum, \nMcCallum Theatre, Fashion Week El Paseo, and December Festival of \nLights parade. She also gave unstintingly of her creativity and time--\nusing her Rolodex and her home to groom a new generation of \nphilanthropists and to organize distinctive red-carpet events that \nraised millions for charity.\n  In recognition of Mrs. Houston's profound influence on the Coachella \nValley and the inspirational legacy she leaves for the community, the \ncity of Palm Springs will name the new main entry plaza of the Palm \nSprings Convention Center in her honor.\n  On a more personal note, it was an honor for me to have known Jackie. \nShe and her husband founded an extraordinary food bank called FIND, \nwhich is run by Jackie's daughter-in-law, Lisa Houston. I was honored \nto visit FIND with Jackie and Jim at FIND's original Cathedral City \nlocation in 2009 and again in 2010 at its new home in Indio. I saw her \ngreat pride in this particular project which helps so many survive, \nparticularly in this tough economy.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mrs. \nHouston. She will be sorely missed by so many, including me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5770-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARGARET NACHTIGALL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and honor the service of Mrs. Margaret Edna Nachtigall upon \nher retirement as executive director of the South Dakota Stockgrowers \nAssociation.\n  Margaret was born on May 18, 1937, to parents Leslie and Edna Coates, \nin Edgemont, SD. She grew up and spent her childhood on the family \nranch near Burdock, SD, which instilled in her a strong work ethic and \na love of animals, especially horses and cattle. This love for animals \nblossomed into volunteer work with community agricultural education and \noutreach through the 4-H program. She could often be found showing her \ncalves and lambs at the Fall River County Fair in Edgemont and the \nWestern Junior Livestock Show in Rapid City. Her love for horses \neventually led her to compete in barrel racing and break-away roping. \nIn 1955, she even ended up fifth in break-away roping at the National \nHigh School Finals.\n  Margaret's insatiable drive for learning, combined with her love of \nanimals, eventually led her into the world of cattle breeding and the \nrole that nutrition plays in reproduction. By the time she began her \nwork for the American Breeder Service her business had grown to the \npoint that she was booked solid during breeding season. That work ethic \nand passion extends into everything Margaret does.\n  Margaret's service to the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association spans \nmany years and has had a significant impact on the association and its \nmembers. I have always valued Margaret's insight and input on a number \nof issues impacting agriculture. She has offered a very important voice \non behalf of South Dakota Stockgrowers and agriculture producers over \nthe years and her knowledge, expertise and advice have helped guide me \nand my staff when it comes to general agriculture, farm and ranch, and \ntrade policy. Her work helped us to finally get a country-of-origin \nlabeling law in place in the 2008 farm bill and she helped to lay the \ngroundwork for the livestock competition rule currently pending with \nUSDA's Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration, GIPSA.\n  In addition to the valuable input and guidance she has given me over \nthe years, she also served as an effective and well-liked leader of the \nStockgrowers Association. As just one testament to Margaret's \nleadership, Larry Nelson, past president of the organization, has this \nto say about her: ``Margaret has been an asset to the South Dakota \nStockgrowers Association as our Executive Director. Her strong work \nethic and her commitment to the independent, family-owned ranches of \nSouth Dakota have shown through her work. I am grateful for her \ndedication to advancing the policies of the South Dakota Stockgrowers \nAssociation and her work to promote our livestock industry.''\n  Margaret's life work on issues that concern cattle producers and \ntheir operations has been done because of an intense love for the \nranching industry. It is because of the work of people like Margaret \nthat the cattle and ranching industry continues to thrive and maintain \nits crucial role throughout South Dakota. I am proud to recognize and \nhonor Margaret's retirement from the South Dakota Stockgrowers \nAssociation, and am delighted to join with her family and friends in \ncongratulating her on this occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5770-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5770-S5771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING VICTOR BUSSIE\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come before you today to \ncelebrate the life and contributions of one of Louisiana's favorite \nsons. This week the citizens of Louisiana are remembering the \nmonumental life of Mr. Victor Bussie. Mr. Bussie passed away Sunday, \nSeptember 4, 2011, at the age of 92. He was laid to rest in Baton \nRouge, LA last Friday. Mr. Bussie was buried not far from our State \nCapitol, where he fought tirelessly for more 50 years to strengthen and \nuphold the rights of working men and women in Louisiana and across the \nNation.\n  A hero to thousands, the scourge of some, and ally for many; Mr. \nBussie spent a lifetime fighting side-by-side with like-minded men and \nwomen. He\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\nwas motivated by a sense of justice and a desire to secure worker \nprotections and the fundamental civil rights that many of us take for \ngranted. During his 41 years at the helm of the Louisiana AFL-CIO Mr. \nBussie saw the evolution of not just workers rights but our country's \nconstant struggle for fundamental civil rights. From 1956-1997 Mr. \nBussie worked to secure civil rights, equal rights for minorities and \nwomen, a fair minimum wage, adequate workplace safety, defined pension \nplans, and numerous other fair labor laws for the people of Louisiana.\n  Mr. Bussie kept his sharp and analytical mind to the very end. He \npassed with his beloved wife Fran at his side.\n  When I began my political career as a State legislator almost 33 \nyears ago, Mr. Bussie was a fixture at the Louisiana Legislature. He \nspent tireless hours effectively advocating on behalf of the hundreds \nof thousands of men and women he represented. I remember him as \nfearless and resolute in his belief in civil rights and fair treatment \nfor all. He refused to back down even after his house was bombed by a \nmember of the Ku Klux Klan in 1967. In 2010, I attended a dinner \nhonoring the lifetime achievements of Mr. Bussie and was in awe of his \naccomplishments. Mr. Bussie was a strong willed and tenacious advocate \nfor what he believed in but he consistently treated everyone with \ndignity and respect.\n  Mr. Bussie was born in Natchitoches Parish, home of the oldest \npermanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase. His family later moved \nto Boyce in the central part of Louisiana near Alexandria. He served in \nthe Navy during WWII and later worked as a hose man with the Shreveport \nFire Department. Many times over the years he described to me how much \nhe had loved being a firefighter and how much he loved the camaraderie \namong the men in his unit.\n  It was because of his sense of fairness, sharp intellect and demeanor \nthat he was approached by his fellow firefighters to represent their \ninterests. In 1956, he was elected president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO. \nHe remained president until his retirement in 1997. Throughout his \ncareer Mr. Bussie acted with dignity and garnered the respect of even \nfrom those who opposed his position.\n  Mr. Bussie was a giant in the State of Louisiana and an example of \nhow passionate advocacy could and should be expressed with dignity and \ngrace.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to offer my \nsincerest congratulations to an inspirational constituent of mine, Sue \nCopinga. Sue is the recipient of the 2011 LifePoint Hospitals \ncompanywide Mercy Award. LifePoint's Mercy Award recognizes individuals \nwho follow in the footsteps of the company's founding chairman and CEO \nScott Mercy, who passed away in 2000. Sue works at Castleview Hospital \nin Price, UT and is a patient advocate in the emergency room, while \nworking part time as an emergency medical technician. Castleview \nHospital serves residents of Carbon and Emery Counties. Like so many \nrural hospitals around the country, Castleview is the only hospital for \nmiles around, making it a vital resource where citizens of Carbon and \nEmery Counties can get the medical care they need.\n  While Sue has a deep history of giving back to others through her job \nand in her personal life, she demonstrated her extraordinary dedication \nto caring for others during one of the worst mine disasters in Utah's \nhistory. On August 6, 2007, the Crandall Canyon Mine collapsed in the \nmiddle of the night, trapping six miners underground. Sue did not \nhesitate. Immediately after learning of the tragedy, Sue headed \nstraight to the scene to provide whatever assistance was necessary. She \nspent the following days and nights at the site standing ready, eager \nand willing to treat the men we all hoped and prayed would be rescued. \nThen, on August 16, a second collapse brought the walls down around \nrescuers who were working tirelessly to free the trapped miners. The \nsecond collapse claimed the lives of three men and injured numerous \nothers.\n  Sue provided emergency care to injured rescuers and miners, despite \nthe dangerous conditions. She voluntarily went into the mine that day \nnot only to help those who were injured, but also to spare fellow EMTs \nfrom being put in harm's way. Sue was worried about a coworker with six \nyoung children and told this fellow EMT to stay behind, noting that her \nown children are grown and raised.\n  Sue's commitment to caring for others is also what makes her \ninvaluable as a patient advocate in the emergency room of Castleview \nHospital, where she has worked for 14 years. During her days--and often \nlong nights at Castleview--Sue touches countless lives, making a \npositive impact on each patient she encounters. Sue provides care and \ncompassion to her patients at a time when they need it most, and has \ncome to be known affectionately as ``Grandma Sue'' for the way she \nsoothes children, the most vulnerable of her ER patients--children.\n  Sue's devotion to helping others is not confined to the hospital's \nwalls. She also serves part time as an EMT where she provides patients \nemergency care and transport in critical situations. When Sue isn't \ncaring for patients in the emergency room or ambulance, she is \neducating future generations of EMTs. For fifteen years, Sue has given \nback to her community by teaching countless people how to save others' \nlives in times of crisis.\n  Sue lives in Elmo, one of Utah's smallest towns. She is the proud \nmother of 5 children, including a Navajo foster daughter, and has 19 \ngrandchildren. Sue also plays a role in supporting the children of her \nlarger community by leading church youth groups and chairing an annual \n``community day'' in her town.\n  It gives me great pleasure to know that Sue's caring, selflessness, \nand devotion to her community is being recognized through the LifePoint \nHospitals Mercy Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5771-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5771-S5772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MRS. SARAH J. GREENLEE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I speak today in honor of Mrs. \nSarah J. Greenlee, who this week accepted the 2011 Joan Orr Air Force \nSpouse of the Year award. Sarah was selected from thousands of nominees \nworldwide who selflessly support their loved ones in uniform. I am \npleased to note that Sarah earned this honor while serving in the great \nState of Alaska at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Sarah and her \nhusband, LTC Paul Greenlee, have recently been transferred to Joint \nBase Pearl Harbor-Hickam, but Sarah has left an indelible mark on the \nAnchorage area through her volunteer work and leadership in the \ncommunity.\n  Sarah was born into a military family and traveled extensively in the \nUnited States and Europe before graduating from Clark High School in \nSan Antonio. She attended Southwest Texas State University, where she \nearned a bachelor's degree in psychology, and later the University of \nTexas-Arlington, where she achieved a master's degree in social work. \nSarah subsequently entered the Air Force through the Commissioned \nOfficer Training Program as a social worker. After 4 years of service, \nSarah left the Air Force to become a full time wife and mother. Sarah \nand Paul are proud parents of Andrew, Rachel, and Zoe.\n  There is a saying in the military that ``home is where the service \ntakes you,'' and for the Greenlees home has been Mississippi, \nWashington, Illinois, Alaska, and now Hawaii. While we ask much of our \nmen and women in uniform, we recognize it is the entire family who \nserves. With every move, families say goodbye to dear friends, kids \nstart school in new places, and the clock starts ticking again toward \nthe next transition. Despite enduring these frequent moves, military \nspouses quickly become leaders on base and in the local community. \nSarah Greenlee is a fitting case in point.\n  Sarah took several actions worth noting. We had two tragic aircraft \naccidents last year in Alaska where we lost the crews of a C-17 and an \nF-22 within a matter of months. In the aftermath, Sarah jumped in with \nsupport and comfort, providing food and offering encouragement to \nleaders and personnel\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nfrom the affected units. She opened her home to children of commanders \nworking on the recovery effort, relieving them to focus on obligations \nto their units.\n  Sarah's impact in the local community was no less remarkable. She was \nactive in the Mount Spurr Elementary School PTA and Anchorage Faith and \nFamily Church. Pastors Brant and Tamara Barker, founders of the church, \nhave travelled from Alaska to Washington to celebrate Sarah's \nsignificant accomplishment.\n  Those who know Sarah best say she is a source of encouragement for \nall she meets. Her listening ears, compassionate words, and acts of \nkindness bring others support and hope.\n  The Air Force Spouse of the Year award is named after the late Joan \nOrr, wife of former Secretary of the Air Force Verne Orr. Mrs. Orr was \na rare, inspirational leader who would accompany her husband on visits \nto bases, meeting with families and visiting community support \nfacilities. During the Christmas holiday, the Orrs traveled to remote \nbases in my home State of Alaska to visit servicemembers who were \nseparated from their families. Mrs. Orr had a passion for teaching \ndance. Even as she struggled with the debilitating effects of Lou \nGehrig's disease, she never cancelled a dance class. From a wheelchair \nand using a writing slate when her voice failed, she taught up to 2 \nweeks before her death. Sarah, like Joan, realized she had something to \ngive and the willingness in her heart to give it.\n  I offer warm congratulations to Sarah on her selection as the 2011 \nAir Force Spouse of the Year and wish her and her family a bright \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5772-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PHILIP RUSH HALEY\n\n Mr.VITTER. Mr. President, today I honor an American patriot \nand a constituent of mine, Philip Rush Haley of Denham Springs, LA. \nPhil grew up in Baton Rouge, LA and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corp in \n1939 at age 18.\n  While stationed in Manila, Philippine Islands, Mr. Haley served as a \nguard outside the office of Admiral Hart, Commander in Chief of the \nAsiatic Fleet. After Admiral Hart left the Philippines, Mr. Haley \nrelocated to Corregidor and was placed under the command of LTG \nJonathan Wainwright. The American forces surrendered to the Japanese in \n1942, and it was at this time Mr. Haley became a prisoner of war.\n  The State Times in Baton Rouge wrote an article entitled ``Local \nMarine Declared Missing in Action.'' Most in his family thought Phil \nHaley was dead, but his mother maintained that Phil's strength and \nresilience would keep him alive. Nearly 1 year later, the Haley family \nreceived word that Phil was indeed alive at Mukden, a Japanese POW camp \nlocated in Manchuria, China.\n  Phil would be in the camp for 3\\1/2\\ years before the war ended and \nhe was liberated by the Russians. His positive attitude and \nperseverance, as his mother predicted, did indeed keep him alive.\n  Phil is still persevering. He understands the importance of service, \nand the Marine motto always faithful. Many consider him to be a \npatriarch and a well-respected leader in his church. He is constantly \nserving others in his community through his active involvement in First \nBaptist Church of Denham Springs. Phil is an ordained deacon, a member \nof the building committee, and a member of the ``Helping Hands'' team.\n  On this special day we will all look back and see the hallmarks of a \nlife well lived. His quiet determination, unfailing kindness, and \nunyielding spirit have made him a pillar not only of a proud and loving \nfamily, but to all who have come to know him. Beneath a humble exterior \nlies a generous and kind soul. He is beloved not for a litany of \naccomplishments, but simply for who he is.\n  Tom Brokaw, in his book ``The Greatest Generation,'' notes that their \nsacrifices made possible the many comforts and conveniences we enjoy \ntoday. It is my honor to pay tribute to this great American. He, like \nso many today, went into harm's way and sacrificed so much so that we \ncan experience our liberties today. I am humbled to have the \nopportunity to express my appreciation for Mr. Philip Rush Haley's \nservice to our country, and wish him all the best in years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/20/senate-section/article/S5772-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3304.

    \n\n[Pages S5774-S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Kirk, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1582. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nmodify provisions relating to beach monitoring, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nFrank Lautenberg to introduce the Clean Coastal Environment and Public \nHealth Act of 2011 to help protect the millions of Americans who \nutilize public beaches each day.\n  Unfortunately, every year many beaches go unmonitored or face severe \ndelays in receiving test results of levels of contamination in coastal \nwaters. Without proper monitoring and notification, thousands of \ncitizens risk illness due to growing contamination of our coastal \nwaters. Beach closings are a far too regular occurrence along the 52 \npublic Lake Michigan beaches in my home State of Illinois. According to \nthe Illinois Department of Public Health, there were 579 beach closures \nor contamination advisories last year, an 8 percent increase from 2008. \nBeach closures greatly affect the health of our children and families--\na recent University of Chicago study showed swim bans at Chicago's \nbeaches due to E. coli levels cost the local economy $2.4 million in \nlost revenue every year. This bipartisan legislation requires rapid \ntesting methods to detect water contamination in 4 hours or less, \nfaster notification and decision about closures and advisories within 2 \nhours. These measures can help save millions of Americans from hospital \nbills or unnecessary beach closings.\n  But we must not ignore the more dangerous toxin which has far \nreaching consequences for the most vulnerable members our society--our \nchildren. Mercury pollution is a serious problem nationwide and is \nparticularly concerning since large amounts can accumulate in fish \ntissue. Mercury levels in the Great Lakes, particularly in Lake \nMichigan, are poorly understood. Moving forward, it is critical that we \nrevise the outdated monitoring and testing of this dangerous toxin. \nThis bill also requires the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to update existing monitoring protocols and develop \nupdated testing recommendations for the existence of mercury in Great \nLakes coastal waters, sediment and fish.\n  Protecting the Great Lakes and our coastal waters is one of my top \npriorities in Congress. I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation that addresses a key problem facing our Great \nLakes beaches. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to help \nsafeguard our future generations and our most precious natural \nresource.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Chambliss)\n  S. 1583. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax deduction for the purchase, construction, and installation of a \nsafe room or storm shelter, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, being from Oklahoma, I can remember back \nin the days when they called Oklahoma, southern Kansas, northern Texas, \nand southwestern Missouri tornado alley. I say to my good friend from \nOregon that I have been in aviation for many years. I know people who \nwon't even fly airplanes through what we call tornado alley. But by now \nI think we know that tornadoes are a daily threat to Americans each \nspring as severe weather rolls across the country. In the past 30 \nyears, over 34,000 tornadoes have touched down somewhere in the \ncountry, which means that one touches down, on average, every 8 hours \nof each day. This chart right here shows that each one of these little \ngreen dots represents a tornado.\n  As we all witnessed once again this spring, many of these tornadoes \ngrow into very voracious and dangerous storms that bring significant \nharm to property and life. This year, 57 such tornadoes struck 14 \nStates and claimed 550 lives. Alabama was the hardest hit. I can \nremember when Oklahoma was ranked as the hardest hit. They had over 240 \nkilled. Missouri also suffered heavily with the loss of 157 people in \nJoplin. I say to my friend from Missouri, who is on the floor, I was up \nin Joplin right after that happened, down close to the Oklahoma border. \nIt is something you have to witness before you understand it. In my \nState of Oklahoma where we have more than our fair share of violent \ntornadoes, this spring's storms resulted in the death of 14 people and \nthe injury of many others. Until you have this happen, and you go on \nsite, which I always make it a point to do--after each tornado in \nOklahoma, you go down and talk to the people. You think of little kids \nlooking for their toys and this type of thing, but they are gone and \ngone for good.\n  While this year has seen a large number of fatal tornadoes, they are \na nationwide threat each spring. Since 1980, 734 tornadoes have claimed \n2,462 lives in at least 37 different States, including 126 in my State \nof Oklahoma. Unfortunately, many of these lost lives\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\ncould have been avoided had storm shelters been more widely used.\n  In the past few months, a number of Oklahomans have asked me if there \nis a Federal program that promotes the installation of tornado storm \nshelters. They observed that those individuals who have these storm \nshelters live through it. They may lose their property, but they live \nthrough it. So they think, Well, government gets involved in all of \nthese programs; what are they going to do to help us encourage people \nto build storm shelters? When I looked into it, I came up emptyhanded \ndespite the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars are obligated \neach year to mitigate the effects of natural disasters.\n  Since death is one of the worst effects of natural disasters, one \nwould think tornado storm shelters, which are the safest way to ride \nout tornadoes, would be a high priority, but only limited funds have \nbeen made available in the past, and it has been sporadic and poorly \nallocated. Most of the funds have been made available through FEMA's \nHazardous Mitigation Grant Program, which is a mandatory program that \nallocates funds to States to help them better prepare for future \ndisasters. States are able to direct some of this money to residential \nstorm shelter construction, but to do this they have to go through a \nlot of hoops--through a lengthy process of coordinating a program with \nFEMA. Needless to say, it is a bureaucratic nightmare and hugely \nexpensive.\n  Oklahoma did this after the devastating tornadoes of May 3, 1999. \nFifty people died and many others were injured that day. As the \nrecovery effort took hold, it became clear to public leaders that \nstaggeringly few Oklahomans had storm shelters accessible for their \nhomes. Because of this, Oklahoma's Department of Emergency Management \nworked with FEMA to create a temporary rebate program to encourage \nindividuals to install storm shelters in their homes. The rebate was \nworth $2,000, and the funding cap was set at $6 million.\n  Unfortunately, the program didn't perform as well as they would have \nliked. It was a popular program and funding depleted quickly. But \nbecause of the rebate amount, only 3,000 homeowners were able to take \nadvantage of the program, despite its $6 million funding level. We are \ntalking about in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Furthermore, because this program was run through FEMA, it had a lot \nof paperwork requirements and was time consuming for the State to \nactually formalize. The ultimate decision of who received the rebate \nrested with FEMA and the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management \nand they decided who received the rebate and who did not. If you ask \nme, that is a pretty expensive, poorly designed program, but that is \ngenerally the way FEMA structures these programs when States go to the \ntrouble of requesting them. All told, FEMA's sporadic Hazard Mitigation \nGrant Program for residential storm shelters has supported the \nconstruction of only 15,000 storm shelters at a staggering cost of $35 \nmillion. That is $2,000 for each storm shelter.\n  A different approach is needed to encourage a wider group of people \nto install tornado storm shelters. This would help mitigate the loss of \nlife during tornadoes. To give people the opportunity--I have 20 kids \nand grandkids. My first concern every time I hear of a tornado coming \nis for them. That is why we have introduced this bill called the Storm \nShelter Tax Relief Act. It provides a tax deduction of up to $2,500 to \nany individual who installs a qualified storm shelter. The cost of this \ndeduction is fully offset, which I will explain in a minute, where it \nis coming from, and there are reductions in other areas of spending.\n  First, the deduction can be claimed by any taxpayer. If someone in \nOklahoma, Kentucky, or Tennessee decides they need a storm shelter at \ntheir house, they can pay to have one installed and then claim the \nincentive by deducting up to $2,500 from their income when they file \ntheir taxes. Claiming this incentive would not require dealing with a \nbig bureaucracy. One doesn't have to fill out the forms. One does not \nhave to go through all the redtape. That is one of the reasons people \ndon't do it under the existing programs. As I said before, previous \nprograms that have been administered through FEMA place the power of \nthe shelter incentive into the hands of an agency and not a family, not \nindividuals. The agency then decides who does and does not receive the \nincentive. I think it is best when this middleman can be avoided, and a \ntax deduction does that. The Tax Code is blind and provides the \nincentive to anyone who decides in their best judgment that they need a \nstorm shelter.\n  Lastly, and probably most importantly, the tax deduction is a better \nallocation of scarce taxpayer resources. A rebate that covers a large \nportion of a shelter's cost, as the Oklahoma program did, can foster \nmoral hazard. What I mean is that when free money is on the table, \npeople generally take it. In this case, people may take the rebate to \nbuy a storm shelter because it is free, not because it is what they \nneed. A tax deduction doesn't allow this because the actual incentive \nis much lower in value. No one is going to go out and spend $2,000 or \nmore on a storm shelter because they get to write that amount off of \ntheir taxable income. Nobody does that. A rational individual would \nonly go out to buy a shelter if they know they need one and then it has \nthe added benefit of being deducted from their income, so it is a much \nbetter way of approaching it. On the aggregate level, this allows a lot \nmore people to get the incentive at the same cost compared to the \nrebate programs that have been used in the past. A tax deduction \nprovides a nudge to taxpayers to take practical steps to stay safe in \nareas where tornadoes are common. It is a commonsense approach and a \nbetter way to use taxpayer resources.\n  Further, this proposal's $41 million cost is fully paid for by \nrescinding funds authorized for storm shelter construction grants \nthrough the programs administered through HUD. In other words, we are \ndoing this program and providing countless more shelters at a cost that \nwould merely mean a tax deduction, and it is going to have a lot more \npeople participating in the program. This means that existing unspent \nHUD funds that are duplicative of other FEMA spending will be \nredirected to a more effective policy in order to accomplish the same \ngoal: Encourage the installation of more storm shelters to save lives \nfrom deadly tornadoes.\n\n  Many may wonder why this is something the Federal Government should \nbe doing. In reality, this falls squarely within the purpose of the \nhazard mitigation priorities of the Federal Government. FEMA defines \nhazardous mitigation as ``any sustained action taken to reduce or \neliminate long-term risk to life and property from a hazard event.'' \nHMGP regulations state that projects ``retrofitting structures . . . to \nminimize damages from high winds, earthquake, flood, wildfire, or other \nnatural hazards'' are eligible for the expenditure of program dollars. \nThe main goal of all this spending is to reduce the likelihood of \nlosses of life and property, and retrofitting buildings to lesson the \nlikelihood of damage caused by tornadoes is an eligible expense. That \nis what this tax deduction does.\n  Furthermore, the threat of deadly and dangerous tornadoes stretches \nfar across the Nation. We saw the first map, but this map shows it is \nnot just the tornado alley I referred to right here. With the exception \nof mountainous areas here, the danger zone is all across America. Not \nsurprisingly, Oklahoma is right in the center. When we look at where \ndeadly tornadoes have occurred during the past 30 years, it is spread \nacross the entire eastern half of the country. All the States in red \nhave had at least one deadly tornado every other year since 1980, and \nmost of them have had even more. This may be surprising, but the threat \nis real. It needs to be addressed. More tornado storm shelters need to \nbe constructed around the country and Federal policies encouraging this \nneed to be changed. That is why we are introducing the Storm Shelter \nTax Relief Act. The number of this bill, I say to my colleagues, is S. \n1583. It was introduced today. I think those of us who have lived in \nthese tornado-prone areas--I can tell stories about tornadoes picking \nup a horse and replacing it, dropping it someplace. In my personal \nexperience, my wife was after me about 50 years ago when we had a place \nup in the country--we still have the same place--and I had a red Jeep. \nThat\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\nred Jeep was one we had for a long time. She said, How come you don't \nhave that insured? I said, What could happen to a red Jeep in the \nmiddle of the country in Oklahoma? Well, a tornado came along, picked \nup a tree and dropped it right on top of my red Jeep. It cut it in \nhalf. So they are totally unpredictable.\n  I can tell more stories about Moore, OK, when we had our 1999 tornado \nwhere everything was devastated on one side of the street and nothing \nwas touched on the other side of the street.\n  It is an art to understanding where these are coming from. We now \nhave developed that art. There is not a person who could be in the path \nof a tornado who doesn't have the facilities and the resources to see \nwhat is out there and where it is coming. What they don't have is a \nway, if it is unavoidable, to protect themselves if it hits them. The \nobvious answer is a storm shelter.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Missouri, who is going to speak next, \ncosponsoring this bill. We would like to have more cosponsors. We have \nevery intention of getting this passed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the bill with \nSenator Inhofe. Between he and I, we may have been to the scenes of \nmore tornadoes than almost anybody else in America who is not a storm \nchaser. Because of where we live and what we have done, we have had a \nchance to see the aftermath of many tornadoes. Unlike the floods we \nhave dealt with in our State this year and the hurricanes we have dealt \nwith in other States recently, the tornado is there and you don't get \nmuch warning, and that storm shelter needs to be close if you want a \nchance to get into it.

Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Coburn) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 2832, to \nextend the Generalized System of Preferences, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, in its 2011 report to \n     Congress on ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n     the People's Republic of China,'' found that ``China \n     continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \n     Taiwan contingencies, even as cross-Strait relations \n     improved. The PLA seeks the capability to deter Taiwan \n     independence and influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \n     Beijing's terms. In pursuit of this objective, Beijing is \n     developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny \n     possible U.S. support for the island in the event of \n     conflict. The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n     capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.'' In \n     this report, the Department of Defense also concludes that, \n     over the next decade, China's air force will remain primarily \n     focused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a \n     credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \n     Asia, deter Taiwan independence, or influence Taiwan to \n     settle the dispute on Beijing's terms''.\n       (2) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) conducted a \n     preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of \n     Taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated January \n     21, 2010. The DIA found that, ``[a]lthough Taiwan has nearly \n     400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are \n     operationally capable.'' The report concluded, ``Many of \n     Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service \n     life, and many require extensive maintenance support. The \n     retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the total \n     size of the Taiwan Air Force.''\n       (3) Since 2006, authorities from Taiwan have made repeated \n     requests to purchase 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     from the United States, in an effort to modernize the air \n     force of Taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability.\n       (4) According to a report by the Perryman Group, a private \n     economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of F-\n     16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8,700,000,000 in \n     output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of \n     employment in the US,'' including 23,407 direct jobs, while \n     ``economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and \n     the District of Columbia''.\n       (5) The sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan would both sustain \n     existing high-skilled jobs in key United States manufacturing \n     sectors and create new ones.\n       (6) On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of \n     the House of Representatives sent a letter to the President, \n     expressing support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. On May \n     26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the Senate sent \n     a similar letter to the President, expressing support for the \n     sale. Two other members of the Senate wrote separately to the \n     President or the Secretary of State in 2011 and expressed \n     support for this sale.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability \n     in Asia in the face of China's two-decade-long program of \n     military modernization and expansion of military capabilities \n     is ensuring a militarily strong and confident Taiwan;\n       (2) a Taiwan that is confident in its ability to deter \n     Chinese aggression will increase its ability to proceed in \n     developing peaceful relations with China in areas of mutual \n     interest;\n       (3) the cross-Strait military balance between China and our \n     longstanding strategic partner, Taiwan, has clearly shifted \n     in China's favor;\n       (4) China's military expansion poses a clear and present \n     danger to Taiwan, and this threat has very serious \n     implications for the ability of the United States to fulfill \n     its security obligations to allies in the region and protect \n     our vital United States national interests in East Asia;\n       (5) Taiwan's air force continues to deteriorate, and it \n     needs additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft in order \n     to modernize its fleet and maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability;\n       (6) the United States has a statutory obligation under the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide \n     Taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to \n     maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, in furtherance \n     of maintaining peace and stability in the western Pacific \n     region;\n       (7) in order to comply with the Taiwan Relations Act, the \n     United States must provide Taiwan with additional advanced \n     multirole fighter aircraft, as well as significant upgrades \n     to Taiwan's existing fleet of multirole fighter aircraft; and\n       (8) the proposed sale of F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the \n     United States economy.\n       (c) Sale of Aircraft.--The President shall carry out the \n     sale of no fewer than 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 635.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Citrus Disease Research \n     and Development Trust Fund Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) duties collected on imports of citrus and citrus \n     products have ranged from $50,000,000 to $87,000,000 annually \n     since 2004, and are projected to increase, as United States \n     production declines due to the effects of huanglongbing (also \n     known as ``HLB'' or ``citrus greening disease'') and imports \n     increase in response to the shortfall in the United States;\n       (2) in cases involving other similarly situated \n     agricultural commodities, notably wool, the Federal \n     Government has chosen to divert a portion of the tariff \n     revenue collected on imported products to support efforts of \n     the domestic industry to address challenges facing the \n     industry;\n       (3) citrus and citrus products are a highly nutritious and \n     healthy part of a balanced diet;\n       (4) citrus production is an important part of the \n     agricultural economy in Florida, California, Arizona, and \n     Texas;\n       (5) in the most recent years preceding the date of \n     enactment of this Act, citrus fruits have been produced on \n     900,000 acres, yielding 11,000,000 tons of citrus products \n     with a value at the farm of more than $3,200,000,000;\n       (6) the commercial citrus sector employs approximately \n     110,000 people and contributes approximately $13,500,000,000 \n     to the United States economy;\n       (7) the United States citrus industry has suffered billions \n     of dollars in damage from disease and pests, both domestic \n     and invasive, over the decade preceding the date of enactment \n     of this Act, particularly from huanglongbing;\n       (8) huanglongbing threatens the entire United States citrus \n     industry because the disease kills citrus trees;\n       (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there are no \n     cost effective or environmentally sound treatments available \n     to suppress or eradicate huanglongbing;\n       (10) United States citrus producers working with Federal \n     and State governments have devoted tens of millions of \n     dollars toward research and efforts to combat huanglongbing \n     and other diseases and pests, but more funding is needed to \n     develop and commercialize disease and pest solutions;\n       (11) although imports constitute an increasing share of the \n     United States market, importers of citrus products into the \n     United States do not directly fund production research in the \n     United States;\n       (12) disease and pest suppression technologies require \n     determinations of safety and solutions must be commercialized \n     before use by citrus producers;\n       (13) the complex processes involved in discovery and \n     commercialization of safe and effective pest and disease \n     suppression technologies are expensive and lengthy and the \n     need for the technologies is urgent; and\n       (14) research to develop solutions to suppress \n     huanglongbing, or other domestic and invasive pests and \n     diseases will benefit all citrus producers and consumers \n     around the world.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to authorize the establishment of a trust funded by \n     certain tariff revenues to support scientific research, \n     technical assistance, and development activities to combat \n     citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and invasive, \n     harming the United States; and\n       (2) to require the President to notify the chairperson and \n     ranking member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives before entering into any trade agreement that \n     would decrease the amount of duties collected on imports of \n     citrus products to less than the amount necessary to provide \n     the grants authorized by section 1001(d) of the Trade Act of \n     1974, as added by section 3(a) of this Act.\n       (c) Effect on Other Activities.--Nothing in this Act \n     restricts the use of any funds for scientific research and \n     technical activities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. __03.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Affordable Footwear Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Average collected duties on imported footwear are among \n     the highest of any product sector, totaling approximately \n     $2,000,000,000 during 2010.\n       (2) Duty rates on imported footwear are among the highest \n     imposed by the United States Government, with some as high as \n     the equivalent of 67.5 percent ad valorem.\n       (3) The duties currently imposed by the United States were \n     set in an era during which high rates of duty were intended \n     to protect production of footwear in the United States.\n       (4) Footwear produced in the United States supplies only \n     about 1 percent of the total United States market for \n     footwear. This production is concentrated in distinct product \n     groupings, which are not affected by the provisions of this \n     title.\n       (5) Footwear duties, which are higher on lower-price \n     footwear, serve no purpose and are a hidden, regressive tax \n     on those people in the United States least able to pay.\n       (6) Low- and moderate-income families spend a larger share \n     of their disposable income on footwear than higher-income \n     families.\n       (7) The outdoor industry develops innovative and high \n     performance footwear that promotes healthy and active \n     lifestyles through outdoor recreation.\n\n     SEC. __03. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is no production in the United States of many \n     footwear articles;\n       (2) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles \n     will not negatively affect manufacturing or employment in the \n     United States; and\n       (3) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles \n     will result in reduced retail prices for a wide range of \n     consumers.\n\n     SEC. __04. AMENDMENT TO THE HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES.\n\n       The Additional Notes to chapter 64 of the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States are amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``5. For the purposes of determining the constituent \n     material of the outer sole pursuant to Note 4(b) of this \n     chapter, the constituent material of an outer sole consisting \n     of rubber or plastics to which textile materials are attached \n     or into which such materials are otherwise incorporated shall \n     be deemed to be only rubber or plastics, and no account shall \n     be taken of the textile materials.''.\n\n     SEC. __05.
