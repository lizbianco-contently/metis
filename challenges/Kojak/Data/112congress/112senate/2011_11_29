The Senate Democrats' No. 1 priority of this Congress is to \npass commonsense legislation; for example, tax cuts and infrastructure \ninvestments, all these ideas we have to put Americans back to work and \nrevive our economy. The Republicans in the House, on the other hand, \nare focused on gutting the safeguards to keep our air clean, make \nworkplaces safe, and check the greed of big Wall Street firms.\n  Never mind that wholesale destruction of measures which save millions \nof lives and trillions of dollars each year have no chance of passing. \nNever mind that nonpartisan experts and economists on both sides of the \naisle say the so-called jobs agenda will not create a single job. House \nRepublicans have complained we have not taken up and passed these \npolicies, which would risk American lives while doing nothing to \nimprove our economy. They insist we should waste weeks or months on \nlegislation that is both dangerous and proven to fail.\n  But the Senate has too much work to do on legislation that would \ncreate jobs without risking American lives to waste time on these \nineffectual, purely partisan measures. Our jobs agenda was designed to \ncreate jobs, not headlines.\n  In any case, the Senate has passed its own share of legislation--40 \npieces, in fact--that have yet to be taken up by the House Republican \nleaders. The Senate has passed legislation that would\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\nstop China from cheating American workers by manipulating its currency, \nevening the playing field for American exporters and saving jobs.\n  We passed a bill to modernize the air travel system. The FAA \nreauthorization is so important, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs \nbut would also keep passengers safer and save money on travel time.\n  We passed a measure that would protect lives by keeping our foods \nsafe from contamination. The House Republicans are refusing to take up \nthese, period. The House Republicans blocked many reasonable jobs \nproposals with a proven track record of success. They are simply too \nbusy rooting for our economy to fail and pursuing an extreme social \nagenda to work with Democrats to create jobs. That will not stop the \nDemocrats from doing everything in our power to get the economy back on \ntrack. That is why Senator Casey has worked to put money back into the \npockets of middle-class workers and small businesses by extending and \nexpanding the payroll tax cut.\n  This legislation cuts taxes for 160 million American workers, saving \nthe average family $1,500 each year. Those families will have more \nmoney to spend on their local economy, grocery stores, pharmacies, and \ngiving communities across the country a financial shot in the arm.\n  The proposal would give payroll tax cuts to businesses, including \n50,000 businesses in Nevada. More than 1.2 million Nevada workers would \nbenefit from the payroll tax cut this year. Under our proposal, they \nwill get even greater tax relief next year.\n  Payroll tax cuts have been a boon to the economy in every State in \nthe Nation. In Kentucky, for example, the home of my friend the \nminority leader, 2.1 million workers took home $1.2 billion in payroll \ntax cuts this year alone. That is why the minority leader said in 2009 \nthat a payroll tax cut ``would put a lot of money back in the hands of \nbusinesses and in the hands of individuals.'' The average Kentucky \nfamily will keep $1,330 of their hard-earned money next year under our \nexpanded payroll tax credit, and 70,000 firms in Kentucky will benefit \nfrom these tax cuts.\n\n  Senator McConnell said in 2009: ``Republicans, generally speaking, \nfrom Maine to Mississippi, like tax relief.'' Yet the Republicans \nalready appear poised to block this legislation.\n  Let's be clear on what a ``no'' vote on this proposal means. It is a \nvote to deny tax relief to millions of businesses. It is a vote to \nraise taxes for 120 million families by nearly $1,000. The Republicans \nwho vote no will literally be taking money out of the pockets of \nmiddle-class families.\n  Once upon a time, Republicans rushed to cut taxes, regardless of \nwhich tax cut it was and whether it added trillions to the deficit. For \nexample, the Bush tax cuts that we hear so much about added trillions \nof dollars to our deficit--and it is obvious what was going on during \nthe Bush cuts--and now these tax cuts have not created jobs that amount \nto anything. Today, they are lining up against a new tax cut, my \nRepublican friends, to put money back in the pockets of the middle \nclass, ensure that businesses have more cash to hire new workers and \nget our economy moving immediately.\n  I hope Republicans will now start working with us to pass a tax cut \nfor 160 million American workers and nearly every business in America. \nAs my friend the Republican leader said: ``Republicans, generally \nspeaking, from Maine to Mississippi, like tax relief.'' I hope they \nremember what the Republican leader said time and time again.\n  Will the Chair announce the business for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7938-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments in the \nSenate to pay tribute to a remarkable woman. Maggie Daley served with \ndignity and grace for 22 years as Chicago's first lady. She died on \nThanksgiving evening after a nearly decade-long struggle with breast \ncancer. She was at home, surrounded by her loving family. There is a \nsad but fitting poignancy to the date. People in Chicago and far beyond \nhave so many reasons to be thankful for the life of this exceptional \nwoman. Maggie Daley was an adopted daughter of Chicago, but no native-\nborn Chicagoan could have loved the city more or served it better.\n  Last May, as her husband Rich prepared to step down as Chicago's \nmayor, the Chicago Tribune wrote an article about what Maggie Daley \nmeant to Chicago. The first paragraph put it well: ``There has never \nbeen and may never be a Chicago first lady of greater impact, influence \nand inspiration than Maggie Daley.''\n  Maggie was smart, funny, tireless, amazingly modest, and deeply \ncompassionate. She was also a very private person. Yet she still \nmanaged to touch the lives of so many people. The love Chicagoans feel \nfor Maggie Daley was reflected in the faces of the people who waited in \na line over a block long, in the rain, this last Sunday, to attend her \nwake at the Chicago Cultural Center--incidentally, a building which she \nworked hard to restore.\n  I stood in that line and talked to many people. Some of them I knew \nfrom my public life and their public lives but many just private \ncitizens, some of whom had met her briefly, some who had worked with \nher for years, but they all came to pay tribute to her. Among them was \nHazel Holt, 74 years old. The Chicago Tribune described Mrs. Holt as a \nperson who decided to drive:\n\n       . . . downtown in her church finery from the Gresham \n     neighborhood on the South Side, absorbed the cost of parking, \n     rode the bus and then walked on a damp, chilly November day \n     to the wake.\n\n  Mrs. Holt said Maggie Daley ``built connections to the city's people \nwith her commitment to charities assisting children, as well as her \npublic poise in the face of cancer that would claim her life.'' She \nwent on to say to the reporter:\n\n       I just loved this lady. I wish I had one-quarter of her \n     grace. She was a role model for a lot of us.\n\n  That is a feeling shared by many of us in Chicago and beyond. Upon \nhearing of Maggie's death, Nancy Brinker, the founder and CEO of the \nSusan G. Komen Foundation for the Cure, said: ``We've lost a real \ngeneral.''\n  Loretta and I were blessed to have known Maggie personally, and Rich \nhas been my friend, colleague, and even boss for decades. Yesterday \nmorning, I attended Maggie's funeral at the old St. Patrick's Church in \nthe neighborhood parish in Chicago. I remember the last mass I attended \nthere with Maggie and Rich Daley. It was St. Patrick's Day. It is a big \nday in Chicago on St. Patrick's Day and ground zero for the celebration \nof old St. Pat.\n  It was clear Maggie's health was flagging. She had to sit through \nmost of the service. She came to the front pew in a wheelchair. But all \nthose struggles were quickly forgotten as her children and grandkids \nwere seated next to her, and we heard from the back of the church, \nafter the mass, that sound we all waited for, the famous Shannon Rovers \nbagpipe band from the Bridgeport section of Chicago. They come marching \nup the center aisle with those bagpipes blasting. It is a moment I will \nnever forget. Maggie's grandkids were nervously waiting, expectantly \nwaiting for the sound of the bagpipes, scrambling all over the pew and \nall over Maggie and Rich to get to the point where they could peer out \ndown the center aisle to watch the bagpipers come away.\n  I looked at Maggie and Rich at that moment and I saw them beaming \nwith the kind of joy that loving parents and grandparents just live \nfor. Maggie was a patron saint of social causes, but her deepest \nconvictions were to God and family. Maggie and Rich Daley had been \nblessed with four children: Patrick, Nora, Kevin, and Lally. Years\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\nago, she made her husband keep a promise to reserve Sundays exclusively \nfor private family time. So the bottom line was this: One could ask \nMayor Daley 6 days of the week to go anywhere in Chicago or anywhere \nelse but Sunday, no way. He made a promise to Maggie that that was \nfamily day. It is a promise he always kept, and we respect him for it.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the family announced that their youngest daughter \nLally had moved the date of her wedding from New Year's Eve to late \nNovember so Maggie could attend. It was a signal that the end was near, \nbut she was at that wedding. There she was in her wheelchair with that \nirrepressible smile, a beaming mother, celebrating her daughter's \nhappiness. It is quintessential Maggie.\n  Part of the reason Maggie Daley found such joy in life is that she \nunderstood what a fragile gift life can be. In 1981, her third child, \nKevin, died from spina bifida just shy of his third birthday. After \nKevin's death, she found healing and meaning in reaching out to help \nothers and especially in volunteering to work for kids with \ndisabilities. Someone once called her the godmother of all Chicago's \nchildren. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on her passing that Mayor Rich Daley \nmay have been the head of the city, but Maggie Daley was the heart of \nChicago.\n  In 1991, Maggie and Lois Weisberg, Chicago's long-time Commissioner \nof Cultural Affairs and an icon in her own right, began something \ncalled Gallery 37. There was an abandoned piece of real estate in the \nmiddle of downtown Chicago that had been lost in legal and court \nbattles for decades. So Maggie and Lois decided to set up a tent on \nthis old plot of land that was sitting vacant and create Gallery 37, \nwhich was an art gallery for kids. All across Chicago they invited \nkids--grade school and high school--to submit their artwork. We all \nwent down there for the joy of that moment, of seeing the kids and the \npride they had, and some of the magnificent artwork they produced, all \nbecause Maggie and Lois decided here was an opportunity they couldn't \nmiss.\n  That program later morphed or matured into an amazing program called \nAfter School Matters. Maggie thought: If I can occupy these kids with \nart and music and drama and theater and chorus during the school year, \nlet's do it after school--a vulnerable time for many kids. So over two \ndecades, Maggie Daley nurtured the artistic talents of thousands of \nChicago high school students and became a model for programs in many \ncities across the country and as far away as London and Australia.\n  The last time Maggie was in this building was in my office. She came \nupstairs to visit and to lobby me for money for After School Matters. \nNeedless to say, she won my vote and my support.\n  Maggie Daley believed that art could change lives. She believed that \nartistic talent could exist in children from the Robert Taylor Homes in \nChicago as surely as it could from children in better, more wealthy \nneighborhoods, and that all young people should have the opportunity to \ndevelop their talents together. That is why After School Matters has \nbecome such an amazing program.\n  Maggie Daley also served on the auxiliary board of the Art Institute \nand the Women's Board of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. She \nwas a very busy person.\n  It was a happy accident that Maggie Daley came to Chicago. Margaret \nAnn Corbett Daley was born and grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh. She \nwas the youngest of Patrick and Elizabeth Corbett's seven kids and \ntheir only girl. After graduating in 1965 from the University of \nDayton, she entered a management training program for Xerox and her job \ntook her to Chicago. She promised her dad she was going to stay in \nChicago for 2 years and then come back to Pittsburgh. But in 1970 she \nmet a young attorney named Rich Daley at a Christmas party. They \ndecided to date, got engaged, and were married for nearly 40 years.\n  The average survival rate for Maggie's form of breast cancer that has \nspread beyond the breast and lymph nodes is very brief. Maggie Daley \nlived with this incurable illness for 9 years. Her doctors called it a \nmedical miracle. She endured years of painful treatments and faced her \ncancer with courage, dignity, grace, and good humor. As the cancer \nprogressed, she relied on crutches, a walker, and eventually even a \nwheelchair, but the smile never quit.\n  She donated generously to help open the Maggie Daley Center for \nWomen's Cancer Care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital last year. The \ncenter helps other women facing cancer by providing access to doctors \nand important support services.\n  Loretta and I obviously offer our deepest condolences to Rich Daley, \nhis wonderful children and their families--all of the Daley children \nand grandchildren. We trust that time and treasured memories will ease \nthe great sorrow they obviously feel. They can also take comfort in \nknowing that the legacy of Margaret Corbett Daley can be seen and felt \nall over her adopted city of Chicago.\n  Maggie Daley's dedication to the arts will continue in part through \nthe work of her daughters, Nora Daley Conroy, who chairs Chicago's \nCultural Affairs Advisory Committee, and, of course, Lally, who will \ncontinue in her mom's tradition. Her commitment to education will live \non in the lives of the young people she has touched. Her courage will \nendure in women she inspired who can now find medical care at the \ncenter she helped establish.\n  Maggie Daley was a modest person. She didn't like to talk about \nherself; she preferred speaking of others. Two years after she was \ndiagnosed with cancer, she gave an interview to the Chicago Sun Times \nin which she hinted about how she felt about the future. This is what \nshe said:\n\n       I try not to waste any time. At the end of the day, what's \n     important is if you think that the people around you have \n     maybe had a better day because of some of the things you've \n     done.\n\n  By that standard and so many others, Maggie Daley lived a good and \nfull life. She did much good, and she will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7939-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7939-S7940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PAYROLL TAX CUT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will only take a moment to say that we \nhave an opportunity now, before we leave for Christmas, to not forget \npeople across America who are struggling in this economy.\n  A payroll tax cut, instituted by President Obama and supported by \nCongress, basically gives more working families a little bit extra \nmoney each month. For the average working family in Illinois, it is \nabout $1,500 a year. For some of us in the Senate, that may not seem \nlike an enormous sum of money, but for families struggling paycheck to \npaycheck it makes a big difference.\n  We need to make certain we restore this payroll tax cut which is \ngoing to expire at the end of this year. How terrible it would be for \nus to impose an additional burden on working families, to impose a new \npayroll tax on working families when they are struggling in this \neconomy that needs their spending power. Every economist taking a look \nat this has said the two best things Congress can do to help this \neconomy move forward and not fall back is to make sure this payroll tax \ncut is protected and that this new payroll tax is not imposed on \nfamilies; and, secondly, to extend unemployment benefits for the \nmillions across America who are still struggling to find a job.\n  We need to call on our colleagues--Democrats and Republicans. For \ngoodness sake, how can we in good conscience go home to celebrate the \nholiday season with our families and say to the millions of working \nfamilies across America: Incidentally, on January 1, your taxes are \ngoing up. That is wrong. It is not fair. Whatever our rationale \npolitically, it makes no sense in the family rooms and neighborhoods of \nAmerica that we would impose a new payroll tax on working families who \nare working so hard to keep their heads above water. Before we leave, \nlet us follow the lead of Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania who is \nsponsoring this legislation. Let us extend this payroll tax cut to help \nworking families and help our economy.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about CPT \nSamson Luke, 33 years old, who lived in Greenwood, AR.\n  Captain Luke was one of those people who had many options in life. \nFortunately for us, he made the decision to serve his country, and he \ndid so with distinction. He was a field artillery officer who served on \nactive duty in the Army from 2000 to 2007. Afterwards, he served in the \nArkansas National Guard where he was a commander of the HHB 1-142nd \nfield artillery. Here is a photo of him with his family. His family was \nvery important to him.\n  He had been to Iraq on two different deployments, after which he was \nawarded the Bronze Star. As I said, he elected to stay on with the \nArkansas National Guard. He served with distinction there. He told his \nwife, who is pictured here, that he felt he was truly at his best when \nhe was leading men.\n  I want to talk about him for a moment because, quite frankly, the \nbean counters over at the Pentagon are trying to save a little money at \nhis family's expense. So I want to talk about his passing away on \nJanuary 10 of 2010--less than a year ago. It was a weekend where he was \ndoing his required training weekend. He was authorized, because he \nlived so close to the post, to spend Saturday night with his wife and \nhis four young children at his home instead of staying on the post. In \nfact, he wasn't authorized to stay on the post because he was so close \nto home. He had to be off post. The idea was he would return to the \npost the next morning and finish up his weekend on that Sunday, but he \nnever woke up. While dealing with this tragedy, his wife was informed \nthat her family would not receive his death benefits. From my \nstandpoint, this is a classic case of getting pencil whipped by the \ngovernment.\n  The Arkansas National Guard has stepped up. They have done everything \nthey could do. They have run it through all the proper channels. They \nhave been very supportive of making sure that Captain Luke's family \ngets his death benefits. I feel as though--and people in the Guard do \nas well--that they are entitled to have the death benefits, but it is \nout of their hands. The law states that death benefits are allocated if \na soldier dies while remaining overnight at or ``in the vicinity of the \nsite of the inactive duty training.''\n  What I want to do with my amendment I am offering through the Defense \nauthorization bill is clarify Congress's intent and make sure that the \nvery tiny number of people who are in his shoes and his family will be \nentitled to these death benefits.\n  I spent a year working on this issue with the Army and with the \nDepartment of Defense and, again, the Arkansas National Guard has \nstepped up and they have been great, but we are at a standstill over \nthe DOD's interpretation of ``vicinity.''\n  This is an important point that I want my colleagues to understand: \nHad Captain Luke stayed on base or had he stayed at a hotel at the \ntaxpayers' expense or had he been traveling to or from his post--his \ntraining--the family would receive these benefits. In fact, the Guard \nhas a policy that if a guardsman lives within so many miles of the \npost, he or she cannot stay on the post, they have to go home. They \ndon't have arrangements for a person to stay there. They want the \nperson to go home. This saves the government money by not putting \npeople up in a hotel or whatever else they may have to do. When a \nperson is on a National Guard training weekend, as Captain Luke was, \nthat person is under orders for 48 continuous hours. Wherever they are \nsleeping, wherever they are traveling, whatever they are doing, they \nare on orders; they are on duty.\n  Captain Luke was on duty when he died. In fact, if his colonel had \ncalled him at 1 o'clock in the morning and said get over here, we need \nyour help on something, he would have had to go over there. He was on \nduty. He was on orders. He would have done that. In fact, he would have \ngladly stayed on the post had they had provisions for him to do that, \nbut it worked out in this case that he was able, because he lived so \nclose, to stay with his wife and family.\n  Also, let me say this: Had he been on orders and gotten out--which, \nof course, would never have happened to him--but had a soldier like him \ngotten out and had he done something such as had a DUI that night, that \nsoldier would have been subject to the code of military justice because \nhe was on orders. But, nonetheless, Captain Luke died when he was on \norders, and now the Pentagon is trying to deny him his death benefits.\n  What my amendment does is clarify congressional intent to ensure that \nservicemembers who live in the area or in the vicinity of their \ntraining site can return home to their families in the evening without \nlosing benefits. Again, they are on orders; they remain on orders. This \ndoesn't change anything along those lines; it just clarifies \ncongressional intent. This is a gray area. We are trying to clarify the \ncongressional intent.\n  This amendment will not bring back the Luke children's father and \ntheir mother's husband, but it will give them the benefits to which \nthey are entitled.\n  I think we can do better for our soldiers' families. When we look at \nMiranda, Miller, Macklin, Larkin, and Landis Luke in this photograph, \nwe know that this is a very patriotic family and this is a group of \npeople who should be compensated for his loss.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said: ``To care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle and for his widow, and his orphan,'' and those words apply in \nthis instance. Captain Luke was serving his country to the fullest and \nhis family should be granted the benefits associated with the death of \na servicemember.\n  I am fighting on behalf of Captain Luke and his family and for others \nin a similarly situated circumstance to clarify that when a person is \non orders when they are doing their National Guard training, they are \nentitled to death benefits wherever they happen to be laying their head \nat that particular time.\n  One last word on this. We don't know exactly how much this will cost, \nbut it will not be very much money.\n  Someone estimated--I do not think it is an official CBO score, but \nsomeone estimated it would probably cost $1 million--that is with an \n``m''--over 10 years. This is budget dust. This is so small, it is \nalmost laughable, but it is so meaningful to this family and maybe \nothers who in the future will find themselves in this situation.\n  So I would like to ask my colleagues to consider supporting the Pryor \namendment. That is amendment No. 1151. I would love to work with the \nbill managers to see if we might get it into a managers' package and/\nor, if we have to, request a rollcall vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7940-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7940-S7941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Colonel Randall L. Koehlmoos\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American \nmilitary leader from Nebraska, Colonel Randall L. Koehlmoos, U.S. Army.\n  Colonel Koehlmoos died in Jakarta, Indonesia, where he was the Chief \nof the Office of Defense Cooperation at our U.S. Embassy.\n  Officers in the U.S. Army have many roles. We most often recognize \nthose who lead soldiers in combat. Others are assigned to protecting \nand promoting vital American interests throughout the world. During a \nnotable career, Colonel Koehlmoos served with equal skill and \ncommitment in both roles.\n  His life of public service began early when a high school art teacher \ninvited him to attend a National Guard drill. Randy was hooked. After \njoining the Nebraska Army National Guard, he attended the University of \nNebraska and earned an officer's commission through the ROTC program. \nHe spent much of his early career with the famed 82nd Airborne \nDivision, where he became a master parachutist with over 100 jumps. He \nled a platoon during the 1991 gulf war and later a company during NATO \noperations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\n  The diplomatic side of the colonel's career emerged in the 1990s. Not \nsatisfied with what many consider easy assignments in U.S. Embassies, \nhe immersed himself in history, culture, and language. He would become \nfluent in four foreign languages and attend the Pakistan Army Staff \nCollege. A crowning achievement for Colonel Koehlmoos--beyond leading \nsoldiers in combat--was writing a major article about relations between \nthe United States and Pakistan. His article, titled ``Positive \nPerceptions to Sustain the U.S.-Pakistan Relationship,'' was published \nin the prestigious Army War College quarterly Parameters.\n  The decorations and badges earned during his distinguished service \nspeak to his dedication and his skill: Defense Superior Service Medal, \nBronze Star, NATO Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism, Meritorious Unit \nCitation, and several foreign nation awards. He was perhaps most proud \nof having earned the Master Parachutist Badge.\n  Colonel Koehlmoos was known to be a no-nonsense individual. He was \nalways focused on the mission. But Randy had a soft spot. An \nunrelenting spiritual love of family dwelled inside this stoic, \nprofessional Army officer. His wife Tracey and his sons Robert and \nMichael and David meant absolutely everything to him. The colonel's \nlarger family extended through his parents Larry and Karen Koehlmoos of \nNorfolk, Nebraska, to friends and colleagues around the world who \nrevered his strength, compassion and leadership.\n  Today, I ask that God be with the family of Colonel Randall \nKoehlmoos. Their faith is strong, and I pray it brings them peace at \nthis very difficult time. And may God bless all those serving in \nuniform and bless their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, James Madison, the father of the \nConstitution, warned:\n\n       The means of defense against foreign danger historically \n     have become instruments of tyranny at home.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln had similar thoughts saying:\n\n       America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we \n     falter, and lose our freedoms, it will be because we \n     destroyed ourselves.\n\n  During war there has always been a struggle to preserve \nconstitutional liberties. During the Civil War, the right of habeas \ncorpus was suspended. Newspapers were closed down. Fortunately, these \nrights were restored after the war. The discussion now to suspend \ncertain rights of due process is especially worrisome given that we are \nengaged in a war that appears to have no end. Rights given up now \ncannot be expected to return.\n  So we do well to contemplate the diminishment of due process knowing \nthat these rights we give up now may never be restored. My well-\nintentioned colleagues' admonitions in defending provisions of this \nDefense bill say we should give up certain rights: the right to due \nprocess. Their legislation would arm the military with the authority to \ndetain indefinitely, without due process or trial, people suspected of \nassociation with terrorism. These would include American citizens \napprehended on American soil.\n  I want to repeat that. We are talking about people who are merely \nsuspected of terrorism or suspected of committing a crime and have been \njudged by no court. We are talking about American citizens who could be \ntaken from the United States and sent to a camp at Guantanamo Bay and \nheld indefinitely.\n  This should be alarming to everyone watching this proceeding today \nbecause it puts every single American citizen at risk. There is one \nthing and one thing only that is protecting American citizens, and that \nis our Constitution, the checks we put on government power. Should we \nerr today and remove some of the most important checks on State power \nin the name of fighting terrorism, well, then, the terrorists have won.\n  Detaining citizens without a court trial is not American. In fact, \nthis alarming arbitrary power is reminiscent of what Egypt did with its \npermanent emergency law. This permanent emergency law allowed them to \ndetain their own citizens without a court trial. Egyptians became so \nalarmed at that last spring that they overthrew their government.\n  Recently, Justice Scalia affirmed this idea in his dissent in the \nHamdi case saying:\n\n       Where the government accuses a citizen of waging war \n     against it, our constitutional tradition has been to \n     prosecute him in Federal court for treason or another crime.\n\n  Scalia concluded by saying:\n\n       The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system \n     of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite \n     imprisonment at the will of the Executive.\n\n  Justice Scalia was, as he often does, following the wisdom of our \nFounding Fathers. As Franklin wisely warned:\n\n       These who give up their liberty for security may wind up \n     with neither.\n\n  Really, what security does this indefinite detention of Americans \ngive us? The first and flawed premise, both here and in the badly \nmisnamed PATRIOT Act, is that our pre-9/11 police powers were \ninsufficient to stop terrorism. This is simply not borne out by the \nfacts. Congress long ago made it a crime to provide or conspire to \nprovide material assistance to al-Qaida or other foreign terrorist \norganizations.\n  Material assistance includes virtually anything of value: legal, \npolitical advice, education, books, newspapers, lodging, or otherwise. \nThe Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of this sweeping \nprohibition. We have laws on the books that can prosecute terrorists \nbefore they commit acts of terrorism. Al-Qaida adherents may be \ndetained, prosecuted, and convicted for conspiring to violate the \nmaterial assistance prohibition. In fact, we have already done this.\n  Jose Padilla, for instance, was convicted and sentenced to 17 years \nin prison for conspiring to provide material assistance to al-Qaida. \nThe criminal law does require and can prevent crimes from occurring \nbefore they do occur. Indeed, conspiracy laws and prosecutions in \ncivilian courts have been routinely invoked after 9/11 to thwart \nembryonic international terrorism. In fact, in the Bush administration, \nMichael Chertoff, then head of the Justice Department's Criminal \nDivision and later Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \ntestified shortly after 9/11. He underscored:\n\n       The history of this government in prosecuting terrorists in \n     domestic courts has been one of unmitigated success, and one \n     in which the judges have done a superb job of managing the \n     courtroom and not compromising our concerns about security \n     and our concerns about classified information.\n\n  We can prosecute terrorists in our courts, and have done so. It is \nthe wonderful thing about our country, that even with the most \ndespicable criminal, murderer, rapist, or terrorist our court systems \ndo work. We can have constitutional liberty and prosecute terrorists. \nThere is no evidence that the criminal justice procedures have \nfrustrated intelligence collection about international terrorism.\n  Suspected terrorist have repeatedly waived both the right to an \nattorney and the right to silence. Additionally, Miranda warnings are \nnot required at all when the purpose of the interrogation is public \nsafety. The authors of this bill errantly maintain that the bill would \nnot enlarge the universe of detainees, people held indefinitely. I \nbelieve this is simply not the case.\n  The current authorization for the use of military force confines the \nuniverse to persons implicated in 9/11 or who harbored those who were. \nThis new detainee provision will expand the universe to include any \nperson said to be part of or substantially supportive of al-Qaida or \nthe Taliban. But, remember, this is not someone who has been concluded \nat trial to be part of al-Qaida. This is someone who is suspected.\n  If someone is a suspect in our country they are usually accorded due \nprocess. They go to court. They are not automatically guilty. They are \naccused of a crime. But now we are saying\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nsomeone accused of a crime can be taken from American soil. An American \ncitizen accused of a crime, a suspect of a crime, could be taken to \nGuantanamo Bay. These terms are dangerously vague.\n  More than a decade after 9/11 the military has been unable to define \nthe earmarks of membership in or affiliation to either al-Qaida or \nother terrorist organizations. It is an accusation and sometimes \ndifficult to prove.\n  Some say to prevent another 9/11 attack we must fight terrorism with \na war mentality and not treat potential attackers as criminals. For \ncombatants captured on the battlefield, I agree. But these are people \ncaptured or detained in America, American citizens. Mr. President, 9/11 \ndid not succeed because we granted terrorists due process. In fact, 9/\n11 did not succeed because al-Qaida was so formidable but because of \nhuman error. The Defense Department withheld intelligence from the FBI. \nNo warrants were denied. The warrants were not even requested. The FBI \nfailed to act on repeated pleas from its field agents who were in \npossession of a laptop that may well have had information that may well \nhave prevented 9/11. But no judge ever turned down a warrant.\n  Our criminal system did not fail. No one ever asked for a warrant to \nlook at Moussaoui's computer in August, a month before 9/11. These are \nnot failures of our law. These are not failures of our Constitution. \nThese are not reasons we should scrap our Constitution and simply send \npeople accused of terrorism to Guantanamo Bay--American citizens. These \nare failures of imperfect men and women in bloated bureaucracies. No \namount of liberty sacrificed at the altar of the state will ever change \nthat.\n  A full accounting of our human failures by the 9/11 Commission has \nproven that enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and the \nintelligence community, not military action or not giving up our \nliberty at home, is the key to thwarting international terrorism. We \nshould not have to sacrifice our liberty to be safe.\n  We cannot allow the rules to change to fit the whims of those in \npower. The rules, the binding chains of the Constitution, were written \nso it did not matter who was in power. In fact, they were written to \nprotect us and our rights from those who hold power with good \nintentions. We are not governed by saints or angels. Occasionally, we \nwill elect people, and there have been times in history when those who \ncome into power are not angels. That is why we have laws and rules that \nrestrain what the government can do. That is why we have laws that \nprotect us and say we are innocent until proven guilty. That is why we \nhave laws that say we should have a trial before a judge and a jury of \nour peers before we are sent off to some prison indefinitely.\n  Finally, the detainee provisions of the Defense authorization bill do \nanother grave harm to freedom. They imply perpetual war for the first \ntime in the history of the United States. No benchmarks are established \nthat would ever terminate the conflict with al-Qaida, the Taliban, or \nother foreign terrorist organizations. In fact, this bill explicitly \nsays that no part of this bill is to imply any restriction on the \nauthorization of force.\n  When will the wars ever end? When will these provisions end? No \ncongressional view is allowed or imagined. No victory is defined. No \npeace is possible if victory is made impossible by definition. To \ndisavow the idea that the exclusive congressional power to declare war \nsomehow allows the President to continue war forever, at whim, I will \noffer an amendment to this bill that will deauthorize the war in Iraq. \nWe are bringing the troops home in January. Is there any reason why we \nshould have an open-ended commitment to war in Iraq when the war is \nending?\n  If we need to go to war in Iraq again, we should debate on it and \nvote on it. It is an important enough matter that we should not have an \nopen-ended commitment to the war in Iraq. The use of military force \nmust begin in Congress. Our Founding Fathers separated those powers and \nsaid Congress has the power to declare war, and it is a precious and \nimportant power. We should not give that up to the President. We should \nnot allow the President to unilaterally engage in war.\n  Congress should not be ignored or be an afterthought in these matters \nand must reclaim its constitutional duties. These are important points \nof fact. Know good and well that someday there could be a government in \npower that is shipping its citizens off for disagreements. There are \nlaws on the books now that characterize who might be a terrorist: \nsomeone missing fingers on their hands is a suspect according to the \nDepartment of Justice, someone who has guns, someone who has ammunition \nthat is weatherproofed, someone who has more than 7 days of food in \ntheir house can be considered a potential terrorist.\n  If someone is suspected by these activities, do we want the \ngovernment to have the ability to send them to Guantanamo Bay for \nindefinite detention? A suspect? We are not talking about someone who \nhas been tried and found guilty; we are talking about someone suspected \nof activities. But some of the things that make us suspicious of \nterrorism are having more than 7 days' worth of food, missing fingers \non their hand, having weatherproofed ammunition, having several guns at \ntheir house. Is that enough? Are we willing to sacrifice our freedom \nfor liberty?\n  I would argue that we should strike these detainee provisions from \nthis bill because we are giving up our liberty. We are giving up the \nconstitutional right to have due process before we are sent to a \nprison. This is very important. I think this is a constitutional \nliberty we should not look at and blithely sign away to the Executive \npower or to the military.\n  So I would call for support of the amendment that will strike the \nprovisions on keeping detainees indefinitely, particularly the fact \nthat we can now, for the first time, send American citizens to prisons \nabroad. I think that is a grave danger to our constitutional liberty. I \nadvise a vote to strike those provisions from the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I listened to the discussion by Senator \nRand Paul, and I understand his theory. Facts are stubborn things, and \n27 percent of those who have been released have been back in the fight. \nThat is fact. That is fact. Some of them have assumed leadership \npositions with al-Qaida. That is fact.\n  The Senator from Kentucky wants to have a situation prevail where \npeople are released and go back in the fight and kill Americans. That \nis his right. He is entitled to that opinion. But facts are stubborn \nthings. The fact is 27 percent of detainees who were released went back \ninto the fight to try to kill Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. With regard to releasing prisoners, I am not asking that we \nrelease them. I think there probably have been some mistakes with \npeople who have been let go. What I am asking only is for due process, \nand we released some of those people without any kind of process and a \nflawed process. So we did make a mistake.\n  Due process does not mean, and believing in the process does not mean \nnecessarily that we would release these people. Due process often \nconvicts. Jose Padilla was given 17 years in prison with due process. \nSo I do not think it necessarily follows that I am arguing for \nreleasing prisoners. I am simply arguing that people, particularly \nAmerican citizens in the United States, not be sent to a foreign prison \nwithout due process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to that, we are not arguing \nthat they be sent to a foreign prison. What we are arguing is that they \nare designated as enemy combattants. When they are enemy combatants, \nthen they are subject to the rules and the laws of war. Again, I point \nout the fact that there have been a number who have been released who \nhave reentered the fight, and that kind of situation is not something \nwe want to prevail.\n  So as I said, facts are stubborn things, and they are designated as \nenemy combatants and will be treated as such during the period of \nconflict.\n  Mr. PAUL. My question would be, under the provisions, would it be \npossible that an American citizen then could be declared an enemy \ncombatant and sent to Guantanamo Bay and detained indefinitely?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I take it that as long as the individual, no matter who \nthey\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nare--if they pose a threat to the security of the United States of \nAmerica, they should not be allowed to continue that threat. I think \nthat is the opinion of the American public, especially in light of the \nfacts I continue to repeat to the Senator from Kentucky--that 27 \npercent of the detainees who were released got back in the fight and \nwere responsible for the deaths of Americans. We need to take every \nstep necessary to prevent that from happening. That is for the safety \nand security of the men and women who are putting their lives on the \nline in the armed services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is morning business time still pending?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that all morning business time be \nyielded back unless there is a request on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand there is a pending UC that Senator Udall is \nto be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1107\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak in\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nfavor of amendment 1107. First, let me say that I know how hard \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain have worked to craft a Defense \nAuthorization Act to provide our Armed Forces with the equipment, \nservices, and support they need to keep us safe. I also thank my \ncolleagues from the Armed Services Committee, a number of whom I see on \nthe floor this morning, for their diligence and dedication to this \nimportant work.\n  With that, let me turn to the amendment itself. I want to start by \nthanking the cosponsors of the amendment. They include the chairwoman \nof the Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein; the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy; and Senator Webb, a former \nSecretary of the Navy, someone whom I think we all respect when it \ncomes to national security issues.\n  I also point out that this amendment is bipartisan. Senator Rand Paul \njoined as a cosponsor this morning and gave a very compelling floor \nspeech a few minutes ago. Senators Wyden and Durbin have also recently \ncosponsored it. I recognize their leadership as well.\n  Let me turn to the amendment itself. A growing number of our \ncolleagues have strong concerns about the detainee provisions in this \nbill. At the heart of our concern is the concern that we have not taken \nenough time to listen to our counterterrorism community and have not \nheeded the warnings of the Secretary of Defense, Director of National \nIntelligence, and the Director of the FBI, who all oppose these \nprovisions. Equally concerning, we have not had a single hearing on the \ndetainee matters to fully understand the implications of our actions.\n  My amendment would take out these provisions and give us in the \nCongress an opportunity to take a hard look at the needs of our \ncounterterrorism professionals and respond in a measured way that \nreflects the input of those who are actually fighting our \nenemies. Specifically, the amendment would require that our Defense \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies report to Congress with \nrecommendations for any additional authorities or flexibility they need \nin order to detain and prosecute terrorists. My amendment would then \nask for hearings to be held so we can fully understand the views of \nrelevant national security experts.\n\n  In other words, I am saying let's ask our dedicated men and women who \nare actually fighting to protect Americans what they actually need to \nkeep us safe. This is a marked departure, in my opinion, from the \ncurrent language in the bill, which was developed without hearings, and \nseeks to make changes to the law that our national security \nprofessionals do not want and even oppose, as I pointed out.\n  Like other challenging issues we face here in the Senate, we should \nidentify the problem, hold hearings, gather input from those affected \nby our actions, and then seek to find the most prudent solution. \nInstead, we have language in the bill, which, while well intended--of \nthat there is no doubt--was developed behind closed doors and is being \nmoved rather quickly through our Congress. The Secretary of Defense is \nwarning us we may be making mistakes that will hurt our capacity to \nfight terrorism at home and abroad. The Director of National \nIntelligence is telling us this language will create more problems than \nit solves. The Director of the FBI is telling Congress these provisions \nwill erect hurdles that will make it more difficult for our law \nenforcement officials to collaborate in their effort to protect \nAmerican citizens. And the President's national security staff is \nrecommending a veto of the entire Defense authorization bill if these \nprovisions remain in the bill.\n  With this full spectrum of highly respected officials and top \ncounterterrorism professionals warning Congress not to pass these \nprovisions, we are being asked to reject their advice and pass them \nanyway--again, without any hearings or further deliberation. I don't \nknow what others think, but I don't think this is what the people of \nColorado expect us to do, and it is not how I envision the Senate \noperating.\n  The provisions would dramatically change broad counterterrorism \nefforts by requiring law enforcement officials to step aside and ask \nthe Department of Defense to take on a new role they are not fully \nequipped for and do not want. And by taking away the flexible \ndecisionmaking capacity of our national security team, by forcing the \nmilitary to now act as police, judge, and jailer, these provisions \ncould effectively rebuild walls between our military law enforcement \nand intelligence communities that we have spent a decade tearing down.\n  The provisions that are in the bill--to me and many others--appear to \nrequire the DOD to shift significant resources away from their mission \nto serve on all fronts all over the world. This has real consequences, \nbecause we have limited resources and limited manpower. Again, I want \nto say that I don't think we would lose anything by taking a little \nmore time to discuss and debate these provisions, but we could do real \nharm to our national security efforts by allowing this language to \npass, and that is exactly what our highest ranking national security \nofficers are warning us against doing.\n  You will note I am speaking in the broadest terms here, but I did \nwant to speak to one particular area of concern, to give viewers and my \ncolleagues a sense of what we face.\n  The provisions authorize the indefinite military detention of \nAmerican citizens who are suspected of involvement in terrorism--even \nthose captured here in our own country, in the United States--which I \nthink should concern each and every one of us. These provisions could \nwell represent an unprecedented threat to our constitutional liberties. \nLet me explain why I think that is the case.\n  Look, I agree if an American citizen joins al-Qaida and takes up arms \nagainst the United States that person should be subject to the same \nprocess as any other enemy combatant. But what is not clear is what we \ndo with someone arrested in his home because of suspected terrorist \nties. These detainee provisions would authorize that person's \nindefinite detention, but it misses a critical point. How do we know a \ncitizen has committed these crimes unless they are tried and convicted? \nDo we want to open the door to domestic military police powers and \npossibly deny U.S. citizens their due process rights? If we do, I think \nthat is at least something that is worthy of a hearing, and the \nAmerican people should be made aware of the changes that will be \nforthcoming in the way we approach civil liberties. But since our \ncounterterrorism officials are telling us these provisions are a \nmistake, I am not willing to both potentially limit our fight against \nterrorism and simultaneously threaten the constitutional freedoms \nAmericans hold dear.\n  As I begin my remarks, I hope I have projected my belief we have a \nsolemn obligation to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, but \nwe also have a solemn obligation to make sure those who are fighting \nthe war on terror have the best, most flexible, most powerful tools \npossible. To be perfectly frank, I am worried these provisions will \ndisrupt our ability to combat terrorism and inject untested legal \nambiguity into our military's operations and detention practices.\n  We will hear some of our colleagues tell us not to worry because the \ndetainee provisions are designed not to hurt our counterterrorism \nefforts. We all know the best laid plans can have unintended \nconsequences. While I am sure the drafters of this language intended \nthe provisions to be interpreted in a way that does not cause problems, \nthe counterterrorism community disagrees and has outlined some very \nserious real world concerns. Stating in the language there will not be \nany adverse effects on national security doesn't make it so. These are \nnot just words in a proposed law. And those who will be chartered to \nactually carry out these provisions are urging us to reject them. \nShouldn't we listen to their serious concerns? Shouldn't we think twice \nabout passing these provisions?\n  I have not received a single phone call from a counterterrorism \nexpert, a professional in the field, or a senior military official \nurging us to pass these provisions. We have heard a wide range of \nconcerns expressed about the unintended consequences of enacting these \ndetainee provisions but not a single voice outside of Congress telling \nus this will help us protect Americans or make us safer.\n  In addition to our national security team, which is urging us to \noppose these provisions, other important voices are also asking us to \nstop, to slow down, and to consider them more\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\nthoroughly. The American Bar Association, the ACLU, the International \nRed Cross, the American Legion, and a number of other groups have also \nexpressed a wide range of serious concerns.\n  Again, I want to underline, although the language was crafted with \nthe best of intentions, there are simply too many questions about the \nunintended consequences of these provisions to allow them to move \nforward without further input from national security experts through \nholding hearings and engaging in further debate.\n  I am privileged to be a member of the Armed Services Committee. I am \ntruly honored. As I have implied, and I want to be explicit, I \nunderstand the importance of this bill. I understand what it does for \nour military, which is why, in sum, what I am going to propose with my \namendment is that we pass the NDAA without these troubling provisions \nbut with a mechanism by which we can consider in depth what is proposed \nand, at a later date, include any applicable changes in the law. It is \nnot only the right thing to do policywise, it may very well protect \nthis bill from a veto. The clearest path toward giving our men and \nwomen in uniform the tools they need is to pass this amendment and then \nsend a clean National Defense Authorization Act to the President.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy, the President says the \nfollowing--and I should again mention in the Statement of \nAdministration Policy there is a recommendation the President veto the \nbill.\n\n       We have spent 10 years since September 11, 2001, breaking \n     down the walls between intelligence, military and law \n     enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild \n     those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing \n     terrorist attacks more difficult.\n\n  These are striking words. They should give us all pause as we face \nwhat seems to be a bit of a rush to pass these untested and legally \ncontroversial restrictions on our ability to prosecute terrorists.\n\n  I want to begin to close, and in so doing I urge my colleagues to \nthink about the precedent we would set by passing these provisions. We \nare being told these detainee provisions are so important we must pass \nthem right away, without a hearing or further deliberation. However, \nthe Secretary of Defense, at the same time, along with the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the Director of the FBI, are all urging us to \nreject the provisions and take a closer look. Do we want to neglect the \nadvice of our trusted national security professionals? I can't think of \nanother instance where we would rebuff those who are chartered with \nkeeping us safe.\n  If we in the Congress want to constrain the military and give our \nservicemembers new responsibilities, as these provisions would do, I \nbelieve we should listen to what the Secretary of Defense has had to \nsay about it. Secretary Panetta is strongly opposed to these changes, \nand I think we all know before he held the job he has now, Secretary of \nDefense Panetta was the Director of the CIA. He knows very well the \nthreats facing our country, and he knows we cannot afford to make any \nmistakes when it comes to keeping our citizens safe. We have to be \nright every time. The bad guys only have to be right once.\n  This is a debate we need to have. It is a healthy debate. But we \nought to be armed with all the facts and expertise before we move \nforward. The least we can do is take our time, be diligent, and hear \nfrom those who will be affected by these new and significant changes in \nhow we interrogate and prosecute terrorists. As I have said before, it \nconcerns me we would tell our national security leadership--a \nbipartisan national security leadership, by the way--that we will not \nlisten to them and that Congress knows better than they do. It doesn't \nstrike me that is the best way to secure and protect the American \npeople.\n  That is why I filed amendment No. 1107. I think my amendment is a \ncommonsense alternative that will protect our constitutional principles \nand beliefs while continuing to keep our Nation safe. The amendment has \na clear aim, which is to ensure we follow a thorough process and hear \nall views before rushing forward with new laws that could be harmful to \nour national security. It is straightforward, it is common sense, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your attention, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have approximately a half hour on each \nside. I am wondering how much time Senator Graham needs?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Ten minutes. Is that too much? Five minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could you do 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Seven?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have, I think, seven speakers on this side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try to be quick.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can you try to do 8 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try to do it as quickly as I can.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. We have had a long time from the sponsor of the \namendment, the chief proponent; we are going to have 10 minutes from \nthe Senator of Illinois. So I yield to the Senator from South Carolina \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Arizona will control, if this is all \nright with the Senator, half of our time. Will that be all right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Chair will let me know when 5 minutes has passed, \nbecause there are a lot of voices to be heard on this issue, and I want \nthem to be heard. I am just one.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me start with my good friend from Colorado. I respect \nthe Senator; I know his concerns. I don't agree.\n  I can remember being told by the Bush administration: We don't need \nthe Detainee Treatment Act. Everybody said we didn't need it, but they \nwere wrong. I remember being told by the Vice President's office during \nthe Bush administration: It is OK to take classified evidence, show it \nto the jury, the finder of fact, and not share it with the accused, but \nyou can share it with his lawyer.\n  How would you like an American soldier tried in a foreign land, where \nthey are sitting there in the chair wondering what the jury is talking \nabout and can't even comment to their own lawyer about the allegations \nagainst them?\n  I have been down this road with administrations and we worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to change some things the Bush administration wanted \nto do and I am glad we did it. We are working in a bipartisan fashion \nto change some things this administration is doing, and I hope we are \nsuccessful, because if we fail, we are all going to be worse for it.\n  Here are the facts: Under this provision of mandatory military \ncustody, for someone captured in the United States, if they are an \nAmerican citizen, that provision does not apply to them. But here is \nthe law of the land right now: If they are an American citizen \nsuspected of joining al-Qaida, being a member of al-Qaida, they can be \nheld as an enemy combatant.\n  The Padilla case in South Carolina, where the man was held 5 years as \nan enemy combatant, went to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nhere is what that court said: You can interrogate that person in an \nintelligence-gathering situation. The only thing you have to do is \nprovide them a lawyer for their habeas appeal review.\n  So here are the due process rights: If our intelligence community or \nmilitary believe an American citizen is suspected of being a member of \nal-Qaida, the law of the land the way it is today, an American citizen \ncan be held as an enemy combatant and questioned about what role they \nplay in helping al-Qaida, and they do get due process. Everybody held \nas an enemy here, at Guantanamo Bay, captured in the United States, \ngoes before the Federal judge, and the government has to prove, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that the person is, in fact, an enemy \ncombatant. There is due process. We don't hold someone and say: Good \nluck. They have to go before a judge--a Federal court--and prove their \ncase as the government.\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\n  Here is the question for the country. Is it OK to hold, under \nmilitary control, an American citizen who is suspected of helping al-\nQaida? You had better believe it is OK.\n  My good friend from Colorado said this repeals the Posse Comitatus \nAct. The Posse Comitatus Act is a prohibition on our military being \nused for law enforcement functions, and it goes back to reconstruction.\n  This is the central difference between us. I don't believe fighting \nal-Qaida is a law enforcement function. I believe our military should \nbe deeply involved in fighting these guys at home and abroad. The idea \nof somehow allowing our military to hold someone captured in the United \nStates is a repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act, you would have to \nconclude that you view that as a law enforcement function, where the \nmilitary has no reason or right to be there. That is the big difference \nbetween us. I don't want to criminalize the war.\n  To Senator Levin, thank you for helping us this time around craft a \nbipartisan solution to a very real problem. The enemy is all over the \nworld and here at home. When people take up arms against the United \nStates and are captured within the United States, why should we not be \nable to use our military and intelligence community to question that \nperson as to what they know about enemy activity? The only way we can \ndo that is hold them in military custody, and this provision can be \nwaived. It doesn't apply to American citizens. But the idea that an \nAmerican citizen helping al-Qaida doesn't get due process is a lie. \nThey go before a Federal court and the government has to prove they are \npart of al-Qaida.\n  Let me ask this to my colleagues on the other side. What if the judge \nagrees with the military or the intelligence community making the case? \nAre you going to require us to shut down the intelligence-gathering \nprocess, read them their rights, and put them in Federal court? That is \nexactly what you want, and that will destroy our ability to make us \nsafe. If an American citizen is held by the intelligence community or \nthe military and a Federal judge agrees they were, in fact, a part of \nthe enemy force, that American citizen should be interrogated to find \nout what they know about the enemy, in a lawful way, and you should not \nrequire this country to criminalize what is an act of war against the \npeople of the United States. They should not be read their Miranda \nrights. They should not be given a lawyer. They should be held humanely \nin military custody and interrogated about why they joined al-Qaida and \nwhat they were going to do to all of us. So this provision not only is \nnecessary to deal with real-world events; it is written in the most \nflexible way possible.\n  To this administration, the reason we are on the floor today is it \nwas your idea to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and put him in New York \nCity and give him the rights of an American citizen and criminalize the \nwar by taking the mastermind of 9/11 and making it a crime and not an \nact of war.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has spoken for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. I will wrap up.\n  To Senator Levin and Senator McCain, what they are accusing the \nSenators of doing is not true. They are codifying a process that will \nallow us to intelligently and rationally deal with people who are part \nof al-Qaida, not political dissidents.\n  If someone doesn't like President Obama, we are not going to arrest \nthem. I am getting phone calls about that. That is a bunch of garbage. \nA person can say anything they want about the President or me, they \njust can't join al-Qaida and expect to be treated as if it were a \ncommon crime. When someone joins al-Qaida, they haven't joined the \nMafia. They are not joining a gang. They are joining people who are \nbent on our destruction, and they are a military threat. If you don't \nbelieve they are a military threat, vote for Senator Udall. If you \nbelieve al-Qaida represents a threat to us at home and abroad, give our \nintelligence and military agencies statutory guidance and authority to \ndo things that need to be clear rather than uncertain.\n  We are 10 years into this war. Congress needs to speak. This is your \nchance to speak. I am speaking today. Here is what I am saying to my \ncolleagues on the other side and to the world at large: If you join al-\nQaida, you suffer the consequences of being killed or captured. If you \nare an American citizen and you betray your country, you are going to \nbe held in military custody and you are going to be questioned about \nwhat you know. You are not going to be given a lawyer if our national \nsecurity interests dictate that you not be given a lawyer and go into \nthe criminal justice system because we are not fighting a crime, we are \nfighting a war.\n  There is more due process in this bill than at any other time in any \nother war. I am proud of the work product. There are checks and \nbalances in this bill that we have been working on for 10 years. The \nmandatory provisions do not apply to American citizens. They can be \nwaived if they impede in an investigation. We are trying to provide \ntools and clarity that have been missing for 10 years. This is your \nchance to speak on the central issue 10 years after the attacks of 9/\n11. Are we at war or are we fighting a crime? I believe we are at war, \nand the due process rights associated with war are in abundance and \nbeyond anything ever known in any other war.\n  What this amendment does is it destroys the central concept that we \nare trying to present to the body and to the country; that we are \nfacing an enemy--and not a common criminal organization--that will do \nanything and everything possible to destroy our way of life. Let's give \nour law enforcement and military community the clarity they have been \nseeking and I think now they will have.\n\n  To the administration, with all due respect, you have engaged in one \nepisode after another to run away from the fact that we are fighting a \nwar and not a crime. When the Bush administration tried to pass \npolicies that undercut our ability to fight this war and maintain our \nvalues, I pushed back. I am not asking any more of the people on the \nother side than I ask of myself. When the Bush administration asked me, \nand others, to do things that I thought undercut our values, I said no. \nNow we have an opportunity to tell this administration we respect their \ninput, but what we are trying to do needs to be done, not for just this \ntime but for the future.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, either we are going to fight this war to win it \nand to keep us safe or we are going to lose the concept that there is a \ndifference between taking up arms against the United States and being a \ncommon criminal.\n  In conclusion, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and all those who buy into what \nhe is selling present a threat to us far different than any common \ncriminal, and our laws should reflect that.\n  Senators Levin and McCain have created a legal system for the first \ntime in 10 years that recognizes we are fighting a war within our \nvalues. I hope we get a strong bipartisan vote for the tools in this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, how much time do we have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Before I recognize Senator Durbin for 8 \nminutes, I just wish to respond to my friend, the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The Senator from South Carolina is broadly \nadmired in the Senate. If I am ever in court, I want him to be my \nlawyer.\n  I would point out, however, that what I am proposing wouldn't destroy \nthe system we have in place--a system, by the way, that has resulted in \nthe convictions of numerous terrorists with life sentences. What I am \nasking is to listen to those who are on the frontlines who are fighting \nagainst terrorists and terrorism who have said they have concerns about \nthis new proposal and would like a greater amount of time to vet it and \nconsider it.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for Senator \nCarl Levin and Senator John McCain. They have done an extraordinary job \non the Defense authorization bill. I would say, by and large, this bill \nwould not have engendered the controversy that brings us to the floor \ntoday but for this provision, because it is a critically important \nprovision which has drawn the attention not just of those in the \nmilitary community--which they, of course, would expect in a Defense \nauthorization bill--but also the attention of those in the intelligence \ncommunity and the law enforcement community across the United States, \nas well as the President of the United States.\n  The provision which they include in this bill is a substantial and \ndramatic departure in American law when it comes to fighting terrorism. \nI salute Senator Udall for bringing it to the attention of the \ncommittee and now to the floor; that before we take this step forward, \nwe should reflect and pass the Udall amendment which calls for the \nnecessary agencies of government--law enforcement, intelligence, and \nmilitary--to reflect on the impact of this decision, not just on the \nimpact of America's security but on America's commitment to \nconstitutional principles. This is a fundamental issue which is being \nraised, and it should be considered ever so seriously. We need to ask \nourselves, 10 years after 9/11, why are we prepared to engage in a \nrewrite of the laws on fighting terrorism?\n  Thank God we meet in this Chamber today with no repeat of 9/11. \nThrough President George Bush and President Barack Obama, America has \nbeen safe. Yes, there are people who threaten us, and they always will, \nbut we have risen to that challenge with the best military in the \nworld, with effective law enforcement, and without giving away our \nbasic values and principles as Americans.\n  Take a look at the provision in this bill which Senator Udall is \naddressing. Who opposes this provision? I will tell you who opposes it. \nSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who passed out of this Chamber with \na 100-to-0 vote of confidence in his leadership, has told us don't do \nthis; this is a mistake in this provision.\n  Secondly, the law enforcement community, from Attorney General Eric \nHolder to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has told \nus it is a mistake to pass this measure, to limit our ability to fight \nterrorism. And the intelligence community as well; the Director of \nNational Intelligence tells us this is a mistake.\n  Is it any wonder Senator Udall comes to the floor and others join him \nfrom both sides of the aisle saying, before we make this serious change \nin policy in America, ask ourselves: Have we considered the impact this \nwill have on our Nation's security, our ability to interrogate \nwitnesses, and our commitment to constitutional principles?\n  When I take a look at the letter that was sent to us by the Director \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, I have to \nreflect on the fact that Director Mueller was appointed by President \nGeorge W. Bush and reappointed by President Barack Obama. I respect him \nvery much. He has warned this Senate: Do not pass this provision in the \nDefense authorization bill. It may adversely impact ``our ability to \ncontinue ongoing international terrorism investigation.''\n  If this provision had been offered by a Democrat under Republican \nGeorge W. Bush, the critics would have come to the floor and said: How \ncould you possibly tie the hands of the President when he is trying to \nkeep America safe?\n  The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has made it clear \nthe passage of this provision in this bill will limit the flexibility \nof the administration to combat terrorism. It will create uncertainty \nfor law enforcement, intelligence, and defense officials regarding how \nthey handle suspected terrorists and raise serious constitutional \nconcerns. Listen, all those things are worthy of debate were it not for \nthe record that for 10 years America has been safe. It has been safe \nbecause of a Republican President and a Democratic President using the \nforces at hand to keep us safe. If we were coming here with some record \nof failure when it comes to keeping America safe, it is one thing, but \nwe have a record of positive success. This notion that there is no way \nto keep America safe without military tribunals and commissions defies \nlogic and defies experience.\n  Since 9/11, over 300 suspected terrorists have been successfully \nprosecuted in article III criminal courts in America. Yes, they have \nbeen read the Miranda rights, and, yes, they have been prosecuted and \nsent to prison, the most recent being the Underwear Bomber, who pled \nguilty just weeks ago in the article III criminal courts. During this \nsame period of time, when it comes to military commissions and \ntribunals, how many alleged terrorists have been convicted? Six. The \nscore, my friends, if you are paying attention, is 300 to 6. President \nBush and President Obama used our article III criminal courts \neffectively to keep America safe, and in those instances where they \nfelt military tribunals could do it best, they turned to them with some \nsuccess.\n\n  I might add, to those who want to just change the law again when it \ncomes to military tribunals, this is the third try. Twice we have tried \nto write the language on military tribunals and commissions. It has \nbeen sent ultimately across the street to the Supreme Court and \nrejected. They told us to start over. Do we want to risk that again? Do \nwe want to jeopardize the prosecution of an alleged terrorist because \nwe want to test out a new legal and constitutional theory? I hope not.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Director of the FBI.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express concerns \n     regarding the impact of certain aspects of the current \n     version of Section 1032 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Because the proposed legislation \n     applies to certain persons detained in the United States, the \n     legislation may adversely impact our ability to continue \n     ongoing international terrorism investigations before or \n     after arrest, derive intelligence from those investigations, \n     and may raise extraneous issues in any future prosecution of \n     a person covered by Section 1032.\n       The legislation as currently proposed raises two principal \n     concerns. First, by establishing a presumption of military \n     detention for covered individuals within the United States, \n     the legislation introduces a substantial element of \n     uncertainty as to what procedures are to be followed in the \n     course of a terrorism investigation in the United States. \n     Even before the decision to arrest is made, the question of \n     whether a Secretary of Defense waiver is necessary for the \n     investigation to proceed will inject uncertainty as to the \n     appropriate course for further investigation up to and beyond \n     the moment when the determination is made that there is \n     probable cause for an arrest.\n       Section 1032 may be read to divest the FBI and other \n     domestic law enforcement agencies of jurisdiction to continue \n     to investigate those persons who are known to fall within the \n     mandatory strictures of section 1032, absent the Secretary's \n     waiver. The legislation may call into question the FBI's \n     continued use or scope of its criminal investigative or \n     national security authorities in further investigation of the \n     subject. The legislation may restrict the FBI from using the \n     grand jury to gather records relating to the covered person's \n     communication or financial records, or to subpoena witnesses \n     having information on the matter. Absent a statutory basis \n     for further domestic investigation, Section 1032 may be \n     interpreted by the courts as foreclosing the FBI from \n     conducting any further investigation of the covered \n     individual or his associates.\n       Second, the legislation as currently drafted will inhibit \n     our ability to convince covered arrestees to cooperate \n     immediately, and provide critical intelligence. The \n     legislation introduces a substantial element of uncertainty \n     as to what procedures are to be followed at perhaps the most \n     critical time in the development of an investigation against \n     a covered person. Over the past decade we have had numerous \n     arrestees, several of whom would arguably have been covered \n     by the statute, who have provided important intelligence \n     immediately after they have been arrested, and in some \n     instances for days and weeks thereafter. In the context of \n     the arrest, they have been persuaded that it was in their \n     best interests to provide essential information while the \n     information was current and useful to the arresting \n     authorities.\n       Nonetheless, at this crucial juncture, in order for the \n     arresting agents to proceed to obtain the desired \n     cooperation, the statute requires that a waiver be obtained \n     from the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     with certification by the Secretary to Congress that the \n     waiver was in the national security interests of the United \n     States. The proposed statute acknowledges that this is a \n     significant point in\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\n     an ongoing investigation. It provides that surveillance and \n     intelligence gathering on the arrestee's associates should \n     not be interrupted. Likewise, the statute provides that an \n     ongoing interrogation session should not be interrupted.\n       These limited exceptions, however, fail to recognize the \n     reality of a counterterrorism investigation. Building rapport \n     with, and convincing a covered individual to cooperate once \n     arrested, is a delicate and time sensitive skill that \n     transcends any one interrogation session. It requires \n     coordination with other aspects of the investigation. \n     Coordination with the prosecutor's office is also often an \n     essential component of obtaining a defendant's cooperation. \n     To halt this process while the Secretary of Defense \n     undertakes the mandated consultation, and the required. \n     certification is drafted and provided to Congress, would set \n     back our efforts to develop intelligence from the subject.\n       We appreciate that Congress has sought to address our \n     concerns in the latest version of the bill, but believe that \n     the legislation as currently drafted remains problematic for \n     the reasons set forth above. We respectfully ask that you \n     take into account these concerns as Congress continues to \n     consider Section 1032.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert S. Mueller III,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me also say that section 1031 of this bill is one \nthat definitely needs to be changed, if not eliminated. It will, for \nthe first time in the history of the United States of America, \nauthorize the indefinite detention of American citizens in the United \nStates. I have spoken to the chairman of the committee, who said he is \nopen to language that would try to protect us from that outcome. But \nthe language as written in the bill, unfortunately, will allow for the \nindefinite detention of American citizens for the first time. The \nadministration takes this seriously. We should too. They have said they \nwill veto the bill without changes in this particular provision.\n  I hope we will step back and look at a record of success in keeping \nAmerica safe and not try to reinvent our Constitution on the floor of \nthe Senate. I believe we ought to give to every President, Democratic \nand Republican, all of the tools and all of the weapons they need to \nkeep America safe. Tying their hands may give us some satisfaction on \nthe floor of the Senate for a moment, but it won't keep America safe.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There have been so many misstatements and facts that have \nbeen made, it is hard to keep up with them. Let me just take the last \nstatement the Senator from Illinois made about changing military \ntribunal law. There is no change in military tribunal law whatsoever \nmade in this bill. I am going to address the other misstatements that \nhave been made by my friends and colleagues, but that was the most \nrecent, so I just want to take on that one first.\n  In terms of constitutional provisions, the ultimate authority on the \nConstitution of the United States is the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. Here is what they have said in the Hamdi case about the issue \nboth of our friends have raised about American citizens being subject \nto the law of war.\n  A citizen--the Supreme Court said this in 2004--no less than an alien \ncan be part of supporting forces hostile to the United States and \nengaged in armed conflict against the United States. Such a citizen--\nreferring to an American citizen--if released, would pose the same \nthreat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict. And here \nis the bottom line for the Supreme Court. If we just take this one line \nout of this whole debate, it would be a breath of fresh air to cut \nthrough some of the words that have been used here this morning--one \nline. ``There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \ncitizens as an enemy combatant.'' That is not me, that is not Senator \nGraham, and that is not Senator McCain. That is the Supreme Court of \nthe United States recently. ``There is no bar to this Nation's holding \none of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.''\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would rather not at this point.\n  There are a number of sections in this bill. My dear friend Senator \nUdall says ``these sections'' as though there are a whole bunch of \nsections that are at issue. There is really only one section that is at \nissue here, and that is section 1032, and that is the so-called \nmandatory detention section which has a waiver in it.\n  Section 1031 was written and approved by the administration. Section \n1031, which my friend from Illinois has just said is an abomination, \nwas written and approved by the administration. Now, section 1031 is \nthe authority section. This authorizes. It doesn't mandate anything \nwith the waiver; section 1032 does. Section 1031--and now I am going to \nuse the words in the administration's own so-called SAP, or Statement \nof Administration Policy. This is what the administration says about \nsection 1031: The authorities codified in this section already exist. \nSo they don't think it is necessary--1031--but they don't object to it. \nThose are their words--the authorities in 1031 already exist. They do. \nWhat this does is incorporate already existing authorities from section \n1031--unnecessary in the view of the administration, yes, but they \nhelped write it and they approved it. We made changes in it.\n  We have made so many changes in this language to satisfy the \nadministration, I think it all comes down to one section: 1032. Section \n1032 is the issue, not all of the sections, by the way, that would be \nstricken by the Udall amendment. The Udall amendment would strike all \nthe sections, but it really comes down to section 1032.\n  In 1032 is the so-called mandatory provision, which, by the way, does \nnot apply to American citizens. I better say that again. Senator Graham \nsaid it, but let me say it again. The most controversial provision--\nprobably the only one in this bill--is section 1032. Section 1032 says: \nThe requirement to detain a person in military custody under this \nsection does not extend to the citizens of the United States. I guess \nthat is the second thing I would like for colleagues to take away from \nwhat I say, is that section--and Senator Graham said the same thing. \nSection 1032--the mandatory section that has the waiver in it--does \nnot, by its own words, apply to citizens of the United States. It has a \nwaiver provision in it to make this flexible.\n  The way in which 1032 operates is it says that if it is determined \nthat a person is a member of al-Qaida, then that person will be held in \nmilitary detention. They are at war with us, folks. Al-Qaida is at war \nwith us. They brought that war to our shores. This is not just a \nforeign war. They brought that war to our shores on 9/11. They are at \nwar with us. The Supreme Court said--and I will read these words \nagain--that there is no bar to this Nation holding one of its own \ncitizens as an enemy combatant. They brought this war to us, and if it \nis determined that even an American citizen is a member of al-Qaida, \nthen you can apply the law of war, according to the Supreme Court. That \nis not according to the Armed Services Committee, our bill, or any one \nof us; that is the Supreme Court speaking.\n  Who determines it? We say, to give the administration the flexibility \nthat they want, the administration makes that determination. The \nprocedures to make that determination--who writes those procedures? We \ndon't write them. Explicitly, the executive branch writes those \nprocedures. Can those procedures interfere with an ongoing \ninterrogation or investigation? No. By our own language, it says they \nshall not interfere with interrogation or intelligence gathering. That \nis all in here. The only way this could interfere with an operation of \nthe executive branch is if they themselves decided to interfere in \ntheir own operation. They are explicitly given the authority to write \nthe procedures.\n  I think we ought to debate about what is in the bill, and what is in \nthe bill is very different from what our colleagues who support the \nUdall amendment have described. Yes, we are at war, and, yes, we should \ncodify how we handle detention, and this is an effort to do that. And \nas the administration itself says, we are not changing anything here in \nterms of section 1031. We are simply codifying existing law.\n  The issue really relates to 1032, and that is what we ought to \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nShould somebody--when it has been determined by procedures adopted by \nthe executive branch--who has been determined to be a member of an \nenemy force who has come to this Nation or is in this Nation to attack \nus as a member of a foreign enemy, should that person be treated \naccording to the laws of war? The answer is yes. But should flexibility \nbe in here so the administration can provide a waiver even in that \ncase? Yes.\n  Finally, as far as civilian trials, I happen to agree with my friend \nfrom Illinois, and he is a dear friend of mine. Civilian trials work. \nThere is nothing in this provision that says civilian trials won't be \nused even if it is determined that somebody is a member of al-Qaida. \nNot only doesn't it prevent civilian trials from being used, we \nexplicitly provide that civilian trials are available in all cases. It \nis written right in here. I happen to like civilian trials a lot. I \nparticipated in a lot of them, and they are very appropriate, and we \nhave a good record. In the case the Senator from Illinois mentioned, \nthat case was a Michigan case. I know a lot about that case. It was the \nright way to go. I prefer civilian trials in many, many cases. This \nbill does not say we are going to be using military commissions in lieu \nof civilian trials. That is a decision we leave where it belongs--in \nthe executive branch.\n  But we do one thing in this bill in section 1031 that needs to be \nsaid. We are at war with al-Qaida, and people determined to be part of \nal-Qaida should be treated as people who are at war with us. But even \nwith that statement, we give the administration a waiver. That is how \nmuch flexibility we give to the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has just over 5 \nminutes. The Senator from Colorado has 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I want to clarify for the \nrecord before I recognize Senator Webb for 5 minutes that some here \nhave claimed that the Supreme Court's Hamdi decision upheld the \nindefinite detention of U.S. citizens captured in the United States.\n  It did no such thing. Hamdi was captured in Afghanistan, not the \nUnited States. Justice O'Connor, the author of the opinion, was very \ncareful to say that the Hamdi decision was limited to ``individuals who \nfought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the \nTaliban.'' I think that is important to be included in the Record.\n  I yield to Senator Webb for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to say that I believe the \nSenator from Colorado has a good point. I say that as someone who is a \nstrong supporter of military commissions, who in many cases has aligned \nhimself with my good friend the Senator from South Carolina and Senator \nMcCain as well on these issues. To me, this is not a jurisdictional \nissue, and it is not an issue about whether we should be holding people \nunder military commissions under the right cases or under military \ndetention under the right cases.\n  My difficulty and the reason I support what Senator Udall is doing is \nin the statutory language itself. I say this as someone who spent a \nnumber of years drafting this kind of legislation as a committee \ncounsel. I have gone back over the last 2 days again and again, reading \nthese sections against each other--1031 and 1032 particularly--and I am \nvery concerned about how this language would be interpreted, not in the \nhere and now, as we see the stability we have brought to our country \nsince 9/11, but what if something were to happen and we would be under \nmore of a sense of national emergency and this language would be \ninterpreted for broader action.\n\n  The reason I have this concern is we are talking here about the \nconditions under which our military would be sent into action inside \nour own borders. In that type of situation, we need to be very clear \nand we must very narrowly define how they would be used and, quite \nfrankly, if they should be used at all inside our borders. I think that \nis the concern we are hearing from people such as the Director of the \nFBI and the Secretary of Defense.\n  I am also very concerned about the notion of the protection of our \nown citizens and our legal residents from military action inside our \nown country. I think these protections should be very clearly stated. \nThere is a lot of vagueness in this language.\n  What the Senator from Colorado is proposing is that we clarify these \nconcepts--that we take this provision out and clarify the concepts. \nProtections are in place in our country. We are not leaving our country \nvulnerable. In fact, I think we are going to make it a much more \nhealthy legal system if we do clarify these provisions.\n  That is the reason I am here on the floor to support what Senator \nUdall is saying. I know the emotion and the energy Senator Levin has \nput into this, and I respect him greatly. I happen to believe we need \nto do a better job of clarifying our language.\n  I spent 16 years, on and off, writing in Hollywood. One of the things \nthat came to me when I was comparing these sections is that this is \nkind of the danger we get in when we get to the fourth or the fifth \nscreenwriter involved in a story. We want to fix one thing and we are \nnot fixing the whole thing.\n  I greatly respect the legitimacy of the effort that is put into this. \nBut when we read section 1031 against section 1032, there are questions \nabout what would happen to American citizens under an emergency. Let's \ntake, for instance, what happened in this country after Hurricane \nKatrina. It is not a direct parallel, but we can see the extremes \npeople went to under a feeling of emergency and vulnerability. We had \npeople who were deputized as U.S. marshals in New Orleans, and we could \nsee them on CNN putting rifles inside people's cars, stopping them on \nthe street, going into people's houses, making a decision--which later \nwas rescinded--that they were going to take people's guns away from \nthem. The vagueness in a lot of this language will not guarantee \nagainst these types of conduct on a larger scale if a situation were \nmore difficult and dangerous than it is today.\n  Section 1031, which Senator Levin mentioned, may be clear to the \nadministration but it is not that clear to me, when they talk about a \ncovered person. This isn't simply al-Qaida, depending on how one wants \nto interpret it, in a time of national emergency. It is a person who is \na part of or who substantially supported al-Qaida, the Taliban, or \nassociated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United \nStates or its coalition partners, including any person who has \ncommitted a belligerent act. We might be able to agree to what that \nmeans here on the Senate floor today, but we don't know how that might \nbe interpreted in a time of national emergency. I am not predicting \nthat it will; I am saying we should have the certainty that it will \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WEBB. OK. Similar concerns also revolve around the definitions in \nterms of the applicability of U.S. citizens and lawful resident aliens \nwhen we go to the words ``requirement does not extend.'' What about an \noption? These are the types of concerns I have. We should have language \nthat very clearly makes everyone understand the conditions under which \nwe would be using the U.S. military inside the borders of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Udall-Webb-Leahy-Feinstein-Durbin-Paul-\nWyden amendment would remove the very troubling detention subtitle from \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. I am a \ncosponsor of this amendment because I believe the detention subtitle is \ndeeply flawed. We should hear from the Pentagon and other agencies \nabout what they believe to be the appropriate role of the Armed Forces \nin detaining and prosecuting terrorism suspects. Unfortunately, the \nlanguage in the bill before us blatantly disregards the concerns of \nthese agencies.\n  Contrary to statements by the bill's authors, the current version of \nthe detention subtitle, considered by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, SASC\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\non November 15, contains virtually all of the same concerns as the \nearlier version of the bill. The changes made by SASC do not correct \nthe problems that have been raised by the administration.\n  Since the SASC marked up the new version, we have received several \nletters from the administration in opposition to the new language. \nSecretary Panetta, Director of National Intelligence Clapper, and FBI \nDirector Mueller, have all written to Senate leaders in opposition of \nthe language. That means this language is opposed by each of the \nagencies whose officers in the field will be directly affected by it.\n  Just yesterday, Director Mueller wrote that the ``legislation \nintroduces a substantial element of uncertainty'' into terrorism \ninvestigations. Secretary Panetta wrote that the legislation ``may \nneedlessly complicate efforts by frontline law enforcement \nprofessionals to collect critical intelligence.'' Director Clapper \nwrote that ``the various detention provisions . . . would introduce \nunnecessary rigidity'' into investigations. And we have a Statement of \nAdministration Policy raising very strong objections to some of these \nprovisions. I ask unanimous consent to place these letters and the \nStatement of Administration Policy in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 15, 2011.\n     The Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express the Department of \n     Defense's principal concerns with the latest version of \n     detainee-related language you are considering including in \n     the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year \n     2012. We understand the Senate Armed Services Committee is \n     planning to consider this language later today.\n       We greatly appreciate your willingness to listen to the \n     concerns expressed by our national security professionals on \n     the version of the NDAA bill reported by the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee in June. I am convinced we all want the \n     same result--flexibility for our national security \n     professionals in the field to detain, interrogate, and \n     prosecute suspected terrorists. The Department has \n     substantial concerns, however, about the revised text, which \n     my staff has just received within the last few hours.\n       Section 1032. We recognize your efforts to address some of \n     our objections to section 1032. However, it continues to be \n     the case that any advantages to the Department of Defense in \n     particular and our national security in general in section \n     1032 of requiring that certain individuals be held by the \n     military are, at best, unclear. This provision restrains the \n     Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a swift and \n     flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now \n     legally available.\n       Moreover, the failure of the revised text to clarify that \n     section 1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we \n     have urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline \n     law enforcement professionals to collect critical \n     intelligence concerning operations and activities within the \n     United States.\n       Next, the revised language adds a new qualifier to \n     ``associated force''--``that acts in coordination with or \n     pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' In our view, this \n     new language unnecessarily complicates our ability to \n     interpret and implement this section.\n       Further, the new version of section 1032 makes it more \n     apparent that there is an intent to extend the certification \n     requirements of section 1033 to those covered by section 1032 \n     that we may want to transfer to a third country. In other \n     words, the certification requirement that currently applies \n     only to Guantanamo detainees would permanently extend to a \n     whole new category of future captures. This imposes a whole \n     new restraint on the flexibility we need to continue to \n     pursue our counterterrorism efforts.\n       Section 1033. We are troubled that section 1033 remains \n     essentially unchanged from the prior draft, and that none of \n     the Administration's concerns or suggestions for this \n     provision have been adopted. We appreciate that revised \n     section 1033 removes language that would have made these \n     restrictions permanent, and instead extended them through \n     Fiscal Year 2012 only. As a practical matter, however, \n     limiting the duration of the restrictions to the next fiscal \n     year only will have little impact if Congress simply \n     continues to insert these restrictions into legislation on an \n     annual basis without ever revisiting the substance of the \n     legislation. As national security officials in this \n     Department and elsewhere have explained, transfer \n     restrictions such as those outlined in section 1033 are \n     largely unworkable and pose unnecessary obstacles to \n     transfers that would advance our national security interests.\n       Section 1035. Finally, section 1035 shifts to the \n     Department of Defense responsibility for what has previously \n     been a consensus-driven interagency process that was informed \n     by the advice and views of counterterrorism professionals \n     from across the Government. We see no compelling reason--and \n     certainly none has been expressed in our discussions to \n     date--to upset a collaborative, interagency approach that has \n     served our national security so well over the past few years.\n       I hope we can reach agreement on these important national \n     security issues, and, as always, my staff is available to \n     work with the Committee on these and other matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon E. Panetta.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Director of\n\n\n                                        National Intelligence,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: I am writing in response to your \n     letter requesting my views on the effect that the detention \n     provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2012 could have on the ability of the \n     Intelligence Community to gather counterterrorism \n     information. In my view, some of these provisions could limit \n     the effectiveness of our intelligence and law enforcement \n     professionals at a time when we need the utmost flexibility \n     to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The Executive \n     Branch should have maximum flexibility in these areas, \n     consistent with our law and values, rather than face \n     limitations on our options to acquire intelligence \n     information. As stated in the November 17, 2011, Statement of \n     Administration Policy for S. 1867, ``[a]ny bill that \n     challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities \n     to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, \n     and protect the nation would prompt the President's senior \n     advisers to recommend a veto.''\n       Our principal objective upon the capture of a potential \n     terrorist is to obtain intelligence information and to \n     prevent future attacks, yet the provision that mandates \n     military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects \n     could restrict the ability of our nation's intelligence \n     professionals to acquire valuable intelligence and prevent \n     future terrorist attacks. The best method for securing vital \n     intelligence from suspected terrorists varies depending on \n     the facts and circumstances of each case. In the years since \n     September 11, 2001, the Intelligence Community has worked \n     successfully with our military and law enforcement partners \n     to gather vital intelligence in a wide variety of \n     circumstances at home and abroad and I am concerned that some \n     of these provisions will make it more difficult to continue \n     to have these successes in the future.\n       Taken together, the various detention provisions, even with \n     the proposed waivers, would introduce unnecessary rigidity at \n     a time when our intelligence, military, and law enforcement \n     professionals are working more closely than ever to defend \n     our nation effectively and quickly from terrorist attacks. \n     These limitations could deny our nation the ability to \n     respond flexibly and appropriately to unfolding events--\n     including the capture of terrorism suspects--and restrict a \n     process that currently encourages intelligence collection \n     through the preservation of all lawful avenues of detention \n     and interrogation.\n       Our intelligence professionals are best served when they \n     have the greatest flexibility to collect intelligence from \n     suspected terrorists. I am concerned that the detention \n     provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act could \n     reduce this flexibility.\n           Sincerely,\n     James R. Clapper.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express concerns \n     regarding the impact of certain aspects of the current \n     version of Section 1032 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Because the proposed legislation \n     applies to certain persons detained in the United States, the \n     legislation may adversely impact our ability to continue \n     ongoing international terrorism investigations before or \n     after arrest, derive intelligence from those investigations, \n     and may raise extraneous issues in any future prosecution of \n     a person covered by Section 1032.\n       The legislation as currently proposed raises two principal \n     concerns. First, by establishing a presumption of military \n     detention for covered individuals within the United States, \n     the legislation introduces a substantial element of \n     uncertainty as to what procedures are to be followed in the \n     course of a terrorism investigation in the United States. \n     Even before the decision to arrest is made, the question of \n     whether a Secretary of Defense waiver is necessary for the \n     investigation to proceed will inject uncertainty as to the \n     appropriate course for further investigation up to and beyond \n     the moment when the determination is made that there is \n     probable cause for an arrest.\n       Section 1032 may be read to divest the FBI and other \n     domestic law enforcement agencies of jurisdiction to continue \n     to investigate those persons who are known to fall within the \n     mandatory strictures of section 1032, absent the Secretary's \n     waiver. The legislation may call into question the FBI's \n     continued use or scope of its criminal investigative or \n     national security authorities in\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n     further investigation of the subject. The legislation may \n     restrict the FBI from using the grand jury to gather records \n     relating to the covered person's communication or financial \n     records, or to subpoena witnesses having information on the \n     matter. Absent a statutory basis for further domestic \n     investigation, Section 1032 may be interpreted by the courts \n     as foreclosing the FBI from conducting any further \n     investigation of the covered individual or his associates.\n       Second, the legislation as currently drafted will inhibit \n     our ability to convince covered arrestees to cooperate \n     immediately, and provide critical intelligence. The \n     legislation introduces a substantial element of uncertainty \n     as to what procedures are to be followed at perhaps the most \n     critical time in the development of an investigation against \n     a covered person. Over the past decade we have had numerous \n     arrestees, several of whom would arguably have been covered \n     by the statute, who have provided important intelligence \n     immediately after they have been arrested, and in some \n     instances for days and weeks thereafter. In the context of \n     the arrest, they have been persuaded that it was in their \n     best interests to provide essential information while the \n     information was current and useful to the arresting \n     authorities.\n       Nonetheless, at this crucial juncture, in order for the \n     arresting agents to proceed to obtain the desired \n     cooperation, the statute requires that a waiver be obtained \n     from the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     with certification by the Secretary to Congress that the \n     waiver was in the national security interests of the United \n     States. The proposed statute acknowledges that this is a \n     significant point in an ongoing investigation. It provides \n     that surveillance and intelligence gathering on the \n     arrestee's associates should not be interrupted. Likewise, \n     the statute provides that an ongoing interrogation session \n     should not be interrupted.\n       These limited exceptions, however, fail to recognize the \n     reality of a counterterrorism investigation. Building rapport \n     with, and convincing a covered individual to cooperate once \n     arrested, is a delicate and time sensitive skill that \n     transcends any one interrogation session. It requires \n     coordination with other aspects of the investigation. \n     Coordination with the prosecutor's office is also often an \n     essential component of obtaining a defendant's cooperation. \n     To halt this process while the Secretary of Defense \n     undertakes the mandated consultation, and the required. \n     certification is drafted and provided to Congress, would set \n     back our efforts to develop intelligence from the subject.\n       We appreciate that Congress has sought to address our \n     concerns in the latest version of the bill, but believe that \n     the legislation as currently drafted remains problematic for \n     the reasons set forth above. We respectfully ask that you \n     take into account these concerns as Congress continues to \n     consider Section 1032.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert S. Mueller III,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n        S. 1867--National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012\n\n                   (Sen. Levin, D-MI, Nov. 17, 2011)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1867, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. \n     The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee's continued support of our national defense, \n     including its support for both the base budget and for \n     overseas contingency operations and for most of the \n     Administration's initiatives to control spiraling health \n     costs of the Department of Defense (DoD).\n       The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee \n     for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to \n     operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities \n     that are important to field commanders, such as the \n     Commanders' Emergency Response Program, Global Train and \n     Equip Authority, and other programs that provide commanders \n     with the resources and flexibility to counter unconventional \n     threats or support contingency or stability operations. The \n     Administration looks forward to reviewing a classified annex \n     and working with the Congress to address any concerns on \n     classified programs as the legislative process moves forward.\n       While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, \n     the Administration would have serious concerns with \n     provisions that would: (1) constrain the ability of the Armed \n     Forces to carry out their missions; (2) impede the Secretary \n     of Defense's ability to make and implement decisions that \n     eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce \n     resources are directed to the highest priorities for the \n     warfighter; or (3) depart from the decisions reflected in the \n     President's FY 2012 Budget Request. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these and \n     other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail \n     below.\n       Detainee Matters: The Administration objects to and has \n     serious legal and policy concerns about many of the detainee \n     provisions in the bill. In their current form, some of these \n     provisions disrupt the Executive branch's ability to enforce \n     the law and impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on the \n     U.S. Government's ability to aggressively combat \n     international terrorism; other provisions inject legal \n     uncertainty and ambiguity that may only complicate the \n     military's operations and detention practices.\n       Section 1031 attempts to expressly codify the detention \n     authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the ``AUMF''). The \n     authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention \n     authority, are essential to our ability to protect the \n     American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its \n     associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full \n     range of threats this country faces from those organizations \n     and individuals. Because the authorities codified in this \n     section already exist, the Administration does not believe \n     codification is necessary and poses some risk. After a decade \n     of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress \n     must be careful not to open a whole new series of legal \n     questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the \n     country. While the current language minimizes many of those \n     risks, future legislative action must ensure that the \n     codification in statute of express military detention \n     authority does not carry unintended consequences that could \n     compromise our ability to protect the American people.\n       The Administration strongly objects to the military custody \n     provision of section 1032, which would appear to mandate \n     military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects. \n     This unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial \n     restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation \n     from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our \n     intelligence and law enforcement professionals. Moreover, \n     applying this military custody requirement to individuals \n     inside the United States, as some Members of Congress have \n     suggested is their intention, would raise serious and \n     unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the \n     fundamental American principle that our military does not \n     patrol our streets. We have spent ten years since September \n     11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence, \n     military, and law enforcement professionals; Congress should \n     not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of \n     preventing terrorist attacks more difficult. Specifically, \n     the provision would limit the flexibility of our national \n     security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and \n     the facts and circumstances of each case, which tool for \n     incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our national \n     security interests. The waiver provision fails to address \n     these concerns, particularly in time-sensitive operations in \n     which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the \n     leading role. These problems are all the more acute because \n     the section defines the category of individuals who would be \n     subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and \n     untested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive \n     and Judicial branches are currently using for detention under \n     the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations. \n     Such confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and \n     decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism \n     suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital \n     intelligence about threats to the American people.\n       Rather than fix the fundamental defects of section 1032 or \n     remove it entirely, as the Administration and the chairs of \n     several congressional committees with jurisdiction over these \n     matters have advocated, the revised text merely directs the \n     President to develop procedures to ensure the myriad problems \n     that would result from such a requirement do not come to \n     fruition. Requiring the President to devise such procedures \n     concedes the substantial risks created by mandating military \n     custody, without providing an adequate solution. As a result, \n     it is likely that implementing such procedures would inject \n     significant confusion into counterterrorism operations.\n       The certification and waiver, required by section 1033 \n     before a detainee may be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to a \n     foreign country, continue to hinder the Executive branch's \n     ability to exercise its military, national security, and \n     foreign relations activities. While these provisions may be \n     intended to be somewhat less restrictive than the analogous \n     provisions in current law, they continue to pose unnecessary \n     obstacles, effectively blocking transfers that would advance \n     our national security interests, and would, in certain \n     circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers \n     principles. The Executive branch must have the flexibility to \n     act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries \n     regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers. Section \n     1034's ban on the use of funds to construct or modify a \n     detention facility in the United States is an unwise \n     intrusion on the military's ability to transfer its detainees \n     as operational needs dictate. Section 1035 conflicts with the \n     consensus-based interagency approach to detainee reviews \n     required under Executive Order No. 13567, which establishes \n     procedures to ensure that periodic review decisions are \n     informed by the most comprehensive information and the \n     considered views of all relevant agencies. Section 1036, \n     in addition to imposing onerous requirements, conflicts \n     with procedures for detainee reviews in the field that \n     have been developed based on many years of experience by \n     military officers and the Department of Defense. In short, \n     the matters addressed in these provisions are already well \n     regulated by existing procedures and have traditionally \n     been left to the discretion of the Executive branch.\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n       Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in this bill \n     micromanage the work of our experienced counterterrorism \n     professionals, including our military commanders, \n     intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism \n     prosecutors, or other operatives in the field. These \n     professionals have successfully led a Government-wide effort \n     to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa'ida and its \n     affiliates and adherents over two consecutive \n     Administrations. The Administration believes strongly that it \n     would be a mistake for Congress to overrule or limit the \n     tactical flexibility of our Nation's counterterrorism \n     professionals.\n       Any bill that challenges or constrains the President's \n     critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate \n     dangerous terrorists, and protect the Nation would prompt the \n     President's senior advisers to recommend a veto.\n       Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft (JSF): The Administration \n     also appreciates the Committee's inclusion in the bill of a \n     prohibition on using funds authorized by S. 1867 to be used \n     for the development of the F136 JSF alternate engine. As the \n     Administration has stated, continued development of the F136 \n     engine is an unnecessary diversion of scarce resources.\n       Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS): The \n     Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \n     Department's air and missile defense programs; however, it \n     strongly objects to the lack of authorization of \n     appropriations for continued development of the MEADS \n     program. This lack of authorization could trigger unilateral \n     withdrawal by the United States from the MEADS Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could \n     further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs--a \n     scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying \n     DoD's commitment under the MOU. Further, this lack of \n     authorization could also call into question DoD's ability to \n     honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative \n     MOUs and have adverse consequences for other international \n     cooperative programs.\n       Overseas Construction Funding for Guam and Bahrain: The \n     Administration has serious concerns with the limitation on \n     execution of the United States and Government of Japan funds \n     to implement the realignment of United States Marine Forces \n     from Okinawa to Guam. The bill would unnecessarily restrict \n     the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our \n     foreign and defense policies with our ally, Japan. The \n     Administration also has concerns over the lack of \n     authorization of appropriations for military construction \n     projects in Guam and Bahrain. Deferring or eliminating these \n     projects could send the unintended message that the United \n     States does not stand by its allies or its agreements.\n       Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations: The \n     Administration appreciates the support of the Committee to \n     improve capabilities of other nations to support \n     counterterrorism efforts and other U.S. interests, and urges \n     the inclusion of DoD's requested proposals, which balance \n     U.S. national security and broader foreign policy interests. \n     The Administration would prefer only an annual extension of \n     the support to foreign nation counter-drug activities \n     authority in line with its request. While the inclusion of \n     section 1207 (Global Security Contingency Fund) is welcome, \n     several provisions may affect Executive branch agility in the \n     implementation of this authority. Section 1204 (relating to \n     Yemen) would require a 60-day notify and wait period not only \n     for Yemen, but for all other countries as well, which would \n     impose an excessive delay and seriously impede the Executive \n     branch's ability to respond to emerging requirements.\n       Unrequested Authorization Increases: Although not the only \n     examples in S. 1867, the Administration notes and objects to \n     the addition of $240 million and $200 million, respectively, \n     in unrequested authorization for unneeded upgrades to M-1 \n     Abrams tanks and Rapid Innovation Program research and \n     development in this fiscally constrained environment. The \n     Administration believes the amounts appropriated in FY 2011 \n     and requested in FY 2012 fully fund DoD's requirements in \n     these areas.\n       Advance Appropriations for Acquisition: The Administration \n     objects to section 131, which would provide only incremental \n     funding--undermining stability and cost discipline--rather \n     than the advance appropriations that the Administration \n     requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High \n     Frequency satellites and certain classified programs.\n       Authority to Extend Deadline for Completion of a Limited \n     Number of Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) \n     Recommendations: The Administration requests inclusion of its \n     proposed authority for the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense to extend the 2005 BRAC implementation deadline for \n     up to ten (10) recommendations for a period of no more than \n     one year in order to ensure no disruption to the full and \n     complete implementation of each of these recommendations, as \n     well as continuity of operations. Section 2904 of the Defense \n     Base Closure and Realignment Act imposes on DoD a legal \n     obligation to close and realign all installations so \n     recommended by the BRAC Commission to the President and to \n     complete all such closures and realignments no later than \n     September 15, 2011. DoD has a handful of recommendations with \n     schedules that complete implementation close to the statutory \n     deadline.\n       TRICARE Providers: The Administration is currently \n     undertaking a review with relevant agencies, including the \n     Departments of Defense, Labor, and Justice, to clarify the \n     responsibility of health care providers under civil and \n     workers' rights laws. The Administration therefore objects to \n     section 702, which categorically excludes TRICARE network \n     providers from being considered subcontractors for purposes \n     of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or any other law.\n       Troops to Teachers Program: The Administration urges the \n     Senate's support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers \n     Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President's \n     Budget and DoD's legislative proposal to amend the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S. \n     Code in lieu of section 1048. The move to Defense will help \n     ensure that this important program supporting members of the \n     military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight \n     of 6 program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program \n     management. The Administration looks forward to keeping the \n     Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly \n     and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.\n       Constitutional concerns: A number of the bill's provisions \n     raise additional constitutional concerns, such as sections \n     233 and 1241, which could intrude on the President's \n     constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of \n     sensitive diplomatic communications. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these and \n     other concerns.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. So, contrary to what the bill sponsors claim, they have \nnot incorporated the administration's requests, and the current \nlanguage does not remove the risk of impeding intelligence \ninvestigations or prosecutions of terrorist suspects.\n  As currently written, the language in this bill would authorize the \nmilitary to indefinitely detain individuals--including U.S. citizens--\nwithout charge or trial. I am fundamentally opposed to indefinite \ndetention, and certainly when the detainee is a U.S. citizen held \nwithout charge. It contradicts the most basic principles of law that I \nsubscribed to when I was a prosecutor, and it severely weakens our \ncredibility when we criticize other governments for engaging in similar \nconduct.\n  I fought against the Bush administration policies that left us in the \nsituation we face now, with indefinite detention being the de facto \nadministration policy, and I strongly opposed President Obama's \nExecutive order on detention when it was announced last March because \nit contemplated, if not outright endorsed, indefinite detention.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the mandatory military detention \nrequirements included in this bill, which I believe dangerously \nundermine our national security. In the fight against al-Qaida and \nother terrorist threats, we should be giving our intelligence, \nmilitary, and law enforcement professionals all the tools they need--\nnot limiting those tools. But limiting them is exactly what this bill \ndoes. Secretary Panetta has stated unequivocally that ``[t]his \nprovision restrains the Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a \nswift and flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now \nlegally available.'' Requiring terrorism suspects to be held only in \nmilitary custody, and limiting the available options in the field, is \nunwise and unnecessary.\n  The language in the detention subtitle of this bill is the product of \na process that has lacked transparency from the start. These measures \ndirectly affect law enforcement, detention, and terrorism matters that \nhave traditionally been subject to the jurisdiction of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nbut neither committee was consulted about these provisions in July when \nthe bill was first marked up, or earlier this month when it was \nmodified.\n  The administration proposed revisions to significantly improve the \ndetention provisions. However, rather than negotiate with the \nadministration in good faith, the Armed Services Committee drafted a \nnew version of the language behind closed doors and claimed that it had \nsolved all of the issues raised by the administration. It is obvious \nfrom the letters we have received that this is not the case.\n  I can see no reason why these provisions were rushed through the \nCommittee without the input of the Defense Department and Federal \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies that will be directly \naffected if this language is enacted.\n  We must allow a thorough review to determine the legal and practical \nconsequences that these changes will have\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\non future counterterrorism and national security operations to ensure \nthey are not hindered. That is what the Udall amendment does. I urge \nall Senators to support this amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is imperative that American citizens \ndetained on U.S. soil be entitled to every protection guaranteed by the \nConstitution. I am concerned, therefore, that not all of the detainee \nprovisions in the bill provide explicit exemptions for U.S. citizens \nwho might be detained in the United States.\n  Had the amendment been more narrowly tailored to address that \nconcern, I would support it. However, I unfortunately cannot support \nthe amendment as a whole because it is too sweeping and would eliminate \nprovisions that are important to preserve because they undoubtedly make \nour country safer. For instance, if this amendment were to pass, the \nAdministration would be free to transfer detainees to countries where \nthere are confirmed cases of detainees who have been released returning \nto fight against the United States. In addition, the amendment would \neliminate a provision that would prevent foreign fighters captured \noverseas from taking advantage of the very constitutional rights I want \nto ensure for American citizens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 2 minutes \nto the Senator from New Hampshire, followed by time from Senator Levin \nfor the Senator from Connecticut, and then what time I have remaining \nfor the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank Chairman \nLevin and Ranking Member McCain and remind everyone that this \nparticular amendment addressing detainee provisions passed \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis in the Armed Services Committee.\n  The reason we addressed this issue was because we heard witness after \nwitness in a series of months before the Armed Services Committee from \nour Department of Defense tell us--for example, when I asked the \ncommander of Africa Command, saying he needs some lawyerly help on how \nto answer what to do with a member of al-Qaida who is captured in \nAfrica. This is an area that cried out for clarification, and that is \nthe genesis of this amendment, which is a very important amendment.\n  Briefly, two issues. No. 1, the arguments that have been raised about \nsection 1031, including the statement of authority, this is a red \nherring. This provision was drafted, as Senator Levin said very \nclearly, based upon what the administration wanted, and also codifies \nexisting law on what the statement authority is in terms of the fact \nthat we are at war with al-Qaida. If people want to disagree with that, \nthat is certainly a policy discussion we can have. But we were attacked \non our soil on 9/11, and this codifies the fact that we are at war with \nmembers of al-Qaida.\n  Section 1032 is the military custody provision. Let's be clear on \nwhat it does and what it does not do. No. 1, it is very clear on who it \napplies to. It only applies to members of al-Qaida or an associated \nforce who are planning or carrying out an attack or attempted attack \nagainst the United States or its coalition partners. It does not apply \nto American citizens. We are only saying that if a person is a member \nof al-Qaida and they want to attack the United States, we are going to \nhold them in military custody. Why? I prosecuted cases in the criminal \nsystem. We don't want to have to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. We don't ever want to have to read a terrorist their \nright to remain silent. That is the issue here.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend, the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee. I rise respectfully to oppose the \namendment the Senator from Colorado has offered, though in some measure \nI thank him for offering it because this has been an important and good \ndebate.\n  My own position, stated briefly, is this: As Senator Levin has said, \nwe are a nation at war. As such we were attacked on 9/11. We adopted in \nthis Chamber the authorization for military force. That is about as \nclose to a declaration of war as we have done since the Second World \nWar. The comparison is exact because what happened to us on 9/11 was in \nsome ways even worse than what happened in December of 1941 when we \nwere attacked at Pearl Harbor.\n  A nation at war that seizes those who have declared themselves to be \npart of enemy forces and have attempted to attack the American people, \nor America, should be treated as enemy combatants, as prisoners of war, \naccording to the law of war. To me, that is a matter of principle. \nRegardless of what statistics one can cite about how well prosecutions \nhave gone in article III courts, that is, to me, not ultimately the \npoint. If we are at war, the people who are fighting against us ought \nto be treated as prisoners of war.\n  In fact, we are without a policy now, as Senator Ayotte said. The \nmain reason I oppose what Senator Udall is proposing is that he would \nremove the sections of the current bill that create a policy and send \nus back to where we are now, where our forces in the field don't know \nwhat to do if they capture a member of al-Qaida.\n  If I had my way, the provisions in this proposal on detainees would \nnot have the waivers the President has. It would simply say, if you are \napprehended--if you are a foreign member of al-Qaida, and you are \ncaptured planning or executing attacks against Americans or our allies \nin this war, you are put in military custody and you are tried in a \nmilitary tribunal. This is not the law of the jungle; this is according \nto American law. These are the same courts in which American soldiers \nare tried when charges are brought against them, and, of course, we \naccept and abide by all of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions.\n  But that was not the will of the Armed Services Committee. The Armed \nServices Committee, in a good, reasonable, bipartisan compromise, has \ncreated a system here where the default position--the initial position \nis to transfer these enemy combatants to military custody. It is a good \ncompromise. It is the kind of compromise that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.--doesn't happen around here enough. I didn't get \neverything I wanted out of it, but it is a lot better than the status \nquo. Therefore, I support the language in the bill and oppose the Udall \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe Udall amendment, which would eliminate the bipartisan detainee \nprovision that the chairman, the ranking member, and committee members \nworked so hard to craft. These provisions are necessary to provide some \ncertainty for our intelligence professionals in how our government will \nhandle terrorist detainees and how long detainees can be questioned for \nintelligence-gathering purposes.\n  We have heard quite a lot over the past few days from administration \nofficials about how our intelligence and law enforcement professionals \nneed flexibility. In fact, Director of National Intelligence Clapper \nwrote to the Intelligence Committee arguing for flexibility and \nstressing the need for a process that, as he said, ``encourages \nintelligence collection through the preservation of all lawful avenues \nof detention and interrogation.'' With that, I agree wholeheartedly. \nThe problem with the status quo, however, is that the administration \nrefuses to use all of its lawful avenues of detention and interrogation \navailable to it, choosing instead only to use one, and that is article \nIII courts.\n  For nearly 3 years, Members of Congress have pressed the \nadministration to establish an effective and unambiguous long-term \ndetention policy, but they have refused. The intent behind these \nbipartisan provisions is simple:\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nWe must hold detainees for as long as it takes to gather information \nour intelligence and law enforcement professionals need to take down \nterror networks and to stop attacks.\n  Frankly, the best place, in my opinion, for this is Guantanamo Bay, \nBut when it comes to Gitmo, the administration is no longer concerned \nabout ``flexibility.'' Instead, we hear that Guantanamo is ``off the \ntable.''\n\n  In fact, in a hearing, when I asked the current Secretary of Defense, \nprior to the SEAL Team 6 takedown of Osama bin Laden: If you captured \nhim, what would you do with him, he quizzically looked back and said: \nWell, I guess we would send him to Guantanamo. Well, we know that would \nnot have happened had we not taken him down.\n  This is unfortunate because intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals, including some at high levels in the administration, \nacknowledge privately that what hampers intelligence collection from \ndetainees is the administration's unwillingness to take new detainees \nto Guantanamo for questioning. When our operators overseas are unsure \nabout where they would hold captured detainees, it causes delay, \nsometimes missed opportunities, and sometimes capture operations become \nkill operations.\n  We cannot afford this kind of uncertainty and the Udall amendment \nsimply kicks the can down the road with a report about a problem we \nalready understand. The time to act is now.\n  Without Guantanamo, long-term military detention elsewhere is the \nnext best option and is the appropriate option for terrorists with whom \nwe are at war. The detainee provisions in the Defense Authorization Act \nwill ensure that the administration uses all of the detention options \nit says it wants, not just article III courts, and offer the \nflexibility the administration says it needs. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the Udall amendment and give our intelligence professionals and \nmilitary operators some certainty as they fight the war on terror.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on the Udall \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues \nwho have engaged in a very important debate.\n  I would also like to say to my friend from Michigan, the chairman, I \nhave observed him for many years debate various issues on the floor of \nthe Senate and in the Armed Services Committee. I have never seen him \nmore eloquent than I have observed in his statements today and \nthroughout this debate. I also appreciate the fact that there are many \nin his conference who do not agree with the position taken by the \nchairman, and I especially am admiring of that.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 45 seconds. The \nSenator from Colorado has 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado be allowed----\n  Mr. LEVIN. He only needs 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Two minutes, at least.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Such time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank, again, the ranking \nmember and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for their hard \nwork.\n  I want to close with a couple points. I want to, in the interest of \nclarifying the record, point out, on the heels of the chairman's \ncomments about the Statement of Administration Policy, when it comes to \nsection 1031, the full statement reads:\n\n       Because the authorities codified in this section already \n     exist, the Administration does not believe codification is \n     necessary and poses some risk. After a decade of settled \n     jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress must be \n     careful not to open a whole new series of legal questions \n     that will distract from our efforts to protect the country.\n\n  Second, there are questions that continue to be raised. I want to \nmention section 1033. The chairman said it is only section 1032 that is \nthe focus of our attention, but there have been questions raised about \nsection 1033. There is language in section 1033 that makes it clear \nthat--we think it makes it clear that there is a provision that \nrequires any receiving country is taking actions ``to ensure that the \n[detainee] cannot engage . . . in any terrorist activity.'' This is if \nwe are releasing or transferring somebody who is detained.\n  I was in Afghanistan recently, at Bagram prison. We have 20,000 \ndetainees there. There are some who believe section 1033 would restrict \nus from releasing those prisoners at Bagram as we begin to draw down \nour efforts in Afghanistan. That is just one of the many questions that \nare asked.\n  Finally, I listened to the passion that my friend from South Carolina \nSenator Graham exhibited on the Senate floor. We are all in this \ntogether. We are going to prevail. The bad guys in the world are not \ngoing to win. We do have, however--and this is what makes our country \nstrong--different points of view on how we prosecute this war. I \nbelieve the intent of what is being suggested in these provisions is \nwell and good and at the highest level. But there are many people we \ntrust and respect--including the FBI Director, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of Homeland Security--who believe what will \nhappen, if we interpret the language, will not actually reflect our \nintent.\n  Therefore, let's set this aside, pass the NDA, send it to the \nPresident, and take the next 90 days to hold hearings and thoroughly \nvet what is in this set of provisions. I will be the first person to \ncome to the floor if all of those individuals and our own experts tell \nus this is the right way to proceed, to say: Let's put this into the \nlaw.\n  But let's not rush to take these steps. We have something that is \nworking. We have over 300 terrorists who have been prosecuted through \nour civil system who are in jail, many of them for life sentences, \nsentences that will outlast their lifespans. Let's not fix something \nthat is not broken until we really understand what the consequences \nare.\n  I thank, again, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThis has been a helpful and important debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also thank our friend from Colorado \nfor his contributions to the committee. He is a valuable member of our \ncommittee, and he is no less valuable because he is offering an \namendment with which I happen to disagree.\n  Two quick factual points. One is, the language the Senator mentioned \nfrom section 1033 is exactly the same language as was in last year's \nbill and is in current law. The only difference is we have given \ngreater flexibility this year to the President by making it waiveable. \nSo our language is more flexible than the current law.\n  Finally, in terms of the Hamdi case, the Senator is correct. I \nbelieve it was Senator Udall who said this was an American citizen who \nwas captured in Afghanistan. That is true. But the Supreme Court, in \nHamdi, relied on the Quirin case--which was an American citizen \ncaptured on Long Island and--quoted that case with approval when \nsaying:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant.\n\n  That was the Quirin language--an American citizen captured on Long \nIsland.\n  Mr. President, if I have any time left, I will yield it and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Udall \namendment.\n  Am I correct, I ask the chairman, in that we would intend, depending \non--there are several things that have to be resolved--but we would \nintend to have this vote at around 2:15 p.m., if things work out? Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if Senator Udall also heard that. I believe, and \nI think it is the intention of all of us, that we vote on this as soon \nas possible after 2:15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1230 and 1281, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nMcCain amendments Nos. 1230 and 1281 be modified with the changes at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, as modified, are as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 1230, AS MODIFIED\n\n       On page 220, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 221, line 6, and insert the following:\n       ``(c) Annual Adjustment in Enrollment Fee.--(1) Whenever \n     after September 30, 2012, and before October 1, 2013, the \n     Secretary of Defense increases the retired pay of members and \n     former members of the armed forces pursuant to section 1401a \n     of this title, the Secretary shall increase the amount of the \n     fee payable for enrollment in TRICARE Prime by an amount \n     equal to the percentage of such fee payable on the day before \n     the date of the increase of such fee that is equal to the \n     percentage increase in such retired pay.

I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote in relation to the Udall of Colorado \namendment No. 1107; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendments \nin order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1107\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, this amendment strikes \ncontroversial detainee provisions that have been inserted in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It would require that the Defense \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies report to Congress with \nrecommendations for any additional authorities they need in order to \ndetain and prosecute terrorists. The amendment would then ask for \nhearings to be held so we can fully understand the opposition to these \nprovisions by our national security experts--bipartisan opposition, I \nmight add--and hopefully avoid a veto of the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  In short, we are ignoring the advice and the input of the Director of \nthe FBI, the Director of our intelligence community, the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the White \nHouse, who are all saying there are significant concerns with these \nprovisions; that we ought to move slowly.\n  We have been successful in prosecuting over 300 terrorists through \nour civil justice system. Let's not fix what isn't broken until we \nfully understand the ramifications.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 30 seconds to Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, section 1031 is a congressional statement \nof authority of already existing law. It reaffirms the fact this body \nbelieves al-Qaida and affiliated groups are a military threat to the \nUnited States and they can be held under the law of war indefinitely to \nmake sure we find out what they are up to; and they can be questioned \nin a humane manner consistent with the law of war.\n  Section 1032 says if you are captured on the homeland, you will be \nheld in military custody so we can gather intelligence. That provision \ncan be waived if it interferes with the investigation.\n  These are needed changes. These are changes that reaffirm what is \nalready in law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Supreme Court has recently ruled--this \nis the Supreme Court talking:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant. A citizen, no less than an \n     alien, can be\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n     part of the supporting forces hostile to the United States, \n     and such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat \n     of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.\n\n  That is the Supreme Court's statement. We can and must deal with an \nal-Qaida threat. We can do it properly. The administration helped to \ndraft almost all of this bill. The provisions which would be struck----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are provisions which even the administration has helped to \ndraft. So I would hope we would deal with the al-Qaida threat in an \nappropriate way, in a bipartisan way. The committee voted \noverwhelmingly for this language.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three seconds.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The Director of the FBI, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Attorney General, and the Director of Intelligence have \nall said let's go slow.\n  Pass the Udall amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, on rollcall vote 210, I voted ``nay.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``yea.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could have Senator McCain's attention \nas well, what we are trying to do next is to move to two amendments, if \nwe can. Both are next on the pending list. One is the Paul amendment \nNo. 1064, repeal the authorization for use of military force against \nIraq. The second one is not directly after his but follows after two \nFeinstein amendments. Senator Feinstein told me she could not be here \nearly this afternoon. I told her if hers could be made part of a \nunanimous consent agreement, that could come later because this \nafternoon we have other things we can do. So the second amendment on \nthis list is another nongermane amendment by Senator Landrieu, No. \n1115, relative to small business research grants.\n  What we are trying to do is work out a unanimous consent agreement. \nThere will be 60-vote thresholds on those two amendments. Neither one \nof them, I believe, is germane. As part of that agreement, we would \nalso next move to approximately 40 cleared amendments which we would \nthen ask be passed as cleared. That would all be part of a unanimous \nconsent agreement we are currently drafting.\n  So I want to alert our colleagues----\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the benefit of our colleagues, could I add also the \nagreement of a half hour time limit on the Paul amendment? He would \nagree to that. I am sure Senator Landrieu would agree to a short time \nagreement on her amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sure she told me that would be OK. When we prepare \nour unanimous consent agreement, we will doublecheck that.\n  So that is where we stand. We hope in the next few minutes to be able \nto bring to the body a unanimous consent agreement. In the meantime, \nunless there is someone else who seeks recognition, I would note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have cleared with Senator Levin to be able to speak \nabout a topic but not offer an amendment. I understand we are working \non a unanimous consent agreement. I do have an amendment that at the \nappropriate time hopefully will be able to be brought up, but I wish to \ndiscuss it now. I think it is a way for us to save $1.1 billion over \nthe next 5 years in the Defense Department, give children of on-base \nmilitary schools a better education, help the local school districts \nthrough Impact Aid by $12,000 per student per year, and actually do \nwhat we are intending to do in terms of education.\n  We have 64 schools right now on 18 military bases within the United \nStates. There are 26,000 students taught by 2,300 teachers. That is 1 \nteacher for every 11 students. The average cost per student per year is \n$51,000 in a military school--$51,000. That is 250 percent higher than \nthe highest cost district anywhere in the United States--2\\1/2\\ times.\n  This amendment says let's use local schools, let's help local schools \nthrough these military bases, and let's give an exemption if we need \nto, if it is not available. If we were to do that, three positive \nthings would happen. The first one is probably a better education. \nAccording to the teachers, conditions are so bad that some of the \neducators at base schools envy the civilian public schools off base, \nwhich admittedly have their own challenges. ``Some of the new schools \nin town make our schools look like a prison,'' said David Primer, who \nuses a trailer as a classroom to teach students German at Marine Corps \nheadquarters in Quantico, VA. In other words, what they are looking at, \nwhat they are doing, and for the cost of it, the value can be higher. \nThat is No. 1.\n  Second, it will help the local school districts because they will not \nonly get Impact Aid, but they will be given up to $12,000 per year per \nstudent off a military base.\n  Then, finally, third, it will, over the next 5 years, save $220 \nmillion a year out of the military's budget that they would not be \nspending. That is after the $12,000 and the Impact Aid. So it is a way \nto save $1.1 billion and give a better education with better facilities \nto the children of our military service bases, these 26,000 students at \n16 military installations. It is a win-win-win.\n  My hope is we will be able to call up this amendment and make it \npending in the future.\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had a number of amendments that I was \njust going to discuss, unless the chairman is planning to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is fine, if my colleague wishes to discuss amendments \nwithout attempting to offer any amendments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, that is not my intention. I just want the chance to \ntalk about them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate that. If I could ask my friend about how long \nhe needs?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Until the chairman is ready to speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That sounds good.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there are a number of amendments I think \nwill probably not come up, but they should. We talked about this some \ntime ago.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration has come up with a change for \ntheir SUB-S nonscheduled carriers that is going to make them comply \nwith certain of the wage and hour--the crew rest requirements. Here is \nthe problem we have. About 95 percent of the passengers who go into--\nthis is our troops--Afghanistan today are carried by nonscheduled \nairlines as opposed to military and about 40 percent of the cargo that \nis going in.\n  Now, the problem we have is, with the 15-hour restriction on crew \nrest, they are unable to bring them in, leave them there, and then go \nback to their point of origin--someplace in Germany--without exceeding \nthat 15-hour limitation. The only choice they would have is to leave \nthem in Afghanistan, which they cannot do because that is a war zone.\n  So I want to have a way of working this out. We want to pursue this \nbecause the carriers understand what the problem is. These are the \nnonscheduled carriers. So it is something I think is very significant, \nand we need to be addressing it.\n  Another issue is, JIEDDO is the group that is the Joint Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Organization. They have done great work in \ntheir technology in stopping the various technologies over there, the \nIEDs that have been killing and causing damage to our troops and to our \nallies. The problem we have is it is set up just for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. When everything is through in Iraq and Afghanistan, that \nmight put them in a position where they would cease to exist, and yet \nthe technology and what they are doing right now is useful in the \nUnited States even though it is not designed by the legislation to do \nthat. I believe this is something that can be corrected.\n  Another area that needs to be addressed--and I have some ideas, and \nthis is one I would like to get in the queue; it is not pending at this \ntime, so there is a little bit of a problem there, but it might be \nsomething that could be addressed in conference--is the military bases \nshould be able to benefit from the production of domestic energy and \nresources on those bases.\n  In the case of the McAlester depot, they could horizontally drill and \ncome out with some pretty good royalties that would otherwise go to the \ngeneral fund or go to the State of Oklahoma. It is kind of divided in \nthat way. Well, the problem is there is a cost that is incurred by the \nmilitary operation. We need to have something that is going to allow \nthem to receive the benefits of the production that takes place under \nthe military installations through horizontal drilling.\n  I think everyone is for doing this. But the problem is, it could be \nscored in that if we took all of the existing production, then that \nwould be money that would not otherwise go to our general fund. So what \nI would propose is to have this in the form of an amendment, and then \nchange it to say: Any operation from this point forward--that money, \nthose royalties, could go back to the military base because what we all \nagree on is we do not want our bases to have to foot the bill for these \nthings that are taking place.\n  I have an amendment, No. 1101, that would stop the transfer of the \nMC-12W ISR aircraft from the Air Force to the Army. I think it is \nsomething that is pretty significant. We are talking about intelligence \nand reconnaissance. The MC-12W is a King Air or a C-12. Right now it is \nunder the jurisdiction of the Air Force, and this bill would change it \nfrom the Air Force to the Army. Well, neither the Air Force nor the \nArmy wants to make that change, and there ought to be a way to support \nthat.\n  There are several other amendments that will be coming forward that \nwill be offered. One I feel very strongly about has to do with the sale \nof the F-16C/D models to Taiwan.\n  Then, lastly--and I feel very strongly about this--back in 2007, we \nchanged the commands to create AFRICOM. AFRICOM, prior to this time, \nwas part of three commands: Central Command, Pacific Command, and \nEuropean Command. Well, it is so significant in terms of national \nsecurity, in terms of our economy and the activity that is going on \nthere right now.\n  For example, ever since 9/11, we have been working with the Africans \nto help develop in Africa our programs--our 1206 programs, our train-\nand-equip programs. More recently, we have been involved in the LRA \nissue in poor countries in Africa.\n  Well, there is an effort now--almost any Member I guess would feel \nthe same way--to take that command that is now in Stuttgart, Germany, \nand put it in Texas or Florida or someplace in the United States. I \nthink that would be something that would inure to the benefit maybe of \na Member, a Senator, but, on the other hand, it creates certain \nproblems.\n  When the African Command came into effect--and I think that is one of \nthe few issues that I, probably, am more familiar with than most other \nMembers--the obvious place would have been to have that command located \nin Africa itself. My choice at that time was Ethiopia. I think there is \na lot of jurisdiction for that. But they said because of the political \nproblem--if we go back historically in Africa, and we look at the \ncolonialism, there is this thing embedded back in the minds of people \nin Africa, thinking that having a command, a U.S. command located in \nAfrica, it might revert back to some of the colonial days. That is the \nconcern people had.\n  So, anyway, I thought it would have been better to have it in Africa \nitself. But because of this--and, by the way, I have talked to many of \nthe Presidents of countries over there--President Kikwete in Tanzania \nand President Kagame in Rwanda and President Kabila in the Congo, and \nseveral of the others--and they say: Yes, you are right. It would be \nbetter to have that command located somewhere in Africa, but we have \nthe political problem with the people who would think that is a move \nback toward colonialism. So it is a complicated problem.\n  However, I do believe all of the generals pretty much believe that \nAFRICOM should remain where it is. At least Stuttgart is in the same \ntime zone. It is easier to transport people and equipment back and \nforth. So I would support defeating any of the amendments that would \nchange that situation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        First Year in the Senate\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, last week we celebrated Thanksgiving, the \ntime of year when we look back and we give thanks for our blessings. We \nare all grateful for our family, our men and women in uniform, and \nthose who also\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\ndefend our Nation in civilian life. I am particularly thankful this \nyear, because 1 year ago today I had the honor of my life to be sworn \nin as the newest junior Senator for the State of Illinois to complete \nSenator Obama's term.\n  And what a year it has been. Coming from the House of \nRepresentatives, I had to adjust to the measured place and pace of the \nSenate. But while Americans may have a dim view of what we do here, I \nremain an optimist. Americans have always faced tough challenges but \nthen rose to the occasion more successfully than any other people in \nhistory.\n  Although I believe there is much more to do to reduce debt, repeal \nburdensome regulations, and encourage job creation, I want to take a \nfew minutes to lay out what my team has accomplished for the State of \nIllinois and the Nation in 1 year.\n  In my first 30 days in office we moved three times, we hired a staff, \nand then voted to prevent the largest tax increase in history, while \nCongress extended tax relief for millions of Americans in that \nlegislation.\n  We also worked to block the transfer of al-Qaida terrorists from \nGuantanamo Bay to northwestern Illinois. Since then, Congress enacted \nthe Budget Control Act, mandating about $2 trillion in reduced Federal \nborrowing over the next 10 years, which in my view is only a first step \nin addressing Washington's out-of-control spending. No one here would \nsay that we have come near to solving the problem, but I am heartened \nby the bipartisan and bicameral support of the Gang of Six proposal, \nand now with the probable support of 45 Republican and Democratic \nSenators, I hope we will soon go big with their recommendations to find \n$4 trillion in savings.\n  The Congress approved three free-trade agreements to boost U.S. \nexports to South Korea, to Colombia, and Panama, as both President \nObama and Speaker Boehner wanted. The action will open markets for \nIllinois farmers and boost exports for companies and employers such as \nJohn Deere in Moline, Caterpillar in Peoria, ADM in Decatur, and \nNavistar in suburban Warrenville.\n  Congress repealed the onerous requirement mandated by the health care \nlaw that required small businesses to document all payments over a few \nhundred dollars. This absurd 1099 rule was the first part of the health \ncare law to be repealed, and it will soon be followed by the misnamed \nCLASS Act that even the Obama administration appears to have canceled \nby executive action.\n  Additionally, Congress reformed our patent system by moving to a \nfirst-to-file, instead of a first-to-invent, system. This signals to \ninventors that they should quickly file their invention and allows us \nto innovate without endless and expensive litigation. Along with that \neffort, the Kirk amendment authorizing the patent office to have a \nsmall business fast lane became law.\n  My office published a Great Lakes report card that gave our largest \nbody of fresh water a C grade to draw attention to invasive species, to \npoor water quality, and beach closures, demonstrating the need for our \nlegislation by myself and Senator Durbin to ban sewage dumping in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  To create more construction jobs in Illinois, I introduced the \nLincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act which would unlock more \nthan $100 billion in new revenue for roads, rail, transit, and \nairports, through more infrastructure funded by public-private \npartnerships. I have since met with Secretary LaHood, Chief of Staff \nDaley, and House Chairman Mica as a way to advance this legislation to \nrestart our economy.\n  We have also had an active year in protecting our allies and \nAmerica's interests overseas. On the floor today, we may consider the \nMenendez-Kirk amendment pending to the Defense Authorization Act which \nwould impose crippling sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran. This is a \nresult of a collaborative effort involving 92 Senators who signed the \nSchumer-Kirk letter calling for the United States to collapse Iran's \nterror-sponsoring bank.\n  In May, Senator Gillibrand and I introduced the Iran Human Rights and \nDemocracy Promotion Act which establishes a special representative on \nhuman rights and democracy in Iran, imposing sanctions on companies \nthat sell or service products that enable the Iranian regime to oppress \nits people. It would require a comprehensive strategy to promote \nInternet freedom in Iran and reauthorize the Iran Freedom Support Act. \nThe bill is now part of the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Sanctions \nConsolidation Act.\n  In February, the Senate passed a Kirk resolution condemning human \nrights abuses in Iran, and we founded the Iranian Dissident Awareness \nProgram to make dissidents such as Hossein Ronaghi-Maleki, a blogger \nand human rights activist, and Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human \nrights activist, household names now in America.\n  We also fought for strict assurances that data collected from our new \nX-band radar in Turkey would be shared with our allies in Israel.\n  In total, my office introduced 18 bills and resolutions and 11 \namendments. We cosponsored 132 pieces of legislation.\n  I am a member of four committees that have held more than 130 \nhearings and markups. This year we worked on the reform of No Child \nLeft Behind, and those reforms passed the committee with bipartisan \nsupport. We also worked on legislation regarding flood insurance \nfunding bills under the Appropriations Committee.\n  Most Americans who watch cable news think all Democrats and all \nRepublicans may hate each other. While Congress has grown more \npartisan, I am particularly proud of the bipartisan partnerships we \nhave fostered in such a short time. I have continued a longstanding \nbattle against the corrupt sugar program by working with Senator \nShaheen of New Hampshire on S. 25 to Stop Unfair Giveaways and \nRestrictions Act, the SUGAR Act of 2011, which would eliminate sugar \nprice supports and increased costs for consumers that destroy American \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Senator Wyden and I introduced legislation targeting more than $60 \nbillion in Medicare fraud every year by issuing new identify theft-\nproof medical ID cards, offering the same ID card protection our troops \nhave for our seniors.\n\n  I also joined Senator Wyden in his efforts to ensure your \nconstitutional rights are protected with regard to your GPS data and \ncell phone and other location information.\n  Senator Casey and I worked together on antibullying legislation to \nkeep our kids safe at school.\n  I joined Senator Whitehouse in an effort to criminalize the pointing \nof lasers against civil aircraft to keep that industry safe.\n  In my capacity as the top Republican member of the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, we \nworked across the aisle with Chairman Tim Johnson to pass the first \nstand-alone appropriations bill out of the Senate since 2009. Since \nthen, we have broken the logjam on appropriations bills, and I hope to \nquickly complete that legislation.\n  I especially wish to recognize one of my first friends in the Senate, \nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, for our collaborative effort on \nmany issues, the latest being a bipartisan resolution calling for the \nCongress to go big on deficit reduction. When we first came to the \nSenate together, we saw that there were few opportunities for \nRepublicans and Democrats to interact outside the Senate floor. That is \nwhy we began to have an open lunch together each Thursday instead of \nthe regularly scheduled partisan lunches, to discuss ways to bridge the \npolitical divide in the Senate and in Washington.\n  I also wish to highlight the partnership I have developed with my \nsenior Senator from the State of Illinois. While we may not see eye to \neye on many issues, Senator Durbin and I have worked closely on a whole \nhost of issues for Illinois. Following in the footsteps of the late \nSenator Paul Simon, Senator Durbin and I have now held more than 25 \njoint constituent coffees here in Washington. It is like a townhall \nmeeting, where we talk with Illinois families about what is going on at \nhome and in the Congress.\n  In March, Senator Durbin and I worked with Secretary of \nTransportation Ray Lahood to help the city of Chicago, American, and \nUnited Airlines come to an agreement to keep the O'Hare Modernization \nProgram moving forward. This is the single greatest job creation \nprogram in northern Illinois, and the agreement that we helped foster \nkeeps thousands at work at O'Hare.\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\n  We worked closely to bring high-speed rail to the State of Illinois, \nand together introduced legislation to expand charter schools, to \nimprove access to EpiPens at schools for children with severe \nallergies, to ensure military families in North Chicago continue to \nreceive their Federal education assistance.\n  We fought to open a new Federal prison in Thompson, IL, but without \nal-Qaida detainees, to create jobs in northwestern Illinois, and \naddress also flooding issues in southern Illinois and levee \nrehabilitation in the metro east area. We have also successfully \nconfirmed four new judges for central and northern Illinois, and have \nan additional two nominations, one Democrat, one Republican, pending.\n  But legislation is not all we do here. In my opinion, one of the most \nimportant things a Member of Congress can focus on is constituent \nservice. We formed advisory boards for African Americans, Latinos, \nsmall business, agriculture, health care, education, and students. \nSince I first came to the House of Representatives in 2001, I have \nworked diligently as an advocate for Illinois before the Federal \nGovernment. In 1 year now, my staff has held more than 3,440 meetings \nwith constituents and other officials and dignitaries. To be as \naccessible as possible, I have visited 50 out of Illinois's 102 \ncounties and held 20 townhall meetings throughout the State.\n  This month, my successor in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nBob Dold, and I held the first ever live Facebook townhall meeting and \nanswered questions we received via the social networking site and \nTwitter.\n  My office has arranged 340 Capitol and White House tours for \napproximately 2,800 constituents. We received more than 85,000 phone \ncalls and responded to 66,000 letters and e-mails. We have helped more \nthan 4,000 constituents with casework details before the government, \nand written more than 200 letters in support of Illinois towns, \ncounties, and organizations for Federal grants. I have convened eight \nconstituent advisory boards and met a total of 18 times. My office \nhelped process 122 passports and assisted 750 veterans and their \nconcerns before the VA.\n  We have accomplished quite a bit this year. I remain optimistic about \nthe long-term future of our Nation. We can outinnovate and outproduce \nany nation on the planet if we create an environment that supports full \njob creation. But there is still a lot of work to do. The Illinois \nunemployment rate stands at over 10 percent. It seems each day we hear \nof a new company thinking of leaving our State.\n  The health care law threatens a further drag on our economy. We face \na global sovereign debt crisis in Europe and fears of future credit \ndevaluations for the United States.\n  U.S. troops continue to pursue enemies of freedom in Afghanistan and \nIraq, and Iran continues its effort to develop nuclear weapons. \nProtests are accelerating in Egypt, and civil unrest in Syria. Piracy \nremains a concern off the coast of Somalia.\n  As I have for the past year, I will spend the next 5 years making \nsure that America remains the best place on Earth for any individual to \nrise to their full potential, a place where your rights are protected \nagainst the government, whose main mission should be to defend us, and \nto foster higher incomes for our families.\n  In these battles, I will advance the interests of the State of \nIllinois as the job engine at the center of the Nation's economy, \nprotector of the Lake Michigan and Mississippi ecosystems, and the \nspecial place that sent Abraham Lincoln and hopefully future Lincolns \nfor national leadership when America needs it most.\n  Of course, my heart and soul will always be with the troops--their \ncare, their mission, and their spirit of defending a place that is the \ngreatest force for human freedom and dignity ever designed.\n  I am truly grateful for the opportunity to serve my Nation twice--in \nthe Navy and in the Senate. I thank the people of Illinois for this \nfirst year in the Senate and for the even bigger things we will do \ntogether in the years to come.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have filed two amendments that I will \noffer at some time, and I will talk about them now.\n  I am strongly opposed to the detention provisions in the Defense bill \nbefore us. I am disappointed that Senator Udall's amendment did not \npass. Taken together, sections 1031 and 1032 would fundamentally alter \nhow we investigate, arrest, and detain individuals suspected of \nterrorism.\n  Before I get into the details of why I oppose these detainee \nprovisions, I think it is important to recognize that September 11 \nirrevocably and unalterably changed our lives. I was in Minnesota on \nthat terrible day. A number of Minnesotans died in the towers, in the \nair, and at the Pentagon. In New York, in the months following the \nattacks, I attended the funerals of brave firefighters and law \nenforcement officers who sacrificed their lives to help rescue folks \nfrom the towers. I cannot shake those images from my mind, and I am \nguessing, like many of you, I will never be able to erase the horrors \nof September 11 from my mind.\n  September 11 reminded us that we are vulnerable and that we are \nfighting an unusual enemy. It forced us to reassess our approach to \ncounterterrorism, and it forced us to redouble our efforts to track \ndown the people who aim to do us harm. But it is exactly in these \ndifficult moments, in these periods of war when our country is under \nattack, that we must be doubly vigilant about projecting what makes us \nAmericans.\n  The Founders who drafted our Constitution and Bill of Rights were \ncareful to draft a Constitution of limited powers--one that would \nprotect Americans' freedom and liberty at all times, both in war and in \npeace.\n  Today, as we contemplate fundamentally altering the criminal justice \nsystem our Founders developed in order to create a military detention \nsystem--a system that would permit the indefinite detention of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful residents of the United States for acts committed \nin the United States--I think it is important to pause and remember \nsome of the mistakes this country has made when we have been fearful of \nenemy attack.\n  Most notably, we made a grave and indefensible mistake during World \nWar II when President Roosevelt ordered the incarceration of more than \n110,000 people of Japanese origin, as well as approximately 11,000 \nGerman Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans. There is a memorial right \nacross the street from the Capitol that should remind us all of this \nterrible mistake.\n  In 1971, President Richard Nixon signed into law the Nondetention Act \nto make sure the U.S. Government would never again subject any \nAmericans to the unnecessary and unjustifiable imprisonment that so \nmany Japanese Americans, German Americans, and Italian Americans had to \nendure.\n  It wasn't until 1988--46 years after the internment--that President \nReagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, that the government formally \nacknowledged and apologized for the grave injustice that was done to \ncitizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry.\n  These were dark periods in American history, and it is easy standing \nhere today to think that is all behind us, that it is a distant memory. \nBut I fear that the detention provisions in this bill forget the \nlessons we learned from the mistakes we made when we interned thousands \nof innocent Japanese, Germans, and Italians or when we destroyed the \nlives of supposed Communist sympathizers with nary a shred of evidence \nof guilt.\n  In the weeks following September 11, the Justice Department made \nextraordinary use of its powers to arrest and detain individuals. We \narrested hundreds of people for alleged immigration violations and \ndozens more under a material witness statute. None of these individuals \nwere charged with a crime. All of this happened without the military \ndetention scheme envisioned in this bill. This was also a mistake and \none that should not be repeated.\n  But if we pass the Defense authorization bill with section 1031, \nCongress\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\nwill, according to the arguments that were made on the floor last week, \nfor the first time in 60 years, authorize the indefinite detention of \nU.S. citizens without charge or trial. This would be the first time \nCongress has deviated from President Nixon's Nondetention Act. What we \nare talking about is that Americans could be subjected to life \nimprisonment--think about that for just a moment--life imprisonment \nwithout ever being charged, tried, or convicted of a crime, without \never having an opportunity to prove your innocence to a judge and a \njury of your peers, and without the government ever having to prove \nyour guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I believe that denigrates the \nvery foundation of this country. It denigrates the Bill of Rights and \nwhat our Founders intended when they created a civilian, nonmilitary \njustice system for trying and punishing people for crimes committed on \nU.S. soil. Our Founders were fearful of the military, and they \npurposely created a system of checks and balances to ensure that we did \nnot become a country under military rule. If this bill passes, the \nSupreme Court should find these detention provisions unconstitutional.\n  Let's put that aside for now and focus on what we are currently doing \nright to fight terrorism. We are doing a heck of a lot of great things \nwhen it comes to national security. I think we actually need to \nremember that, and we need to remember that we are winning the fight \nagainst terrorists without trampling on our constitutional rights.\n  Just last May, under the tremendous leadership of President Obama and \nSecretary Panetta, head of the CIA, we hunted down and killed Osama bin \nLaden. A few days ago, the Washington Post reported that the al-Qaida \ncore has contracted and weakened since then, and its leadership ranks \nhave been reduced to two members. To be sure, that does not mean that \nal-Qaida is no longer a threat, particularly coming from groups outside \nthe core, but it is a remarkable achievement. Our current \ncounterterrorism strategy is not broken. Indeed, just the opposite is \ntrue. We are winning the war against al-Qaida. There is no indication--\nnone--that we need to fundamentally alter our approach to locating \nterrorists here or overseas.\n  Under Director Mueller's leadership, the FBI has turned itself inside \nout, and over the last 10 years, since September 11, it has become an \nintelligence-gathering counterterrorism machine. I can't say I have \nalways agreed with 100 percent of the FBI's tactics, and there are \ntimes when I worry they may be overstepping, but make no mistake, if \nour goal is hunting down the bad guys, the FBI knows what they are \ndoing. There is no reason to think we need to change course and create \nan entirely new system that would completely supplant the resources and \nexpertise of the FBI.\n  For those who would argue that we need to shift these people out of \nour civilian criminal justice system and away from article III courts \nand into a military system, I have to ask why. Where is the sign that \nwe have a problem that needs fixing? There is no reason to think we \nneed to create an entirely different framework for a problem we have \nbeen dealing with for centuries. This enemy is not so different that we \nneed to upend our criminal justice system.\n  I think this is a solution in search of a problem. There is no need \nto go down this path. We should be focused on doing what is best for \nthis Nation and what is best for protecting Americans. We should be \nworking together on this, not coming up with additional ways to divide \nand polarize this country. That is why, when the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the FBI \nexpress serious concerns about these provisions and when the \nPresident's top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, complains that \nthese provisions will make it even harder for them to locate and detain \nterrorists in the United States and overseas, we should probably listen \nto them.\n  Section 1031 runs the risk of authorizing the indefinite detention \nwithout trial of Americans. Section 1032 is unnecessary and complicates \nour counterterrorism policy. They are bad policy.\n  In short, these provisions should not be passed. They are not well-\nconsidered terrorism policy, and they would authorize poorly understood \nand deeply troubling policies. That is why I have put forward \namendments that would strike each of these two sections. That is why I \ncosponsored Senator Mark Udall's amendment, the cousin of our Presiding \nOfficer. That is why I cosponsored his amendment, and I would be happy \nto cosponsor amendments from our Presiding Officer as well, but that is \nwhy I cosponsored Senator Mark Udall's amendment that would have sent \nthese matters back to the administration and the relevant committees of \nCongress for the full consideration, discussion, and debate they \ndeserve. Our national security and our freedom require nothing less.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1125 and 1126\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I understand the procedure, it is \nnow appropriate for me to speak on my pending amendments. I will not \noffer my two amendments for a vote now, but I would like to take the \nopportunity to speak about them at this time. I trust that is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my continued \nopposition to the detention provisions in the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  I was on the Intelligence Committee prior to 9/11, and I have watched \nthe transition since that time. I have watched America--to use a \nphrase--get its act together, and I am proud of where this country \nstands at this time with the procedures, the interrogation techniques, \nthe custody issues, and the prosecutions that have been successful in \nthe last 10 years. In my judgment, this country is safer now than we \nwere before 9/11.\n  Before the recess, I laid out my views on why the detainee provisions \nin the Armed Services bill were detrimental to national security \nbecause they reduce the President's flexibility to make decisions on \nhow best to detain and potentially interrogate and prosecute suspected \nterrorists. Today, I would like to speak to the two amendments I have \nfiled, and I will describe them in a moment.\n  Let me also reference two letters in opposition to the detention \nprovisions in the underlying bill: one written to me from the Director \nof National Intelligence, James Clapper, and the second written \nyesterday to Chairman Levin from Bob Mueller, the Director of the FBI.\n  These letters are in addition to the Statement of Administrative \nPolicy, which includes a veto threat to the detention provisions and \nthe letter from the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, both of which \nwere inserted into the Record before the recess.\n  So I note that the provisions in the bill we are considering are \nopposed by the White House, by the Secretary of Defense, the Director \nof National Intelligence, and the Director of the FBI. These top \nnational security officials are all concerned that the bill reduces the \nadministration's flexibility to combat terrorism, both at home and \nabroad, and I would agree with that.\n  I will ask at the appropriate time for a vote on amendment No. 1125, \nwhich will limit mandatory military custody to terrorists captured \noutside the United States. This is a very simple amendment that only \nadds one word, ``abroad,'' to section 1032 of the underlying bill.\n  Currently, this bill creates a presumption that members or parts of \nal-Qaida or ``associated forces'' will be held in the military \ndetention system, and I disagree with that approach. I believe the \nPresident should have the flexibility to hold captured terrorists in \nthe military or the criminal justice systems, and the decision of which \nsystem to use should be made based on the individual facts and evidence \nof each case.\n  Putting aside that general view, I am very concerned that creating a \npresumption for military custody--which this bill does--and requiring a \ncumbersome waiver process will jeopardize counterterrorism cases and \nintelligence gathering. This concern is not\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nonly mine, it has been raised by the White House, by Secretary Panetta, \nand very directly by Director Mueller in his letter.\n  So my amendment would clarify the situation and remove the confusion \nand delay that I believe this bill will cause. My amendment will make \nclear that under section 1032 of this bill the U.S. Armed Forces are \nonly required to hold a suspected terrorist in military custody when \nthat individual is captured abroad. All that amendment does is add that \none word, ``abroad,'' to make clear that the military will not be \nroaming our streets looking for suspected terrorists. My amendment does \nnot remove the President's ability to use the option of military \ndetention or prosecution inside the United States.\n  My amendment makes clear that inside the United States there is no \npresumption for military custody. Inside the United States, a Customs \nagent or local law enforcement officer could follow his or her standard \nprocess and turn a suspected terrorist over to the FBI for handling \nwithout having to worry about whether a waiver may apply or whether it \nis required.\n  The FBI has changed. There are 56 field offices, there is a national \nsecurity branch, and it is staffed with thousands of agents inside the \nUnited States. The FBI is well equipped to handle a terrorist inside \nthe United States, but the Department of Defense is not. Listen to what \nDirector Mueller wrote. He notes, and I quote:\n\n       The legislation introduces a substantial element of \n     uncertainty as to what procedures are to be followed at \n     perhaps the most critical time in the development of an \n     investigation. . . .\n\n  Now, I understand that the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee have included a waiver and have required that the \nadministration issue procedures to lay out how the mandatory military \ncustody provision will be carried out. But the administration is \ntelling us, with a unanimous voice from all its senior counterterrorism \nofficials, that this provision is harmful and unnecessary. But we say \nCongress knows better. I don't believe we do know better, and I think \nnot to listen to those who are really responsible to carry out these \nmissions in what is a very difficult field today, based on a careful \nassessment of national security, is a mistake.\n  The administration has threatened to veto this bill and said it \n``strongly objects to the military custody provision of section 1032'' \nin its official Statement of Administration Policy because it would, \nand I quote, ``tie the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals.'' So here are the experts saying: Don't do this, it will \ntie our hands; and here is the political branch saying: We know better.\n  If something had gone wrong, if there had been mistakes, if there \nhadn't been over 400 cases tried successfully in civilian Federal \ncriminal courts in the last 10 years and 6 cases and a muffed history \nof military prosecution in these cases, I might agree. But the march is \non here in Congress: militarize this thing from stem to stern. And I \ndisagree with that. When something isn't broke, don't fix it.\n  Mr. President, there are rapid reaction teams part of the HIG--or \nHigh-Value Interrogation Group--who can deploy on a moment's notice, \nwho can rapidly assess a suspect, who can carry out a proper and \neffective interrogation, and the executive branch then has an \nopportunity to decide whether the facts and the evidence really are \nbest suited for a Federal criminal prosecution in Article III courts, \nor the facts and the evidence are really best suited for a military \ncommission prosecution.\n  This flexibility is what we are taking away from the executive branch \nunder the provisions in this bill. It was well practiced during the \nBush Presidency, and it has been well practiced by the Obama \nPresidency. Virtually every national security professional connected to \nthe handling of terrorists and the intelligence obtained from them says \nto change it would be a mistake. So I believe the amendment I am \noffering--limiting mandatory military custody to detainees outside the \nUnited States--is a major improvement to the underlying bill. It \nremoves the uncertainty that will occur if military custody is required \nfor detainees captured inside the United States.\n  Frankly, I would prefer that the provision--section 1032--be struck \nin its entirety, as I don't believe we should be creating a presumption \nof military custody over the law enforcement route. That is not what \nthis country is about. There is the posse comitatus law on the books. \nThe military isn't supposed be roaming the streets of the United \nStates. But if there is going to be this type of provision, it should \nat least do no harm to our ability to detain, interrogate, and \nprosecute terrorists. So I ask for my colleagues' support on this \namendment.\n\n  While I am on the Senate floor, I would like to speak briefly to the \nsecond amendment I have filed and on which I also seek a vote, since \nthe Udall amendment has failed; that is, amendment No. 1126, which \nwould prohibit U.S. citizens from being held in indefinite detention \nwithout trial or charge.\n  As Members know, section 1031 of the underlying bill updates and \nrestates the authorization for the use of military force that was \npassed on September 18, 2001, 10 years ago, 1 week after the attacks of \n9/11. The provision updates the authority to detain terrorists who seek \nto harm the United States, an authority that I believe is consistent \nwith the laws of armed conflict. However, I strongly believe that the \nU.S. Government should not have the ability to lock away its citizens \nfor years, and perhaps decades, without charging them and providing a \nheightened level of due process. We shouldn't pick up citizens and \nincarcerate them for 10 or 15 or 20 years or until hostilities end--and \nno one knows when they will end--without giving them due process of \nlaw.\n  So my amendment simply adds the following language to section 1031 of \nthe underlying bill:\n\n       The authority described in this section for the Armed \n     Forces of the United States to detain a person does not \n     include the authority to detain a citizen of the United \n     States without trial until the end of hostilities.\n\n  It is hard for me to understand how any Member of this body wouldn't \nvote for this amendment because, without it, Congress is essentially \nauthorizing the indefinite imprisonment of American citizens without \ncharge or trial.\n  As I said on the Senate floor previously, 40 years ago Congress \npassed the Non-Detention Act of 1971 that expressed the will of \nCongress and the President that America would never repeat the \nJapanese-American internment experience--something that I witnessed as \na child up close and personal--and would never subject any other \nAmerican to indefinite detention without charge or trial. In the 40 \nyears since President Richard Nixon signed the Non-Detention Act into \nlaw, Congress has never made an exception to it.\n  A key issue in this bill is that this is the Congress making an \nexplicit exception that has never been made before by the Congress, and \nwhat we are saying is, it is OK to detain an American citizen without \ntrial, ad infinitum. I don't think it is. I don't think that is what \nour Constitution is all about. Yet the provision in this bill would do \njust that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a column \npublished yesterday in the San Jose Mercury News of California from \nFloyd Mori.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From MercuryNews.com, Nov. 27, 2011]\n\n S. Floyd Mori: Internment Specter Raises Ugly Head in Forgetful U.S. \n                                 Senate\n\n                           (By S. Floyd Mori)\n\n       The oldest generation of Japanese-Americans, those whose \n     earliest memories were of their lives and families being \n     upended by internment without charge or trial in \n     concentration camps during World War II, at least take \n     comfort in the hope that America is now committed to never \n     inflicting that experience on any other group of Americans or \n     immigrants. But our trust in that commitment is being shaken \n     by a bill poised to go to the Senate floor that could once \n     again authorize indefinite detention without charge of \n     American citizens and others now living peacefully in our \n     country.\n       We have reason to believe in the commitment of Americans to \n     say never again to indefinite detention. In 1988, the Civil \n     Liberties Act officially declared that the Japanese-American \n     internment had been a ``grave injustice'' that had been \n     ``carried out without adequate security reasons.'' In other \n     words, the indefinite detention of Japanese-Americans during \n     World War II was not only wrong, but unnecessary.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n       A bill on the Senate floor raises the question of whether \n     the Senate has forgotten our history. S. 1253, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act, has a provision in it, \n     unfortunately drafted by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John \n     McCain, R-Ariz., that would let any U.S. president use the \n     military to arrest and imprison without charge or trial \n     anyone suspected of having any relationship with a terrorist \n     organization. Although Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and \n     more than a dozen of her colleagues are bravely calling for a \n     halt to a damaging bill, they face significant opposition.\n       The troubling provision, Section 1031, would let the \n     military lock up both Americans and noncitizens in the 50 \n     states. There would be no charges, no trial, no proof beyond \n     a reasonable doubt. All that would be required would be \n     suspicion.\n       Although the details of the indefinite detentions of \n     Japanese-Americans during World War II and the proposed \n     indefinite detentions of terrorism suspects may differ, the \n     principle remains the same: Indefinite detentions based on \n     fear-driven and unlawfully substantiated national security \n     grounds, where individuals are neither duly charged nor \n     fairly tried, violate the essence of U.S. law and the most \n     fundamental values upon which this country was built.\n       As the measures to indefinitely detain Japanese-Americans \n     during World War II have been deemed a colossal wrong, the \n     same should be true of modern indefinite detention of \n     terrorism suspects. Our criminal justice system is more than \n     equipped to ensure justice and security in terrorism cases, \n     and we certainly should not design new systems to resurrect \n     and codify tragic and illegitimate policies of the past.\n       As our history shows, acting on fear in these situations \n     can lead to unnecessary and unfruitful sacrifices of the most \n     basic of American values. In the 10 years since the 9/11 \n     attacks, Congress has shown admirable restraint in not \n     enacting indefinite detention without charge or trial \n     legislation. Now with the president seeking to end the \n     current wars, the Senate must avoid repeating the mistakes of \n     the past and protect American values before they are \n     compromised. We cannot let fear overshadow our commitment to \n     our most basic American values.\n       The Senate can show that it has not forgotten the lessons \n     of the Japanese-American internment. It should pass an \n     amendment that has been offered by Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., \n     that would remove Section 1031 from the act. This Senate \n     should not stain that great body by bringing to the floor any \n     detention provision that would surely be looked upon with \n     shame and regret by future generations.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I know Mr. Mori well. He is the national executive \ndirector of the Japanese American Citizens League, which is the oldest \nand largest Asian-American civil rights organization in the United \nStates. The Japanese American Citizens League--or JACL as we would \nsay--has been an active voice on the wrongful internment of Japanese \nAmericans during World War II, and I believe it is worth listening to \nwhat they have observed from that painful history.\n  The administration has threatened to veto this bill and said the \nfollowing in its official Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention \n     authority, Congress must be careful not to open a whole \n     series of legal questions that will distract from our efforts \n     to protect the country.\n\n  Yet by allowing the military to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely, \nCongress would be opening a great number of serious legal questions, in \nmy judgment.\n  This amendment would restore the language that was in an earlier \nversion of this bill that would have established a similar ban on the \nindefinite detention of U.S. citizens. It is also consistent with the \nway we have conducted the war on terror over the past 10 years. In \ncases where the United States has detained American citizens, including \nJohn Walker Lindh and Jose Padilla, they have eventually been \ntransitioned from indefinite detention to the criminal justice system, \nand both have been convicted and are serving long prison sentences. \nJohn Walker Lindh pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was given a \n20-year sentence, and Jose Padilla was convicted of terrorism \nconspiracy and sentenced to a 17-year prison sentence.\n  So I believe this amendment is consistent with past practice and with \ntraditional U.S. values of due process. We are not a nation that locks \nup its citizens without charge, prosecution, and conviction. My \namendment reflects that view, I believe in that view, and I hope this \nbody does as well. So I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I ask my colleagues' support on these \ntwo amendments because I believe they will improve the legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Mr. President. It is good to see the Senator \nin the chair.\n  I rise to speak on amendment No. 1145. I cannot call up this \namendment at this point in time, but hopefully at some time during this \ndebate we can deal with this issue of foreign base closures, which is \nwhat amendment No. 1145 does.\n  I have offered--along with my colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison--to establish an overseas basing commission. We are joined on \nthis amendment by Senators Conrad, Wyden, and Sanders.\n  This commission would be charged with saving taxpayer money by \nidentifying and reevaluating our overseas military base structure and \ninvestments. It is not a new discussion. This has been done before. In \nWashington, colleagues from both sides of the aisle have long advocated \nfor issues similar to this one.\n  In Montana, Senator Mike Mansfield--a personal hero of mine and one \nof the truest statesmen of this body--advocated fiercely throughout his \npublic service for a more commonsense approach to our overseas military \ncommitment. Senator Mansfield's approach balanced our national security \ninterests and decisions with decisions and investments that made sense \nfiscally. The time could not be more appropriate to renew this call. \nGiven our budget outlook, we have a responsibility to exhaustively look \nfor savings across our government. We need to be smart and we need to \nwork together.\n  It makes a lot of sense to me that cutting overseas military \nconstruction projects that have minimal negative impacts on our \nnational security and military readiness is the right idea. We know \nthere is a significant higher cost associated with maintaining \nfacilities and forces overseas, particularly in Europe, than here in \nthe United States. We also know we need a more complete picture of the \ncost, the benefits, and the savings associated with overseas basing as \nwe make tough budgetary decisions. Given our military's advanced \ncapabilities, it is time for some responsible decisions about how to \nbest secure our country while saving American taxpayers every penny we \npossibly can.\n  As Montana families examine their bottom line and as the country \nworks to cut spending, it is past time to give our outdated military \nbases and installations a closer look. An overseas basing commission \nwould independently address these issues firsthand and ensure that \nmilitary construction spending and operational maintenance spending \nmatch our capabilities and our national security strategy.\n  As we move forward, I hope we will do so in the spirit of Senator \nMansfield by working together and by making commonsense decisions that \nkeep us both safe and spend our taxpayer dollars more wisely.\n  As I said when I opened these remarks, I think this is a no-brainer. \nWe need to take a step back, look at the money we are spending on \noverseas bases, make sure we are getting the best bang for the buck and \nmake sure it meets our national security needs. With a lot of these \npost-World War II installations, they can be shut down, we can save \nsome money, and it is a win-win situation for everybody.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I was listening in the cloakroom to Senator \nTester's comments about his amendment, and I wish to tell everyone how\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nright on point he is. I am focusing on overseas bases and the need to \nclose some of those bases. We have another Defense bill coming up \nfairly soon, if we cannot get something done on this bill--and I hope \nwe can--whether it is the sense of the Senate or otherwise to put our \nfocus there, because we need to reduce our presence particularly in \nthose bases, I believe, in Europe, where we simply no longer need those \nbases and cannot afford to maintain them. But whether we can get a \ncommission done is a different issue because that could actually slow \ndown the process, to appoint a BRAC-type commission.\n  I just wished to comment while he was still on the floor that I \nbelieve he is right. He is focused on that which is critically \nimportant for not just the Armed Services Committee but for this Senate \nto look at, which is to look at the huge number of overseas facilities \nwe have and the fact that there are many we no longer need and we have \nto look there for some significant savings. I just wished to commend \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin for his comments. \nAs we look for opportunities to save money, as we look for \nopportunities to focus in on the war on terror, I think our time has \ncome to take a hard look at our overseas basing and do what, quite \nfrankly, will enhance our opportunities to fight the war on terror \nwhile saving the taxpayers dollars over the short term and the long \nhaul.\n  I thank Chairman Levin for his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate as if in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     National Labor Relations Board\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate for the \nfifth time in the last 3 years to discuss this administration's \nrelentless pursuit to modify and change the labor laws of this country \nthat have served us well for in excess of 70 years. A particular \ninstance that is going to take place tomorrow causes me to come one \nmore time to discuss this subject.\n  A few days before Thanksgiving last week, the National Labor \nRelations Board posted a notice that they would meet at 10 a.m. on \nWednesday morning to discuss passing a rule that will change a 75-year \nprecedent in labor law, a rule that will reduce the time period between \nthe filing of a petition for a union organization and a vote to as \nlittle as 10 days.\n  Historically, in our country, it has been an average of 38 days from \nthe filing of the petition to the vote as to whether to organize. For \nno cause or reason, other than unleveling the playing field, NLRB has \ndecided to rush this rule through in an ambush-type of event. If we \npull the facts back and look, it is quite easy to see what they are \ntrying to do.\n  Craig Becker, who is on the National Labor Relations Board as a \nrecess appointment of the President of the United States, was denied \napproval in the confirmation process in the Senate. The President chose \nto appoint him in a recess appointment which expires at the end of this \nDecember. Therefore, in the waning hours of his service on the Board, \nat a time in which the majority has a 2-to-1 vote, they are going to \nrush through a change in an amendment to the labor laws in the United \nStates of America that have served us for 70 years. It is not right. It \nis not fair. At a time of high unemployment and distress in our \neconomy, the worst thing to do is change the rules of the game that \nhave served the country so well.\n\n  I will fire a warning shot also. I think there is something else that \nwill probably happen before the end of the year, and that is there will \nprobably be a posting of a rule to make microunionization possible. It \nhas already been discussed by the NLRB. It is a process whereby we \ncould take separate departments in the same company and let them \nunionize one at a time. Take a Home Depot, for example, or a Kroger \ngrocery store. Let the butchers unionize and then let the bakers \nunionize and then let the detergent salesmen unionize and then let the \njanitors unionize and let the shop end up having 15, 20, 25 different \nunion organizations in the same store. That has never been able to be \npossible and it is not right. It should be across the board within the \ncompany.\n  So I come to the floor to let everybody know at NLRB that I know what \nis going to happen tomorrow morning. I know it is a rush to judgment \nand it is a bad judgment and it is a mistake. We have great labor laws \nin this country. In fact, if we take this petition and change it down \nto 10 days, we are not recognizing the fact that of all the elections \nthat have taken place in the last couple years, the unions have won 67 \npercent of the time. There is no problem with the organization laws, \nand there is no reason to compress the time from the filing of the \npetition to the vote. Fair is fair. A company that has an organization \npetition filed against it ought to have a reasonable period of time to \nassess the grievances that are advertised against them rather than \ncompressing the vote period and having a rush to judgment.\n  I hope tomorrow the NLRB will recognize that a rush to judgment is \nwrong. It is not good for the country, it is not good for our economy, \nand it is not good for the American people. I will oppose it and do \noppose it today, as I will oppose microunionization should they attempt \nto do the same before this year is out.\n  I yield back my time and notice the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, with the chairman's permission, \nI would like to speak on the Defense bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Levin. I wish to thank \nSenator McCain. I wish to thank the entire Armed Services Committee and \nall the dedicated staff for their efforts in crafting this National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  I am going to continue to work with all of my colleagues to resolve \nsome of the very challenging provisions, one of which we just voted on, \nhaving to do with what courts the detainees are going to be prosecuted \nin. I am hopeful compromises will be reached in the days ahead so this \nbill can be passed and signed into law.\n  There are five amendments I and others have offered that I wish to \ntalk about. The first is amendment No. 1210. It has been crafted in \nconsultation with the Government Accountability Office and it would \nrequire the Department of the Navy to evaluate the cost and benefits of \nstationing additional destroyers at Naval Station Mayport in \nJacksonville, Fl. One may ask why.\n  Well, the frigates at Mayport that will all be decommissioned by \n2015, but the ships that will replace them, the Littoral combat ships, \nwill not arrive until 2016. Therefore, there is a hiatus of a year in \nwhich the ship repair industry, that was built up to take care of the \nNavy's fleet, will be without work. From the standpoint of keeping the \nmaintenance and repair of the Navy's fleet, we need to determine if it \nwill be more cost effective for the Navy to mitigate this problem by \nbringing additional destroyers to Mayport during that timeframe, \nextending the service lives of the existing frigates, or by boosting \nthe industry by bringing ships from around the country to the \nJacksonville ship repair industry for repair.\n  Doing nothing is not an option because the ship repair business would \ntake too big of a hit. In order to provide some oversight of the Navy's \nmethodology, so that we can get the greatest bang for the buck and keep \nthe Navy fleet at the level of readiness it needs, I am asking for the \nGAO to assess and report independently on these measures. My colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Rubio, has joined as a cosponsor.\n  I urge support of this amendment. It should not be a controversial \namendment. I hope the committee will be able to accept it.\n  I have also proposed amendment No. 1236, which requires the \nDepartment of the Air Force to further explain their plan to change the \nflag officer positions at the Air Force Materiel Command. Reducing \noversight and eliminating officers with vital experience\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\ncould damage the Air Force's weapons testing mission. So this amendment \nsimply requires the Air Force to submit a report which would be \nassessed by the GAO. Again, this should not be a controversial \namendment and ought to be accepted by the committee.\n  Senator Schumer of New York and I are working to ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Department continue to \nstudy and evaluate the harmful effects of the garbage burn pits at our \nbase in Balad in Iraq. This has gotten some attention in the press. It \nis horrible. What we are seeing is when our troops are exposed to these \ntoxic fumes from these open burn pits, we see the consequences in their \nhealth that turn up later. Obviously, it is not only a diminution of \nthe health of our troops which we ought to first and foremost protect, \nbut of course there is a continuing cost to the U.S. Government, \nbecause years later, what we are finding is--and this comes out of the \nfirst gulf war experience with those open burn pits--we have determined \nthat serious health problems could be traced back to the breathing in \nof those toxic substances because the troops were exposed to the fumes \ncoming out of those burn pits.\n  What this amendment does--and it should not be controversial--is it \nrequires a study be designed to take a look at those burn pits and \nfurther focus on the serious medical effects on our troops. So far, the \nreports have been inconclusive, but troops are still getting sick and \nit needs to be understood; thus, the reason for that study. Next year \nwe will work to have the actual study funded. But Senator Schumer and I \nwant to get on with this study and we ask and it should be accepted by \nthe committee as a noncontroversial amendment. After all, it is what we \nall want, the protection of our troops.\n  Let me talk about amendment No. 1209. This addresses the longstanding \nproblem faced by relatives of those who have been killed in action or \nwhose death is related to service in the military, and that is the \ncurrent law of a dollar-for-dollar reduction of Department of Defense \nSurvivor Benefit Plan annuity offset, dollar for dollar, by the \nDependency and Indemnity Compensation which comes from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. The stand-alone bill, S. 260, filed by Senator \nInhofe and myself, is cosponsored by--get this--49 Senators. The Senate \nhas supported eliminating this offset for years. I hope that in the \nSenate, on this Defense authorization bill, we are going to remain \nsteadfast in support of military widows and family members. Why? \nBecause the Survivor Benefit Plan is an optional program for military \nretirees offered by the Defense Department. It is like an insurance \nplan. Military retirees pay premiums out of their retirement pay to \nensure that their survivors will have adequate support when that \nretired military person passes away. For many retirees, reasonably \npriced insurance from the public marketplace is not available due to \ntheir service-related disabilities and their health issues; thus, the \nreason for this insurance plan, the Survivors Benefit Plan. SBP is a \nway for retirees to provide some income insurance for their survivors. \nIt pays survivors 55 percent of the servicemember's retired pay. That \nis for the survivors of the retired military person when that person \ndies. It is an insurance policy.\n  The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation--DIC--is a completely \ndifferent survivor benefit and it is administered by the Veterans' \nAdministration. When a servicemember dies, either due to a service-\nrelated disability or illness or active-duty death, surviving spouses \nare entitled to monthly compensation of $1,154 from the Veterans' \nAdministration. But here is the rub:\n  Of the 270,000 survivors receiving the SBP--the insurance policy that \nthe military retiree has paid for--about 54,000 are subject to the \noffset, meaning some of their SBP is taken away. According to the \nDefense Actuary, 31,000 survivors' SBP is completely offset by the VA's \nDependency and Indemnity Compensation, meaning they only have $1,154 a \nmonth to live on. These survivors are entitled to both under two \ndifferent laws, but then there is a law that says you have to offset \none from the other.\n  Military retirees in good faith bought into the insurance plan--the \nSBP. They were planning for the future for their families. The \ngovernment now says we are going to take some of that money away. What \nit means is we are not taking care of those who were left behind in the \nsame manner as these servicemembers thought they were going to get when \nthey took care of our country. I know of no purchased annuity plan that \nwould deny payout based on receipt of a different benefit. I say that \nhaving had some experience in insurance in my former life years and \nyears ago as the elected insurance commissioner of the State of \nFlorida.\n  It was said best by President Lincoln when he said in his second \ninaugural address that one of the greatest obligations in war is to \n``finish the work we are in; to bind up the Nation's wounds; to care \nfor him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his \norphan.''\n  That is the whole intention of these two laws, but we are not doing \nit. We are not honoring our servicemembers. The government must take \ncare of our veterans, their widows and their orphans. Almost every year \nin the Senate we have passed this, eliminating the offset. What happens \nis it goes down to the conference and they eliminate it because it is \ngoing to cost money. We have had a couple of times where important \nlittle steps were taken in the right direction with some lessening of \nthe offset, but we must meet our obligations to military families with \nthe same sense of honor their loved one rendered during their service \nto this country, so we must eliminate this offset.\n  Finally, there is an amendment to sanction the Central Bank of \nIran. In just the previous 2 months, Iran has attempted a terrorist \nattack on U.S. soil, while continuing to develop its nuclear capability \nback home, and it has done so in complete disregard for the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\n\n  The United States has led the international community in enacting \ncrippling sanctions against the Iranian regime. We need to tighten down \nthe screws more. We have done so in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act \nand again in 2009 with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability \nand Divestment Act.\n  So we must continue these efforts. By sanctioning the Central Bank of \nIran, we will make it clear to Iran's religious leaders--and that is \nwhat we have to say--that there are real consequences to their support \nfor terrorism and their attempts to develop nuclear weapons.\n  A nuclear Iran would be disastrous for the region. It would be \ndisastrous for Europe. It clearly would be a threat against Israel, one \nof our strongest allies, and it clearly is a threat to the national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  The cost of inaction is too great. That is why we ought to go after \nthe Central Bank of Iran by sanctioning them.\n  I think I have offered a number of amendments along with and on \nbehalf of our colleagues that should be able to be accepted, and I \nwould implore the leadership of the committee to please consider these.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, with the acceptance of this unanimous \nconsent request, the Levin-McCain amendment, as modified, has now been \nagreed to; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So now before us is the Paul amendment No. 1064, with 30 \nminutes of debate. I do not see Senator Paul in the Chamber.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus be added as a cosponsor \nto our Levin-McCain amendment No. 1092.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1092, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, until Senator Paul gets here to begin \ndebate on his amendment, I would, very briefly, describe what we have \ndescribed before, which is the anticounterfeiting amendment, which is \nso important to stop the flow of counterfeit parts into the Department \nof Defense supply chain.\n  The amendment is going to do a number of things. It is going to \nrequire the Department of Defense and Department of Defense suppliers \nto purchase electronic parts from original equipment manufacturers and \ntheir authorized dealers or from trusted suppliers that meet \nestablished standards for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts.\n  It establishes requirements for notification, inspection, testing, \nand authentication of electronic parts that are not available from such \nsuppliers.\n  It requires Department of Defense officials and Department of Defense \ncontractors that become aware of counterfeit parts in the supply chain \nto provide written notification to the DOD inspector general, the \ncontracting officer, and the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program \nor similar program designated by the Secretary of Defense.\n  It requires enhanced inspection of electronic components imported \nfrom countries that have been the source of counterfeit parts in the \nDOD supply chain--China being the one that is clearly the worst \noffender in this regard.\n  It requires large DOD contractors to establish systems for detecting \nand avoiding counterfeit parts in their supply chains and authorizes \nreduction of contract payments to contractors that fail to develop \nadequate systems.\n  It requires the Department of Defense to adopt policies and \nprocedures for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts in its own \ndirect purchases and for assessing and acting upon reports of \ncounterfeit parts from DOD officials and DOD contractors.\n  It authorizes the suspension and debarment of contractors that \nrepeatedly fail to detect and avoid counterfeit parts or otherwise fail \nto exercise due diligence in the detection and avoidance of counterfeit \nparts.\n  The amendment also includes a bill Senator Whitehouse introduced that \nwas passed out of the Judiciary Committee to toughen criminal sentences \nfor counterfeiting military goods or services.\n  Finally, it requires the Department of Defense to define the term \n``counterfeit part,'' which is a critical, long overdue step toward \ngetting a handle on this problem.\n  I wish to thank Senator McCain, who, with me, held a significant \nhearing in the area of counterfeit parts, demonstrating that what is \ngoing on is that electronic waste--which is shipped from the United \nStates and the rest of the world, mainly to China--is then disassembled \nby hand, washed in dirty rivers, dried on city sidewalks, sanded down \nto remove part numbers and other marks that would indicate its quality \nor performance.\n  We have millions, literally, that we have identified of used parts \nthat have gotten into the Defense supply chain that are not supposed to \nbe used parts,\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nthat are supposed to be new parts. It is amazing how far the \ncounterfeiters--and particularly in China--are willing to go.\n  We have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the GAO \nactually, to use a fake company to go online and buy electronic parts, \nand the GAO found suppliers that not only sold counterfeit parts--when \nthe GAO sought legitimate parts--they found suppliers that were willing \nto sell them parts with nonexistent part numbers. All those sellers \nwere in China.\n  We had example after example of weapons systems that had counterfeit \nparts in them. They endanger our troops. They endanger our taxpayers. \nAll too often the people who pay for the replacement of counterfeit \nparts are the taxpayers instead of the contractors. That is going to \nend under our bill. So all the weapons we identified--lasers that were \nused for targeting Hellfire missiles; display units that were used in \nthe Air Force's aircraft, the C-27Js, C-130Js, C-17s, CH-46s used by \nthe Marine Corps--those counterfeit parts have gotten into those \nsystems. We are going to put an end to this with this legislation.\n  I thank my good friend Senator McCain for all the work he and his \nstaff and my staff put in on that hearing in preparing this amendment, \nwhich we have now adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin and the staff for \nthe thorough job of investigation that was undertaken to identify the \ncounterfeit electronic parts that are penetrating the Department of \nDefense supply chain.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for his provisions which have been added \nto the bill from a bill he had introduced in the Judiciary Committee.\n  At the hearing we had on November 8, the committee received \nadditional evidence to supplement an already robust investigative \nrecord, and some very serious issues were raised, including the threat \ncounterfeit electronic parts pose to the safety of our men and women in \nuniform, to our national security, and to our economy, how counterfeits \nincrease the short- and long-term costs of defense systems, the lack of \ntransparency in the Defense supply chain, and the U.S. relationship \nwith the People's Republic of China.\n  I see the Senator from Kentucky is on the floor. But I would just \nlike to point out again and emphasize the points the chairman has made.\n  The problem of counterfeit electronic parts in the Defense supply \nchain is more serious than most people realize. During its \ninvestigation, our committee uncovered over 1,800 incidents, totaling \nover 1 million parts of counterfeit electronic parts in the Defense \nsupply chain. Suspect counterfeit electronic parts have been installed \nor delivered to the military for use on thermal weapons sites, on THAAD \nmissile mission computers, and on military aircraft, including the C-\n27J, C-17, C-130J, P-8A Poseidon, SH-60B, AH-64, and the CH-46.\n  I do not claim this legislation will solve the problem of \ncounterfeiting from China, the whole issue of intellectual property. \nCounterfeiting that goes on in other aspects of the world's economy and \nours is one that is a very large issue. But at least this is an effort \nto make sure, as much as we can, that the men and women who serve in \nour military are not subject to operating systems that could literally \nendanger their lives--much less the incredible increase of the \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n\n  I thank the chairman again and his staff, and I can assure my \ncolleagues this is an issue we will be following very closely in the \ndays and weeks and months ahead.\n  I note the presence of Senator Paul, so I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1064\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 30 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on amendment No. 1064.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky would just yield for \n30 seconds, not to be taken from his time, so I can answer a question \nthat has been asked of me: What happened to the approximately 35 to 40 \namendments which we had cleared? Why were they not part of this \nunanimous consent request?\n  The answer is because there are a few Senators, apparently, who do \nnot object to the substance of the amendments but who have other goals \nthey are, at the moment, insisting on. That puts in jeopardy the effort \nof literally dozens of our colleagues to achieve what is in these \ncleared amendments, and I hope those few Senators would relent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1064\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in support of bringing the Iraq war \nto a formal end. President Obama has ordered troops home by January 1. \nWe should rejoice at the conclusion of the war. No matter whether one \nfavored the Iraq war or not, there is a glimmer of hope for democracy \nto now exist in the Middle East in Iraq.\n  War is a hellish business and never to be desired. As the famous POW \nand war hero John McCain once said: ``War is wretched beyond \ndescription, and only a fool or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel \nreality.''\n  This vote is more than symbolism. This vote is about the separation \nof powers. It is about whether Congress should have the power to \ndeclare war. The Constitution vested that power in Congress, and it was \nvery important. Our Founding Fathers did not want all the power to \ngravitate to the Executive. They feared very much a King, and so they \nlimited the power of the Executive.\n  When Franklin walked out of the Constitutional Convention, a woman \nasked him: What have you brought us? Was it going to be a republic, a \ndemocracy, a monarchy?\n  He said: A republic, if you can keep it.\n  In order to keep a republic, we have to have checks and balances. But \nwe have to obey the rule of law.\n  Madison wrote:\n\n       The Constitution supposes, what the History of all \n     Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of \n     power most interested in war, and most prone to it. The \n     Constitution has, therefore, with studied care, vested the \n     [power] to declare war in [Congress].\n\n  When we authorize the war in Iraq, we give the President the power to \ngo to war, and the Constitution gives the power to the President to \nexecute the war. All the infinite decisions that are made in war--most \nof them are made by the executive branch. But the power to declare war \nis Congress's. This division was given to make there be a division of \npowers, a separation of powers, to allow there to be a reluctance to go \nto war.\n  We have this vote now to try to reclaim the authority.\n  If we do not reclaim the authority to declare war or to authorize \nwar, it will mean our kids or our grandkids or our great-grandkids \ncould be sent to a war in Iraq with no debate, with no vote of \nCongress. We have been at war for nearly 10 years in Iraq. We are \ncoming home. And we should rejoice at the war's end. But we need to \nreclaim that authority. If we leave an open-ended authority out there \nthat says to the President--or any President; not this particular \nPresident, it could be any President--if we leave that authority out \nthere, we basically abdicate our duty, we abdicate the role of \nCongress. There are supposed to be checks and balances between Congress \nand the President.\n  So what I am asking is that Congress today reclaim the authority to \ndeclare war and at the same time we celebrate that this is an end to \nsomething that no one should desire.\n  As Senator McCain has pointed out, as many have pointed out, Dwight \nEisenhower pointed out the same thing: If you want to know the hellish \nof war, talk to someone who has been to war.\n  But that is why this power is too important to be given to one person \nand to be left in the hands of one person--a President of either party.\n  So the vote today will be about reclaiming that authority, reclaiming \nthe authority of Congress to declare war. I would recommend that we \nhave a vote and that the vote today be in favor of deauthorizing the \nwar in Iraq.\n  It is not just I who have pointed this out. The first President of \nthe United States wrote:\n\n       The Constitution vests the power of declaring war in \n     Congress; therefore, no offensive expedition of importance \n     can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated \n     upon the subject and authorized such a measure.\n\n  This has been recognized by Presidents from the beginning of the \nhistory\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nof our country. The problem is that if we do not give it up, that power \nis left out there, and it is a power lost to Congress.\n  Frank Chodorov wrote:\n\n       All wars come to an end, at least temporarily. But the \n     authority acquired by the states hangs on; political power \n     never abdicates.\n\n  This is a time to reclaim that power. It is an important \nconstitutional question. I hope those Senators will consider this \nseriously and consider a vote to reclaim the authority to declare war.\n  I reserve the reminder of my time and temporarily yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to first of all thank the \nSenator from Kentucky for quoting me. It is always a very pleasant \nexperience as long as it is something that one would admire. On several \noccasions, I have been quoted in ways that I wish I had observed what \nmy old friend Congressman Morris Udall used to say is the politician's \nprayer: May the words that I utter today be tender and sweet because \ntomorrow I may have to eat them. So I want to thank the Senator from \nKentucky for his kind words.\n  I also want to praise the Senator from Kentucky, who is a person who \nhas come here with a firm conviction that he not only has principles \nbut he intends to act on those principles in as impactful a way as \npossible and represent the people of Kentucky in a very activist \nfashion. He has my admiration. However, I would rise in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  I would like to read from a letter that was sent to the chairman and \nto me from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary \nof Defense.\n\n       This week, as you consider the National Defense \n     Authorization Act, the Department of Defense would like to \n     respond to your request for views on the amendment offered by \n     Senator Paul which would repeal the Authorization for the Use \n     of Military Force in Iraq. U.S. Forces are now in the final \n     stages of coming home by the end of 2011. We are moving to a \n     new phase in the relationship between our two countries and \n     equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual \n     respect.\n       While amendment No. 1064 echoes the President's policy, we \n     cannot support the amendment as drafted. Outright and \n     complete repeal of the AUMF-I, which is the Authorization for \n     the Use of Military Force in Iraq, withdraws all \n     Congressional support for any limited windup activities \n     normally associated with ending a war. Thank you very much \n     for your continued efforts.\n\n  The Department of Defense sent over an unclassified response that was \napproved by several members of the Pentagon. It says: Although we are \nimplementing the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement in full and pulling out \nall of our forces by the end of the year, we still have a limited \nnumber of DOD personnel under the Chief of Mission Authority to staff \nthe Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq. Because there may be elements \nthat would choose this time of transition to attempt to do harm to \nthese personnel, it is essential that the Department of Defense retain \nthe authority and flexibility to respond to such threats. The AUMF-I \nprovides these authorities. The administration has worked closely with \nCongress in circumstances where it has been necessary to rely on the \nAUMF, and it would continue to do so should the need arise.\n  In other words, and unfortunately, Iraq remains a dangerous place. We \nwill have the largest contingent of Americans as part of the embassy \nthere as we withdraw our combat troops. Some 16,000 Americans will man \nour embassy and consulates in Iraq, and unfortunately there are great \nsigns of instability in Iraq. Al-Sadr has said that any remaining \nAmerican troops will be a target. The Iranians continue to encourage \nattacks on Americans. There are significant divisions within the \ncountry which are beginning to widen, such as Sunni-Shia, the area \naround Kirkuk, increasing Iranian influence in the country.\n  I will refrain from addressing the deep concerns I had before the \nagreement to completely withdraw took place. I will leave that out of \nthis discussion because I feel the decision that was clearly made not \nto keep a residual force in the country, which was made by this \nadministration and which is the subject for debate on another day, has \nplaced the remaining Americans in significant jeopardy. As I say, that \nis 16,000 Americans to carry out the postwar commitments we have made \nto Iraq to help them rebuild their country after many years of war and \nbloodshed.\n  I certainly understand the aim of the Senator from Kentucky. The \nPresident campaigned for President of the United States committing to \nwithdraw all of our troops from Iraq. He is now achieving that goal. \nBut I think it would be very serious to revoke all authority that we \nmight have in order to respond to possible unrest and disruption within \nthe country that might require the presence, at least on some level or \nanother, of American troops to safeguard those 16,000 Americans who \nwill be remaining in Iraq when our troops withdraw. So I argue that the \namendment be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I, too, will oppose the Paul amendment for \nthe repeal of the authorization for the use of military force in Iraq \nfor a number of reasons, but I think mainly there are just too many \nunknown, uncertain consequences of repealing this authority, including \nthe need to protect our troops. I am unwilling to take this risk during \nthe critical transition period and not knowing precisely what will \nhappen after that transition either.\n  By the way, I take this position as someone who opposed the use of \nmilitary force in Iraq to begin with. Back in October 2002 when \nCongress voted on the authorization to use military force in Iraq, I \ndid not support it. I thought it was a mistake to do that and offered \nan alternative resolution that would have authorized the use of force \nif the United Nations Security Council supported that use of force. So \nI take a position here opposing the repeal of the authorization \nalthough I opposed the authorization itself in the first instance. It \nis an unusual position to be in. I want to explain why it is that I \noppose the repeal of this authorization.\n  First, the drawdown appears to be on track to be completed by \nDecember 31, but there can always be unforeseen circumstances that \ncould delay that date. There is no provision in this bill for the \npossibility of an extension or a modification of that date. I would be \nreluctant to see it modified or extended. I must say that I do not want \nto preclude the possibility by ending something in advance--ending an \nauthorization in advance of circumstances arising that might require \nfor days, weeks, months the extension or modification of the current \ndecision to withdraw our forces by December 31.\n  Second, we simply do not know the consequences of repealing the \nauthorization. Let me give a few examples. What about ongoing lawsuits \nin U.S. courts arising from actions by U.S. personnel that were \nauthorized under this authorization for the use of military force? \nWould repeal of the authorization for the use of force have an effect? \nIt is unknown to me. I don't know how many lawsuits there are. But what \nis the impact on this? That is something which surely we should want to \nknow.\n  By the way, we authorized the use of force in the first gulf war. We \ndid not repeal that authorization. Technically, that authorization \ncontinues. It has done no harm that I can see.\n  Third, the Paul amendment raises issues for our detention authority \nin Iraq. This is not an abstract concern. Currently, the administration \nis in the process of deciding how to deal with one high-value detainee \nin U.S. custody whose name is Ali Mussa Daqduq. He is suspected of \nhaving organized a 2007 kidnapping in Iraq that resulted in the deaths \nof five U.S. servicemembers. He is also tied to Hezbollah.\n  The United States is relying on the authority of the AUMF--the \nauthorization for the use of military force in Iraq--to continue to \ndetain Daqduq. U.S. officials are still in discussions with the \nGovernment of Iraq over the ultimate disposition of Daqduq, including \npossibly releasing him to U.S. custody either in Iraq or somewhere \nelse.\n  Repeal of the AUMF could limit the administration's options for \ndealing with Daqduq after January of 2012. Would it limit those \noptions? We don't know.\n  Should we pass something as dramatic as a repeal of an authorization \nat this time without knowing what the consequences are in the real \nworld to our interests? I don't think we can\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\ntake that chance, so I would oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to rise in support of the \nstatements made by Senators McCain and Levin.\n  I do not have that good a feeling about Iraq, quite frankly. I am not \nvery confident at all that the worst is behind us. I am hopeful that we \ncan withdraw our troops and that nothing bad will happen in Iraq, but, \nas Senator Levin just described, the implications of repealing the \nauthorization to use military force are wide, varied, and uncertain.\n  What do you get by repealing this? You can go back home and say you \ndid something that--I do not know what you get. I mean, I really do \nnot. I do not know what we gain as a nation by taking the contingencies \nof using military force off the table as we try to wind down.\n  I just don't see the upside, quite frankly. I know the reality of \nwhat our troops face and why the Department of Defense would want to \ncontinue to have this authorization until we get Iraq behind us. At the \nend of the day, 4,400 people plus have lost their lives, thousands have \nbeen wounded and maimed--not counting the Iraqis who have lost their \nlives and have been wounded and maimed trying to create order out of \nchaos.\n  As we move forward as a body, I don't see the upside to those who are \ndoing the fighting and who have to deal with complications of this \nlong, protracted war by us repealing the authorization at a time when \nit may be necessary to have it in place. If there is any doubt in your \nmind about what Senators Levin and McCain say and what the Department \nof Defense says about the need for this to be continued, I ask you to \ngive the benefit of the doubt to the DOD. You don't have to; I just \nthink it is a wise thing to do because what we gain by repealing it--I \nam not sure what that is in any real sense.\n  By having the authorization in place for a while longer, I understand \nhow that could help those who are fighting in Iraq and the follow-on \nneeds that come as we transition. I ask the body to be cautious, and if \nyou have any doubt that Senator McCain's or Senator Levin's concerns \nare real, I think now is the time to defer to the Department of Defense \nand give them the tools they need to finish the operations in Iraq.\n  I will close with this one thought. The vacuum created by the fact \nthat we will not have any troops in 2012 can be filled in a very bad \nway if we don't watch it. The Kurd-Arab problem could wind up in open \nwarfare. The Iranian influence in Iraq is growing as we speak. We do \nhave troops and civilian personnel in the country, and we will have a \nlot next year. I think out of an abundance of caution we ought to leave \nthe tools in place that the Department of Defense says they need to \nfinish this out.\n  I urge my colleagues to err on the side of giving the Department of \nDefense the authorization they need to protect those who will be left \nbehind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. It disappoints me that President Obama opposes a formal end \nto the Iraq war, but it doesn't surprise me. As a candidate, he was \noutspoken against the war and for ending the war: He will be bringing \nthe troops home. But this vote in this debate is not necessarily just \nabout bringing the troops home. This is a debate over power. The \nexecutive branch wants to keep the unlimited power to commit troops to \nwar. This is about who holds the power.\n  The Founding Fathers intended that Congress should hold the power. \nThis vote is about whether we will continue to abdicate that power and \ngive up that power to the Executive. That allows for no checks and \nbalances. We need to have checks and balances. It is what our Founding \nFathers intended.\n  With regard to defending ourselves, there is authorization for the \nPresident to always defend the Nation using force. There is \nauthorization for every embassy around the world to defend the embassy. \nThat is why we have soldiers there. We have agreements with the host \ncountry that the host military is supposed to support the embassy. If \nthat fails, we have our own soldiers. We have these agreements around \nthe world. There is nothing that says we cannot use force. This says we \nare reclaiming the power to declare war, and we will not have another \nwar with hundreds of thousands of troops without a debate. Should not \nthe public and Congress debate it before we commit troops to war?\n  This war is coming to a close. I suggest that we should be proud of \nit. I hope people will support this amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Paul's \namendment to revoke war authority. We have heard on the floor that the \nconsequences of revoking authority are vague and uncertain. Indeed, my \nteam has been seeking a reply from the Department of Defense as to \nwhether there were any conditions we should be alerted to or whether \nthis would create a problem. At the last minute, we appear to have a \nmemo--which has not come to my office--that says there are possible \ncomplications.\n  Well, let's be clear. The executive branch never wants to hand back \nauthority it has been granted. It always wants to retain maximum \nflexibility. But as my colleague has pointed out, this is an issue of \nconstitutional authority. We had a constitutional discussion about \nauthorizing action in Iraq and, certainly contrary to my opinion, this \nbody supported that action. But now the President is bringing this war \nto an end.\n  Doesn't it make sense, then, that we end the authority that went with \nthis war and call a formal end to this battle? The issue has been \nraised that there might be something that happens in the future. Isn't \nthat true for every country on this planet, that something might happen \nin the future? Something might happen in Somalia or in Yemen or in any \nnation in the world. Indeed, under the War Powers Act, the President \nhas the ability to respond immediately. He doesn't need to come to this \nbody for 60 days. So there is extensive flexibility that would go with \nIraq just as it goes with every other country, in addition to the \nauthority that has been granted to pursue al-Qaida and associated \nforces around the world.\n  When, if not now, should we revoke this authority? Do we say that \nonce granted, at any point in the future the administration can go back \nto war without the authorization of this body? It is time for us to \nreclaim the authority of Congress. Should the circumstances arise that \nthe President feels the need to go back into a war mode versus many of \nthe other uses of force that are already authorized under other \nprovisions, then he would have 60 days. He could come back to this body \nand say: These are the changed circumstances. Under the Constitution, \nwill you grant the power to renew or create a new force of war in that \ncountry? Then we can hold that debate in a responsible manner.\n  But this open-ended commitment under these circumstances doesn't make \nsense. Congress has yielded its authority under the Constitution far \ntoo often to the executive branch. So many times this body has failed \nto do its fair share under our constitutional framework.\n  This amendment before us today makes sense in the context of a \nwithdrawal of troops and provides plenty of flexibility to undertake \nany security issues that might arise in the future. For that reason, I \nurge my colleagues to support the Paul amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, is it appropriate to call for the yeas and \nnays at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. I will yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, under the previous order, I think we \nwere going to debate both amendments and\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\nvote in a few moments. That is what I understood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How long will the Senator take?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All right.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1115, as Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senators have done such a good job managing this \nbill. I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment and to be \npaired with this important amendment that the Senators from Kentucky \nand Oregon have offered. I will explain it briefly because a longer \nexplanation would not be necessary.\n  This body is very familiar with the reauthorization of the SBIR \nProgram. The reason I believe the chairman and ranking member allowed \nme to offer this amendment with Senator Snowe is twofold. One, it has a \nbearing on the Department of Defense in that the Department of Defense \nis the largest contributor to the SBIR and STTR programs, the two most \nimportant research and development programs for small business that the \nFederal Government runs and operates. The Senators know full well the \nimportance for the Department of Defense and therefore extrapolate \ncorrectly the importance of this program for all of our agencies.\n  We take a small portion of the research and development dollars for \nall Federal agencies and basically direct it to small business. There \nare some good reasons for that, which I will put in the Record. As \nwritten by one of the advocates supporting the program--and I will put \nthis into the Record--she writes:\n\n       The SBIR/STTR funding award process spawns competition \n     among high-tech businesses. Scientists and engineers propose \n     their best technological concepts to solve a problem of \n     national interest. The best of the best of these technical \n     concepts are selected for funding. Thus, this funding \n     mechanism assures that the thinking minds continuously work \n     on producing the most practical solutions to engineering \n     problems.\n\n  Whether it is our soldiers in the field or our scientists at NASA or \nwhether it is our scientists and engineers struggling to understand the \noceans or better communication technology, they go to the SBIR and STTR \nprograms and look for some of the cutting edge ideas. We invest in \nthem, and many of those ideas go commercial for the benefit of \neveryone, taxpayers included.\n  She goes on to write:\n\n       Small businesses develop niche products that are not mass \n     produced overseas. Thus, it helps our employment situation \n     [right here at home]. The employees of a high-tech company \n     are highly educated professionals belonging to a high income \n     group who contribute substantially to the tax pool and the \n     economy.\n\n  Finally, she says:\n\n       Small businesses are job creators. We hear that large \n     companies are sitting on trillions of dollars in cash, yet \n     not investing in job creation. Small businesses often operate \n     on a very thin to no profit margin and hire staff on borrowed \n     money. . . . This is because growth is the mantra for small \n     businesses for survival.\n\n  If they don't grow, they don't survive. This small business research \nprogram is so important. The reason I am here tonight asking my \ncolleagues to vote on this amendment on the Defense bill is that it is \nrelevant. It is also important. We are 5 years late. This program \nshould have been authorized 5 years ago.\n  I inherited this situation when I became chairman of the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee. As you know, I have worked \ndiligently with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this \ndebate forward and to advance the ball. That is what we are going to do \ntonight. We are, hopefully, going to pass this with more than the 60 \nvotes necessary.\n  This bill came out of the Small Business Committee on a vote of 17 to \n1. It was just broadly bipartisan in its appeal. It is sponsored by my \nranking member, Senator Snowe, who has been one of the strongest \nadvocates for small business in the Senate--not just for this year but \nfor many years. She sponsored this bill along with Senators Shaheen, \nBrown, and Kerry. With Senator McCain and Senator Levin's help, along \nwith the cosponsors of this amendment, I ask my colleagues to vote \nfavorably for it tonight. Again, we are 5 years overdue. It is an \nimportant program to get authorized so that the folks operating our \nprograms at all of the departments can have some confidence that the \nprogram is going to go on, that they can even do a better job than they \nhave been doing, and we can get these investments out to small \nbusinesses that are game changers in America, creating new technology \nand, most importantly, creating the jobs that America needs right here \nat home.\n  I don't see anyone else to speak on the amendment. I think that would \nprobably be all the time that we need. I hope that is a signal that \nthere is no opposition to the amendment. Perhaps we can do a voice vote \nor have a very strong vote for reauthorizing the small business \nresearch program. Again, that is so meritorious and so necessary for \nthe investment of small business in America today.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, while Senator Landrieu is here--\nbecause she, I know, is going to be interested in this and is right on \ntop of this--I want to assure her it was our intention with the \nprevious order to have the Landrieu amendment No. 1115 modified with \nthe changes that are at the desk, and so I now ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be modified with those changes, and that our \nprevious order with respect to the vote in relation to the Landrieu \namendment be modified as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1115), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n               DIVISION E--SBIR AND STTR REAUTHORIZATION\n\n     SEC. 5001.

Mr. President, while I have the floor, and while Senator \nLandrieu is here, let me add my voice of thanks and gratitude to \nSenator Landrieu for the energy she shows as chair of our Small \nBusiness Committee. I am honored to be a member of that committee and \nto sit at her side. I know how long and hard she has worked on this \nSBIR Program, how many years we have fought hard for this program, with \nher as our leader.\n  The same thing is true with the technology program--the Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer Program--which is part of this amendment. \nThis bill is going to help 30 million small businesses to invest in \ntechnology research to help grow their businesses, spur innovation, and \ncreate jobs. Small business technology firms that receive SBIR funds \nhave produced 38 percent of America's patents--13 times more than large \nbusinesses--and employ 40 percent of America's scientists and \nengineers, and the Defense Department is the biggest user of these \nprograms. So this is very appropriate on this bill, and we are very \ngrateful for the determination of Senator Landrieu and her cosponsors.\n  If I am not already a cosponsor of the amendment, I would ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this has made it possible for us to be here \ntonight, and I wanted to say that while Senator Landrieu was on the \nfloor and to express what I think is, if not the unanimous, certainly \nthe near unanimous gratitude of this body, because I expect this will \nhave an overwhelming vote.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent also that our \nPresiding Officer, Senator Casey, be added as a cosponsor to our \ncounterfeit parts amendment, No. 1092. It took us too many weeks to do \nthis, but as I see the Presiding Officer in the chair, I am making up \nfor lost time and asking unanimous consent that he be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1064\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This will be the last vote of this evening. Tomorrow we \nwill have a vote around 11 a.m. on cloture on this bill, and we will \nwork with the managers to see how they are going to work through the \ngermane amendments.\n\n\n                    Amendments No. 1115, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Landrieu amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, thank you very much. We will only take a \nminute. I would like to yield the majority of my time to the ranking \nmember who has worked so hard on this bill.\n  I would like to thank the cosponsors and thank all of my colleagues \nfor supporting a very balanced extension of the SBIR Program. This is 5 \nyears overdue, and I yield the remainder of my time to the ranking \nmember from the State of Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, Chairman Landrieu, for her leadership, and I commend her for \nthat.\n  I thank all of the Members of the Senate for supporting these two \nvital programs. We had much debate on these programs back in March for \n5 weeks. There has been broad bipartisan support. They are vital job \ncreators and innovators. They have provided more than 25 percent of the \ninnovations that have occurred over this last decade and are certainly \nvital to the Defense Department as we are setting aside existing \nFederal research dollars for small business firms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which is nearly \nidentical to legislation that passed the Senate unanimously last \nDecember and which passed our Committee by a vote of 18 to 1 in March \nof this year.\n  It is critical that we focus like a laser on job creation, and \nencourage an environment in which America's small businesses--our \nNation's job generators--can once again flourish. We know that small \nbusinesses will lead us out of our economic morass. They employ more \nthan half of all private sector employees and have created 64 percent \nof the net new jobs over the past 15 years. Ninety percent of that job \ncreation is concentrated in four to five percent of all companies, \ncommonly known as ``gazelles,'' or high-impact firms. The SBIR Program \nis designed to assist exactly these types of companies.\n  Together, these vital job creation programs have provided small firms \nwith over $28 billion during their lifespans. They have been front and \ncenter in improving our Nation's capacity to innovate. According to a \nreport by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, SBIR-\nbacked firms have been responsible for roughly 25 percent of the \nNation's most crucial innovations over the past decade plus--``a \npowerful indication that the SBIR Program has become a key force in the \ninnovation economy of the United States.'' And the SBIR Program has \nplayed a critical role in providing the Department of Defense--our \nnation's largest SBIR agency--with the technology and components it \nrequires. From night vision goggle simulators, to sensors which provide \nintelligence about battlefield events like anti-aircraft artillery and \nrocket launches to our brave men and women in the field, technologies \nborne from a small infusion of SBIR funding have helped make our \nmilitary more efficient, cost-effective, and safer.\n  Simply put, these programs have helped America's entrepreneurs create \nbusinesses, jobs, and innovations for a wide range of applications in \nour daily lives. Regrettably, SBIR has been subject to 14 short-term \nextensions since it was slated to expire in September 2008, and STTR \nhas been a part of 11 of those since September 2009. This uncertainty \nis of concern to both program managers, who are never sure if they will \nhave the funding for small business awardees, and to the small business \napplicants themselves.\n  Furthermore, our amendment would reauthorize these programs for 8 \nyears--which has been done twice before for SBIR in 1992 and 2000, the \nlast two reauthorizations. A long-term reauthorization of SBIR and STTR \nis critical to the effectiveness of these initiatives. Simply stated, \nan SBIR or STTR recipient's lifecycle in the program is longer than 2 \nyears. A Phase I award lasts for 6 months, while a Phase II lasts for 2 \nyears. This does not take into account the time required for agencies \nto issue solicitations and companies to apply for awards, including \nbetween Phases I and II, as well as a company's time in Phase III \ncommercializing its product or technology. Short-term reauthorizations \ndissuade promising small businesses from applying to the programs, and \nmakes agencies hesitant to fund projects when they are uncertain for \nwhich they will have follow-on funding in the future.\n  The 2-year extension that some members have been discussing would \njeopardize the compromise reached in this legislation and remove the \ncertainty the bill provides. In particular, it has the ability to \nunravel the ``venture capital'' compromise, which was negotiated for \nnearly 6 years between Members of Congress, the small business \ncommunity, and the Biotechnology Industry Organization, BIO. This \ncompromise--which allows firms majority owned by multiple venture \ncapital operating companies to be eligible for up to 25 percent of SBIR \nfunds at the National Institutes of Health, National Science \nFoundation, and Department of Energy, and up to 15 percent of the funds \nat remaining agencies--includes the backing of a number of critical \norganizations, like BIO, the National Venture Capital Association, \nNVCA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Small Business \nAssociation.\n  A 2-year authorization would force us to relitigate this issue \nimmediately, before we have the ability to analyze how the compromise \nis working. Indeed, our legislation requires the Government \nAccountability Office to review the impact of the venture capital \ncompromise on the programs 3 years after the bill is enacted, and every \n3 years thereafter. We need time to understand how well this change is \nworking before reconsidering it.\n  Furthermore, it would put at risk some of the key provisions in our \nbill--most noticeably the allocation increases for SBIR from 2.5 to 3.5 \npercent over 10 years, and for STTR from 0.3 to 0.6 percent over 5 \nyears. Because these allocations are spread out over several years, and \nnot immediate, they could be stunted by a short-term reauthorization, \nprohibiting small businesses from accessing critical funding to help \ndevelop their promising technologies.\n  I would note that as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has noted in \nsupport of our legislation, ``[e]ven though this important program for \nsmall business has a proven track record of success, its full potential \nhas been held hostage by a series of short-term reauthorizations which \nhas created uncertainty for SBIR program managers and limitations for \npotential small business grant recipients.'' It is high time for us to \nunleash the potential of these critical firms by ensuring that these \ninitiatives have the requisite stability that they have been lacking in \nrecent years due to Congressional inaction.\n  In its October Interim Report, the President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness urged Congress to ``. . . permanently affirm and fully \nauthorize Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \nTechnology Transfer (STTR) funding for the long term, rather than for \nshort-term re-authorizations.'' It is long beyond time for us to pass a \ncomprehensive, long-term reauthorization of these critical programs. \nOur amendment provides us with this opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since there is bipartisan support, why do we \nneed a rollcall vote? Do we have to have a rollcall vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement requires 60 \nvotes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that order be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1115), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if it is in order, I would like to speak on \nthe bill. Last evening we passed the Leahy-Graham amendment, which \nwould, by law,\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nmake the head of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. As we go forward in our deliberations with respect to this \nbill, particularly the conference committee----\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Please take your \nconversations from the well.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is once again recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  As I have indicated, I would like to make some comments about how I \nthink we can improve and clarify the legislation that was adopted last \nevening by unanimous consent. But, first, let me begin by recognizing, \nobviously, the extraordinary contributions of the men and women of our \nNational Guard. I speak from the experience of just a few weeks ago \nhaving visited members of the 43rd Military Police Brigade of the Rhode \nIsland National Guard who have the responsibility for the detention \nfacility in Bagram, Afghanistan. Under the able leadership of BG \nCharles Petrarca, they are doing an extraordinary job.\n  I also was able to talk with some of the members of our Air National \nGuard, the 143rd Airlift Wing. This is the finest C-130-J wing in the \nentire U.S. Air Force--National Guard or Active or Reserve, in my \nestimate. They are doing remarkable work. They are doing remarkable \nwork. In fact, we could not continue the operations in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, or our homeland security obligations, without the men and \nwomen of the National Guard.\n\n  I wish to also just say coincidentally that I had the great \nopportunity to sit down with my Adjutant General Kevin McBride. General \nMcBride and his staff are extraordinarily effective professionals. I \nfirst got the chance to see him literally in action when he commanded \nthe 43rd Military Police Brigade in Iraq, where they also had detention \nresponsibilities.\n  So we are talking about now a component of our military forces that \nare professionals, superbly qualified, complete patriots, and dedicated \nto the success of the mission and the success of this Nation. There is \nthe saying ``One Army'', as there is ``One Air Force,'' and it truly \nis. I can recall serving on Active Duty when there was at least a \nperception of disparity between Reserve, National Guard, and Active-\nDuty forces. That perception no longer exists. The reality is that \nthese are superb professionals doing their job. So I think that is the \nstarting point to consider this legislation.\n  What I would like to suggest in terms of an improvement to the \nlegislation is clarifying the role and responsibility of the Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If \nhe has statutory responsibilities, those responsibilities should be \nspecified.\n  As General McKinley, who is the current Chief of the National Guard \nBureau and a superb professional, pointed out at the committee hearing:\n  The Chief of the National Guard Bureau still does not have an \ninstitutional position from which [he] can advise the President, the \nNSC, the Homeland Security Council, and Congress on non-federalized \nNational Guard forces that are critical to homeland defense and civil \nsupport missions.\n  If this is the purpose of appointing and confirming the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that \npurpose should be laid out. If that is the role he or she is expected \nto play--to provide advice to the Chairman and advice to the President \non the non-federalized National Guard forces critical to homeland \ndefense and civil support missions--it should be spelled out. I hope it \nis spelled out as we go forward with the process of conferencing this \nlegislation.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Adding the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the JCS, \n     in my opinion, would ensure that in the post-9/11 security \n     environment the National Guard's non-federalized role in \n     homeland defense and civil support missions will be fully \n     represented in all JCS deliberations.\n\n  I think this is very important. Let me suggest why--because one of \nthe essentials of any military organization is unity of command. The \nNational Guard Bureau has two separate services which it represents: \nthe Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. We do not want, \nparticularly at the level of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to confuse who \nspeaks for the services--who speaks for the Army, who speaks for the \nAir Force. I think in order to do this--to preserve the unity of \ncommand, to make it very clear that at the deliberations of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force speaks for the Air \nForce and the Chief of Staff of the Army speaks for the Army--we have \nto make it clear what the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is \nspeaking to.\n  I hope as we go forward we can make it very clear as General McKinley \nmade it very clear in his testimony that his perspective, his point of \nview, his position on the Joint Chiefs is related, as he said \nrepeatedly, to those non-federalized functions of the National Guard, \nparticularly with respect to homeland security and civil support \nmissions. I think this would enhance and clarify the role of the Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau, and I also think it would avoid even the \nappearance of a lack of unity of command within the services.\n  I think these are important points. These points can be and should be \napproached in the conference. I hope that at the end of the day, when \nthe President is prepared to sign this bill--and there may be other \nimprovements to this legislation--that this particular aspect of the \nlegislation is incorporated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask permission to speak for 20 minutes in morning \nbusiness, but it will probably be less than that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I won't, \nI have two unanimous consent requests that will take just a couple of \nmoments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, go ahead.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1174\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 1174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 1260 and 1262 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Secondly, there are two colloquies between myself and \nSenator Sherrod Brown. At the end of these colloquies, in both cases, \nSenator Brown withdraws the amendments referred to in the colloquies, \namendments Nos. 1260 and 1262.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that those two amendments he then \nwithdraws at the end of the colloquies in fact be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1260\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I rise to discuss my amendment No. 1260 with the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This amendment would \nstrike section 846 of the bill, which would establish a new exception \nto the requirement to purchase specialty metals that are produced in \nthe United States.\n  Over the last several months, a number of concerns have been raised \nabout this provision. In particular:\n  The provision is not needed, because domestic titanium is cost-\ncompetitive with foreign titanium and the cost of titanium has not been \na major cost driver in DOD weapon systems.\n  No specific case has been raised in which U.S. companies have lost \ncontracts or manufacturing jobs as a result of a price difference \nbetween U.S. and foreign titanium.\n  If the new exception in section 846 were abused, it could undermine \nthe preference for domestic titanium and result in the loss of U.S. \njobs.\n  Administering the new exception could create significant burdens on \nboth defense contractors and the Department of Defense; and the \nDepartment's existing authority to make Domestic Non-Availability \nDeterminations (DNADs) already gives it the flexibility it would need \nto address a significant price differential, should it arise at some \npoint in the future.\n  Is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee aware of these \nconcerns?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am aware of the concerns raised by the Senator from \nOhio, and I assure him that I will give careful consideration to those \nconcerns as\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nwe go to conference with the House of Representatives on this \nprovision.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the Senator's assurance, and I \nwithdraw the amendment on that basis.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1262\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I rise to discuss my amendment No. 1262 regarding \nthe definition of specialty metals produced in the United States.\n  Under section 2533b of title 10, U.S. Code, specialty metals included \nin weapon systems purchased by DOD must be produced in the United \nStates. This requirement has been in place for more than 30 years and \nfor most of that time, the Department interpreted the requirement to \napply to metals that are ``melted'' in the United States.\n  After Congress re-codified the requirement in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, however, DOD decided that a \nmetal is produced in the United States if any part of the production \nprocess takes place in this country. That includes finishing processes \nsuch as rolling, heat treatment, quenching, or tempering. This is a \nsubstantial change to the definition that has a direct impact on \ndomestic production and American jobs, which I know the ,Chairman has \ndefended throughout his career.\n  My amendment would restore the long-standing definition of what it \nmeans for a metal to be ``produced'' in this country--that it must be \n``melted'' here.\n  Is the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee familiar with this \nissue?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am aware of the issue, and of the concerns raised by the \nSenator from Ohio about this definition. Section 823 of the Ike Skelton \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 directed the \nSecretary of Defense to review the definition of the term ``produced'' \nand to ensure that it complies with the requirements of law and is \nconsistent with congressional intent.\n  It is my understanding that this review is currently ongoing. I \nbelieve that we should have the informed input of the Department of \nDefense before we act on this issue. For that reason, I believe that \nthe amendment is premature. However, the review required by section 823 \nis already several weeks overdue. I understand that DOD is not always \nable to meet our reporting deadlines, but this is an issue on which we \nneed DOD's input and we need it soon. I assure the Senator from Ohio \nthat we will carefully review the findings of the DOD review and \nrevisit the issue in light of those findings, if necessary. If the \nDepartment fails to meet its statutory duty to address this issue, we \nwill take that into consideration as well.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the Senator's assurance, and I \nwithdraw the amendment on that basis.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1419\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 1419 would correct an \nunintended staff error in the new Division D funding tables that the \nSenate Armed Services Committee voted to adopt Tuesday, November 15, \n2011. This error unintentionally reduced the President's budget request \nfor the line 154, RDTE AF, JSTARS account by $33 million. This \namendment would correct this error and restore the RDTE AF JSTARS \naccount back to the level requested in the President's budget request \nand approved in the June 22, 2011, SASC-passed version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. Both the majority and minority staff \ndirectors have acknowledged that this was an unintended staff error and \nhave requested that this be corrected by restoring full funding of the \nRDTE AF JSTARS account to $121,610,000. Chairman Levin and I agree.\n\n\n                                  EELV\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned when the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2012 was first brought up on the floor, I wanted to \nfocus on, in the course to the Senate's consideration of this bill, the \nissue of military space procurement. There can be no doubt that how the \nDepartment of Defense procures satellites and space-related capability \nhas gotten unacceptably out of control.\n  In the impending environment of fiscal austerity, the situation has \nbecome nothing less than severe.\n  One need not look further than the Space-Based Infrared System High, \nSBIRS-HIGH, program as a good example of how bad things have gotten. \nThis program has been a problem since its inception in 1996. In fact, 5 \nyears into the program--in 2001--an independent review cited the \nprogram as ``too immature to enter the system design and development \nphase'' and observed that the program was based on faulty and overly \noptimistic assumptions with respect to, among others things, \n``management stability and the level of understanding of \nrequirements.'' The independent review also highlighted a breakdown in \nexecution and management resulting from those overly optimistic \nassumptions and unclear requirements that essentially ``overwhelmed'' \ngovernment and contractor management.\n  That was 2001, when it was determined that total program cost growth \ncould exceed $2 billion, a 70 percent increase in cost. And, here we \nare today, 10 years later, and the system still has not achieved its \nobjectives. In fact, it was just launched--for the first time--\nrecently, on May 7, 2011.\n  Originally estimated to cost $2.4 billion, it is now expected to cost \nnearly $16 billion, roughly 7 times the original estimate. With SBIRS' \nhaving been launched finally, we will see if it has overcome its \ncontinuing software issues and delivers its improved ballistic missile-\nmonitoring capability as promised. I am, however, not optimistic: the \nsatellite was launched even though the flight system software was not \nready, and the ground control software needed to exploit the \nsatellite's full capabilities is still lagging.\n  It is worth bearing in mind that the Government Accountability \nOffice's latest March 9, 2011, report on major defense acquisition \nprograms notes that SBIRS has the odious distinction of breaching the \n``Nunn-McCurdy'' law on cost growth a record four times--the most of \nany major weapons program. It's a hall-of-famer.\n  By the way, the DOD just recently reported to Congress that the next \npair of these satellites, built by Lockheed Martin, could cost $438 \nmillion more than previously estimated and could be delivered a year \nlate. Unacceptable.\n  SBIRS is, however, not the only space program that has been facing \nthese types of problems. Over the past decade, most--I repeat, most--of \nthe DOD's space programs have been over cost and behind schedule. Their \ndelays have in fact been so significant that we now face potential gaps \nin capabilities in vital areas dependent on space procurement such as \nweather monitoring and ultra-high frequency communications.\n  After years of spiraling costs and under the specter of diminishing \nbudgets, the Air Force now says it wants to buy space assets in bulk to \nsave money. Only in Washington could programs with the kind of history \nof mismanagement and unparalleled cost-growth and schedule-delays we \nhave seen in large military satellite and launch programs--which in the \nmost egregious cases have yet to see a single day of operational \nperformance or demonstrate intended capability--be proposed for \neconomic savings by buying its related components in bulk.\n  Until the Air Force overhauls how it buys its biggest and most \nexpensive military space assets--more than simply doubling down on bad \nbets--these kinds of programs will continue to be painful case studies \nof how problematic our overall system for acquiring major weapons \nremains.\n  One program that I chose to focus on in particular in this bill is \nthe Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, EELV, program. On \nthis program, I have filed two amendments, which have either already \nbeen adopted or are awaiting adoption without opposition.\n  My first amendment would require the EELV program to report to \nCongress and to the Office of the Secretary of Defense on how it is \ndoing in terms of cost, schedule and performance as if it were \ndesignated as a major defense acquisition program, MDAP, not in \nsustainment.\n  This sounds pretty simple, but why this amendment is in fact \nnecessary is striking.\n  In 2006, the unit cost of the EELV program, which provides the DOD \nand other government agencies the launch capability to get large \nsatellites into orbit, breached the cost thresholds under the Nunn-\nMcCurdy law. Under that law, the Department is required to\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nreport to Congress if there is a significant or critical increase in \nunit cost over the program's baseline cost.\n  In this case, EELV's unit costs unexpectedly grew because of a change \nin the acquisition strategy warranted by a decrease in the demand for \nEELV launches. And, that was due to, among other things, satellite \nprogram development delays and cancellations.\n  But rather than restructure the program to make sure that it provides \nlaunch capability affordably; rebaseline its unit cost estimate to a \nmore realistic number; and certify, after careful deliberation and an \nanalysis of alternatives, that the program must continue--all of which \nis required under Nunn-McCurdy--something else happened.\n  In 2007, the program was basically taken out of the defense \nacquisition management system, otherwise known as the ``milestone \nsystem,'' and put in ``sustainment.'' The decision to do so \nsignificantly reduced EELV's reporting requirements to the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense and to Congress, particularly on the program's \ncost and status. And, that limited both the OSD and Congress' ability \nto oversee the program going forward.\n  Ordinarily, such a decision is made when a program has completed its \ndevelopment and production phases. But, this wasn't the case for EELV. \nEven to this day, the program faces maturity issues based on the fact \nthat the DOD has yet to launch all EELV variants in sufficient numbers \nto ensure design and production maturity.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office in 2008, the \ndecision to put EELV on sustainment may have been influenced by other \nfactors, namely, avoiding the imminent Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach.\n  One thing is clear: this decision should never have been made.\n  And, Congress' and the OSD's oversight of this large program has been \nhampered ever since.\n  Against this backdrop, my amendment would require that the DOD either \nmove the program back to a major defense acquisition program (MDAP) not \nin sustainment or otherwise have the program provide, as appropriate, \nCongress or the OSD updates of the program's cost and status using the \ncriteria set forth for other MDAPs.\n  This, frankly, should have been done years ago.\n  My second amendment is required because of more recent developments \nin the EELV program. That amendment would require the Air Force to \nexplain, by a time certain, exactly how its new EELV acquisition \nstrategy for the balance of rocket cores beyond its immediate purchase \nimplements each of GAO's recommendations in its recent report on the \nprogram.\n  Unsurprisingly, the increasing cost of launching satellites into \nspace has become a major problem. And, with defense dollars likely to \ndecline for as far as the eye can see, driving down the cost of space \nlaunch is tough because, with regard to ``EELV''-class rockets, only \none company provides the U.S. government with the ``heavy'' launch \ncapability it needs--the United Launch Alliance, ULA, comprised of \nformer competitors Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n  There can be no doubt that, at the end of the day, only competition \ncan meaningfully drive down costs. As GAO recently noted, competition \nfor space launch missions provides the government with an unprecedented \nopportunity to control costs under the EELV program. I strongly agree. \nLargely because of the lack of competition and the DOD's reliance on a \nmonopoly incumbent provider, by some estimates, EELV costs may increase \nby more than 50 percent over the next 5 years. This is neither \ndesirable nor affordable.\n  But, in an effort to procure heavy-launch capability affordably, the \nAir Force, which serves as the Executive Agent for space at the DOD, \noriginally came up with a strategy to sole-source from ULA as much as \neight boosters over 5 years. This so-called ``Block-40 strategy'' \nwould, however, have effectively locked-up the government into a large \nblock purchase with ULA and foreclosed the possibility of competition \nover time.\n  Thankfully, GAO looked into this acquisition strategy. And, its \nreport, which came out just a few weeks ago, was scathing. In it, GAO \nfound that, despite statements by the Air Force to the contrary, the \nAir Force's Block-40 strategy was unsupported by the necessary data and \nanalysis--most notably, certified cost and pricing data, analysis on \nthe health of the industrial base and the cost-effectiveness of mission \nassurance.\n  This amendment would require the Air Force to explain when it submits \nits budget next year how it implemented each of GAO's recommendations. \nThose recommendations include, among other things, independently \nassessing the health of the U.S. launch industrial base and reassessing \nthe proposed block buy contract quantity and length.\n  On October 21, 2011, I brought this issue to Secretary Panetta's \nattention, with Chairman Levin. While we only recently received a \nresponse, which I would like to be made part of this record, the \nquestion as to whether GAO's recommendations have been and will be \ncomplied with remains open. So, notwithstanding the letter, this \namendment remains ripe and necessary.\n  Once again, I believe both of these provisions have been or will be \nadopted into the bill without opposition. And, I thank my colleagues \nfor their cooperation. The area of how the Department of Defense \nprocures space assets and capabilities is something we all have to \nfocus on more than we have been. Particularly in these times of fiscal \nhardship and austerity, looking the other way and hoping for the best \nis an option we cannot afford.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your October 21, 2011, \n     letter regarding the recently completed Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) report on the Evolved Expendable \n     Launch Vehicle (EELV) program. In your letter, you asked the \n     Department to pause ``all activities in furtherance of . . . \n     negotiations with United Launch Alliance (ULA) for follow-on \n     EELV launches'' and ``all activities intended to finalize the \n     Air Force's Block 40 acquisition strategy'' until the \n     Department has: 1 ``completed a full review of the concerns \n     raised by GAO'' in its recent report; and (2) ``taken \n     appropriate steps to ensure that prices are fair and \n     reasonable, including obtaining cost and pricing data, and \n     complying with other applicable requirements of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation.'' Secretary Panetta asked me to reply \n     in my capacity as the Department's Executive Agent for Space.\n       The Department and the Air Force have thoroughly reviewed \n     the GAO report--including early drafts and the final report--\n     and we agree additional data is needed before executing an \n     EELV contract for FY 2013-2017. The Air Force EELV \n     acquisition strategy is fundamentally based on gathering more \n     and better information before pursuing any specific contract. \n     The strategy is part of a series of steps the Air Force is \n     taking to control cost growth in the EELV program, including \n     efforts to facilitate opportunities for proven launch \n     providers to compete for EELV-class launches. The Air Force \n     and the Department see competition as a critical element of \n     our long term efforts to reduce launch costs.\n       The GAO completed their audit prior to most of the work on \n     the revised EELV acquisition strategy. Consequently, some of \n     the concerns highlighted have been addressed. For example, in \n     March 2011, when the drafting of the GAO report was nearly \n     complete, the Air Force created a new executive position, the \n     Program Executive Officer for Space Launch (PEO/SL). The PEO/\n     SL was established to enhance executive management of the \n     EELV program, with the near-term focus of driving down costs \n     and spearheading the effort to craft a new EELV acquisition \n     strategy. The new PEO has led several efforts to implement \n     specific cost reduction efforts based on a detailed Should \n     Cost Review that I directed as Secretary of the Air Force. \n     The PEO has also taken steps to gain additional knowledge to \n     inform the acquisition strategy, including independent cost \n     estimates for the large cost drivers for launch. These \n     efforts and the data they yielded are the key building blocks \n     for the EELV acquisition strategy. The United Launch Alliance \n     supplier survey data described and questioned in the GAO \n     report was made available to review teams examining the EELV \n     program, but was not relied upon in the PEO's development of \n     the acquisition strategy.\n       The Air Force EELV acquisition strategy entails an \n     evaluation of an economic order quantity of EELV booster \n     cores, but there is no commitment to a specific contract \n     quantity or duration. Instead, the first phase of the \n     strategy will require the incumbent contractor to provide \n     their best price offers on a quantity range of six to ten \n     booster cores per\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\n     year over contract periods ranging from three to five years. \n     This data will allow the Air Force to balance the rate and \n     commitment decision with our fundamental priorities: \n     operational requirements, price, budget, and enabling \n     competition.\n       The Air Force will not pursue any negotiations with ULA \n     until they have submitted the cost and price data we need, \n     and ULA's submissions will be audited as they would in any \n     contracting process. The citations in the GAO report to \n     Defense Contracting Audit Agency standards for sufficient \n     cost and price information refer to prices associated with \n     some subcontractor ULA orders that were placed in a \n     commercial environment and thus did not require certified \n     cost and pricing data. For the FY 2013-2017 proposal, the \n     prime contractor will be required to certify the data \n     submitted is current, accurate, and complete.\n       With the recently released New Entrant Certification \n     Strategy, the Air Force, NASA, and the NRO are working to \n     facilitate the certification of new entrants who want to \n     compete for EELV-class missions. By examining a range of \n     contract options and terms for EELV procurement, and by \n     examining progress from new entrants in the coming months, \n     the Air Force will be well-positioned to identify the best \n     balance of these priorities and the best value for the \n     taxpayer. Only at that point, with additional information in \n     hand, will the Air Force move to negotiate a new contract.\n       Thank you again for your letter and your continued support \n     of national security space. I look forward to continuing to \n     work in partnership with you to maintain assured access to \n     space for the Nation. A similar letter has been sent to the \n     Chairman of your committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael B. Donley,\n                                    DoD Executive Agent for Space.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7987-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7987-S7988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when the Congress passed the health care \nlaw, it imposed a mandate on individuals who lacked health insurance to \npurchase it. Since then, a number of courts have held that the \nindividual mandate exceeds the power of Congress to regulate interstate \ncommerce.\n  The Supreme Court will soon hear a case on this question.\n  The Supreme Court, which usually gives a case 1 hour of oral \nargument, is giving the various issues in this case 5\\1/2\\ hours. This \nis a modern record.\n  The Supreme Court should exercise its powers of judicial review \ncarefully. One of its major principles of judicial restraint is that an \nact of Congress is presumed to be constitutional. But this is a \npresumption that can be rebutted. It derives from the respect that one \nbranch of government gives when reviewing the actions of another.\n  If Congress has made a determination that a statute is \nconstitutional, the Supreme Court should give that finding some level \nof deference.\n  But the presumption rests on a premise that Congress has made a \nconsidered judgment on the constitutionality of the laws it passes. In \nthe case of the health care bill, this did not happen. Republicans \nraised a constitutional challenge to the individual mandate that was \nbrushed aside by Democrats who favored the bill as a policy matter, and \nwere not going to let a serious constitutional issue get in the way of \npassing the law.\n  In fact, we know that there was no Congressional consideration of the \nconstitutionality of this unprecedented restriction of the freedom of \nAmerican citizens.\n  I mean unprecedented literally. Congress has never before discovered \nor exercised this power in more than 200 years of this country's \nhistory. And since Congress has never before imposed a requirement to \npurchase a product, no Supreme Court precedent has ever found that \nCongress may do so.\n  Instead, apart from the regulation of items such as navigable \nwaterways or communication lines, the Supreme Court has always \ndiscussed the subjects that Congress may regulate under the Commerce \nClause as ``activities.'' The Court has never held that Congress can \nuse its Commerce Clause power to regulate inactivity--or require people \nto engage in commerce. The Court has found that Congress cannot \nregulate intrastate economic activities that in combination do not \naffect commerce. And Congress cannot regulate non-economic activities, \nsuch as carrying a gun in a school zone.\n  So it should be clear that Congress cannot regulate inactivity--such \nas a thought or a decision not to purchase health insurance.\n  Congress has great power under the Commerce Clause to reduce \nindividual freedom. In 1942, the Court ruled in Wickard v. Filburn that \na farmer could be penalized for exceeding a quota on the amount of \nwheat he could produce, even when the excess went for providing food \nfor his own farm and its livestock.\n  And that Commerce Clause decision has allowed Congress to pass many \nsignificant regulatory laws, such as environmental laws, drug laws, and \nthe public accommodation provisions of the civil rights laws.\n  But in every such case, the regulated person retained the freedom to \navoid being regulated. A person who did not want to comply with \nenvironmental laws could stop engaging in the activity that fell under \nthe environmental laws. A person who did not want to be subject to the \ndrug laws could avoid transporting drugs.\n  And a person who did not want to adhere to the public accommodation \nlaws could leave the public accommodation business.\n  The individual mandate is different. The mandate requires action. And \nthere is no escape. A person cannot opt out of the activity that \ntriggers the regulation because the mandate applies even to inactivity. \nIf the person is alive, then he or she has to buy health insurance. \nThat is a serious and novel threat to individual freedom.\n  Congress has offered incentives to change people's behavior.\n  But it is hard to see why Congress would do that if it had the power \nit now claims to force people to buy particular goods and services. \nUnder this logic, Congress could require people to buy new GM cars, so \nit would not have enacted Cash for Clunkers. Similarly, this supposed \npower would allow Congress to order people to pay money to third \nparties rather than raising taxes. And a decision upholding the mandate \nwould permit Congress to keep beef prices high by requiring vegetarians \nto buy beef.\n  Members of Congress could use this supposed Commerce Clause power to \nentrench themselves in office. They could require people to buy houses \nor cars or other products in areas where their political party has its \nbase of support.\n  Despite the arguments of the Obama Administration, the power it \nclaims that Congress can use to compel people to buy goods and services \nis not unique to health care. The judges who are honest recognize that \nif Congress can force people to buy insurance, Congress can force the \npurchase of any product or service.\n  It can regulate inactivity because that can affect interstate \ncommerce.\n  This conclusion is consistent with the opinion of the Congressional \nBudget Office. In a 1994 memo, CBO wrote that ``a mandate-issuing \ngovernment'' could lead ``in the extreme'' ``to a command econom[y] in \nwhich the President and the Congress dictated how much each individual \nand family spent on all goods and services.''\n  In June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in the \nBond case that an individual--not only a State--could challenge the \nconstitutionality of a Federal statute as exceeding the power of \nCongress to enact under the 10th Amendment. The Court wrote, ``By \ndenying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns \nof public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from \narbitrary power. When government acts in excess of its lawful powers, \nthat liberty is at stake.''\n  The case now before the Supreme Court raises first principles about \nour republic. The people are the sovereign in our country. The \ngovernment serves the people, not the other way around. That is \nenforced through a Constitution that gives the Congress limited powers. \nIn the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote that the powers of the \nFederal Government are few and defined, and the powers of the States \nare many and undefined. Although there is much more interstate commerce \nin today's economy than there was in 1787, the power is still limited.\n  If Congress can require Americans to purchase goods and services that \nCongress chooses, without a limiting principle, then there is no \nlimited Federal Government. There would be no issue that Congress could \nnot address at the\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nFederal level. There would be no range of State powers that the Federal \nGovernment cannot usurp. The 10th Amendment would be a dead letter, as \nthere would be no powers reserved to the States.\n  Congress exceeded its enumerated powers in passing the individual \nmandate.\n  It attempted to create an all-powerful Federal Government that posed \na threat to liberty that the Supreme Court unanimously warned against \nin the Bond case. All the Supreme Court need do to strike down the \nmandate is to adhere to its position in Bond. If it departs from that \nview and upholds the mandate, then our hopes for liberty may depend on \na new President charting the course contained in Judge Kavanaugh's \ndissenting opinion in the D.C. Circuit case. Judge Kavanaugh wrote that \na President is not required to enforce a statute that regulates private \nindividuals that the President believes is unconstitutional.\n  This is true even when a court has held the statute to be \nconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the \nconstitutionality of the individual mandate is important not only for \nthe fate of that provision, but for its effect on the powers of the \nFederal Government and the very survival of individual economic \nliberty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Our economy, as the Presiding Officer and others \nknow, demands two major priorities from Congress right now: to reduce \nspending and to foster job creation. Equally important, you cannot do \none without the other. We cannot only cut our way to prosperity. They \ncannot be mutually exclusive goals. We can make sensible reforms that \nreduce the deficit while promoting job creation.\n  Here is what we should be talking about: first, closing tax loopholes \nfor companies that ship jobs overseas and encourage American job \ncreation. That saves $19 billion over 10 years. It will mean companies \nchoosing to manufacture in the United States instead of China, instead \nof Mexico, in many cases.\n  My State, Ohio, is the third leading manufacturing State in the \ncountry. We produce more than any other State except California, three \ntimes our population, and Texas, twice our population.\n  Second, let's give faster access to generic drugs to treat breast \ncancer and MS and rheumatoid arthritis. That saves $2.3 billion over 10 \nyears. It saves for taxpayers. It saves for insurance companies, \nmeaning insurance rates will go up at a much lower rate. It saves for \nindividuals reaching into their pocket and paying copays.\n  Third, let's strengthen and streamline the farm safety net. That \nsaves $20 billion over 10 years. There is simply no reason that large \nfarmers who have profitable years need to get direct payments, need to \nget farm subsidies. Establishing a safety net makes sense. If prices \nare particularly low for a couple of years, if yields are particularly \nlow for a couple of years, farmers need that safety net because we do \nnot want to lose more family farms. But do not continue to give farm \nsubsidies to farmers who simply do not need them.\n  Fourth, let's ask the wealthiest Americans to go back to the same tax \nrate they paid during the Clinton years. That will raise $800 billion \nover the next 10 years. During the Clinton years, 21 million private \nsector jobs--net increase--occurred, even with a higher tax rate on \nhigh-income people as we balanced the budget, and during the 8 Bush \nyears, two major tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, which the Presiding \nOfficer and I and others opposed, under the belief that trickle-down \neconomics would work, there was only a 1 million private sector net \nincrease in jobs in those 8 years. We started with a huge budget \nsurplus and ended with a huge budget deficit. We know that kind of \neconomics does not work.\n  Those four ways are just four of the many I can talk about at another \ntime of reducing our deficit and making our economy stronger. Too many \nin Washington seek to undermine one of the programs that kept our \ncountry strong in good economic times and bad economic times; that is, \nSocial Security.\n  I am now a grandfather. I turned 59 a couple of weeks ago. Our first \ngrandson is 3 years old. I understand it becomes more personal. I \nunderstand how grandparents now get to spend more time with their \ngrandchildren. Margaret Mead once said: Wisdom and knowledge are passed \nfrom grandparent to grandchild.\n  The Presiding Officer, who has enough gray hair, would understand \nthat, understands that because Medicare and Social Security have helped \nAmericans live longer and healthier lives, it does give us--that is why \nit is personal for me, it does give us more time with our grandkids, \nand passing on that knowledge and wisdom that only grandparents can \nthen give to their grandchildren.\n  Yet too many seniors have worked hard, played by the rules, and \nrequire Social Security simply to live. More than half of Ohio's \nseniors get more than half their income in their retirement years from \nSocial Security. That is how important it is. Some seniors get almost \nall of their income from Social Security. That may be as little as \n$1,000 or $1,100 or $1,200 a month. That is what they live on.\n  Yet as more and more seniors rely on Social Security, they went 2 \nyears without a cost-of-living adjustment. Why? Because the cost-of-\nliving adjustment under Federal law--this is not the fault of the \nPresident, although it may have been several Presidents ago; this is \nnot the fault of the Congress, although it may have been when it was \ndecided several Congresses ago--but the law simply says that the Social \nSecurity cost-of-living adjustment is the so-called Consumer Price \nIndex, which is determined for a typical 40-year-old in the workplace, \nnot a 70-year-old who is in retirement. The 40-year-old in the \nworkplace has significantly lower health care costs, perhaps has higher \ntransportation costs getting to or from work, while the senior who is \n70 has significantly higher health care costs as a percentage of their \nincome and significantly higher heating costs, just to keep warm in the \nwinter, cool in the summer, because of their lifestyle.\n  This Consumer Price Index, which is the determination for whether you \nget a cost-of-living adjustment, is based on a working 40-year-old, not \na retired 70-year-old. That is what we want to fix. That is why I have \nintroduced my legislation to do CPI--instead of CPI-W, Consumer Price \nIndex-Working Person, the way it is now, to change it to CPI-E, \nConsumer Price Index-Elderly, to base it on those who get the COLA.\n  America's seniors did not get a COLA the last 2 years because it did \nnot reflect their cost as much as it reflected not very high inflation \namong 40-year-old working families. Belle, a senior community activist \nfrom Shaker Heights, recently shared with me her story that seniors \nacross America can relate to, how difficult it is to meet their needs \nwhen Social Security benefits do not. Half of her income goes to health \ncare costs not covered by Medicare--hearing aids, glasses, dental care, \nin addition to supplemental health insurance she pays. And as Belle \nwill tell anyone, she, like millions of Americans, worked hard and \ncontributed to Social Security. They do not see it as--the word we use \naround here--an ``entitlement;'' they see it as an investment that they \nmade because every working person in Denver, in Colorado Springs, in \nAurora, in Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton paid into Social Security \nand Medicare every day of their work lives. They have invested. They \nhave earned it. They were promised it.\n\n  But, presently, as I said, COLAs are based on the Consumer Price \nIndex for workers, for wage earners, instead of the Consumer Price \nIndex for the elderly. Those 65 and older tend to spend about twice as \nmuch on health care as the general population, twice as much out of a \nsmaller income, than half as\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nmuch out of a bigger income that a 40-year-old would get.\n  So that is where we need to go with the Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustment. But in the so-called supercommittee, which was not \nable to come to an agreement, there were many in the supercommittee, \nparticularly Republicans, particularly sort of ultraconservative \npoliticians who do not much like Social Security to begin with, wanted \nwhat is called the chained CPI. The chained CPI. They called it a \ntechnical fix. But it is really a regressive tax increase that would \ncut senior citizens' cost-of-living adjustment.\n  They did the chained CPI because it would save Social Security money. \nWell, to save Social Security money, what does that mean? It means you \nare taking money from benefits, especially for low and middle-income \nseniors, which is most of them. Those are people who rely on Social \nSecurity for most of their income.\n  Their chained CPI would mean the annual benefits for a typical 65-\nyear-old would be $136 less. Over time, a typical 75-year-old would \nreceive $560 less a year, and at 85 they would receive $1,000 less a \nyear, and at 95, as more seniors live to that age, when they need their \nbenefit, the cut is $1,400 a year. You know, that may not be much money \nfor my colleagues, but it is a lot of money if you are a senior living \non a fixed income.\n  We know how to balance this budget. We did it when the Presiding \nOfficer and I were in the House of Representatives. We did it with a \nDemocratic President and a Congress that at least would go along with \nhim and did not draw these lines in the sand and make signed pledges to \nlobbyists. They are signing pledges to lobbyists, saying: I will not do \nthis; I will do not do that, instead of thinking for themselves and \nsigning a pledge only to the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We knew how to get to a balanced budget. We can do this. We did it in \nthe 1990s. We got to a balanced budget without reducing the cost-of-\nliving adjustment, without turning Medicare over to the insurance \nindustry. You know, to me there are some radical Members of the House \nof Representatives, there are some in the Senate, who want to see \nSocial Security turned over to Wall Street, let them run it; Medicare \nover to the insurance companies, let them run it.\n  When President Bush wanted to privatize Social Security in 1995, the \nPresiding Officer was in the House of Representatives. Imagine if we \nhad gone along with President Bush's idea to privatize Social Security. \nImagine what would have happened. We know what happened to people's \n401(k)s. Imagine what would have happened to the monthly Social \nSecurity payments.\n  The government, as much as people criticize it, has never failed once \nto pay a Social Security check on time. It never failed to pay it at \nall. Since 1937, when Social Security paid out its first lump sum, I \nbelieve, or death benefit, and in 1940 when Social Security started \npaying monthly benefits, it never failed to pay, never paid late. So we \nknow how it works.\n  If we had turned it over to Wall Street, who knows what would have \nhappened. If we had turned Medicare over to insurance companies, as the \nRyan proposal over in the House wants to do and as 40 colleagues here \nwant to do, who knows what would have happened. We know it would not be \nMedicare the way we are used to it. We know it would not be Social \nSecurity the way we are used to it or the Medicare that serves the \nAmerican public or the Social Security that serves the American public. \nThose two programs, if lifted 75 years ago--it was for the poorest, \nlowest income, the most indigent part of our population, seniors. It \nreduced the poverty rate dramatically so that seniors are no longer the \npoorest demographic of our population. Regrettably, children are, and \nwe need to do better than we have done there.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that some of these radical proposals to \nprivatize Medicare and turn it over to the insurance companies, \nprivatize Social Security and turn it over to Wall Street, to do this \nchained CPI that will reduce the cost-of-living adjustment, because \nsome egghead in some think tank in Washington, probably funded by Wall \nStreet and insurance companies, thinks it is a great way to extract a \nfew more dollars from seniors and do whatever they do with more dollars \nin the Treasury--it is pretty clear what we need to do to get a \nbalanced budget, and it is pretty clear what we should not do. We can \nall work together and get to that point.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the African Meeting House in Boston is one \nof the great landmarks of American freedom, as important to \nunderstanding our history as Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill.\n  Not only is it the Nation's oldest black church building but \nthroughout much of the 19th century it also served as the unofficial \nheadquarters of the movement to abolish slavery in America. And on \nDecember 6--its 205th anniversary--the African Meeting House will \nreopen its historic doors after a $9 million restoration project to \npreserve the place where giants like William Lloyd Garrison and \nFrederick Douglass once thundered against the evil of human bondage.\n  It was in the Meeting House basement where William Lloyd Garrison \nformed the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. Garrison predicted \nthat the principles set forth by the Society would ``shake the nation \nby their mighty power.'' Indeed, they did, because they were, in fact, \nthe same principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence, the \nBill of Rights, and the other founding documents of our country. The \nMeeting House is a reminder of the struggle which was inevitable \nbecause slavery was written into our Constitution before brave \nAmericans--both white and black--shed blood and spoke powerful words to \nensure that it was at last written out of that founding document.\n  Maria Stewart, an African-American woman William Lloyd Garrison \nadmired greatly, took Garrison's argument further, insisting in a \nseries of speeches at the African Meeting House that under those \nfounding documents, women were entitled to the same rights as men. ``It \nis not the color of the skin that makes the man or the woman, but the \nprinciple formed in the soul,'' she said in one of her speeches in \n1833. ``Brilliant wit will shine, come from when it will; and genius \nand talent will not hide the brightness of its luster.''\n  That was never as true as when Frederick Douglass delivered ``A Plea \nfor Speech in Boston'' at the African Meeting House in 1860 after an \nanti-slavery meeting elsewhere in the city had been disrupted by a mob. \n``No right was deemed by the fathers of the Government more sacred than \nthe right of speech,'' Douglass said. It is ``the great moral renovator \nof society and government,'' he said. Slavery itself could not survive \nfree speech. ``Five years of its exercise would banish the auction \nblock and break every chain in the South,'' he said.\n  Tragically, it ultimately required a war to resolve the great \ncontradiction at the heart of our democracy. And with the coming of the \nCivil War, the African Meeting House joined the war effort, hosting \nrallies to recruit an all-black regiment of black soldiers. The result \nwas the legendary 54th Massachusetts Infantry made up of volunteers \nfrom as far as Haiti, led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw--the regiment \nand its commander both immortalized in monuments, literature and, of \ncourse, the award winning film Glory.\n  Mr. President, I was proud to work with Governor Deval Patrick and \nthe Massachusetts congressional delegation to get $4 million in Federal \ngrants\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\nfor the $9 million renovation of the African Meeting House. But few \npeople have worked harder to make the renovation and rededication a \nreality than Beverly Morgan-Welch, the executive director of the Museum \nof African-American History. She has spent more than a decade \nspearheading the project, and I congratulate her for all her efforts on \nbehalf of the Museum and the Meeting House and for the decades she has \nspent telling the unique and powerful story of African-Americans. It is \nan inspiring story about those whose spirits would not be broken by \nslavery, those who found ways to create families and communities under \nunimaginably brutal conditions, and those who managed--against all \nodds--to escape to freedom.\n  The African Meeting House reminds us that America has come a long way \nin making good on what Dr. King called ``the promissory note'' of our \ndemocracy--the right to ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' \nto all our citizens. It is a testament to the great strides we have \nmade in outlawing the racial injustice that tainted the ideals of \nAmerican society and helped make possible the election of our first \nAfrican-American president and, in Massachusetts, our first African-\nAmerican governor.\n  But the African Meeting House also reminds us of the work and the \nstruggle that continues today. If we are to be fully emancipated from \nthe consequences of slavery, we must understand its history, which \nplayed out so eloquently, so gallantly and so courageously at the \nAfrican Meeting House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7990-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEFENSE LEGISLATIVE FELLOW PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Defense Legislative \nFellow Program and honor the fellows whom I have come to know well \nduring their service in my office since 2009. These individuals have \nbeen among our Nation's best and brightest and they come to Congress \neach year to impart their knowledge to Members and their staffs and \nleave with a better awareness of the political process and the tireless \nand often unheralded work that congressional staff undertake each and \nevery day. In the past 2 years I have had the pleasure of having three \ndefense fellows work in my office: LTC Brooks Tucker, U.S. Marine \nCorps; MAJ Vaughan Byrum, U.S. Army; and MAJ Brett Robinson, U.S. Air \nForce.\n  As a testament to their abilities, MAJ Vaughan Byrum, a 14-year Army \nofficer, prior enlisted soldier, and veteran of the two deployments to \nIraq, is now serving as one of a handful of promising and capable \nofficers representing the Army in the Senate Liaison Office, and Major \nRobinson is completing his tenure in my office and preparing for \nanother demanding assignment in the Washington, DC, area. As an officer \nin the Marine Corps Reserve, LTC Brooks Tucker started as a fellow in \nmy office in 2009, just when I was assigned a spot on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. He has served on both my personal office and \nVeterans' Affairs Committee staffs, and he has been a tireless advocate \nfor North Carolina's veterans and Active-Duty families and has been the \ncritical lynchpin in my efforts to help the service-members and \nfamilies who were impacted by contamination while serving at Camp \nLejeune.\n  I want to express my gratitude to all three of these defense fellows \nfor their service to the U.S. Senate and the people of North Carolina.\n  Major Byrum came to my office after completing a tough and demanding \ntour of duty in Baghdad, training and mentoring the provincial police \nand assisting with the critical transition from coalition to Iraqi \nresponsibility and control. Like many combat veterans whom I have met \nover the years, Major Byrum is the epitome of professionalism, \npossesses a warm sense of humor, and conducts himself with humility and \nimpeccable bearing. A graduate of North Carolina A University and a \nleader in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, Vaughan has a heart as \nbig as his linebacker frame. He is fondly remembered by my staff, who \nwent out of their way to welcome him back to the Senate after an \ninterim assignment serving in the Pentagon. His can-do attitude and \nself-effacing demeanor will serve him well as he works with Senators \nand staff in the months ahead. I know his wife Andrea and daughter \nVictoria are very proud of him. I realize the Byrum family has made \nnumerous sacrifices and endured lengthy separations, and they, like so \nmany others in the military, have borne that burden quietly, with \ncourage and grace.\n  Major Robinson has worked diligently in my Washington office for the \npast year and ably served the people of North Carolina. Before joining \nthe Senate, Major Robinson served as the special operations program \nmanager for the Air National Guard overseeing the special operations \nbudget supporting over 1,000 personnel and 9 aircraft. As a traditional \nAir Guardsman, he serves as a C-130 pilot with the Pennsylvania Air \nNational Guard. Prior to his recent assignments in Washington, DC, \nMajor Robinson completed combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and \ngarnered operational experience on the African Continent, Europe, and \nAsia. A distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, he has \nserved as a tactics officer, pilot, and flight commander and is the \nrecipient of numerous personal decorations for meritorious service over \nhis 13 years in uniform.\n  His tireless work and patient manner has not gone unnoticed, whether \nit be helping a Vietnam combat veteran receive a long overdue \ndecoration for valor, offering operational perspectives on air \noperations in Afghanistan and Libya, or working in concert with \nmilitary commanders and civilian leaders in North Carolina to address \nveterans' needs.\n  And to Jori, his wife, who is also an Air Force officer, thank you \nfor your support and sacrifice as you balance the demands and confront \nthe challenges of life in service to this Nation. I enjoyed meeting you \nand your sons, Grayson and Kiernan, and I know Major Robinson couldn't \ndo what he does without your love and support.\n  I have gotten to know Major Robinson and Major Byrum quite well in \nthe past 2 years. For men with so many rich life experiences and career \naccomplishments to be proud of, they truly epitomize the moniker \n``quiet professional'' and exude a measured demeanor, consistent \ncompetency, and genuine modesty that has made them trusted advisers to \nme and my staff and garnered our admiration and affection. In sum, they \nare superb examples of the finest military in the world.\n  From interns in my office to constituents in the State, to all of my \nstaff in North Carolina, Major Byrum and Major Robinson have impressed \nus at every turn and succeeded in educating us about the honor, \ntradition, and sacrifices made every day by our service men and women \noverseas, especially those of the National Guard.\n  Thank you, MAJ Vaughan M. Byrum and MAJ Brett B. Robinson, for your \ndistinguished year of service to the people of North Carolina and for \nyour continued commitment to protecting our Nation and the prosperity \nof all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7990-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 1917.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REID:\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\n  S. 1919. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \npenalties for transporting minors in foreign commerce for the purposes \nof female genital mutilation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Girls' \nProtection Act of 2011. This legislation addresses a topic that is \ndifficult to talk about. It deals with the issue of female genital \nmutilation, FGM, a harmful cultural ritual with origins in Africa, Asia \nand the Middle East, that involves the removal of part or all of female \ngenitalia.\n  FGM has no medical justification and is not based in religious \nbeliefs. In fact, FGM, which is usually carried out on young girls \nsometime between infancy and fifteen years of age, can cause lifelong \nphysical and psychological damage. The procedure is typically performed \nwithout an anesthetic and can cause bleeding, shock, infections and \neven death because of hemorrhage and unhygienic conditions. Lifelong \nhealth consequences include chronic infection, complications during \npregnancy and labor, as well as severe pain during urination, \nmenstruation, and sexual intercourse. This cruel procedure has been \ninternationally recognized as a violation of the human rights of girls \nand women.\n  I first learned about FGM in 1994 when I read an article reporting \nthe arrest of two men in Egypt who arranged for the filming of this \nappalling ritual procedure being performed on a ten year-old girl. \nAlthough this ritual is predominately practiced in various parts of \nAfrica, Asia, and the Middle East, some ethnic communities in the \nUnited States continue to subject young girls to FGM. This compelled me \nto introduce legislation, which was enacted in 1996, that criminalizes \nthe practice of FGM on girls under the age of 18 in the United States. \nThe legislation I am introducing today seeks to strengthen this law by \nclosing what is known as a ``vacation loophole'' by banning the act of \ntransporting girls overseas to be subject to FGM.\n  While it is difficult to know precisely how many girls in the United \nStates are at risk of being subject to FGM, estimates from various \nsources suggest that approximately 200,000 women living in the United \nStates have been, or are at risk, of being subject to FGM. Enactment of \nThe Girls Protection Act would help to better protect these girls by \nserving as a deterrent for those parents who are considering sending \ntheir young girls to their home countries to undergo FGM.\n  I am introducing The Girls' Protection Act today in honor of \nInternational Human Rights Defenders Day as well as the recognition of \nthe Sixteen Days of Activism Against Gender Violence which occurs \nbetween November 25 and December 10 of each year. It is important to \nhonor those individuals who are working, often under difficult \ncircumstances and hostile social environments, for the advancement of \nwomen's health, dignity and human rights. The passage of this \nlegislation would go a long way to support these efforts and to help \nend this degrading and inhumane practice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRANSPORT FOR FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.\n\n       Section 116 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Whoever knowingly transports from the United States \n     and its territories a person in foreign commerce for the \n     purpose of conduct with regard to that person that would be a \n     violation of subsection (a) if the conduct occurred within \n     the United States, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under \n     this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/29/senate-section/article/S7997-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7997-S7998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 337--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 10, 2011, AS ``WREATHS \n                          ACROSS AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROTECTION OF CRITICAL \n                   COMPONENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ELECTRIC POWER \n                   GRID FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE EVENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Government has a primary \n     responsibility to provide for the common defense and general \n     welfare of the United States.\n       (2) The society, economy, and national security apparatus \n     of the United States are critically dependent upon the \n     availability of electricity.\n       (3) A continuing supply of electricity is necessary for \n     sustaining water supplies, production and distribution of \n     food, fuel, communications, financial services, and other \n     very significant elements of the United States economy.\n       (4) Contemporary United States society is not structured, \n     nor does it have the means, to provide for the needs of \n     nearly 300,000,000 Americans without electricity.\n       (5) Because the existing United States electrical power \n     grid operates at or near its physical capacity, relatively \n     modest damage to the grid could cause functional collapse.\n       (6) Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a threat to the overall \n     electrical power system of the United States.\n       (7) A major electromagnetic pulse event could couple \n     ultimately unmanageable currents and voltages into an \n     electric power grid routinely operated with little margin and \n     cause the collapse of large portions of the United States \n     electric power grid for a substantial length of time.\n       (8) The current strategy for recovery from an \n     electromagnetic pulse event leaves the United States ill-\n     prepared to respond effectively, resulting in potential \n     damage to vast numbers of electric components over an \n     unprecedented geographic scale.\n       (9) A collapse of large portions of the United States \n     electric power grid will result in significant periods of \n     power-outage, and restoration from collapse or loss of \n     significant portions of the system may be exceedingly \n     difficult.\n       (10) If the United States electric power grid is lost for \n     any substantial period of time, the consequences are \n     potentially catastrophic to civilian society.\n       (11) Electromagnetic pulse occurs both naturally, such as \n     geomagnetic storms, and via manmade causes, such as the high-\n     altitude detonation of a nuclear device.\n       (12) The International Atomic Energy Agency released a \n     report in November 2011 that cites concerns over nuclear \n     weapons-related developments in Iran.\n       (13) A perceived vulnerability of the United States \n     electric power grid to electromagnetic pulse could invite a \n     potential enemy to attempt an electromagnetic pulse attack.\n       (14) The Department of Defense relies upon civilian sources \n     outside Department installations for ninety-nine percent of \n     electricity needs.\n       (15) Eighty-five percent of the electricity supply for the \n     Department is outside of Department control.\n       (16) There is deep concern regarding the negative impacts \n     on the United States electric power infrastructure and \n     Department interests from an electromagnetic pulse event \n     unless practical steps are taken to provide protection for \n     critical elements of the United States electric power grid.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to \n     immediately address vulnerabilities to its electric power \n     grid from natural and manmade electromagnetic pulse events, \n     particularly by engaging in efforts to ensure that the United \n     States electric power grid, especially portions of the grid \n     critical to national security, are protected from natural or \n     manmade electromagnetic pulse; and\n       (2) the Department of Defense should ascertain which of its \n     critical sources of electricity are not protected against \n     interruptions from natural or manmade electromagnetic pulse \n     and develop and implement a plan to remedy any such \n     vulnerabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1422.
