Mr. President, I would note the Acting President pro \ntempore today. I had the good fortune of being able to come to the \nfloor last week to talk about the Acting President pro tempore's tenure \nin the Senate--some 6 years--and I talked about some of the many \naccomplishments he had in that relatively short period of time, as we \ncall Senate time.\n  But I am reminded again of the Senator from Virginia, having spent an \nhour on Friday with Bob Kerrey. Bob Kerrey and I reflected back on his \nexperience here in the Senate, and one memorable meeting he and I had. \nThe purpose of that meeting was for Bob Kerrey to introduce me to \nSenator Webb. It was a wonderful meeting because when the meeting \nfinished--and I won't go into the details of everything I said, but the \nSenator from Virginia knows--I came out of that meeting recognizing \nwhat kindred spirits these two gallant warriors were and are, both \nhaving been highly decorated, one in the Navy, the other a marine; one \nwith a Medal of Honor, the other--the Acting President pro tempore--the \nNavy Cross, Silver Star, more than one Bronze Star for Valor, and a \nnumber of Purple Hearts.\n  So I say again, but I can't say it too much, what an honor and \npleasure it has been to serve in this body with the Senator from \nVirginia, Jim Webb. I have learned so much about what a difference a \npositive attitude will make. And there is no better example of that \nthan the new GI bill of rights. To think a new Senator--a brand new \nSenator--would have the idea, the confidence that he could do this; not \nonly the confidence that this bill is important, but he wrote it \nhimself. The Acting President pro tempore wrote that bill himself. He \ndidn't go to bill drafters, as most of us do, he wrote it himself and \nproceeded to get it passed. So this is a man I will miss a whole lot.\n\n\n                              Daniel Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, I want to spend a little time today talking about the \njunior Senator from Hawaii, Daniel Akaka, as he retires from a life \ndedicated to his community and this country.\n  Senator Akaka's service to this Nation began during wartime, when he \nwas a teenager. He graduated from high school and the war was ongoing. \nOf course, people were watching Hawaii very closely because they had \nsuch a huge Asian population--a huge Japanese-American population. So \nit was watched very closely, and for reasons that weren't valid, but \nthat is what we did then.\n  Dan Akaka spent 2 years as a civilian worker with the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers and 2 years on active duty in the U.S. Army. His duties \nwith the Army, as I recall, having talked to Dan\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nAkaka, were to protect the water in Honolulu.\n  After the war, Dan attended the University of Hawaii, using the \noriginal GI bill. Years later, he would receive his master's degree \nfrom the University of Hawaii as well as his bachelor's disagree. \nSenator Akaka believes he would never have become a U.S. Senator if not \nfor the GI benefits he received through his service in the military. \nThat is why, as a member and past chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, he has worked to make important improvements to the 21st \nCentury GI Bill. Today's GI bill is modeled, after the work done by Jim \nWebb, after the educational opportunity program that Dan took advantage \nof when he was a young boy.\n  Senator Akaka was chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee from \n2007 to 2010, as thousands and thousands of Iraqi and Afghanistan \nveterans were coming home from combat. As Democrats collectively worked \nto bring our troops home from Iraq, Dan Akaka labored with the \nVeterans' Administration to meet the needs and challenges of a new \ngeneration of veterans. The 21st Century GI Bill ensures those veterans \nget the educational opportunities they deserve.\n  Dan so valued his own education that he went on to serve his \ncommunity as a teacher after he graduated from college. He became a \nprincipal, worked for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, \nand the Hawaii Office of Economic Opportunity. He served 14 years in \nthe House of Representatives before he was appointed to the Senate in \n1990. He won election to the Senate later that year.\n  As chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Dan has been a strong \nvoice and tireless advocate for Native Americans. He has taught us all \nabout history--the history of Hawaii and its native communities, as \nwell as the issues facing indigenous Hawaiians today.\n  Senator Akaka is a descendent of native Hawaiians. He is 75 percent \nHawaiian and he has Hawaiians on both sides of his family. He is very \nproud of his heritage. Dan was the first Native Hawaiian in the Senate.\n  He is also a deeply religious man who comes from a strong faith \ntradition. His devout mother taught her children a custom of charity. \nHis mother was really a soft touch. Anyone coming by with a sad story, \nshe would invite them in. Sometimes her hospitality only allowed her--\nbecause she had nothing else--to give them something to drink. His \nfamily was very poor when he was young. But Dan was able to work \nthrough this. Even if his mother had spent the grocery money for the \nmonth, strangers were always welcome at her table.\n  A friend of Dan's brother came to Hawaii from Chicago for a very \nbrief period of time, and his mother took him in. He never left. He \nbasically was raised in the Akaka home. A boy named Anthony from \nChicago, as I indicated, came to visit Dan's brother and he never left. \nAnthony became such a part of that family that, before he died, he \nwanted to make sure he was buried in Hawaii. He wanted to be buried \nwith Dan's siblings and family in Hawaii. And he was.\n  Senator Akaka served as choir director of the Hawaii Christian mother \nchurch, where his brother was minister. His brother was minister there \nfor some 17 years. Senator Akaka is still a member of that church.\n  He is blessed with a wonderful family as well as a rewarding career. \nHe and his wife Millie have 5 children, 15 grandchildren, and 14 great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Senator Akaka has served his constituents well and with distinction. \nHe has served not only his constituents and the State of Hawaii but our \ncountry with distinction. He has enjoyed a long and productive career \nand his presence in the Senate will be missed.\n  I offer congratulations to Senator Akaka on his dedicated military \nand public service and wish him and Millie happiness in their \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7712-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with the fiscal cliff fast approaching, \nI feel the need to point out something this morning that is perfectly \nobvious to most Americans but which Democrats in Washington still don't \nseem to grasp. I am referring to the fact that any solution to our \nspending and debt problem has to involve cuts to out-of-control \nWashington spending.\n  I know that might sound obvious to most people, but for all the \nPresident's talk about the need for a balanced approach, the truth is \nhe and his Democratic allies simply refuse to be pinned down on any \nspending cuts. Americans overwhelmingly support some level of cuts to \ngovernment spending as part of a plan to cut the Federal deficit. Yet \nthe President will not commit to it. He refuses to lead on the issue. \nThe President seems to think if all he talks about is taxes, and that \nis all reporters write about, somehow the rest of us will magically \nforget that government spending is completely out of control and that \nhe himself has been insistent on balance.\n  A couple of weeks ago we saw his plan. After four straight trillion-\ndollar deficits and 2 years of running around calling for a balanced \napproach to bring those deficits under control, we saw his idea of \nbalance--a $1.6 trillion tax hike, new and totally unprecedented power \nto raise the Federal debt limit at his whim, and a $50 billion stimulus \nfor infrastructure; in other words, even more spending.\n  So when it came to offering his idea of a balanced approach, the \nPresident was vague about cuts but very specific in his request for \nmore government spending--something no reasonable person had publicly \ncontemplated previously. It raises the question: Do Democrats even \nbelieve their own rhetoric on spending? Or, contrary to the clear \nwishes of the majority of Americans, do they just want more tax revenue \nto fund a government without any limits--any limits whatsoever--which \nkeeps getting bigger and bigger with every passing year?\n  Think about it. The Federal Government spent $1.8 trillion in 2001, \nand last year--10 years later--$3.6 trillion. These are nominal \ndollars, I realize, but by any measure the size of government has grown \nwell beyond its means. Government spending is completely and totally \nout of control and we need to start acting like it.\n  Yesterday the Government Accountability Office revealed that \ngovernment workers and private contractors are doing the same exact \nwork on Medicaid claims, leading to billions in waste. Meanwhile, \nSenator Coburn has shown all of us some of the ridiculous things \ntaxpayers are paying for with their tax dollars--some of the things \nthat caused us to spend a trillion dollars more than we take in every \nsingle year.\n  Last year he put out a report showing how we could save more than \n$100 billion--about one-tenth of the annual deficit--by eliminating \nduplicative and overlapping government programs. We have 94 Federal \ninitiatives aimed at encouraging green building through 11 different \nFederal agencies. We have 14 programs with the sole purpose of reducing \ndiesel emissions.\n  A few weeks ago Senator Coburn issued a study that showed taxpayers \nare funding Moroccan pottery classes, promoting shampoo and other \nbeauty products for cats and dogs, and a video game that allows them to \nrelive prom night.\n  Taxpayers also just spent $325,000 on a robotic squirrel named Robo-\nSquirrel. The President just sent us a 73-page report detailing how $60 \nbillion in Sandy funds would be spent. Don't you think he could put \ntogether a list of spending cuts that would at least include Robo \nSquirrel?\n  We are still waiting. Why? Because for Democrats apparently every \ndollar in Federal spending is sacred; once secured, it can't be cut. \nThat is why we have trillion-dollar deficits. The truth is, until the \nPresident gets specific about cuts, nobody should trust Democrats to \nput a dime in new revenue toward real deficit reduction or to stop \ntheir shakedown of the taxpayers at the top 2 percent. As one liberal \nlawmaker put it last week, that's just the beginning.\n  When it comes to deficit deals, the taxpayers need to trust but \nverify. On cuts, that means specifics.\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. President, as we enter the final weeks of the 112th Congress, one \nof the toughest tasks for me is saying goodbye to colleagues who will \nnot be with us at the start of the next Congress.\n  I would like to kick it off this morning by spending just a few \nminutes bragging on my longtime friend and neighbor to the north, \nSenator Dick Lugar.\n  Let me start by saying I am grateful to have served alongside this \ngood man and to have had a front-row seat for much of his illustrious \ncareer.\n  To give an idea of the kind of career Dick Lugar has had, consider \nthis: He was an Eagle Scout, first in his class in high school, first \nin his class in college, a Rhodes Scholar, Naval intelligence briefer, \ncorporate turnaround artist, and big-city mayor. That was all by the \nage of 35. He has excelled at everything he has ever done. Most \nincredibly, he has done it with perfectly smooth elbows. Walk into any \noffice on Capitol Hill and you would not find a single person who would \nsay a bad word about Dick Lugar. He has earned the respect and \nadmiration of everyone who ever crossed his path. I assure you, in the \nworld of politics, that is nothing short of a miracle. Now Dick has \ndecided to press his luck. He is moving into the only line of work \nwhere rivalries are even more vicious than in politics--he is becoming \na college professor.\n  Dick and I go all the way back to my first Senate race in 1984. He \nwas the head of the NRSC at the time. He took a chance on me, and I \nhave always been grateful. He has been a friend ever since.\n  A lot of Hoosiers cross the Ohio River every day to work in Kentucky, \nbut it is not often a Hoosier Senator crosses it to help a Kentuckian \nmaking his first bid for the Senate. Since we are from neighboring \nStates, our work in the Senate has often overlapped over the years. I \ntruly lucked out. Dick has always been helpful and cooperative and a \nperfect gentleman.\n  With his six terms in the Senate, Senator Lugar is the longest \nserving Member of Congress in Indiana history. He ranks 10th on the \nlist of Senators who have cast the most rollcall votes.\n  As the longtime chair or ranking member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, he has become one of America's most respected voices on \nmatters pertaining to foreign policy. Indeed, Senator Lugar commands \nthe highest respect not only from his peers in the Senate but around \nthe world, for his deep knowledge of foreign policy, national security, \nagriculture, and trade.\n  To a lot of liberals, he is a walking contradiction: a Republican \nintellectual. He has always worn that reputation lightly. Anyone who \nhas ever been on a CODEL with Dick has seen his method. He stuffs his \ncarry-on to the point of bursting with memos, newspapers, magazines, \njournals, reports, survey data, you name it. Apparently, Trent Lott sat \nnext to him on the plane once and was horrified at the way he tore out \nthe pages and scribbled notes on them. We all know Trent would never be \nso indelicate.\n  Senator Lugar has always had a global view. It started during his \ndays as a Rhodes Scholar and an intelligence briefer in the Navy and he \nbrought that global view back to Indiana. After the untimely death of \nhis dad, Dick and his brother took over the family business and \nreinvented it from a struggling domestic operation to a global leader \nin the manufacture of baking machinery.\n  He went from success to success, moving from a seat on the \nIndianapolis school board into the mayor's office, and then, in 1996, \non to the Senate. What a Senate career it has been.\n  For my part, I think Senator Lugar's achievement in passing the Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threats Reduction Program in 1991 was a great \nachievement, not just for himself but for the entire world.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program provides assistance to former Soviet states \nsuch as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus in helping them \ndismantle and destroy their nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, \nin order to prevent them from coming under the control of terrorists.\n  As of 2011, Nunn-Lugar has deactivated over 7,600 strategic warheads, \n791 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 669 submarine-launched \nballistic missiles, 32 nuclear submarines, and 194 nuclear test \ntunnels. It has neutralized 1,395 metric tons of chemical weapons, and \nit has certified that the countries of the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and \nBelarus--which once held the third, fourth, and eighth largest nuclear \narsenals in the world, respectively--are now nuclear-free. What an \nincredible legacy.\n  After the September 11 attacks, Senator Lugar called for and helped \npass the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar approach, resulting in the Global \nThreat Reduction Initiative, which aims to prevent chemical and \nbiological weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists. He has \nbeen a leader in Congress on the issue of ensuring food safety and \nsupply internationally for years.\n  It is the mark of a leader that he thinks not only of his own moment \nin time but of the future of his community and of his fellow man, here \nand around the world. I think it is safe to say few Senators embody \nthat spirit as fully as Senator Lugar. That is not just my opinion. For \nhis work to make the world a safer place, Senator Lugar has been justly \nnominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  Senator Lugar was first elected to the Senate in 1976 and has served \nfor six terms. He is beloved in his home State of Indiana and in \nbordering Kentucky too. There is not only a lot of admiration but a lot \nof affection for this giant of the Senate just south of Hoosier \nterritory.\n  Senator Lugar has put his extraordinary talent to the service of this \ninstitution and his fellow countrymen, and I have no doubt he will be \nremembered as one of the best.\n  Senator Lugar would probably tell us his greatest achievement was \nmarrying Char. They have been married now for more than 50 years. They \nare proud of their four sons and their 13 grandchildren, and they can \nbe proud of the great teamwork they have had together over the years, \nfrom their time as co-presidents of their senior class at Denison \nUniversity. Char and the boys were involved in all his campaigns. The \nSenate family is sad to see them go as well.\n  Senator, you are a treasure to the Senate and a model of the public \nservant. We are sorry to see you go, and I am sorry to lose your wise \ncounsel. I know that whatever you turn to next, you will be a great \nsuccess, and I look forward to hearing all about it. Thank you for your \ntremendous service to this body, to the State of Indiana, and to the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7713-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me first echo the comments of the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, about our colleague and friend, \nSenator Dick Lugar of Indiana.\n  It has been my good fortune now for some 16 years to serve in the \nSenate with Senator Dick Lugar and to come to know him and his wife \nChar and, more importantly, to come to know their work together on \nbehalf of Indiana and the United States. Dick Lugar is truly a giant in \nthe Senate. We are going to miss him. There aren't many with the vision \nof Dick Lugar.\n  There is something about standing in the middle of this country, \nAdlai Stevenson II once noted, with the flatlands all around you that \ngives you a perspective on the world a little different. Dick Lugar's \nperspective on the world has been so insightful and so important for \ndecades.\n  His work with Senator Nunn in dealing with the proliferation of \nnuclear weaponry and the dissolution of the Soviet Union was truly \nhistoric and\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nmay have saved the world from catastrophe time and again. He reached \nout to a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama and \ntook him on a congressional delegation tour to look into this issue. I \nthink at the end of the day their friendship was solid, and President \nObama notes it was one of the more important overseas visits he made as \na Member of the Senate.\n  I know Dick Lugar as well from the many times we came together with \nour wives at the Aspen Institute. It is truly unfortunate that there \naren't more Senators participating in the Aspen Institute. It is a \nmeeting, usually overseas, of members of the Senate and their spouses \nwith experts to discuss some of the most important problems facing us \nin this world. No lobbyists are allowed to attend; it is truly 2 or 3 \ndays of work. But it is also a time in the evening to sit together and \ncome to know a family. Loretta and I have come to know Char and Dick \nLugar as exceptional people. Char and I would sit and talk about \nbooks--which she loves to read and I do too--and Dick and I would talk \nabout the topic of the day, and we created a bond of friendship in \nthose experiences.\n  He has done so much work in the Senate, as Senator McConnell noted, \nstarting as the mayor of Indianapolis and working his way up to the \nSenate. He became a powerful force in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and I was honored to serve on that committee over the last \nseveral years and watch his work unfold and evolve.\n  Dick Lugar is going on to great things, I am sure. This is not the \nend of his service to our country. I wish him and Char the very best, \nwhatever their next undertaking may be.\n  As you receive praise from the Senator from Kentucky to the south of \nIndiana, accept some from the Senator from west of Indiana in the State \nof Illinois. I am honored to count Dick Lugar as a friend, and I am \nsure going to miss you. You have been an extraordinary ally and \ncolleague on so many important issues.\n\n\n                              Daniel Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, I also add my comments in chorus to what the majority \nleader said about Senator Dan Akaka of Hawaii.\n  I came to know him--and I have spoken about this on the floor--and \nMillie who are the perfect Senate family. They have devoted a major \npart of their lives to serving Hawaii and serving in the national \ninterest.\n  The legacy Senator Akaka leaves behind is substantial when it comes \nto legislation, particularly in helping veterans and agricultural \nissues. But, more important, what Dan Akaka leaves behind is the \nfeeling of kinship and camaraderie which he has with so many Members of \nthe Senate. He is a stalwart at the Senate Prayer Breakfast, leading \nthe singing every Wednesday morning, and it is heartfelt and very \ngenuine.\n  As Senator Reid mentioned earlier, his family background of Hawaii--\nwhich he shared with us one afternoon at a lunch--is a tradition of \ngiving and hospitality which we find built in to Danny Akaka. We are \ngoing to miss him.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  To the Presiding Officer--I said a few words on the floor before--we \nthank you for your service. You did an extraordinary job here. There \naren't many one-termers who make a mark in the Senate and on the \nNation. You did it.\n  I can remember--I thought it was a little bold of you, maybe even \nmore--when you came in and said: I want to rewrite the GI bill, and you \ndid it and it was exceptional. You have helped thousands of men and \nwomen who have served in our military come back to America and be \nwelcomed and be productive parts of our future.\n  In so many ways, I wish to thank Senator Jim Webb, our Presiding \nOfficer, for being an important and viable part of the Senate. I know \nyou will continue to serve our Nation in many different capacities in \nthe future, and I am sure they will be equally exceptional.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7714-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7714-S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have to answer some of the comments made \nearlier by the Republican leader as he talked about the state of \nnegotiations between the President and Congress as we face the fiscal \ncliff. He said at one point that the President is calling for raising \ntaxes $1.6 trillion. That is true. But I would call to his attention \nthat the Simpson-Bowles Commission suggested that 40 percent of the $4 \ntrillion in deficit reduction comes from revenue and taxes. What the \nPresident is suggesting is entirely consistent with that bipartisan \ngroup's call for more revenue and taxes as part of our deficit \nreduction.\n  The President has made it clear, though, that he wants to protect and \ninsulate middle-income families from any income tax increases, and I \nagree with him. We should not raise the income taxes on those making \nless than $250,000 a year. I voted that way in July. We sent the bill \nto the House. It sits there. It languishes in the House because the \nSpeaker will not call it. He has his chance this week or next to call \nthat bill on the floor of the House of Representatives to avoid any tax \nincrease on middle-income families. That is an important bill for us to \nget done before we leave at the end of this particular session of \nCongress.\n  Let me say that $1.6 trillion in taxes over 10 years is not an \nunreasonable amount. The tax rate the President is asking for is the \nrate that was in place during the expansive period in our economy under \nPresident Bill Clinton. To argue that the President has gone too far in \nasking for tax and revenue is to ignore the obvious. It is the same \npercentage asked for by Simpson-Bowles, if not less, and it is a tax \nrate that, frankly, ruled in this country at a period of time when we \nhad more jobs and businesses created than ever in recent history.\n  A second argument that was made by the Republican leader is that \nthere is a proposal from the President to raise the debt ceiling at his \nwhim. Those are his words. I beg to differ. What the President has \nproposed is exactly the McConnell procedure. Senator McConnell of \nKentucky suggested to us that we have a process for extending the debt \nceiling that allows Members of Congress to vote to approve or \ndisapprove and ultimately for the President to decide whether to sign \ninto law--their resolution of disapproval, for example. That, of \ncourse, could lead to a veto and another opportunity for Congress to \nvote again.\n  This was a process Senator McConnell suggested. It was a way out of a \nbind when the House Republicans and others threatened to shut down the \neconomy over the debt ceiling extension, which is, in fact, the \nmortgage of the United States of America. It would have otherwise led \nto the first major default on America's debt in our history, with \ncalamitous results when it came to the impact on our economy.\n  For the Republican leader to come to the floor and criticize the very \nsame procedure he suggested and voted for I think is hard to understand \nand explain. Last week he came to the floor and suggested that we \nenshrine it in law. He offered the bill on the floor. Senator Reid came \nand said: We accept your invitation, and we will take a rollcall vote \non that, at which point Senator McConnell filibustered his own bill \nthat he had introduced, I recall, earlier in the day. I think he made \nhistory in the Senate, filibustering his own bill when we had a chance \nto vote and pass it.\n  I would say this notion that the President is looking for an \nextraordinary power when it comes to the debt ceiling is not quite \naccurate. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, if we accept your \napproach to it, it will give the Senate and House a voice, but we will \nnot risk default.\n  Third, the Senator from Kentucky was lamenting the size of government \ngrowth. When we took a look at the last time we balanced the budget and \nhad a surplus in Washington, it was under President William Jefferson \nClinton, a little over 12 years ago. What has happened to spending \nsince President Clinton's balanced budget? It has gone up \nsubstantially. Where has it gone up? In domestic discretionary \naccounts, which are often the target of speeches like Senator \nMcConnell's today? No. That has basically been flatlined when you take \ninflation into consideration. The dramatic growth in government \nspending since we were last in balance has been in two areas. One of \nthose was in military spending. I might add that the reason it has \ngrown dramatically is we have been at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\nPresident has extricated us from Iraq, and we are in the process of \nleaving Afghanistan.\n  If you want to know why government spending has gone up so fast, \nthere has been a 64-percent increase in military spending since the \nbudget was last in balance. There was no increase in domestic \ndiscretionary spending when you take inflation into account but 64 \npercent in military spending. That is why spending has gone up. Yet, \nwhen they suggest we will cut spending in the sequester, people say: \nYou cannot touch it; it has to continue to grow. I question that. I \nthink we can be safe as a nation and really address the wasteful \nspending taking place in the Pentagon as well as every other government \nagency.\n  Where else is there a growth in government spending? The same \nanalysis by Senator Inouye says that since the budget was in balance, \nthe expenditures in entitlement spending have gone up 30 percent--30 \npercent. It is a substantial pool of money. Why? Because yesterday \n10,000 Americans reached the age of 65, today another 10,000, tomorrow \nanother 10,000 and every day for the next 18 years as the boomers \narrive. To lament the growth in entitlements is to ignore the obvious: \nwe have more people calling on Social Security and Medicare for help. \nPeople have paid into these systems for a lifetime and now--I think \nquite rightfully--expect to be covered by the same programs they have \nsupported for so many years in their working lives.\n  Is the Senator from Kentucky suggesting that we need to cut back when \nit comes to eligibility in Social Security and Medicare? That would \nsure restrain the growth, but it would be fundamentally unfair and \nunwise to tell people who paid in a lifetime to Social Security and \nMedicare that now you do not get your benefits.\n  Let's be honest about the growth in government spending. When you \nhave wars that you do not pay for, when you have entitlement programs \ncreated, such as the Medicare prescription Part D, unpaid for, when you \nhave a growth in entitlements just by the demographic growth in \nAmerica, that accounts for a lot of the increase in spending.\n  There is one other key element. A large measure of the increase in \nFederal spending has been increased health care costs, and we estimate \nthat in the next 10 to 20 years, 70 percent of Federal budget outlays \nwill grow because of increased health care costs. We addressed this. We \nwent after the growth in health care costs with the President's \nObamaCare--the health care reform bill--in an attempt to contain it and \nhad not one single Republican who would join us in that effort. Not \none. We ended up passing it exclusively as a Democratic bill. That is a \nshame because I think Democrats and Republicans should share the same \ngoal of trying to reduce the increased cost of health care spending.\n  When it comes to the President's offer, we need a bold approach \nagain. We need to contain the spending costs as we already have, \nalready cutting $1 trillion in spending to date. We need to have \nrevenue sources, which the President has asked for, and we need to look \nat entitlement programs--I want to be very specific--not entitlement \ncuts per se but entitlement reform. Untouched, Medicare runs out of \nmoney in 12 years. That is a challenge to each and every one of us \ntoday--not 12 years from now but today. What will we do in the next \nyear, looking at entitlement programs such as Medicare, to make sure \nthey have a life well beyond 12 years? I think that is a responsibility \nwe should face squarely, and it should be part of this deficit \nnegotiation. I am not for a quick fix that is introduced in the next \ncouple of days or hours; rather, I would like to see a thoughtful \nrepair and reform of Medicare and other entitlement programs so they \nwill continue to be in service in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7715-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7715-S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GREATER EXPORTS TO AFRICA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have visited Africa many times. When I \nhave, I have left with an amazing impression of this great continent \nand all that it contains. It really does lure one and draw you back to \nthe different places in Africa that offer such a rich history but also \noffer great opportunity.\n  What I find in Africa today is that China has an increasing presence \non that continent. China has a plan when it comes to the future of \nAfrica. America does not. That is why I am going to offer as an \namendment to the TAG bill which is currently pending before the Senate \nthe American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act. My partners on \nthe bill are Senators Chris Coons, Ben Cardin, John Boozman, and Mary \nLandrieu, as well as support in the House from Representative Chris \nSmith.\n  At the heart of this bill is the creation of jobs in America. \nExporting more goods to Africa will help create jobs here. Every $1 \nbillion in exports supports over 5,000 jobs. I believe we can increase \nexports from the United States to Africa by 200 percent in real dollars \nover the next 10 years, and we cannot wait any longer.\n  If there are some who say that Africa is so backward and so far \nbehind, what is it in the United States they can afford to buy if they \neven wanted to, that is old thinking. Let me give you some new reality. \nIn the past 10 years, 6 of the world's fastest growing economies are in \nSub-Saharan Africa, and in the next 5 years Sub-Saharan Africa will \nboast seven of the top fastest growing economies in the world. The \nnumber of Africans with access to the Internet has increased over the \nlast 10 years fourfold to 27 percent. From 1998 to today, the number of \nmobile phones on the continent have grown from 4 million to 500 \nmillion, and 78 percent of Africa's rural population has access to \nclean water. These are signs of a growing middle class.\n  China sees it. We have to see it. China is insinuating itself into \nthe economy of major Africa nations. They are offering concessional \nloans, and they are offering their contractors, their engineers, and \ntheir investment in Africa. We are not. We are going to rue the day. \nAfrica is a great opportunity for us, and this bill addresses it.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues in the Senate will consider supporting \nthis greater exports to Africa trade bill. This is something we can do \nto increase jobs in America, increase trade with Africa, and really \nbuild those countries that share our values. The difference between the \nUnited States, China, and other countries? We come to the marketplace \nwith values, and we have to make certain those values are protected and \nencouraged. We can only do that if we are honest traders and we are \nactively engaged in expanding the markets for our goods and services.\n  Over the years and during my travels, I have heard from African \nleaders and American businesses the same story--the U.S. has fallen \nwoefully behind other countries in its commercial engagement with \nAfrica. And our government does not have a coordinated strategy to help \nmatch the aggressive efforts of other nations trying to invest in \nAfrica. In endorsing this bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nwritten that, ``Congress has an opportunity to reverse this decline.''\n  But why would U.S. businesses and groups representing them, groups \nlike the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Corporate Council on Africa, \nthink this effort is so important? As I have said, in the past 10 \nyears, 6 of the world's fastest growing economies are in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and in the next 5 years Sub-Saharan Africa will boast 7 of the \ntop 10 fastest economies.\n  From 2000 to 2009, the number of Africans with access to the internet \nhas increased four-fold to 27 percent.\n  From 1998 to today, the number of mobile phones on the continent has \ngrown from 4 million to more than 500 million, and 78 percent of \nAfrica's rural population has access to clean water.\n  These are signs of a growing middle class and what the World Bank has \ncalled ``the brink of an economic take-off'' for Africa. U.S. \nbusinesses must be a part of that take-off, and our government must \nprovide a cohesive system of support and a coherent national strategy \nto enable it. That is what this bill does, and it does so at almost no \ncost. It would develop a comprehensive strategy to coordinate the work \nof several U.S. government agencies that help U.S. businesses export \nAmerican products and services to Africa.\n  The bill creates a Special Africa Export Strategy Coordinator to \nensure that these government agencies are working together efficiently, \nand in a way that businesses of all sizes can navigate easily. It is \nsmart, low cost,\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nand it creates enormous returns on investment in jobs, diplomatic \ninfluence, and engagement.\n  Meanwhile, other countries are positioning themselves to be there for \nthe coming African economic boom--countries like Brazil, India, and you \nguessed it, China. China has aggressively moved in. In fact, today, \nChina is Africa's largest trading partner. China has pumped billions of \ndollars into Africa, often in the form of concessional loans--loans \nbelow market rates that have favorable payback options. These loans are \nhard to resist for developing countries, and they're hard for American \ncompanies to compete with.\n  Between 2008 and 2010, China provided more financing to the \ndeveloping world than the World Bank--loans totaling more than $110 \nbillion. This money buys China access to markets, natural resources, \nconsumers, and political influence. A recent story on CNN.com, entitled \n``Chinese Media Make Inroads into Africa,'' shows the kind of \naggressive engagement we are up against.\n  This past January, state-owned Chinese Central Television opened its \nfirst broadcast hub outside of Beijing. Where did they put it? Mumbai? \nLondon? Rio? Try Nairobi. Another Chinese state-run news organization \nhas more than 20 bureaus on the African continent, part of what is \ncalled the China Africa News Service. According to the article, it's \nall part of an effort ``to win the hearts and minds of people in the \ncontinent and create a more fertile business environment.'' And it's at \nour expense. It should make us take a hard look at what the U.S. \nGovernment is doing to promote and support our own businesses. And that \nis what this bill does.\n  But this bill is not just good for American interests, it is also \ngood for Africa--something our competitors are not always concerned \nwith. While the Chinese may offer sweetheart deals that buyers can't \nresist, the price of doing business with China is much higher than just \nthe cost of repaying loans.\n  To calculate the real price you have to add to the sum the precious \nnatural resources that China gobbles up for its growing economy back \nhome and the environmental devastation that comes from its general lack \nof concern for environmental standards. You have to add the cost of \nAfricans losing out on work when the Chinese ship in their own labor to \nbuild the projects they are bankrolling. And when Africans do get the \njobs you have to consider the cost of the poor labor standards and \nworking conditions they have to endure. And lastly you have to consider \nChina's indifference to democracy, corruption, and human rights \nstandards.\n  A recent New York Times article illustrated an even greater cost--a \nfar more deadly side of Chinese involvement in Africa. It dealt with \nthe resurgence of ivory poaching in Uganda and Kenya and the DRC. It is \na resurgence that has resulted in tens of thousands of elephants being \nslaughtered over the past several years and, get this, it is a \nresurgence fueled by Chinese demand--as much as 70 percent of the ivory \nis smuggled to China. In fact, the article goes on to say that there is \ngrowing evidence that ivory poaching actually increases in elephant-\nrich areas where Chinese construction workers are building roads.\n  Now, I said this was a deadly consequence of Chinese involvement in \nAfrica, but I didn't mean just for elephants. Much of the money from \nthis Chinese-fueled increase in the ivory trade ends up in the hands of \ninternational fugitive Joseph Kony and his band of murdering thugs. It \nis widely believed that Kony's Lord's Resistance Army has embraced \nivory poaching to fund its reign of terror.\n  The U.S. Government should seek a level of engagement with our \nAfrican partners that makes American companies and American products \ncompetitive alternatives to what China has to offer. That's what this \nbill does. It would establish a minimum number of commercial Foreign \nService officers to be stationed at U.S. embassies in Africa and the \nmulti-lateral investment banks. It would increase the Export Import \nBank staff presence on the ground in Africa. That means better support \nfor U.S. businesses on the continent and better interface with African \ngovernments. The bill would also formalize the training economic and \ncommercial officers receive, so they are fully aware of all the tools \navailable for export promotion and financing--a benefit to businesses \nwho want to do business in Africa, or anywhere in the world. And \nfinally, it would equip the U.S. government to counter the aggressive \nconcessional--or below market--loans that many African nations cannot \nresist.\n  The Increasing American Jobs through Greater Exports to Africa Act \nhas something for everyone to support. It is good for the American \neconomy. It helps U.S. businesses create jobs here at home by tapping \ninto a burgeoning overseas market hungry for our products. It is good \nU.S. foreign policy. It positions America to maintain our global \nleadership in a shifting geopolitical landscape. And it is good for the \npeople of the African continent. Superior American products and \nbusiness practices would become more competitive and financially \naccessible to them.\n  That is why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously \napproved this common sense bill. Now the full Senate has a chance to do \nthe same. I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical effort. \nWe must commit today that the United States will not be left behind in \nAfrica. Every day we wait, countries such as China expand their \neconomic, political, and diplomatic footprint on the continent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7716-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7716-S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WIND ENERGY TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I come to the floor again to \nurge my colleagues to extend the production tax credit for wind energy. \nI would like to note that on the heels of Senator Durbin's comments \nabout China, we wish the Chinese energy industry well, but we do not \nwant to outsource our wind energy jobs to China needlessly. We are on a \npath to do so.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa here, Senator Grassley, who I know will \nspeak later on the wind production tax credit, but it is going to \nexpire in less than 1 month from now--December 31, to be specific--if \nwe do not act. That means we are 1 month away from pulling the rug out \nfrom under an industry that is currently playing a key role in \nrevitalizing American manufacturing, creating jobs, and powering our \nNation. We are literally 1 month away from ending a credit that \nsupports tens of thousands of workers right here in the United States.\n  Each day that we wait to extend the PTC, we risk losing more good-\npaying American jobs. We also risk doing away with a credit that is a \nmajor contributor to the success and development of our Nation's wind \nindustry. This credit has helped companies leverage billions of \ndollars' worth of investments and created thousands of made-in-America \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  If history is any guide, allowing this critical tax credit to expire \nwould be disastrous. The expiration of the PTC in 2000, 2002, and 2004 \nled to massive drops in wind energy installation. Already in my home \nState of Colorado this year we have seen hundreds of layoffs across the \nFront Range due to our heel-dragging on the PTC.\n  Each time I discuss the PTC on the Senate floor, I highlight a \ndifferent State to show the vitality of the wind industry in that \nparticular State, how this important credit has created jobs for that \nState's economy. Today I am here to talk about Iowa, America's \nheartland and the homeland of the PTC.\n  In Iowa wind power is no longer an alternative source of energy. In \nfact, Iowa has become the Nation's No. 2 producer of wind energy, \nproviding close to 20 percent of the State's electric power. Its \npotential is not even close to being fully tapped. Iowa's wind \nresources could someday produce up to 44 times the State's current \nelectricity needs.\n  Let me share some specifics with my colleagues. Nearly 3,000 turbines \nspin statewide in Iowa, and Iowa is home to various manufacturing \nfacilities that produce wind turbines and components. The industry \nemploys nearly 7,000 Iowans, half of whom are located at manufacturing \nfacilities all across the State.\n\n  Take, for example, Pocahontas County. We can see the map of Iowa \nhere. There are a total of 216 wind turbines that have been constructed \nin Pocahontas County. When all turbines are\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nat full taxable value, they will contribute an estimated total of \nalmost $190 million to the total county tax base. This means additional \nrevenue for local budgets and additional money for investments in \nschools and critical community projects.\n  Iowans know the possibilities and potential a continued investment in \nwind energy holds for their future. However, I wish to underline again \nthat if we do not act, good-paying jobs will continue to be lost and an \nindustry that is critical to our energy independence will be hit very \nhard.\n  This is simply unacceptable. Already Siemens Energy is laying off 615 \nworkers in three States, including Iowa. The company Siemens has \nacknowledged that difficult market conditions are due to congressional \ninaction on the PTC.\n  My colleagues from Iowa, Senators Grassley and Harkin, have been \nstanding with me to fight for the renewal of the production tax credit. \nSenator Grassley is known as the father of the wind production tax \ncredit. He led the charge some 20 years ago to establish this credit, \nand I applaud him and Senator Harkin for their work in the renewable \nenergy sector and their dedication to extending this important credit. \nThey know the PTC is a win for Iowa and a win for the United States. \nThat is why it is so important--beyond important--to extend the PTC as \nsoon as possible. The PTC equals jobs, and we ought to pass it as soon \nas possible.\n  As my colleagues keep telling me and we hear from the American \npeople, there is no reason to outsource these jobs. There is no reason \nto outsource energy production, and there is no reason to damage a \ngrowing industry that is helping America become energy independent. \nCongress needs to pass an extension of the production tax credit today. \nWe can't wait any longer.\n  Let's create jobs and build the clean energy economy of the future. \nLet's extend the wind production tax credit and let's do it now. It is \nthat simple. The production tax credit equals jobs. Let's pass it ASAP.\n  Again, I wish to acknowledge my colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, who has been a leader in this important policy area for the \nlast 20 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I had an opportunity to \nhear what Senator Udall of Colorado had to say about Iowa and my \nparticipation, and I thank him very much for his kind remarks.\n  This year Senator Mark Udall is the champion of people speaking about \nthe wind energy tax credit. I have spoken a few times, but he has \nspoken for every State that has a wind energy business. He has spoken \nmany times more than I have, and I wish to compliment Senator Udall \nfrom Colorado for doing that.\n  I think it is a foregone conclusion that after 20 years' of \ninvestment of taxpayer money in what we call the tax incentive for wind \nenergy, and with the industry just about becoming a mature industry--\nand there are different points of view within the industry, but in just \na few years it will be starting to phase out--this wind energy tax \ncredit can go away because it will be a mature industry much as the \nethanol tax credit went away at the end of last year. So with this \ntremendous investment, it seems to me it would be a shame not to \ncontinue it so we can get to maturity, and then in a sense ratify the \ndecision of the good investment of taxpayer money that has already been \nmade.\n  So today it is my privilege to join my colleague, Senator Udall of \nColorado, on the floor of the Senate to discuss the importance of wind \nenergy and the need to extend the production tax credit for wind. I \nappreciate Senator Udall's commitment to the production tax credit for \nwind energy. As I have said before, but I wish to say it again, he has \ncome to the floor many times during the past several months to \nhighlight the importance of wind energy in the various States. He has \nbeen a real leader on this issue.\n  As Senator Udall has said, I have been a longtime supporter of the \nwind energy tax credit beginning with my authorship of the first wind \nproduction tax credit in 1992. At the time, I have to confess I didn't \nsee coming, for my State or for the Nation as a whole, the big deal it \nhas become not only in the production of wind energy and Iowa being No. \n2 in the Nation, but also the component manufacturing that goes on in \nmost every State involved in wind energy, including my own State. \nParticularly, I didn't foresee, at a time when most of our talk about \nexporting jobs is actually exporting jobs, and in my State, at least \nfrom two countries, Spain and Germany, we have been able to import \njobs--or I should say import the ability to create jobs through foreign \ninvestment--for the component manufacturing. So it has been a success \nin so many ways.\n  Maybe one other point that ought to be emphasized at this time: Some \nMembers--and maybe more Members in the other body--seem to be more \ncynical about any sort of investment in green energy because of \nSolyndra and other places where taxpayer money has gone in the way of \ngrants and then there has been immediate bankruptcy, resulting in a \nwaste of taxpayer money. There is absolutely no benefit from the wind \nenergy tax credit unless energy is actually produced. So it is not \ngoing to be one of those situations where through taxpayer money, \nthrough a tax incentive, money is going to some company and not reaping \nthe benefits of it, the end result in this case being the production of \nwind energy.\n  The production tax credit for wind is working and should be a part of \nthe effort in Washington to get more Americans working. Nationally, the \nwind energy industry supports 75,000 jobs. There are more than 400 \nmanufacturing facilities nationwide supplying wind components. Thirty-\nfive percent of all new electricity generation added during the last 5 \nyears was from wind, and this happens to be more than from coal and \nnuclear combined. Today, 60 percent of a wind turbine's value is \nproduced in the United States, compared with just 25 percent in the \nyear 2005.\n  As I have said so often, my home State of Iowa is a leader in wind \nenergy production and component manufacturing. Nearly 20 percent of \nIowa's electricity needs are met from wind energy, powering the \nequivalent of 1 million homes. Almost 3,000 utility-scale turbines in \nIowa generate lease payments to landowners, worth $14 million every \nyear. Iowa is behind only Texas nationally in terms of installed wind \ncapacity. The wind energy employs more than 6,000 Iowans. These jobs \nare at risk because Congress has so far failed to extend the production \ntax credit which is set to expire at the end of the year.\n  In fact, hundreds of Iowans employed in wind energy have already been \nlaid off because of slowing demand over uncertainty of tax credits, and \nthere will be more laid off in my State except in one city where they \nare manufacturing components to go to Canada for use in wind energy in \nCanada. Certainty about tax policy and affordable energy, then, are \nfactors for economic growth and getting unemployed workers back on the \nassembly line.\n  As much energy as possible--both traditional and renewable--should be \nproduced at home to create jobs and strengthen national security. Wind \nenergy is obviously a free resource, and it is abundant in many places \naround the country. I suppose we could say wind is abundant every \nplace, but at speeds that make the production of energy from wind cost-\neffective.\n  In my State, most of these facilities are in northwest Iowa where the \nwind averages about 14 miles per hour compared to going diagonally down \nto the southeast corner of the State where it averages about 8 miles \nper hour. So if there is enough constant wind, this is very definitely \na free resource.\n  Wind is also a homegrown resource. The electricity it generates is \nproduced on local farms for local customers and often adds investment \nvalue to the community. A clean, renewable source such as wind is not \ndependent on faraway countries with leaders, in the case of petroleum, \nfor instance, who happen to be so hostile to the United\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nStates even as they take our energy dollars and maybe use those against \nus. That is why there is broad support for extending this worthwhile \npolicy.\n  Legislation in the House of Representatives to extend the production \ntax credit has 119 cosponsors, including 25 Republicans. In August the \nSenate Finance Committee, with a bipartisan vote, passed my extension \nof the wind energy production tax credit amendment I offered at that \nparticular time.\n  The Governors' Wind Energy Coalition and the Western Governors' \nAssociation have called for an extension of the production tax credit. \nThe Western Governors' Association is an independent organization \nrepresenting Governors of 19 States, and current membership includes 13 \nRepublicans and 6 Democratic Governors. So there is pretty broad \nbipartisan consensus among Governors that this ought to be extended.\n  I was pleased to join a press conference a few weeks ago with Senator \nMark Udall and over 40 military veterans representing Operation Free. \nThey were visiting Capitol Hill to meet with Members of Congress, \nencouraging Congress to extend the wind production tax credit.\n  The wind energy production tax credit was created to try to level the \nplaying field with coal-fired and nuclear electricity generation. The \nproduction tax credit for wind is available only when wind energy is \nproduced. There is no benefit for simply placing the turbine in the \nground. It is a tax relief that rewards results, and that is much \ndifferent than failed taxpayer-funded grants and loans made since 2009 \nwhen a lot of that money went to companies that are now bankrupt.\n  Those who want to do away with the wind energy tax incentive don't \nseem to mention that other forms of energy have received far more \ngenerous tax incentives for many decades longer than the wind energy \nindustry. Oil and gas and nuclear power all received longstanding \nFederal support. I wish to emphasize, because I believe I read \nsomeplace, that one of the opponents of the wind energy tax credit \nbeing extended comes from nuclear.\n  Do my colleagues think we would even have a nuclear industry in the \nUnited States since the 1950s or 1960s if it weren't for the Price \nAnderson Act that supports it as kind of a super--or an insurer of last \nresort? It would never have developed, and it is still in existence. \nIsn't it a little bit intellectually dishonest to say that wind should \nnot have the tax incentive when other industries wouldn't even exist if \nthey hadn't had it already?\n  If we are going to have a discussion of which industries merit \nFederal support and which industries don't, the discussion needs to be \nintellectually honest. If we are having that discussion, everything \nneeds to be on the table, not just wind energy. Can you think of 60 \nextenders that are going to sunset at the end of this year? Only one--\nwind--seems to be attacked right now.\n\n  This extension deserves a place in our year-end package of tax \nextenders to help give confidence investors want and employers need to \nkeep and hire workers.\n  There is no reason to exacerbate the unemployment problem by failing \nto extend this successful incentive. America's security in the short- \nand long-term depends on a robust effort to develop domestic energy \nsources.\n  Before I leave the floor, this can be done by the extender bill all \nby itself being passed or it can be, as we hope, that President Obama \nand Speaker Boehner have some sort of framework for us to put meat on \nthat framework so we do not go over the cliff and have this bill be a \npart of it. When that whole fiscal cliff debate is about jobs, we do \nnot want to forget about these 75,000 jobs that are in wind energy. A \nlot of these jobs have already led to some layoffs. We could bring \nthose people back to work pretty fast.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7718-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7718-S7720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE RULES CHANGES\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, the Founders of this great country \nclearly wanted the Senate to serve as a deliberative body anchored with \nthe ability to fully amend and to fully debate issues. Yet there has \nbeen a lot of talk lately about Senate rules changes to limit Senators' \nability to make their voices heard.\n  To many, this may sound like inside baseball, limited to the concerns \nof just a handful of Senators. But let me assure you this issue is so \nmuch more than that. The changes that are being contemplated would \nsignificantly impact everyday Americans, especially those who live in \nrural or less-populated States.\n  Take Nebraska, for example. We do not necessarily consider ourselves \nsmall. We have almost 2 million people and several Fortune 500 \ncompanies. But we also do not like the idea of getting steamrolled by \nhigh-population States; for example, California, New York or Illinois. \nBut that is exactly what these Senate rules changes would allow.\n  This is not just some wild supposition on my part. The majority \nleader himself said the filibuster ``is a unique privilege that serves \nto aid small States from being trampled by the desires of larger \nstates.'' He went on to say it is ``one of the most sacred rules of the \nSenate.''\n  Of course, that was a few years ago, before he proposed to do the \nvery thing he has criticized. He now appears ready to undermine the \nmost important rule, not by a two-thirds vote, as clearly required by \nSenate rule XXII, but by a simple majority fiat. This contradicts \nlongstanding practice and disregards the 67-vote threshold President \nLyndon Baines Johnson said ``preserves, indisputably, the character of \nthe Senate.''\n  This is the same so-called nuclear option Democrats previously \ndecried as breaking the rules to change the rules. For example, the \nsenior Senator from New York previously opposed such a blatant power \ngrab saying:\n\n       The checks and balances that Americans prize are at stake. \n     The idea of bipartisanship, where you have to come together \n     and can't just ram everything through because you have a \n     simple majority, is at stake. The very things we treasure and \n     love about this grand republic are at stake.\n\n  Those are pretty powerful and unequivocal words, but it does not stop \nthere.\n  The senior Senator from Illinois called it `` . . . attacking the \nvery force within the Senate that creates compromise and \nbipartisanship.'' So that reflects a trifecta of the Democratic \nleadership saying it is a bad idea. Yet they keep pushing it like it \nhas somehow magically been transformed into a good idea.\n  But it does not matter how long we polish the tin cup; it will not \nmagically become the golden chalice. Again, you do not have to believe \nme. One of the Senate's great historians, Democratic Senator Byrd of \nWest Virginia, was very clear on this issue. He said: ``Our Founding \nFathers intended the Senate to be a continuing body that allows for \nopen and unlimited debate and the protection of minority rights.''\n  When faced with the idea of limiting these basic underpinnings of the \nSenate, he concluded: ``We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--\nthe necessary fence--this nation has against the excesses of the \nExecutive Branch and the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n  I had the great privilege of working with Senator Byrd when I first \ncame to the Senate. We offered an amendment together which would have \nprevented the majority from stretching the Senate rules to enact \nDraconian cap-and-trade legislation on a simple majority vote--\ninterestingly enough, a situation not so different from today's \nproposals.\n  Senator Byrd was very wise in these matters, serving as his party's \nleader in both times of majority and minority. He had seen both sides \nof the fence, if you will. He had studied the Framers and had \ndetermined that such a blatant power grab could not stand. In fact, the \nvast majority of our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, agreed and our \namendment passed on a vote of 67 to 31. That is exactly what should \nhappen. If changes are needed, a bipartisan supermajority should \napprove them, not a simple majority changing the rules to break the \nrules, not a simple majority steamrolling the Nation.\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\n  Senator Byrd left no doubt about his opinion of the so-called nuclear \noption when he implored us: `` . . . jealously guard against efforts to \nchange or reinterpret the Senate rules by a simple majority, \ncircumventing Rule 22 where a two-thirds majority is required.''\n  He concluded with a statement more eloquent than any original words I \nmight speak. So allow me to once again quote him. I implore my \ncolleagues to listen carefully:\n\n       . . . the Senate has been the last fortress of minority \n     rights and freedom of speech in the Republic for more than \n     two centuries. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect \n     before ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the \n     political priority of the moment.\n\n  It is often said those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat \nit. I hope my colleagues will study this history, discover the wisdom \nof Senator Byrd, and decide to abandon this ill-advised hostile \ntakeover of the Senate, this attempt to put a gag on the minority.\n  One of my favorite statements on this subject from Senator Byrd is: \n``. . . before we get all steamed up, demanding radical changes of the \nSenate rules, let's read the rules.''\n  Let's do that. Senate rule V clearly states that ``the rules of the \nSenate shall continue from one Congress to the next Congress unless \nthey are changed as provided in these rules.''\n  Rule XXII is very clear. It unquestionably says the necessary \naffirmative vote shall be two-thirds of the Senators present and voting \nto change the Senate rules.\n  Again, very clearly, this is all about breaking the rules to change \nthe rules.\n  The sad thing for our Senate and our great Nation is that once the \nbell is rung, it cannot be unrung. Simple majority votes to change our \nSenate rules, I guarantee you, will become commonplace. Whenever a new \nparty takes control, they will change the rules by a majority vote. \nWhoever occupies the majority at the moment will then run roughshod \nover the minority party, the laws they passed when they were in the \nmajority, and their constituents. It is absolutely inevitable.\n  Today's assurances that it only applies to motions to proceed will \neventually ring hollow when it extends to judges, to bills, and then to \nconference reports. There will be nothing to stop it.\n  One day we will awaken with a Senate that basically is the House of \nRepresentatives, where majorities rule and only their leadership \ndecides what amendments will be considered and what votes will occur \nand when they will occur. We will have a legislative branch that does \nnot resemble even faintly what the Framers of our great Constitution \nenvisioned.\n  But maybe, just as important, we would find entire states of \nconstituents who have no voice in the policies that affect their daily \nlives. That would be a travesty.\n  I implore my colleagues one last time to listen to the wisdom of \ntheir leaders of today and throughout our history--people such as our \nmajority leader, who said: ``For more than 200 years the rules of the \nSenate have protected the American people, and rightfully so,'' and \nSenator Byrd, who said: ``As long as the Senate retains the power to \namend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people \nwill remain secure.''\n  But, unfortunately, this great institution has evolved into a \nconstant cycle of bringing flawed legislation to the floor, filling the \namendment tree to prohibit all amendments, daring the minority party to \nvote no to protect the rights of their constituents, and when they do \nso, claim they are filibustering and obstructionist.\n  If we could fix this one basic problem, if we could return the Senate \nto its most basic principle of open debate and opportunity for \namendments, maybe we would realize the folly of these proposed rules \nchanges and we would get back in the business of being Senators again \nand working together again.\n  This quick fix is not the answer. I hope between now and January \ncooler heads will prevail, and we will put ourselves back on a path to \nfinding bipartisan solutions to our Nation's most pressing problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair if \nthe Senator from Nebraska will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico asks the Senator \nfrom Nebraska to yield.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The Senator from Nebraska has talked about \nthe rules not being able to be changed because internally in the Senate \nrules there is a provision that says you need a supermajority, two-\nthirds of the Senate, to change the rules. This is the proposition we \nare hearing argued by many Senators, that we are breaking the rules to \nchange the rules. We have heard that repeated several times over and \nover on the Senate floor.\n  The other side of the argument, as the Senator I think well knows, as \nhe worked up here and was around and saw Senator Byrd, is that the \nConstitution is superior to the Senate rules. And the Constitution \nspecifically says, in article 1, section 5, that each House may \ndetermine the rules of its proceedings. Statutory construction applied \nto that means a simple majority determines the rules of its \nproceedings. This is a standard interpretation construction.\n  We know supermajorities are only indicated at several places in the \nConstitution, and every place else it is implied that it is by a \nmajority. Here you have a supermajority in the Senate rules and you \nhave the Constitution saying at the beginning of a Congress you can \nchange the rules by majority vote. So the question to the Senator is: \nDoes not he agree the Constitution is superior to the Senate rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, the Constitution would always trump, but \nthat is a misinterpretation of what we are doing here. Let me play this \nout, because I am pretty confident I know how this is going to work if \nthis is pursued. What would happen in January is there would be a \nrequest for a ruling by the Parliamentarian, and the Parliamentarian \nwould correctly rule that in order to change the rules you need two-\nthirds of the Senate. Then they would use the procedure of overruling \nour Parliamentarian with a majority vote. That will then stand as the \nruling for the Senate. Very clearly what you are doing is you are \nskirting both the Constitution and the rules of the Senate.\n  Let me, if I might, take the Senator's question and show the shocking \nresult we are going to end up with. Do you realize there was a day in \nthis body where judges were not filibustered? We can look at Supreme \nCourt judges who might be controversial to one side or the other who \nwere approved by a majority vote.\n  So what happened? My friends on the other side of the aisle sat down, \nthey brought in some constitutional scholar. He said: Well, why are you \nnot filibustering judges? And now it is very routine and very common--\nand both sides do it. So here is what is going to happen. Every time \nyou have a majority that comes to power--and we all know the pendulum \nswings. In our lifetime we will see Republicans returned to the \nmajority. That is how elections go--once this is cracked open, then \nthey as the majority party can come in to change the rules and \nbasically say: It is open season. We will get a ruling from the \nParliamentarian just as the Democrats did. We will overrule that ruling \nof the Parliamentarian by a 51-vote majority or 50, if you have the \nVice President in the chair, and then Katy-bar-the-door. All laws \npassed by that majority are now subject to being repealed by a majority \nvote.\n  If you can do it on the motion to proceed, there is not any reason \nyou cannot use this very flawed procedure to do it on every other piece \nand step along the way. That is what Senator Byrd was warning us about. \nHe was basically saying: Members of the Senate, once you crack this \ndoor open, there is no turning back. And there will not be any turning \nback.\n  So what happens to our country? Well, No. 1, the minority becomes \npowerless in the Senate. As a Member of the minority, I could come down \nhere, I could offer an amendment. I could join forces with Senator Byrd \non using reconciliation on climate change, and we could get 67 votes. \nBut all of a sudden what is going to happen here is your minority is \ngoing to be basically\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nwithout a voice in the Senate because the majority rules. That was \nnever intended. That has not been part of our history.\n  So I think to directly answer the question, you are misinterpreting \nwhat this is all about. The net effect of where we are going to end up, \nif we go in this direction, I guarantee you, in our lifetime we will \nlook back at that moment in history and we will say that changed the \noperation of the Senate forever.\n  As I said in my comments, once the bell is rung, it is impossible to \nunring the bell. We will not have stability in our laws and we will not \nhave stability in our Senate and we will have a minority that is \nabsolutely powerless. I do not believe that is what was intended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7720-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7720-S7721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOOD STAMPS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that was very good debate. I would share \nthe concern of Senator Johanns. I remember we backed off this dangerous \ntrend of changing the rules when we fixed the filibuster politically in \nthis political institution. We need to figure out a way to solve this \nproblem. I would say, without any doubt in my own mind, the real reason \nwe have had to filibuster is because the majority leader, to a degree \nunprecedented in history, is controlling and blocking the ability of \nthe minority party to even have amendments on bills. That goes against \nthe great heritage of the Senate and cannot be accepted. That is why we \nare having this problem.\n  I wanted to share a few thoughts this morning about the food stamp \nprogram and some of the developments that have been going on. America \nis a generous and compassionate Nation. We do not want and will not \nhave people hungry in our country. We want to be able to be supportive \nto people in need.\n  But every program must meet basic standards of efficiency and \nproductivity and wisdom and management. This program is resisting that. \nIt is the fastest growing major program in the government. In the year \n2000 we spent $20 billion on food stamps nationwide. Last year it was \n$80 billion. It has gone up fourfold in 10 years. That is a dramatic \nincrease. It is increasing every year and virtually every month. The \nmost recent report in September had one of the largest increases in the \nprogram's history--another 600,000 added to the rolls, totaling now \n47.7 million. One out of every six Americans is receiving food stamps. \nOddly, when we attempted to confront our debt and our spending, we had \nhuge reductions for the Defense Department. Some other departments took \nbig cuts. The food stamp program was set aside. President Obama and the \nDemocratic leaders said: We will not even talk about it. No less money, \nno savings, no review of food stamps. It cannot be changed. It should \nbe left alone.\n  Well, that is not a good plan. As the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee, I have begun to look at the program to see how it is we have \nhad such great increases. The agriculture establishment says every \nsingle dollar that is spent is needed for hungry people. I offered an \namendment that would have reduced spending over 10 years from $800 \nbillion total to $789 billion, reducing spending by $11 billion based \non closing a loophole, a categorical eligibility gimmick that should \nnot be there, allowing people to receive benefits who did not qualify \nfor them.\n  It was said: Oh, you want people to be hungry. It was voted down. I \nthought it was a very modest, reasonable change. By the way, \nagriculture spending in our government is different than a lot of \npeople--Mr. President, what is the status of our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have \nanother 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is where we are, I think, in terms of spending on \nthe program and the need to examine it and see how it works. The \nestablishment says every dollar is needed, not a dime can be reduced. I \ncertainly agree that no one should be hungry in America. But we must \nknow that the SNAP program, the food stamp program as it is commonly \nknown, is not the only benefit that people have.\n  Indeed, an average family without income in America today would \nreceive as much as $25,000 in total benefits per year from the \ngovernment if they did not have an income. They get things such as \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, they get SSI, housing \nallowance, free health care through Medicaid. They get food stamps and \nother benefits totaling at least $25,000.\n  By the way, if you took all of the means-tested welfare-type programs \nthat are in existence in America today, there are over 80. If you \ndivide it up by the number of households who fall below the poverty \nline in America, it would be $60,000 per household--$30 per hour, on \naverage, for a 40-hour work week. That is how much it would amount to.\n  The median income in America is less than that. The median income--\nand they pay taxes on that--is maybe $25 an hour. This would be over \n$30 an hour based on if we were just to divide up our welfare programs. \nSo to say we should not examine those programs and ask ourselves can we \ndo better is a mistake. The question I would ask is, can we improve it? \nCan we help more people move from dependence to independence? Is the \nprogram functioning as we would like it to function?\n  I have been asking questions of the Secretary of Agriculture Tom \nVilsack. He provided some information that was very troubling to me. I \nhave submitted additional information to him. Now we are not getting \nany more answers. They have just shut the door. The Secretary basically \nsaid: Well, you are a Member of the Senate. You are asking too many \nquestions. I am not giving you any more information. You raise concerns \nwhen I give you information. You point out problems. I do not like \nthat. You are not getting any more.\n  I would note in some of our first inquires in the examination of \ntheir program, we found they are on a determined effort to expand the \nnumber of people who get on welfare or food stamps even if they do not \nwant to be on food stamps. One of the things that is interesting is \nthey gave a person in western North Carolina, one of the agricultural \npeople, an award for overcoming ``mountain pride.'' Basically what they \nsaid was this lady should be given an award because when people in the \nmountains who are independent and believe they can take care of \nthemselves, thank you--without the Federal Government--she overcame \nthat. They have a brochure telling people what to say when people say, \nI do not need food stamps, to get them to sign up for food stamps.\n  I have to say, and I am not happy about it. So now the Secretary has \nfailed to comply with oversight requests from the Senate Budget \nCommittee. Secretary Vilsack has missed the October deadline that we \nasked him to meet by nearly 2 months. My staff has been provided no \nupdate despite repeated requests, and apparently no letter is being \ndrafted from the Department in response to our request. Just stiff you \nguys.\n  Well, last I heard he worked for the American people. So do I. And \none of my jobs is to make sure the American people's money is well \nspent. I am asking him about how he is spending our money, and he does \nnot want to respond.\n  My letter asked questions about two main issues: First, the USDA's \nacknowledged relationship with Mexico to place foreign nationals almost \nimmediately on food stamps. One of the questions I asked was simply how \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture interprets the Federal law.\n  Well, we make Federal law, we pass laws. I would like to know how \nthey are enforcing them and what standards they are using. Federal law \nsays those likely to be reliant on welfare cannot be admitted to the \nUnited States. If they want to come to the United States, and they meet \nthe qualifications, they get to come. But they have to show they are \nnot going to be dependent on the government for their food, aid, and \nhealth and everything when they come.\n  We have lots of people who want to come to America. Most of those \npeople probably can come and sustain themselves. Why would we be \nadmitting\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nthose who can't, who are going to immediately go on the government \nassistance programs? But this law is effectively not being enforced.\n  Senators Grassley, Hatch, and Roberts are ranking members on key \ncommittees, and I sent a letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So another question I asked was concerning the \nDepartment's goal to place more people on food stamps. Here is part of \nthe question from the letter: According to USDA, ``only 72 percent of \nthose eligible for SNAP benefits participated,'' adding, ``their \ncommunities lose out on the benefits provided by new SNAP dollars \nflowing into local economies.''\n  If USDA's enrollment goals were reached, we asked, how many people \nwould be receiving food stamps today? We have gone up dramatically; how \nmany more would be of benefit? I would simply ask that question.\n  I will ask him again on the Senate floor. How many millions more \npeople would be on the Food Stamp Program if 100 percent of those \nqualified had enrolled? In 2011 USDA gave a recruitment award, as I \nmentioned, for overcoming ``mountain pride.'' They produced a pamphlet \ninstructing their recruiters on how to ``overcome the word `no.' '' The \nUSDA claims the chief obstacle to recruitment is a ``sense the benefits \naren't needed.'' That is an obstacle.\n  USDA asserts that ``everyone wins when eligible people take advantage \nof benefits to which they are entitled,'' claiming that ``each $5 in \nnew SNAP benefits generates almost twice that amount in economic \nactivity for the community.''\n  Well, I guess we just ought to do it another fourfold. That would \nreally make America prosperous.\n  USDA produced a Spanish-language ad in which the main character is \npressured into accepting food stamps.\n  This is what is on the video: The lady said, ``I don't need anyone's \nhelp. My husband earns enough to take care of us.'' Her friend mocks \nher and replies--this is the Department of Agriculture pitch--``When \nare you going to learn?'' Eventually, she gives in to her friends who \nare pressuring her and agrees to enroll.\n  Is this the right approach for America? We need to work, to help \npeople with pride, help people to assume their own independence, to be \nsuccessful, take care of their own families and move them from \ndependence to independence. That ought to be the fundamental goal of \nour system. It was the goal in the reform of 1996 in the welfare reform \nthat worked very well. More people prospered, fewer people are in \npoverty, and more people are taking care of themselves. It really was a \nsuccess. We have been drifting back away from that.\n  What I sense is when you ask questions about it, you are treated as \nsomeone who doesn't care about people who are hungry, who do need our \nhelp. We want to help. All we are asking is, Can't we do it better? \nCan't we look back to the principles of independence, individual \nresponsibility, and individual pride that Americans have and nurture \nthat and use that as a way to help reduce dependence in this country? \nSo those are the things I wanted to share.\n  I would just say this: The Secretary of Agriculture has the \nresponsibility to answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would ask to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Senate Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, there has been much \ndiscussion about the need to reform the Senate rules, and I have \nlistened closely to the arguments against these changes by the other \nside. Today I rise to address some of their concerns. My Republican \ncolleagues have made impassioned statements in opposition to amending \nour rules at the beginning of the next Congress. They say the rules can \nonly be changed with a two-thirds supermajority. They say any attempt \nto amend the rules by a simple majority is breaking the rules to change \nthe rules. This simply is not true.\n  Repeating it every day on the Senate floor doesn't make it true. The \nsupermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict \nwith the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution is very specific about \nwhen a supermajority is required and just as clearly when it isn't \nrequired.\n  Article I, section 5 of the Constitution States:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, \n     punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the \n     Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  When the Framers require a supermajority, they explicitly said so. \nFor example, for expelling a Member. On all other matters, such as \ndetermining the Chamber's rules, a majority requirement is clearly \nimplied.\n  There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents sitting as President \nof the Senate. Sitting up where the Presiding Officer is sitting, three \nVice Presidents have sat there. And the meaning of article I, section \n5, as it applies to the Senate, this is what they were interpreting. In \n1957, Vice President Nixon ruled definitively, and I quote from his \nruling:\n\n       While the rules of the Senate have been continued from one \n     Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the \n     Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own \n     rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, \n     cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate \n     rules adopted in a previous Congress, which has the expressed \n     or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in \n     a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it \n     desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  That was Vice President Nixon. Vice Presidents Rockefeller and \nHumphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses.\n  I have heard many of my Republican colleagues quote Senator Robert \nByrd's last statement to the Senate Rules Committee. The Presiding \nOfficer knew Senator Byrd well. He is from his State of West Virginia. \nSenator Byrd came to that Rules Committee. I was at that Rules \nCommittee, and I was at the hearing where he appeared--and I have great \nrespect for Senator Byrd. He was one of the great Senate historians. He \nloved this institution, but we should also consider Senator Byrd's \nother statements and the steps he took as majority leader to reform \nthis body.\n  In 1979 it was argued that the rules could only be amended in \naccordance with the previous Senate rules. Majority Leader Byrd said \nthe following on the floor:\n\n       There is no higher law, insofar as our Government is \n     concerned, than the Constitution. The Senate rules are \n     subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The \n     Constitution in Article I, Section 5, says that each House \n     shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at \n     the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be \n     bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  That was Senator Robert Byrd. This Congress is not obliged to be \nbound by the dead hand of the past.\n  As Senator Byrd pointed out, the Constitution is clear. There is also \na\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nlongstanding common law principle upheld in the Supreme Court that one \nlegislature cannot bind its successors. For example, the Senate cannot \npass a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in \nthe future. That would violate this common law principle and be \nunconstitutional. Similarly, the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt \nprocedural rules that a majority of the Senate in the future cannot \namend or repeal.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. In 2003 \nSenator John Cornyn wrote in a Law Review article--as many of you know, \nSenator Cornyn was an attorney general in Texas, was a distinguished \njustice. Senator Cornyn said the following in this Law Review article:\n\n       Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by a majority vote, one Senate \n     cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend \n     by a majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the \n     general common-law principle that one parliament cannot bind \n     another.\n\n  That was Senator John Cornyn.\n  Amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not breaking the \nrules to change the rules, it is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution \nis superior to the Senate rules. And when there is a conflict between \nthem, we follow the Constitution.\n  I find some of the rhetoric about amending our rules particularly \ntroubling. We have heard comments that any such reforms, if done by a \nmajority, would ``destroy the Senate.'' Again, I can turn to my \nRepublican colleagues to answer this accusation.\n  In 2005 the Republican Policy Committee released a memo entitled \n``The Constitutional Option: The Senate's Power to Make Procedural \nRules by Majority Vote.'' That memo supports the same arguments I make \ntoday for reform by a majority, and it also refutes many of the recent \nclaims about how the Senate will be permanently damaged.\n  One section of the memo titled, ``Common Misunderstandings of the \nConstitutional Option'' is especially interesting and enlightening. It \nresponds to the argument that ``the essential character of the Senate \nwill be destroyed if the constitutional option is exercised,'' and it \nresponds with the following words:\n\n       When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the \n     constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and \n     precedents, those illustrative exercises of the option did \n     little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed, \n     many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger \n     today in a body that still allows for extensive debate, full \n     consideration, and careful deliberation of all matters with \n     which it is presented.\n\n  What is more important about the Republican memo is the reason they \nbelieved a change to the rules by a majority was justified. Because of \nwhat Republicans saw as a break in longstanding Senate tradition. They \nclaimed they weren't using the constitutional option as a power grab, \nthey were using it as a means of restoring the Senate to its historical \nnorm.\n  This is exactly where we find ourselves today. Back then, the \nRepublicans argued the constitutional option should be used because 10 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees were threatened with a \nfilibuster. I believe the departure from Senate tradition now is far \nworse.\n  Since Democrats became the majority party in the Senate in 2007, we \nhave faced the highest number of opposition filibusters ever recorded. \nLyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate \nmajority leader. In the same span of time, Harry Reid has faced 386.\n  For most of our history, the filibuster was used very sparingly. But \nin recent years, what was rare has become routine. The exception has \nbecome the norm. Everything is filibustered--every procedural step of \nthe way, with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the \nprocess, not send it into a deep freeze.\n  Since the Democratic majority came into the upper Chamber in 2007, \nthe Senates of the 110th, 111th, and current 112th Congresses have \nwitnessed the three highest total of filibusters ever recorded. A \nrecent report found the current Senate has passed a record low 2.8 \npercent of bills introduced. That is a 66-percent decrease from the \nlast Republican majority in 2005 and 2006 and a 90-percent decrease \nfrom the high in 1955 and 1956.\n  So the Republicans argued in 2005, ``[a]n exercise of the \nconstitutional option under the current circumstances would be an act \nof restoration.'' An act of restoration. I cannot improve on that \nstatement. We must return the Senate to a time when every procedural \nstep was not filibustered.\n  I respect the concerns some of my Republican colleagues have \nregarding the constitutional option, but there is an alternative. We \ndon't have to reform the Senate rule with a majority vote in January. \nThis is up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Each time \nthe filibuster rule has been amended in the past, a bipartisan group of \nSenators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with a \nmajority vote on the reforms looming, enough Members agreed on a \ncompromise and passed the changes with two-thirds in favor. We could do \nthat again in January.\n  I know many of my Republican colleagues agree with me that the Senate \nis not working. Some say we don't need to change the rules, we need to \nchange behavior. But we tried that--the changing of behavior--with a \ngentleman's agreement at the beginning of this Congress. It failed. So \nnow it is time to make some real reforms.\n  This is not a ``power grab,'' as some have charged. We want to make \nthe Senate a better place--a place where real debate happens for both \nparties. So I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to bring \ntheir own proposals to the table. Let's work together to restore the \ndeliberative nature of the Senate where all sides have the opportunity \nto debate and be heard.\n  I said 2 years ago I would push for reforms at the beginning of the \nnext Congress regardless of which party was in the majority. I will say \nagain that our goal is to reform the abuse of the filibuster, not \ntrample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I am willing to \nlive with all the changes we are proposing whether I am in the majority \nor the minority.\n  The American people, of all political persuasions, want a government \nthat actually gets something done, that actually works. We have to \nchange the way we do business. The challenges are too great, the stakes \nare too high, and we do not want a government of gridlock to continue.\n  I thank the Chair for the time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Release Johnny Hammar\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, a very disturbing thing has \nhappened in Mexico with one of my constituents--a U.S. marine who \nserved honorably.\n  Johnny Hammar fought in Fallujah and was honorably discharged in \n2007. He and another marine, both having suffered under posttraumatic \nstress disorder, were taking advantage of the fact they were surfers to \nlessen their stress. They had surfed up and down the east coast. This \nis a marine whose family lives in Miami, so they had gone to Cocoa \nBeach, and they were going to others. They wanted to go to Costa Rica \nto catch the big waves in the Pacific, and so Johnny bought a camper \nand entered Mexico at Matamoros.\n  As they crossed the border, he checked with United States Customs \nbecause he had a shotgun that was an antique that had been owned by his \ngreat-grandfather. He registered the weapon with U.S. Customs so that \nwhen he returned Customs would have a record of it. But when he went \nfrom the American side of the U.S.-Mexico line into Mexico, and openly \nshowed his great-grandfather's antique shotgun, the Mexican authorities \narrested him.\n  His companion, another marine, after interrogation was released, but \nthey put Cpl Johnny Hammar, now age 27, in the general prison \npopulation in Matamoros, Mexico.\n  This case came to my attention last August, and I immediately \nresponded. As a result of my contacting the Mexican Government, they \nmoved him from the general population of the jail into an individual \njail cell. But as they have\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\ngone in to interrogate him, they have manacled him, shackled him, and \nat one point they had him chained to the bed.\n  This has gone on long enough. If it is against the law to take a gun \ninto Mexico, even though he had already declared it at U.S. Customs, \nthe Mexican authorities could have, when they released his fellow \nmarine to go back into the United States, sent him back into the United \nStates and told him don't bring your great-grandfather's shotgun into \nMexico. If that is against Mexican law. But they didn't. They have put \na U.S. Marine, who has honorably served his country, in a Mexican jail, \nand he has been there since last August.\n  Enough is enough. I called my friend Arturo, the great and well-\nrespected Mexican Ambassador, yesterday and I can't get a return call \nfrom the Mexican Ambassador, so I am bringing this to the attention of \nthe Senate so we can further get through to the Mexican Government and \nindicate to them they have made a bureaucratic mistake.\n  Obviously, if it is against Mexican law to take a weapon in, then \nunder these circumstances, this young U.S. marine does not deserve the \ntreatment he is getting--holding him in a Mexican jail at the border of \nthe United States for the past 5 months.\n  I hope cooler heads will prevail. If it requires me speaking on the \nSenate floor day in and day out to keep this issue alive, I will do so. \nClearly, it has been in the press. It has been in the Miami Herald \nseveral times, a much more detailed account of his background, his \nservice to the country, and his struggling with PTSD ever since he got \nhome.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to bring this to \nthe attention of my colleagues, and once again I say to the Mexican \nGovernment: Send this marine home. Now that you have a new President \ninstalled in Mexico, relations with the United States are especially \nimportant and United States citizens who are peaceful in their intent, \ninnocent in their observation of the Mexican laws, where no harm has \nbeen done, should be treated respectfully. Send that U.S. marine back \nto America and back to his family in Miami.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I want to express my \nsupport for S. 3637, a temporary extension of the Transaction Account \nGuarantee, or TAG, Program.\n  The program, which is administered by the FDIC for insured depository \ninstitutions and the NCUA for credit unions, provides unlimited \ninsurance for non-interest-bearing accounts at banks and credit unions. \nThese transaction accounts are used by businesses, local governments, \nhospitals, and other nonprofit organizations for payroll and other \nrecurring expenses, and this program provides certainty to businesses \nin uncertain times.\n  These accounts are also important to our Nation's smallest financial \ninstitutions. In fact, 90 percent of community banks with assets under \n$10 billion have TAG deposits. This program allows these institutions \nto serve the banking needs of the small businesses in their \ncommunities, keeping deposits local. In my State of South Dakota, I \nknow that the TAG Program is important to banks, credit unions, and \nsmall businesses.\n\n  Our Nation's economy is certainly in a different place than it was in \n2008 at the height of the financial crisis when this program was \ncreated, but with concerns about the fiscal cliff in the United States \nand continued instability in European markets, I believe a temporary \nextension is needed. Therefore, I believe that a clean 2-year extension \nmakes the most sense and provides the most certainty for business and \nfinancial institutions and also provides time to prepare for the end of \nthe program in 2 years.\n  I wish to note that this legislation has a cost recovery provision \nthat ensures no taxpayer is on the hook for this insurance. Financial \ninstitutions pay for the coverage. This is not and never will be a \nbailout. This is simply additional insurance paid for by the banks to \nensure these accounts remain stable.\n  I thank Leader Reid for making this issue a priority in the lameduck \nsession. I also thank Senator Sherrod Brown for being a great partner \nfor many months on this important topic. The administration has just \nissued a SAP in support of TAG, and I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n   S. 3637--Transaction Account Guarantee Program Temporary Extension\n\n                           (Sen. Reid, D-NV)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 3637, \n     which would temporarily extend the unlimited deposit \n     insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction \n     accounts. The Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) Program \n     played an important role in maintaining financial stability \n     and banking system liquidity for consumers and businesses \n     during the financial crisis. While the Administration \n     supports a temporary extension of the program, it remains \n     committed to actively evaluating the use of this emergency \n     measure created during extraordinary times and a responsible \n     approach to winding down the program. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with the Congress to move forward \n     other measures that will support small businesses and \n     accelerate the economic recovery.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask my colleagues to support the \nextension of TAG.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          Senate Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, some things never change in the Senate. For \nmore than 200 years, our practice of extended debate has been the \nsingle most defining characteristic of the Senate. For more than 200 \nyears, extended debate has annoyed the majority and empowered the \nminority.\n  What has changed, however, is that the majority today threatens not \nonly to change Senate rules and practice in order to cripple this \ntradition and consolidate power but to use unprecedented tactics to do \nit. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together \nand preserve the fundamental integrity of this body, even if we may \ndisagree about some of the political issues.\n  I wish to explain to my colleagues why neither the ends nor the means \nthat the majority has been discussing are legitimate. First, there is \nno debate crisis on the Senate floor, none whatsoever.\n  In fact, it is easier to end debate today than during most of \nAmerican history. For more than a century since we had no cloture rule \nat all, ending debate required unanimous consent. A single Senator \ncould filibuster merely by objecting. From 1917 to 1975, ending debate \nrequired a supermajority of two-thirds, higher than the three-fifths \nrequired today. As I said a minute ago, extended debate has always \nannoyed the majority.\n  Today is no different. Yet we hear the majority claiming there have \nbeen hundreds of filibusters, that the rules are being abused, that \nobstruction is at\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\nan alltime high. The American people likely do not know the particulars \nof our debate rules and practices but Senators making such claims \ncertainly should.\n  The majority pumps up the filibuster numbers by claiming that every \ncloture motion is evidence of a filibuster. They know that is not true. \nAs the Congressional Research Service says:\n\n       The Senate leadership has increasingly utilized cloture as \n     a routine tool to manage the flow of business, even in the \n     absence of any apparent filibuster. . . . In many instances, \n     cloture motions may be filed not to overcome filibusters in \n     progress, but to preempt ones that are only anticipated.\n\n  That is what is going on today. The majority leader often files a \ncloture motion as soon as a motion or a bill becomes pending. He does \nthat to prevent debate from starting, not to end debate that is \nunderway. In the last three Congresses under this majority, a much \nhigher percentage of cloture motions got withdrawn without any cloture \nvote at all than under the last three Congresses under a Republican \nmajority.\n  The majority leader appears to think that debate itself is simply \ndilatory. While extended debate has long been annoying to the majority, \nthis majority leader apparently believes any debate is annoying.\n  Neither filing a cloture motion nor taking a cloture vote is evidence \nof a filibuster. A filibuster occurs when an attempt to end debate, \nsuch as a cloture vote, fails. That is why some on the other side of \nthe aisle want to address what they claim is a filibuster problem by \nchanging the cloture rule.\n  Let's use some common sense and stop misleading our fellow citizens \nabout how this body operates. A filibuster is a debate that cannot be \nstopped. During this 112th Congress a much smaller percentage of \ncloture votes have failed than in the past. That is right. Cloture \nvotes today are more successful in preventing filibusters than in the \npast.\n  The same is true about motions to proceed, which is the particular \nfocus of those who are now threatening to weaken debate by forcing a \nrules change. In the 112th Congress, 32 percent of cloture votes on \nmotions to proceed have failed, compared to an average of 54 percent \nduring the previous dozen congresses. Put simply, the current Senate \nmajority has used cloture to prevent filibusters on motions to proceed \nmore effectively than in the past.\n  By the way, during the last several Congresses when the Democrats \nwere in the minority, the current majority leader and majority whip \nvoted to filibuster motions to proceed dozens of times. As I said, \nextended debate has always annoyed the majority and empowered the \nminority.\n  Once again, it is easier to end debate today than during most of \nAmerican history. The majority has done so more effectively in the \ncurrent Congress than in the past, both in general and on motions to \nproceed. There simply is no crisis, no unprecedented abuse that \nrequires some sort of fundamental change in the rules and traditions of \nthis body.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, I suggest that the majority \nactually try working with the minority. That is something we have not \nseen under the current majority leader's tenure. Since the Democrats \ntook control of the Senate in 2007, the majority leader has not only \nroutinely filed cloture motions to prevent debate, but he has severely \nlimited the minority's ability to offer amendments. Since the majority \nleader is at the front of the line in this body, he uses that \npreference to offer amendments so the minority cannot. He did that here \njust a few minutes ago.\n\n  The current majority leader has used this tactic more than 60 times, \nmore than any previous majority leader of either party. In fact, he has \ndone so more than all previous majority leaders combined. It is one \nthing to require a majority to pass an amendment, but the effect or, \nrather, the intent of this tactic is to require Senators in the \nminority to obtain the majority leader's permission to even offer \namendments in the first place.\n  Isn't that ironic? The majority leader uses the rules to his \nlegislative advantage but wants to strip from the minority the ability \nto do the same. The Senate is not supposed to work that way and did not \nwhen Democrats were in the minority. Back in April 2005, when he was \nthe minority whip, our distinguished current majority leader defended \nthe minority's ability to offer even nongermane amendments because \ndoing so prompted Senate consideration of subjects that the majority \nmay have ignored.\n  That was then; this is now. Today it does not require three-fifths to \nblock an amendment. The majority leader can and has done the same thing \nall by himself. This kind of silencing of minority views does not even \nhappen in the House of Representatives, which operates by majority rule \nacross the board. In the House, the majority party, either Republican \nor Democratic, often limits amendments, sometimes barring them \nentirely.\n  But at times the minority is entitled, before final passage, to a \nmotion to recommit, which means a chance to propose a different version \nof the bill. This motion is not merely symbolic. Not infrequently that \nmotion carries. In contrast, when the Senate majority leader fills the \namendment tree, as he just did, he precludes anything such as the \nHouse's motion to recommit.\n  When the minority's rights are trampled like this, what is it to do? \nAcquiesce or respond in self-defense? Frankly, it should be no surprise \nthat a minority blocked from influencing legislation through amendments \nwould demand extended debate by opposing cloture. But look what \nhappens. The majority obstructs the minority's right to participate in \nthe development of legislation and then attacks the minority for \nopposing the passage of that same legislation.\n  Again, that is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate. It is \nnot just the minority who suffers from this strategy. More to the \npoint, the American people suffer. They sent us to be real Senators, \nindividuals who represent them and their concerns. They expect us \nactually to legislate, which means to amend as well as debate \nlegislation, not simply to vote on whatever the majority puts in front \nof us.\n  Our constituents want us to force attention to public issues, even \nwhen the majority would prefer to avoid them. This is the caliber of \nrepresentation our constituents both demand and deserve. The rules and \npractices of the Senate have been designed to facilitate just this kind \nof representation. It is these same rules that the majority now seeks \nto change because they find them inconvenient.\n  There is a conceit expressed in Washington that what happens in \nCongress is beyond the comprehension of interest of most Americans. But \nthat is not so. When our voice is stifled, full representation for our \nconstituents is denied. When we are gagged, the people are gagged. \nNothing can be easier to grasp or to provoke greater public \nindignation.\n  So my first point is that debate is not the problem. If there is a \ncrisis, it is the majority's gambit of preventing amendments and then \nfiling hundreds of cloture motions to prevent debate. My second point \nis that the unprecedented tactic threatened by the majority to limit \ndebate even more will only further undermine the integrity of this \nbody.\n  Some of those pushing in that direction have never served in the \nminority. But all Senators should be alarmed by this prospect. The \nmajority has talked about changing Senate rules to eliminate the \nopportunity to filibuster motions to proceed. This opportunity has been \navailable to Senators since at least 1949, and as I have mentioned, the \nmajority leader himself repeatedly seized that opportunity when he was \nin the minority.\n  I do not believe the cloture rules need to be changed. I do believe, \nhowever, that if the Senate is to consider a change, it should follow \nthe process laid out in our rules.\n  That process exists for a reason. It is the process we have used to \nchange rules in the past, and there is no reason other than a raw power \ngrab to do it any other way.\n  Senate rules specify that ending debate on a rules change needs \napproval by two-thirds of Senators present and voting, and there is a \nvery good reason this is so. This cloture hurdle on rules changes \nexists to ensure that such amendments are not made without bipartisan \ncooperation. If anything should require broad consensus, it should be \nthe rules by which this institution itself operates.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n  That is how, for example, we changed the rules in 2007 concerning the \ncontent of conference reports and the use of earmarks or how we \nestablished a way to provide for public disclosure of holds. All of \nthese changes, some of which require amending the rules, occurred \nduring the tenure of the present majority leader. None was muscled \nthrough by majority fiat or forced on an unwilling minority. \nBipartisanship was possible because these changes were good for the \nSenate.\n  But now we have learned that the majority may begin the next Congress \nby disregarding our rules and attempting to change those they find \ninconvenient by a simple partisan majority. They threaten, as they did \nbefore the start of the current Congress, to use the so-called nuclear \noption to force new rules by single-party will. The substantive changes \nthey have proposed would be degrading enough to the Senate. The method \nthey propose to impose them would be catastrophic.\n  I urge my colleagues, from freshmen to the most senior Members, to \ntake some guidance from our predecessors, such as Senator Mike \nMansfield, who served in the minority and later became majority leader. \nIn 1975, when Senators similarly proposed using this same nuclear \noption similarly to change the cloture rule by simple majority, he said \nthis tactic would ``destroy the very uniqueness of this body . . . and \n. . . diminish the Senate as an institution of this government.'' He \nsaid it would ``alter the concept of the Senate so drastically that I \ncannot under any circumstances find any justification for it.''\n  Senator Reid expressed a similar view in 2003 when he was the \nminority whip, arguing that rules changes should be considered through \nregular order, through the process our rules provide. Senator Reid \nreaffirmed that view in 2005 when he was minority leader, saying that \nthe so-called nuclear option would amount to breaking the rules to \nchange the rules.\n  Senator Reid further observed:\n\n       One of the good things about this institution we have found \n     . . . is that the filibuster, which has been in existence \n     since the beginning, from the days of George Washington--we \n     have changed the rules as it relates to it a little bit but \n     never by breaking the rules.\n\n  In other words, if the majority wants to grab even more power, if \nblocking amendments is not enough for them, if debate is too annoying \nfor them, if they want to rig the rules to further sideline the \nminority, then they should use the process we have here in place in the \nSenate. They should make their case and present their arguments, and if \nthey are compelling enough to attract a wide consensus, then the rules \nof this body can be changed. That is the way we have changed rules in \nthe past. Senator Reid expressed this view when he was in the minority.\n  Former Senator Chris Dodd, a good friend to many of us still in this \nChamber and someone who, I would surmise, would be sympathetic to the \ncurrent majority's views on policy, did so while in the majority. He \nstated in his farewell address his opposition to changing the Senate \nrules in the way the majority leader presently proposes.\n  My friend Senator Dodd had this to say:\n\n       I have heard some people suggest that the Senate, as we \n     know it, simply can't function on such a highly charged \n     political environment, that we should change the Senate rules \n     to make it more efficient, more responsive to the public \n     mood, more like the House of Representatives . . . I \n     appreciate the frustration many have with the slow pace of \n     the legislative process . . . Thus, I can understand the \n     temptation to change the rules that make the Senate so \n     unique--and simultaneously, so frustrating.''\n\n  Senator Dodd continued:\n\n       But whether such a temptation is motivated by a noble \n     desire to speed up the legislative process, or by pure \n     political expedience, I believe such changes would be unwise.\n\n  In conclusion, Senator Dodd said:\n\n       We 100 Senators are but temporary stewards of a unique \n     American institution, founded upon universal principles. The \n     Senate was designed to be different, not simply for the sake \n     of variety, but because the framers believed that the Senate \n     could and should be the venue in which statesmen would lift \n     America up to meet its unique challenges.\n\n  Those who know both Senator Dodd and me know that we didn't agree on \nmuch during our years together in the Senate. However, on this point, I \nhave to say that Senator Dodd couldn't have been more right. We did \nagree on a number of things, but it took bipartisan agreement to be \nable to accomplish that.\n  Rules changes such as the ones proposed by the majority would alter \nthe very nature of the Senate and undermine its unique purpose. For \nmore than two centuries, the procedural rights of individual Senators, \nboth in the majority and in the minority, have been a hallmark of this \nbody. Those rights and the rules and practices developed to protect \nthem have earned us the reputation as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. Among those rights are the minority's right to offer amendments \nand debate. The majority has already put the former under attack, and \nnow the majority leader threatens to undermine the latter. Quite \nsimply, the majority would weaken this institution in a partisan quest \nfor power. Do these steps serve the Constitution? Do they maintain \nchecks and balances? Do they foster bipartisanship? Do they benefit the \nAmerican people? The answer to all of these questions is resoundingly \nnegative.\n  I urge my good friend the majority leader and my friends and \ncolleagues on the other side to exercise serious self-restraint over \nwhether and how Senate rules changes proceed. Those who are unhappy \nwith the rules are free to propose amendments. As we have done in the \npast, those proposals should be referred to the Rules Committee and \nconsidered in the regular course of business. If the proposals have \nmerit, support for them will cross party lines.\n  Bipartisan solutions are urgently needed to resolve the Nation's \nproblems. I speak as a Senator with a long record of working with \nDemocrats to achieve bipartisan consensus and answers. But invoking the \nnuclear option will unnecessarily start a new Congress on a divisive \nand discordant tone. It will generate a poisonous climate guaranteed to \nimpair our capacity to cooperate. No majority can expect the minority \nto stand on the side lines while its rights are destroyed and its place \nin this body is diminished. Any minority of either party would defend \nits place and defend the integrity of this body. We will do so now if \nthe majority pursues this reckless and entirely unnecessary course.\n\n  I urge the majority to respect the traditions of the Senate and to \nfollow our rules. I urge the majority to avoid rather than generate \nthose crises.\n  I have to say that we do not want to be like the House. This is a \nplace where legislation has to be cooled, according to Washington. This \nis a place where we have to do more reflection. This is a place where \nthere are rights in the minority that are time-honored rights, for good \nreasons. Yes, we don't always get our will or our way here. That is \ntough for some of us sometimes. But, on the other hand, rather than \nthrow these rules out or to modify them in ways that really diminish \nthem and to use a nuclear option, it is less than honorable, in my \nopinion.\n  But the fact is that I have been through a lot of this, and I have to \nsay there is a reason these rules are in existence, and you don't just \nthrow them out the door for political advantage. The fact is that this \nbody was never intended to be one where you could just sluice things \nthrough any way you want to and where the majority could get its will \nno matter what happens. This is a body where literally we have to \ndeliberate. This is a body where we need to bring about a bipartisan \nconsensus. Now, that is hard sometimes, it is painful sometimes, it is \nirritating as can be sometimes, but it is the right thing to do.\n  I really don't believe the majority leader is going to push this. I \nthink he is a better man than that. And I don't believe most Senators \nin the majority would put up with that because they are better men and \nwomen than that.\n  I have to say, on our side, we would like to see full debate. We get \na little tired of the majority leader calling up the bill, filing \ncloture immediately, and then filling the amendment tree so no \namendments can be brought up unless he approves them. That is not the \nSenate's way. I am not saying you can never fill the amendment tree, \nbut that should only be used at the end of the debate when it has gone \non too long and it has to be brought to a close. It should not be used \nat the beginning of\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nthe debate. This is a body where we allow nongermane amendments. It is \na body where we have rights. It is what makes it the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. It is a body where rules make a \ndifference.\n  Even though they are to our disadvantage now, I will argue exactly \nthe same if anybody on our side, when we get in the majority, decides \nto change these rules this way. So I hope we all think it through \nbecause there will be all-out war from this day on, from the day on \nthat we use the nuclear option to change perhaps the most important \nrule in the Senate.\n  The filibuster rule is a time-honored right by the minority. It is \none of the only protections the minority has--or should I say one of \nthe few protections the minority has--and it should not be thrown away \nfrivolously.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, you may not believe it, but \nsomeday you are going to be in the minority, and you don't want to see \nthese rules thrown out any more than we do. If we ignore this, ``Katy, \nbar the door.'' We will have obstructed and hurt the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world and the system that has allowed us to be \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a number of matters.\n  Before Senator Hatch leaves the floor, I really do think it is \nimportant that we listen to what he said, but I also think his \ncriticism of the majority leader was really over the top. We just \nfinished a defense bill, I say to my friend, that had over 100 \namendments. I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee. We had \na transportation bill that had endless amendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield for a colloquy?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. There was no intention in my mind to disparage the \nmajority leader. I disparage what the majority leader is doing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am glad the Senator cleared that up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I want to clear it up because he is a friend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine.\n  Mr. HATCH. But these rules are friends, too, and I feel really deeply \nabout this. I hope the Senator and other Democrats feel deeply about it \ntoo, because you might wind up in the minority someday when some people \non our side might want to do what is being done here today. There is a \nreason for these rules.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was here in the minority, and I was able to exercise \nthe filibuster, and I was able to stop a lot of legislation that came \nover from Newt Gingrich's House. I believe in the filibuster \ncompletely, and I think it is important to protect minority rights. But \nI do think there is such a thing as the use of the filibuster versus \nthe abuse of the filibuster. So my position has always been clear that \nI think the abuse of the filibuster is wrong.\n  When I first came here, I thought, well, we should just do away with \nthe 60-vote rule. I came to understand that I didn't really, at the end \nof the day, wind up believing that was wise. So I am working with \ncolleagues to figure out a way we can have a talking filibuster but \nprotect the rights of the minority. But I have to say, I don't think \nthere ought to be a filibuster allowed on a motion to proceed to a \nbill. We have seen that abused and abused and overused. These are the \nkinds of things we should get together on as colleagues, as friends, \nacross the issues that divide us and not engage in filibusters on a \nmotion to proceed to a bill. There is plenty of time to filibuster the \nbill itself. There is plenty of time to argue. But it seems to me \nwhoever is the majority leader, be it a Democrat or a Republican, he or \nshe should have the right to take us to a bill. I think that is a power \nthat should lie with the majority, whoever that majority is. So I would \ncertainly approve of fixing that problem.\n\n  In addition, how many filibusters do we have to have before we go to \nconference? I will support one and we will fight it out. But three \nmotions that can be filibustered before going to conference? That is \nnot doing the people's business. Imagine if a bill gets all the way to \nthat conference phase. Remember, it has gone through the committees of \nthe House and Senate, it has gone through the votes of the House and \nSenate, it has gone through the conference committee to a vote of the \nconference committee. Why on Earth should we be allowed to filibuster \nthree motions? So I think there are ways we can work together.\n  I know my friends from Tennessee and New York at one point were \nworking on ways to prevent any President, be it a Democrat or \nRepublican, from facing filibusters on more or less routine \nnominations. I could support that change too. But I do want to say, as \nI look at the abuse of the filibuster versus use of the filibuster--\nand, again, I believe the rights of the minority must be protected--we \nhave to look at the bold, stark facts. Since Harry Reid became the \nleader here, he has had to face 388 filibusters. The last time the \nDemocrats were in the minority we forced half as many. I think that is \ntoo much, but it is only half as many. So we have our majority leader \nfacing twice as many as Democrats led, and it has gotten out of hand.\n  Members can stand up here and say it is a horrible thing to try to \nchange the rules, but my test is abuse versus use. I think we can come \ntogether and avert any type of showdown at the OK Corral. That is \nridiculous. We don't need that. We can talk as friends and figure out \nsome of these commonsense reforms that we can do without having to get \nangry at one another. I don't think it serves anyone's purpose if we \nare all angry at one another over this.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  My last comments have to do with the fiscal cliff. I stand here 21 \ndays before a tax increase on all Americans is going to occur. This tax \nincrease will go up $2,200 for an average middle-class family.\n  That is the bad news. Taxes are going to rise. Here is the great \nnews. The great news is the Senate already passed legislation to fix \nthe problem. And guess what. We didn't do it yesterday or the day \nbefore yesterday. We saw it coming and we passed it on July 25, 2012. \nWe passed the middle-class tax cuts. My understanding is we took care \nof the AMT.\n  The fact is all that now has to happen is for the House to take up \nour bill. If they take up our bill and they pass our bill, we will see \neveryone in America keep their tax cuts up to $250,000 in income, and \nafter that $250,000 we will go back to the Clinton rates.\n  But here is the really good news, if we do that: We will raise $1 \ntrillion and reduce our debt by $1 trillion. There is no reason why \nSpeaker Boehner shouldn't bring this bill to a floor vote. He will win \nthe vote because I know Democrats and some Republicans will definitely \nsupport him. He needs to be Speaker of the House, not Speaker of the \nRepublicans, just as Tip O'Neill, when I was there, wasn't Speaker of \nthe Democrats, he was Speaker of the House.\n  As a matter of fact, the way Tip did it is, he would get half the \nDemocrats and half the Republicans--and he didn't care what you were, \nan Independent, whatever your affiliation, conservative, liberal--and \nhe would go up to you and say: Can you be with me on this? It is good \nfor the country. Ronald Reagan and I agree.\n  That was Tip O'Neill. And I know what that is like. Ronald Reagan and \nTip O'Neill. So it ought to be President Obama and John Boehner saying: \nWe should pass this middle-class tax cut.\n  Here is the thing I don't get. When the Bush tax cuts went into place \nthey were passed overwhelmingly by Republicans. Why wouldn't the same \nRepublicans want to make sure they continue for 98 percent of the \npeople? I don't get it. I did not vote for the Bush tax cuts then. I am \ngoing to vote for them now, for the 98 percent, because we are coming \nout of a tough time. I didn't vote for them then. You know why? I said \nwe would go into huge deficits. And I don't want to say I was right, \nbut we did go into a huge period of deficits. It was that, plus two \nwars on a credit card, and it was a prescription drug benefit that was \nnot paid for by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower prices. I \nvoted against that too.\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\n  So here we are at a magic moment in time--a magical moment because it \nis the holiday season--and we know the Senate passed the middle-class \ntax cuts in July, and we know there are 21 days left before taxes go up \non 98 percent of the people. Rhetorically, I ask the Speaker: Why don't \nyou just pass this?\n  Today I read the Speaker of the House said: Well, I don't want to do \nthis until I see what programs Barack Obama is going to cut. That is \nhis latest thing. To which I respond: Here is the deal. In the debt \nceiling fight we cut $1 trillion of spending. It is shown in those caps \nthat we vote on. Very tough, $1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 \nyears. That equals what we will get from the tax hikes on those over \n$250,000. Plus, as part of health care reform, we found savings in \nMedicare of $700 billion.\n  By the way, the Republicans ran ads against our people saying the \nDemocrats cut Medicare, and we explained they were savings, because \nwhat we did is we told providers: Cut down on fraud and abuse--you are \novercharging. Be that as it may, the Republicans were just wiping their \nbrow and crying for the Medicare recipients and saying we cut Medicare. \nNow they want more Medicare cuts. They have come up with a plan which \nwould raise the age of Medicare, which I think is completely \ndisastrous, and I will tell you why.\n  If we were to raise the age of Medicare recipients, we would leave \n300,000 seniors uninsured. Just what we want. Happy New Year, Merry \nChristmas, and Happy Hanukkah all in one. We would increase the cost to \nbusinesses by $4.5 billion because people would stay longer on the \nbusiness payroll--their medical payroll--at an age when they are \ngetting older. We would increase out-of-pocket health care costs for \nthose age 65 and 66 by over $3 billion. We would increase costs to the \nStates by $700 million. We would cost millions of seniors age 65 and 66 \n$2,200 more for health care. And we would increase premiums for all \nother seniors enrolled in Medicare by 3 percent because the population \nenrolled in Medicare would be older and less healthy.\n  In other words, we would be pulling the healthiest seniors out of \nMedicare so that those who are left are sicker, and premiums would go \nup on everybody else.\n  The source for these statistics is the Kaiser Family Foundation and \nthe Congressional Budget Office. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record these facts regarding the raising of the Medicare \neligibility age.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Raising the Medicare eligibility age would:\n       Leave nearly 300,000 seniors uninsured.\n       Increase costs to businesses by $4.5 billion.\n       Increase out-of-pocket health care costs for those aged 65 \n     and 66 by $3.7 billion.\n       Increase costs to states by $700 million.\n       Cost millions of seniors age 65 and 66 an average of $2,200 \n     more for health care.\n       Increase premiums for all other seniors enrolled in \n     Medicare by about 3 percent, because the population enrolled \n     in Medicare would be older and less healthy.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say this rhetorically to Speaker Boehner, and I \nwill quote Senator Stabenow, who is quite eloquent on this point. You \nhave a three-legged stool here: You have reductions in spending, which \nwe did in the debt ceiling argument of $1 trillion. It is done. You \nhave cuts in the so-called entitlements of $700 billion, which was done \nunder Obamacare--that is Medicare. The only thing we haven't taken care \nof is the third leg, which is revenues, and we are suggesting for that \n$1.7 trillion that we get $1 trillion in revenues.\n  There have been no revenues put on the table. The Republicans in the \nHouse are defending the billionaires, the millionaires--the Koch \nbrothers and all the rest--from having to pay their fair share.\n  In closing, I would say the American people are very smart. I believe \nthey understand this. They understand what it means to raise the age of \nMedicare, which we are not going to do. They understand what it means \nif we do not make sure they get that renewed tax cut. They understand \nwhat it means when they see millionaires and billionaires who not only \nhave made even more millions and billions, but the disparity between \nthe middle class and the millionaires and billionaires has grown \nwildly.\n  This last election was a lot about that. In this election that was \nnot a side issue--that millionaires and billionaires aren't paying \ntheir fair share. It was not a side issue that we should have a budget \nissue that is fair. It is not a side issue.\n  It is very easy to resolve this. It is not a good idea for us to fall \noff that cliff. It is not a necessary thing. So I say to the \nRepublicans, you want a tax cut for everyone, including billionaires. \nHow about taking it for 98 percent of the people? I think that is a \ndeal you should grab and leave Medicare alone. Let's do this now, and \nwhen we come back we can get a budget deal that is fair all around.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the Senator from California is \nstill on the Senate floor, I want to thank her for her comments on the \nSenate rules.\n  I would agree this is something we should be able to talk amongst \nourselves and work out. Some of us who have been here for a little \nwhile and watch the Senate know it is a unique institution. \nFundamentally, most of us on both sides of the aisle know we are not \nfunctioning as effectively as we should. And there are only two things \nthat need to happen: We need to get bills to the floor, and then we \nneed to have amendments. Historically, it has been the responsibility \nof the majority to decide what comes to the floor, and historically the \nminority--whoever that happens to be--has an opportunity to have \namendments.\n  Over the last 25 years, a couple of things have happened. One is the \nmotion to proceed has been used to block bills coming to the floor. \nThat happened rarely 25 years ago. But, on the other hand, something \nelse happened over the last 25 years: a procedure called filling the \ntree--which is really a gag rule on amendments--was once rarely used \nbut is now abused. During his tenure, Senator Bob Dole used the so-\ncalled filling the tree procedure, and used it seven times. Later, \nSenator Byrd used it three times when he was the majority leader. \nSenator Mitchell used it three times; Senator Lott, 11; Senator \nDaschle, only once, this gag rule; Senator Frist, 15. All those leaders \nused it 40 times. Our majority leader, Senator Reid, has used it 68 \ntimes.\n  So we can all come up with statistics on both sides, but shouldn't we \njust resolve that what we would like to do is show the country we are \ngrown-up, responsible adults; that we can sit down and say, yes, we can \nagree on ways to make sure that most bills come to the floor and \nSenators get to offer most of the amendments they want to offer on the \nbill? I think we can do that. I think there is a spirit on both sides \nof the aisle to do that, and I am working toward that goal and I know a \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans are doing that. I appreciate the \nspirit of the Senator's remarks on the rules.\n  The Senator from California also mentioned the fiscal cliff, and I \nwould like to talk about that in two ways. I have a little different \nperspective.\n  The campaign is over. Congratulations to President Obama. He won it. \nHe won the campaign. Isn't this an opportunity for the President to now \nshift gears, to become President of the United States--to do for the \ndebt that we have, for the social safety net programs that are in \njeopardy, to show the same kind of leadership on those issues that \nPresident Eisenhower did on the Korean war; that President Lincoln did \non the Civil War; that President Reagan did working with Tip O'Neill as \nwas mentioned on Social Security--that was a difficult thing to do back \nin the early 1980s--and President Clinton did on welfare reform.\n  Robert Merry, who wrote the biography of James K. Polk, said the \nother day: In the history of the United States every great crisis has \nbeen solved by Presidential leadership or not at all.\n  A number of us have made our suggestions about what to do about the \nfact that our debt is too big, we are spending money we don't have, and \none way or the other we have to fix it. It is that simple. We shouldn't \nbe borrowing 42 cents of every dollar we spend. So we have to fix it. \nAnd a number of us have said on the Republican side: We will hold our \nnoses and do some things we normally wouldn't do.\n  If the President will come forward with a reasonable proposal on \nrestraining entitlement spending, we will help\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nraise revenues and we will put the two together, and that makes a \nbudget agreement that the new Foreign Minister of Australia described \nin this way: The United States of America is one budget agreement away \nfrom reasserting its global preeminence, one budget agreement away from \nstopping all talk in the Pacific area of America's decline, one budget \nagreement away from showing that we can govern ourselves.\n  So why don't we do that? Well, I was Governor of a State. That is a \nmuch smaller potatoes job--I know that--than being President. But if we \nneeded better roads--which we did--and I waited around for the \nlegislature to come up with a road program, we would still be driving \non dirt roads. If I wanted to recruit the Japanese industry to \nTennessee--which we did--and I waited around for the legislature to \ndecide which country to go, we wouldn't have any of the auto jobs we \nnow have. If we needed to reward outstanding teaching, and I waited \naround for the legislature to decide how to be the first State to pay \nmore for teaching well, we wouldn't be doing it at all--which we are \nnow leading the country in doing.\n  I am trying to say that the way our constitutional system works, at \nthe smaller level in a State with the Governor, or at the national \nlevel with the President, the President sets the agenda.\n  Lyndon Johnson's press secretary, George Reedy, said: The President's \njob is, No. 1, to see an urgent need; No. 2, to develop a strategy to \ndeal with the need; No. 3, persuade at least half the people he is \nright. Well, President Obama has done 1 and 3, but he hasn't done 2. We \nare all sitting around waiting for the President's proposal on what to \ndo about fixing the debt. He has told us what he wants to do about \ntaxes, but he has not yet said what to do about spending on runaway \nentitlement programs which we all know we have to fix. If he will do \nthat, we will get a result.\n\n  We are not the President. We wanted to be. We tried to be. Some of us \nhave even run for the office, but we are not. He is. It is a great \nprivilege. He won the election. We congratulate him for that. So let's \nhave the President's proposal. We need Presidential leadership on the \nquestion.\n  And it is not just an abstract matter of a budget agreement so that \nthe Australian Foreign Minister is happy with the United States, his \nally.\n  I know a lot of people in Tennessee--hundreds of thousands of them \nactually--who can't wait until they are 65 years old in order to get \nMedicare so they can be assured they can afford their health care \nbills. There are hundreds of thousands of people in our State for whom \nSocial Security is their only or most of their income.\n  What do we say to them? Do we say to them that we are going to ignore \nthe fact--let's just take Medicare--that they are not going to be able \nto depend on Medicare unless we take some steps to save it? I mean, we \ncan all count. We know, from the Urban Institute, the average two-\nearner couple who retires this year will have paid about $122,000 into \nMedicare during their lifetime and are going to take $387,000 out, that \nsimply can't continue. One way or another we have to make certain that \nthe millions of Americans who are looking forward to Medicare can count \non it when they become eligible for Medicare. We have the same \nresponsibility with Social Security.\n  So I would hope the President would recognize there are a lot of us \non both sides of the aisle who want to reach a budget agreement. We are \nwaiting for his leadership. He is not sitting around a table as one \nSenator anymore. He is the President. He is the agenda setter. We need \nhis proposal. Then we can react to it and then we can agree on it. He \nis not the Speaker. He is not the majority leader of the Senate or the \nminority leader. He is the President of the United States.\n  Just as President Eisenhower, President Reagan, President Lincoln, \nall of the Presidents who have led in resolving great crises, I hope \nPresident Obama will as well.\n  I want him to succeed in resolving this crisis, and the crisis \nincludes not just raising taxes on rich people--I mean, of course, most \npeople are in favor of raising taxes on the guy with the bigger house \ndown the street. It includes finding a way to fix the debt.\n  I would make one other point on the fiscal cliff. I mentioned that I \nthought the campaign was over, but the President was in Michigan \nyesterday on what looked like a campaign event. It seems to me, that \ntime would have been better spent here in Washington, D.C. working on \nthe fiscal cliff, but he was in Michigan. By my way of thinking, he was \ndoing two things: First, he was encouraging the people of Michigan to \ncontinue to deny working people the right to get or keep a job without \nhaving to pay union dues; and, second, to continue to perpetuate a \nsystem that will keep our auto industry from being able to compete in \nthe world marketplace.\n  Michigan is on the verge of becoming the 24th right-to-work State in \nthe United States. The state Senate and the House each passed separate \nbills in Michigan last week. They passed a final bill today, and I \nunderstand the Governor is about to consider whether to sign it. This \nis what it will do:\n  It will ensure that employees in Michigan do not have to pay union \ndues in order to get or keep a job.\n  The President said yesterday that Michigan legislators shouldn't be \ntaking away the people's right to bargain for better wages or working \nconditions. But no one, in passing a right-to-work law, is taking away \nworkers' rights. They're actually giving them a new right--the right \nnot to have to pay union dues in order to get or keep a job. Workers \nhave the right to collectively bargain. Federal laws have recognized \nthat since the 1930s. But since 1947, the Federal Government has also \nsaid that States have the right to determine whether to a state may \nprohibit compulsory unionism. So if Michigan goes the way of the right-\nto-work law, 24 States have made that decision.\n  The President also said that these right-to-work laws ``have nothing \nto do with economics and everything to do with politics.'' I would \nrespectfully disagree with that based upon my life's experience. Thirty \nyears ago, Tennessee was the third poorest State. I was looking around \nfor a way to increase family incomes and to attract new jobs. So I went \noff to Japan to recruit Nissan. We had virtually no auto jobs in \nTennessee at the time. They took a look at a map of the United States \nat night with the lights on, showing that most of the people lived in \nthe east. While most of the people lived in the east, the center of the \nmarket is where you wanted to be if you are making big heavy things, \nand the center of the market had moved toward the southeast. So \nTennessee and Kentucky were more in the center of the market than \nMichigan or other states where autos had normally been manufactured. So \nNissan looked aggressively at Tennessee, Kentucky, and Georgia. But \nthen they looked at something else.\n  None of the States north of us had a right-to-work law. They had a \nvery different labor environment. So Nissan came to Tennessee. They \nweren't the only ones. General Motors and the United Auto Workers \npartnership came to Tennessee with a Saturn plant. They still have an \nimportant General Motors plant there where the workers are members of \nthe United Auto Workers, but it is in a right-to-work State. Over the \nlast 30 years, there have probably been a dozen large assembly plants \nbuilt in the Southeastern United States. There are about 1,000 \nsuppliers in our State today.\n  What has been the effect of the arrival of the auto industry in \nTennessee, attracted by, among other things, our right-to-work law? \nOne-third of our manufacturing jobs today are auto-related jobs. And \nwhat has been the effect on the United States? It has maintained a \ncompetitive environment where those who want to sell cars in the United \nStates can make them in the United States. Without that competitive \nenvironment, my guess is that most of those cars would be made in \nMexico or some other place around the world.\n  If you don't believe me, read David Halberstam's work in 1986, a book \ncalled ``The Reckoning'' about the American auto industry. In Mr. \nHalberstam's words, the big three carmakers and the United Auto \nWorkers, had enjoyed setting wages, setting prices, and ultimately \nbecame uncompetitive. They laughed at these little Datsuns that Nissan \nwas selling on the\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nwest coast and these little Beetles that Volkswagen was selling in the \nUnited States in the 1960s and 1970s. They ignored the warning of Mitt \nRomney's father, George Romney, the president of the American Motors \nCorporation, who said there is nothing more vulnerable than entrenched \nsuccess. He said that in the 1960s. And what happened? The American \nautomobile industry nearly collapsed.\n  I believe what saved the industry, as much as anything else, was the \nright-to-work laws and the existence of a competitive environment in \nthe Southeastern United States, where workers could make cars \nefficiently, be paid well for their work, and make them here in the \nUnited States, instead of in Japan. What President Carter said to me \nwhen I was Governor of Tennessee was: Governors, go to Japan, persuade \nthem to make in the United States what they want to sell in the United \nStates. They did that and they did well. In fact, the Nissan plant has, \nfor year in and year out, been the most efficient and successful auto \nplant in North America.\n  The right-to-work law has been about jobs and it has made a \ndifference in Tennessee. I am not entirely sure why Michigan has had a \ndifficult time with its economy lately, but perhaps not being a right-\nto-work state is one reason. Michigan's right to adopt this law has \nbeen an important part of our law in Tennessee. I have literally grown \nup with it. I remember, as a 7-year-old, Senator Taft arguing the Taft-\nHartley Act, or at least I heard my parents talk about it. Section \n14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave States the right to say that workers \nin their State did not have to pay union dues to get or keep a job.\n  And I well remember Everett Dirksen's arguments on the Senate floor \nin the mid-1960s. President Johnson, at the behest of union leaders, \nwanted to repeal Section 14(b). Dirksen rose up against it. He said:\n\n       It is the right of the State to do it if it so desires; if \n     the Governor signs the bill, or if they override the \n     Governor's veto. That should be their prerogative in a \n     country where the States and those who represented the States \n     in the Constitutional Convention in 1787 were safeguarded by \n     that residual clause in the Constitution. The right of States \n     to prohibit compulsory union membership has been challenged \n     repeatedly by union officials. But that right has been upheld \n     consistently by the judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  Finally, as a Tennessean, I could be upset that Indiana, and now it \nappears Michigan, has adopted right-to-work laws. That puts Tennessee \nat less of a competitive advantage. I believe in States rights. I \nbelieve States have the right to be wrong as well as the right to be \nright. With all these Midwestern States having the right to be wrong \nand not having right-to-work laws, we benefited enormously in our State \nby the arrival of the auto industries and other manufacturers.\n  But for our country to exist over the next 20 or 30 years in a very \ncompetitive world, where jobs can be anywhere, where things can be \nmanufactured anywhere, we want at least those things that are going to \nbe sold here to be made here. Having a right-to-work law which permits \nthe UAW and General Motors to have a partnership at one plant in \nTennessee and Nissan and Volkswagen to have a nonunion plant at another \nplace in Tennessee, by vote of the employees, I submit, will make us a \nstronger, competitive country.\n  It has everything to do with economics, and I wish the President \nyesterday had spent his time on the fiscal cliff instead of going to \nMichigan and arguing in favor of denying workers their right get or \nkeep a job without having to pay union dues, and denying efforts to \nkeep our American automobile industry as competitive as it needs to be \nin the world marketplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is no great secret that the Congress \nhas a very low favorable rating. Many people shake their heads and they \nwonder why this institution is so dysfunctional. There are a lot of \nreasons for that, but I suggest one of the reasons has to do with a lot \nof hypocrisy that we see in both bodies of Congress. I will give one \nexample.\n  As all of us know, during the recent Presidential campaign, \nRepublicans attacked Democrats over and over for voting to cut Medicare \nas part of the Affordable Care Act. They ran a significant part of \ntheir campaign on saying: Democrats have cut Medicare. We Republicans \nare here to protect Medicare.\n  In fact, this is exactly what Mitt Romney said on August 15, 2012.\n\n       My campaign has made it very clear: the President's cuts of \n     $716 billion to Medicare, those cuts are going to be restored \n     if I become President and Paul Ryan becomes Vice President.\n\n  The reality is that what we did under the Affordable Care Act \nresulted in zero cuts to benefits. We tried to make the system more \nefficient. But be that as it may, the Republicans posed as great \nchampions of Medicare against those terrible Democrats who wanted to \ncut it. Meanwhile, Democrats went to town, taking on the Ryan budget \nwhich did make devastating cuts to Medicare and, in fact, wanted to \nvoucherize that program. So we have Republicans beating Democrats for \nostensibly--not accurately--trying to cut Medicare, Democrats attacking \nRepublicans for, in fact--accurately--wanting to cut Medicare, and \nwhere are we today?\n  If we read the newspapers we hear and we know as a fact that Mr. \nBoehner, the Republican Speaker, has proposed devastating cuts in \nMedicare--a month after the election where the Republicans said they \nwere going to defend Medicare. They want to raise the Medicare \neligibility age from 65 to 67. Frankly, I am concerned there may be \nsome Democrats--not a whole lot, I hope none, but some Democrats--who \nmay end up going along with that disastrous proposal. That is \nhypocrisy. Everybody during the campaign is saying the other guy wants \nto cut Medicare. The day after the campaign, our Republican friends are \ntalking about devastating cuts and maybe some Democrats are prepared to \nsupport that.\n  Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 would be an \nunmitigated disaster. It would cut Medicare benefits by $162 billion \nover the next decade and would deny Medicare to over 5 million \nAmericans who are 65 or 66 years old.\n  The American people, when asked how do you feel: We are looking at \ndeficit reduction. Do you think it is a good idea to raise the Medicare \nage? The American people overwhelmingly say, no, that is a dumb idea, \ndon't do it.\n  According to a November 28, 2012, ABC News Washington Post poll, 67 \npercent of the American people are opposed to raising the Medicare \neligibility age, including 71 percent of Democrats and, I suggest to my \nRepublican friends, 68 percent of Republicans, 62 percent of \nIndependents.\n  While there may be division in the Senate or House, there is no \ndivision among the American people. They think it is a dumb idea and \nthe American people are right. They are right for very obvious reasons.\n\n  Think about some woman who is 66 years of age, not feeling well. She \ngoes into the doctor's office and she is diagnosed with a serious \nhealth care problem. There is no Medicare there for her. What does she \ndo? She goes over to a private insurance company. What do you think the \nprivate insurance company is going to charge this person who is already \nill? An outrageous rate she cannot afford. What happens to this senior, \nthat person who is 65 or 66? Do they die? Do they go bankrupt? Do they \ngo to their kids who do not have the money to help them stay alive? It \nis a disastrous idea.\n  Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 would leave at \nleast 435,000 seniors uninsured every year. Imagine being 66 and not \nhaving health insurance. Easy for folks around here in the Congress to \nlaugh. Easy for wealthy people to laugh about it. It isn't so funny \nwhen you are living on $15,000 or $20,000 a year and have no health \ninsurance. It would increase costs to businesses by $4.5 billion. It \nwould, of course, increase out-of-pocket costs for seniors; the \nestimate is about $3.7 billion.\n  For the individual senior, the estimate is that for two-thirds of \nseniors age 65 to 66, they would pay an average of $2,200 more for \nhealth care. They are trying to live on $20,000, $25,000, $30,000 a \nyear. Suddenly they are hit, on average--could be more, could be less--\n$2,200 a year. On it goes.\n  It would increase premiums by about 3 percent for those enrolled in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nhealth care exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act because many \n65- and 66-year-olds would be enrolled in the exchanges instead of \nMedicare. It would save the Federal Government $5.7 billion in 2014, \nbut it would cost seniors, businesses and State and local governments \n$11.4 billion--double that, double what the Federal Government would \nsave.\n  I hope all those folks who, before the election--Republicans and \nDemocrats--were running around the country and in their own States \nsaying: We are for the middle class; we are going to protect Medicare--\nI hope they go back and read their preelection speeches and stick to \nwhat they said before the election.\n  That is one of the issues out there in terms of the so-called fiscal \ncliff or deficit reduction. Let me talk about another insidious one, in \nterms of raising the age of 65 to 67 on Medicare. That is a disaster, \nbut it is pretty clear, everybody understands what it is about. There \nis now an underhanded way, an insidious way that some people are \ntalking about doing deficit reduction, the so-called chained CPI, which \nnobody outside Washington, DC, has a clue as to what it is about.\n  What it would do is change the formulation in terms of how we \ndetermined COLAs for seniors, disabled vets, and others. The bottom \nline is, in my view and the view of many economists, we underestimate \nthe inflationary cost of what seniors are spending because a lot of \ntheir spending goes into prescription drugs, health care, and that has \ngone up faster than general inflation. What the chained CPI says is: \nOh, no. What we have now is too generous and we have to cut back. We \nhave to make the COLA skimpier.\n  This is exactly what a chained CPI would do for people on Social \nSecurity. What it says is that somebody who was age 65 would see their \nbenefits cut by $560 a year when they turn 75 and $1,000 a year when \nthey turn 85. Again, I know we have CEOs from Wall Street who have huge \nsalaries, who receive huge bonuses, who have the best care available in \nthe world, they have great retirement programs--these guys who were \nbailed out by the working families of America when their greed nearly \ndestroyed the financial system of the world--they are now coming to \nCapitol Hill and they are saying we have to cut Social Security and we \nhave to cut Medicare and we have to cut Medicaid.\n  For those guys, when we talk about $560 a year for somebody who is \n75, that is not a lot of money and $1 thousand when you are 85--what is \na thousand bucks? Let me tell you, $1,000 is a lot of money when you \nare trying to survive on $18,000 or $20,000 a year. We must not allow \nthat to take place.\n  There is something many people do not know; that is, the chained CPI \nwould go beyond cutting benefits for seniors on Social Security. It \nwould take a real devastating whack at disabled veterans. What about \nthat? I want my Republican friends or any Democrats who support that to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and tell the American people that when \nwe send young men and women over to Afghanistan and Iraq and they got \ntheir arms blown off, they got their legs blown off, and we are now \ngoing to balance the budget on their backs by cutting benefits for \ndisabled veterans--come to the floor of the Senate and tell the \nAmerican people they support a chained CPI which would do exactly that.\n  We have some folks here saying, yes, people are making billions of \ndollars, we don't want to cut their taxes. But, yes, we will cut \nbenefits for disabled vets who lost their arms and legs in Afghanistan. \nThat is an obscenity and I hope very much we do not go in that \ndirection.\n  When we talk about deficit reduction, we have to deal with it. It is \na serious problem. There is a lot of discussion about the need to deal \nwith $4 trillion over a 10-year period, and I support that. Let's talk \nabout a way we can go forward without balancing the budget on the backs \nof the elderly, disabled vets, working families.\n  First of all, we have to understand and acknowledge that in the \ndeficit reduction debates of 2010 and 2011, the Republicans won, \nbasically, those negotiations. We have to be honest about that. \nRepublicans acknowledge that. Some Democrats do. Republicans are \ntougher than Democrats, Democrats cave, Republicans stand tall.\n  We have to understand, despite the fact we have a growing inequality \nin this country, rich getting richer, middle class shrinking, after all \nthe discussions about deficit reduction, the wealthiest people in this \ncountry have yet to pay one nickel more in taxes. But because the \nDemocrats are not quite as tough as the Republicans, what has happened \nis that we have cut, in those two negotiations, $1.1 trillion in \nspending already. So if we are talking about a $4 trillion bill, \nunderstand that we have already cut $1.1 trillion, which leaves $2.9 \ntrillion to be dealt with. I think the President is right, and I simply \nhope this time he sticks to his guns and does what he says.\n\n  What I am suggesting is that there are ways to do deficit reduction \nthat are fair. The first point, in terms of $4 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod, we have already cut over $1 trillion in terms of spending--$1.1 \ntrillion. No. 2, I think the President is right in suggesting we have \nto ask for significant revenue from the wealthiest people in this \ncountry--the top 2 percent--without asking for any tax increases for \nthe bottom 98 percent. That would add $1.6 trillion in revenue, \nbringing us somewhere around $2.7 trillion, so we have a $1.3 trillion \nproblem. Over a 10-year period, that is not a difficult problem to \nsolve.\n  Let me throw out a few ideas, and I am sure other people have equally \ngood ideas.\n  Before we cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we might want \nto address the reality that this country is losing about $100 billion \nevery single year from corporations and wealthy people who are stashing \ntheir money in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens, and \n$100 billion is a heck of a lot of money.\n  At a time when gas and oil prices have soared recently, when we know \nmajor oil companies have in recent years paid nothing, in some cases--\ndespite being enormously profitable--in Federal taxes, we can and must \nend tax breaks and subsidies for oil, gas, and coal companies.\n  This country is now spending almost as much as the rest of the world \ncombined in terms of defense. Our friends and allies in Europe provide \nhealth care for all their people. In many of these countries, college \neducation is free. We are spending twice as much as part of our GDP as \nthey spend on defense. I think it is time to take a hard look at \ndefense spending, and I think we can make cuts there which will still \nleave us with the kind of military we need to defend ourselves.\n  Instead of raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, \ninstead of cutting benefits, we can make Medicare and Medicaid more \nefficient. I believe we can save at least $200 billion over a 10-year \nperiod by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and lowering prescription \ndrug costs for seniors. For example, the Medicare Part D prescription \ndrug program prohibited Medicare from negotiating with the \npharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices. The VA negotiates, and \nother government agencies negotiate. Medicare should be able to do \nthat.\n  Fortunately, the war in Iraq is over. We are about to wind down in \nAfghanistan, and there are savings there.\n  So before I give the mic over to my colleague from Vermont, I wish to \nconclude by saying, yes, we go forward on deficit reduction, but there \nare ways to do it. At a time of growing wealth and income inequality in \nAmerica, we can move forward and make significant reductions in our \nnational debt, in our deficit, without doing it on the backs of the \nelderly, the children, the sick, and the poor.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post on the subject of increasing the age for Medicare \neligibility be printed in the Record.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 11, 2012]\n\n    Raising Medicare Age Could Leave Hundreds of Thousands Uninsured\n\n                           (By Greg Sargent)\n\n       It looks increasingly possible that lawmakers will reach a \n     fiscal cliff deal that includes a hike in the Medicare \n     eligibility age--a concession to those on the right who seem \n     determined to see very deep entitlement cuts, even if they \n     take benefits away from vulnerable seniors. One argument for \n     raising the eligibility age is that seniors who lose benefits \n     can get insurance through Medicaid or the Obamacare \n     exchanges.\n       But a new report to be released later today undercuts that \n     argument--and finds that up to half a million seniors could \n     lose insurance if the eligibility age is raised.\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n       The report, by the Center for American Progress, points out \n     a key fact that's been mostly missing from the debate: The \n     hope of getting seniors who lose Medicare insured through \n     Obamacare could be seriously compromised by the Supreme Court \n     decision allowing states to opt out of the Medicaid \n     expansion. This would inflate the number of seniors who could \n     be left without insurance, because many would fall into the \n     category of lower-income senior that would be expected to \n     gain access to Medicaid through its expansion. (Jonathan Cohn \n     has written about this extensively.)\n       Here's how CAP reached its conclusion. The nonpartisan \n     Congressional Budget Office recently concluded that a rise in \n     the eligibility age could mean as many as 270,000 seniors are \n     left uninsured in 2021. But that's assuming Obamacare is \n     fully implemented in all states. The CAP report points out \n     that 10 states have publicly declared they will opt out of \n     the Medicaid expansion, and more are undecided.\n       The CAP study then totaled up how many seniors below the \n     poverty line live in states that may opt out of the Medicaid \n     expansion, using 2011 data. The total: Over 164,000. This \n     table shows how many of these seniors live in each of these \n     states:\n       Add these to the aforementioned 270,000 seniors, and you \n     get a total of approximately 435,000 seniors who could be \n     left without insurance annually by 2021. And this is a \n     conservative estimate--it's based on 2011 data, and the \n     population of seniors will grow significantly over the next \n     decade.\n       Now, it's very possible that many of these states will \n     ultimately drop their bluster and implement the Medicare \n     expansion. But Republican state lawmakers are also stalling \n     in setting up the exchanges and resisting the law in other \n     ways. With Obamacare implementation up in the air, it may be \n     too risky to raise the eligibility age and hope Obamacare can \n     pick up the slack.\n       ``With opponents of the health care law still working to \n     block it at every turn, many more seniors would become \n     uninsured because they would have nowhere else to turn,'' \n     CAP's president, Neera Tanden, tells me. ``As a result this \n     misguided proposal would undermine the promise of affordable \n     health care for all.''\n       On top of this, the report finds, raising the eligibility \n     age could also undermine a key goal of Obamacare by inflating \n     medical costs and health care spending, for a range of \n     reasons: Cost shifting, tampering with the health and age \n     levels in insurance pools, and an increased reliance on \n     private insurance, which isn't as good as Medicare at \n     controlling costs.\n       In my view, the speculation that Dems will ultimately agree \n     to raising the eligibility age has been a bit overheated--\n     it's not clear this is definitely on the table. But it's \n     certainly possible. After all, some on the right seem \n     determined not to accept any entitlement reform as ``real'' \n     unless vulnerable beneficiaries are harmed, and Obama and \n     many Dems prefer a deal to going over the cliff. So anyone \n     who doesn't want to see this happen should be making noise \n     about it right about now. And there are a range of \n     alternative ways to cut Medicare spending without harming \n     beneficiaries.\n       I'll bring you a link to the report when it's available.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to begin by recognizing a \nsignificant achievement by the senior Senator from Iowa, our ranking \nRepublican on the Judiciary Committee. Today Senator Grassley has \nserved for 31 years, 11 months, and 6 days as a member of our \nCommittee. His tenure now exceeds that of our friend, former chairman, \nlongtime member, and current Vice President, Joe Biden. Senator \nGrassley is now the sixth longest-serving member in the history of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley and I know how the \nCommittee should operate in its best traditions. I will continue to \nwork with him to achieve all we can for the American people.\n  Today, the Senate will finally be allowed to vote on the nominations \nof Jesus Bernal to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California and John Dowdell \nto fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof Oklahoma. Both of these nominees were voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote before the August recess and should have been \nconfirmed months ago. These confirmations today will demonstrate that \nthere was no good reason for the delay--just more partisan delay for \ndelay's sake. This unnecessary obstruction is particularly egregious in \nconnection with Jesus Bernal's nomination because it perpetuated a \njudicial emergency vacancy since the middle of July for no good reason \nand to the detriment of the people of Los Angeles and the Central \nDistrict of California.\n  Also disconcerting is the Senate Republicans' continuing filibuster \nagainst another Oklahoma nominee. Although he had had the support of \nhis two Republican home State Senators, Senate Republicans filibustered \nin July the nomination of Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to a judgeship \non the Tenth Circuit. Senate Republicans continue to object to voting \non this nomination and are apparently intent on stopping his \nconfirmation for the remainder of the year. This, despite the \nreassuring comments made by Republican Senators when they joined the \nfilibuster in September and excused their participation by saying that \nafter the election he would receive Senate action. With the American \npeople's reelection of President Obama there is no good purpose to be \nserved by this further delay. But Robert Bacharach and nearly a dozen \njudicial nominees, who could be confirmed and who would fill four \ncircuit court vacancies and five additional judicial emergency \nvacancies, are being forced to wait until next year--or perhaps \nforever--by the Senate Republican leadership. Among those nominations \nis that of William Orrick III to fill another judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Northern District of California and that of Brian Davis \nto fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Middle District of Florida.\n  A perceptive and long-time observer of these matters is Professor \nCarl Tobias. I ask that a copy of his recent article entitled ``Obama, \nSenate Must Fill Judicial Vacancies'' from The Miami Herald be included \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. He recently wrote how these vacancies on our Federal trial \ncourts ``erode speedy, economical and fair case resolution.'' He \ncorrectly points out that this President, unlike his predecessor, \n``assiduously'' consults with home State Senators from both parties. \nSenate Republicans nonetheless stall confirmations virtually across the \nboard. For example, they are filibustering the Bacharach nomination \nfrom Oklahoma and the Kayatta nomination from Maine, despite the \nsupport of Republican home state Senators.\n  Professor Tobias observes that the judicial nominees of President \nObama are ``noncontroversial . . . of balanced temperament, who are \nintelligent, ethical, industrious, independent and diverse vis a vis \nethnicity, gender and ideology.'' None of these characteristics or \ntheir outstanding qualifications matter to Senate Republicans intent on \nobstruction. The explanations that Republicans offer for their \nunprecedented stalling of nominees with bipartisan support, indicate \nthat Republicans are fixated on a warped sense of partisan payback. \nThey recognize none of the distinctions with the circumstances in 2004 \nwhen President Bush was seeking to pack the Federal courts with \nconservative activist ideologues and Senate Republicans ran roughshod \nover Senate practices and traditions. They ignore the history since \n2004, the resolution of the impasse by recognition of a standard \nlimiting filibusters only to situations of\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\n``exceptional circumstances,'' or the marked difference in the role \nthey have been accorded by President Obama and me in connection with \nhis judicial nominations from their home States.\n  After this vote, the Senate remains backlogged with 18 judicial \nnominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, including 13 \nnominations from before the August recess. They should be confirmed \nbefore the Senate adjourns for the year. If the Senate were allowed to \nact in the best interests of the American people, it would vote to \nconfirm these nominees and reduce the judicial vacancies that are \nplaguing our Federal courts and that delay justice for the American \npeople. Sadly, it appears that Senate Republicans will persist in the \nbad practices they have followed since President Obama was elected and \ninsist on stalling nearly a dozen judicial nominees who could and \nshould be confirmed before the Senate adjourns this month.\n  By this point in President Bush's first term we had reduced judicial \nvacancies to 28. In stark contrast, there are still close to 80 \njudicial vacancies today. If the Senate were allowed to confirm the 20 \njudicial nominations currently pending, we could take a significant \nstep forward by filling more than one-quarter of current vacancies and \ncould reduce vacancies around the country below 60 for the first time \nsince President Obama took office. Even that would be twice as many \nvacancies as existed toward the end of President Bush's first term.\n  That so many judicial nominations have been delayed by Senate \nRepublicans into this lameduck session need not prevent the Senate from \ndoing what is right for the American people. Those who contend that it \nwould be ``unprecedented'' to confirm long-stalled nominations in this \nlameduck session are wrong. The fact is that from 1980 until this year, \nwhen a lameduck session followed a presidential election, every single \njudicial nominee reported with bipartisan Judiciary Committee support \nhas been confirmed. That is the precedent that Senate Republicans are \nbreaking. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nno consensus nominee reported prior to the August recess has ever been \ndenied a vote--before now. That is something Senate Democrats have not \ndone in any lameduck session, whether after a presidential or midterm \nelection.\n  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees, including three circuit court nominees, in the \nlameduck session after the elections in 2002. I remember I was the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee who moved forward with those votes, \nincluding one on a very controversial circuit court nominee. The Senate \nproceeded to confirm judicial nominees in lameduck sessions after the \nelections in 2004 and 2006. In 2006 that included confirming another \ncircuit court nominee. We proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in \nthe lameduck session after the elections in 2010, including five \ncircuit court nominees.\n  That is our history and recent precedent. Those who contend that \njudicial confirmation votes during lameduck sessions do not take place \nare wrong. I have urged the Senate Republican leadership to reassess \nits damaging tactics, but apparently in vain. Their new precedent is \nbad for the Senate, the Federal courts and, most importantly, for the \nAmerican people.\n  Further, their partisan spin on the past does nothing to help fill \nlongstanding vacancies on our Federal courts, which are in dire need of \nadditional assistance. Arguments about past Senate practice do not help \nthe American people obtain justice. There are no good reasons to hold \nup the judicial nominations currently being stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar. A wrongheaded desire for partisan payback for some \nimagined offense from years ago is no good reason. A continuing effort \nto gum up the workings of the Senate and to delay Senate action on \nadditional judicial nominees next year is no good reason.\n  It is past time for votes on the four circuit nominees and the other \n14 district court nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nWhen we have consensus nominees before us who can fill judicial \nvacancies, especially judicial emergency vacancies, the Senate should \nbe taking action on these nominations to help the American people. \nDoing so is consistent with Senate precedent, and it is right. Let us \ndo our jobs so that all Americans can have access to justice.\n  John Dowdell is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Oklahoma.

However, the \n     Judiciary Committee delayed action on Circuit Judge Brian \n     Davis for the Middle District three times until the June 21 \n     meeting when the panel reported Davis 10-7. The committee \n     also only held a September hearing for Magistrate Judge \n     Sherri Polster Chappell, whom President Barack Obama \n     nominated to the Middle District in June and finally approved \n     her on Thursday.\n       Moreover, the bench experiences 64 vacancies in the 679 \n     district judgeships. These openings erode speedy, economical \n     and fair case resolution.\n       Observers criticized Obama for nominating too slowly in \n     2009, but he has since picked up the pace. The chief \n     executive assiduously consulted Republican and Democratic \n     senators from states where vacancies occurred before \n     nominations. He has suggested noncontroversial nominees of \n     balanced temperament, who are intelligent, ethical, \n     industrious, independent and diverse vis-a-vis ethnicity, \n     gender and ideology.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the \n     Judiciary Committee, has rapidly set hearings and votes, \n     sending nominees to the floor where many have languished. For \n     instance, the Senate recessed September 22 without \n     considering 19 excellent nominees; most enjoyed strong \n     committee votes.\n       Republicans should cooperate better. The major problem has \n     been the Senate floor. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the \n     Republican Minority Leader, has rarely agreed to ballots, \n     invoking unanimous consent, which allows one senator to halt \n     votes. Especially troubling has been Republican refusal to \n     vote on qualified consensus nominees, inaction that \n     contravenes Senate custom. When senators have cast ballots, \n     they overwhelmingly confirmed most nominees.\n       The 64 district vacancies are crucial. The Middle and \n     Southern District each experience two. Obama has nominated 33 \n     highly competent prospects nationwide. The President \n     nominated Judge Davis and Judge Walker during February and \n     Judge Chappell in June. Obama must quickly propose candidates \n     for the 31 openings without nominees. Senators approved Judge \n     Walker because he is well qualified. The chamber failed to \n     consider the other similarly qualified Florida nominee, Judge \n     Davis, before recessing in September but must vote on him in \n     the lame duck session that began November 13. The committee \n     reported Judge Davis in June 10-7 with Senator Lindsey \n     Graham, R-S.C., not voting. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, \n     voted against. He ``had a concern about some intemperate \n     language that dates back to 1995 in what otherwise appears to \n     be an unblemished record'' and would ``keep an open mind.''\n       Judge Davis was held over thrice at the request of Senator \n     Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking member, who appeared \n     concerned about Davis' answers in the May hearing and to \n     later written questions. On June 21, Grassley voiced concern \n     about Davis' perspectives respecting a few issues, \n     particularly implicating race, and voted No.\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\n     Now that the committee has reported Judge Chappell, the \n     Senate must quickly consider her, while the chamber should \n     expeditiously process Circuit Judge William Thomas, whom \n     Obama nominated for one Southern District vacancy November \n     14.\n       The administration should keep closely conferring with \n     Florida Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio, who expressed \n     strong support for Walker, Davis, Chappell and Thomas, and \n     soon propose a fine nominee for the Southern District opening \n     created November 16 when Judge Patricia Seitz assumed senior \n     status. The Senate, for its part, must speedily process that \n     nominee.\n       The 64 vacancies undermine the delivery of justice. \n     Accordingly, President Obama must swiftly nominate, and \n     senators promptly approve, numerous excellent judges now that \n     senators have reconvened for their lame duck session.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very excited and rise in strong \nsupport of Jesus Bernal's nomination to be U.S. District Judge for the \nCentral District of California. He is going to make an amazing judge.\n  He is the oldest son of two humble factory workers, Gilberto and \nMartha, who aspired for their sons and daughters to attend college.\n  As the daughter of a mom who never even graduated from high school \nbecause she had to go out and work to provide for her ailing dad, I can \nsay that you know any parents who give up so much for their kids have \nthe heart and you know their sons and daughters will have the heart and \nwill make sure--whether they wind up here or teaching in a school or \nwhatever their profession is, or being on the bench--they will work for \njustice for all.\n  Gilberto and Martha would tell young Jesus and his siblings: ``You \nstudy, we work.'' Those are the kinds of parents he came from. Their \naspirations were realized. All five of their children attended college, \nand today, I believe, Mr. Bernal will be confirmed as a federal \ndistrict court judge. What a country we live in.\n  When confirmed, Mr. Bernal will be the only Latino district court \njudge serving the central district's eastern division, which includes \nmy home county of Riverside and San Bernardino County as well. What a \ntremendous honor for his family.\n  Mr. Bernal graduated from Yale with honors, and then Stanford Law \nSchool. After law school, he clerked for Judge David Kenyon on the same \ncourt to which he has been nominated. What an amazing thing: The clerk \nbecomes the judge.\n  He began his career as an associate at Heller Ehrman, where he worked \non complex commercial litigation cases. In 1996, he joined the L.A. \noffice of the federal public defender for the central district and \nrepresented indigent defendants in federal court.\n  In 2006, he became the directing attorney for the Riverside branch \noffice where he supervises a team of attorneys, investigators, \nparalegals, and administrative staff. He served on the board of \ndirectors for the Federal Bar Association, Inland Empire Chapter, since \n2006, and he has dedicated time to working with at-risk youth.\n  Confirming a judge to the central district's eastern division comes \nnot a moment too soon. Riverside County has 23 percent of the central \ndistrict's population. But out of the 25 active judges, there is only 1 \nactive judge sitting in Riverside. The people of Riverside need another \njudge. I am proud it will be Jesus Bernal, a highly respected member of \nthat community.\n  I want to thank the Senate Judiciary Committee, for this amazing \nsupport. And I want to thank President Obama for moving this \nrecommendation forward.\n  I also hope that before the Senate adjourns this year we approve four \nother California nominees who are awaiting confirmation: Fernando \nOlguin, Jon Tigar, Bill Orrick, and Troy Nunley. All are nominated to \nserve on courts that are considered judicial emergencies.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Jesus Bernal to be a U.S. District Judge for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Born in Mexico, Mr. Bernal is 49 years old. He earned his Bachelor's \nDegree cum laude from Yale University in 1986 and his law degree from \nStanford Law School in 1989. He became a U.S. citizen in 1987.\n  Following law school, Mr. Bernal spent 2 years as a law clerk for the \nHonorable David V. Kenyon on the same court to which he is nominated \ntoday, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n  Mr. Bernal began his career in private practice, working as an \nassociate at the law firm of Heller, Ehrman, White, & McAuliffe in Los \nAngeles from 1991 through 1996. Mr. Bernal practiced complex civil \nlitigation, representing corporate clients in business disputes.\n  Since 1996, Mr. Bernal has worked as a Deputy Federal Public Defender \nin the Central District of California, where he has personally \nrepresented hundreds of indigent criminal defendants and overseen \nhundreds of other representations.\n  Mr. Bernal has appeared hundreds of times in court. He represents \ndefendants through each phase of their cases--in hearings and plea \nnegotiations, and at trial, sentencing, and on appeal.\n  Since 2006, Mr. Bernal has been a leader in the Federal Public \nDefender's Office, experience that will help him manage his courtroom. \nHe is the Directing Attorney of the Riverside Branch Office, a role in \nwhich Mr. Bernal supervises trial attorneys, investigators, and other \npersonnel, in addition to carrying his own caseload.\n  He also serves as chairman of the Ethics Committee for the Federal \nPublic Defender's Office for the whole Central District, which is the \nlargest Federal Public Defender organization in the Nation. In this \ncapacity, Mr. Bernal works to resolve ethical issues and to provide \nethical guidance for the 240 employees who work for the Federal Public \nDefender in the Central District.\n  Mr. Bernal has over 20 years of legal practice, including 5 years in \ncomplex civil litigation and 15 years in Federal criminal defense. He \nalso has extensive practical experience supervising other attorneys. In \nshort, he is well-prepared to serve on the District Court.\n  The seat Mr. Bernal will fill has been vacant since former District \nJudge Stephen Larson stepped down from the bench in 2009.\n  Judge Larson sat in the Eastern Division of the Court, which hears \ncases in Riverside and covers the counties of San Bernardino and \nRiverside, the 11th and 12th most populated counties in the Nation.\n  The Central District is very busy. It has a caseload that is nearly \n30 percent above the national average, and the sixth-highest civil \ncaseload in the Nation.\n  The Eastern Division of the Central District is even more critically \noverloaded. It has only a single district judge. Yet it encompasses \n2,000 annual civil filings and 4.2 million people roughly the \npopulation of the entire commonwealth of Kentucky, which has nine \nactive district judges and seven senior judges to handle its workload.\n  In short, filling this particular seat is very important and will \nbring needed judicial resources to the Federal bench in Riverside.\n  I also want to urge the confirmations of other judicial nominees from \nmy home State.\n  Including Mr. Bernal, 5 of the 15 district court nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar are from California. The other nominees are:\n\n       Magistrate Judge Fernando Olguin, a nominee to the Central \n     District whom I recommended to the President;\n       Superior Court Judge Jon Tigar and Bill Orrick, nominees to \n     the Northern District recommended by Senator Boxer; and\n       Superior Court Judge Troy Nunley, a nominee to the Eastern \n     District whom I recommended to the President.\n\n  All four were approved by bipartisan votes in the Judiciary \nCommittee, three of them by voice vote.\n  Each of these districts is in a judicial emergency according to the \nJudicial Conference of the United States.\n  The Central District's caseload is over 30 percent above the national \naverage. The Northern District's caseload is over 20 percent above the \nnational average. It now takes over 50 percent longer for a case to go \nto trial than it did a year ago in the Northern District, which hears \nsome of our county's most complex technology cases.\n  The Eastern District is the most overworked district in the Nation by \nfar. With over 1,100 weighted filings per judgeship, its caseload is \nover twice the national average.\n  Simply put, my State more than any other urgently needs us to take \nprompt action on judicial nominees.\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Jesus Bernal, \nand to support confirming the four other distinguished California \nnominees pending on the Executive Calendar this year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, no matter what calendar one goes by, we \nare nearing the end of this Congress. We have only a few short weeks to \nend the stalemate and pass a farm bill. For months, House leaders have \nblocked a vote on a bipartisan farm bill. We passed in this body, \nacross the political spectrum--Republicans and Democrats alike--a bill \nthat saved tens of billions of dollars. However, the Republican \nleadership in the House of Representatives will not allow it to come to \na vote. Much is at stake--from rural communities to farmers who need \nthe certainty that a farm bill extension would mean. I have said a lot \nof times on this floor that farming cannot be put on hold. We can't \ntell a farmer: Well, hold those crops for a couple of months while we \nwait to see what we are doing. Don't milk those cows for a few months \nuntil we figure out whether the Congress will get its act together on a \nfarm bill. It doesn't work that way. Farmers already cope with \ninnumerable variables in running their businesses. The last thing they \nneed is for Congress to needlessly compound the uncertainty through \nweeks of delay and obstruction.\n  The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill under the leadership of the \nchair of our committee, Senator Stabenow. We passed a bipartisan bill \nthat renews the charter for basic agriculture, nutrition, and \nconservation programs, while saving taxpayers $23 billion. What I have \nbeen told privately is that if the House leaders would permit a vote, \nthis bill would pass in the House. Just as Republicans and Democrats \ncame together in this body, they would in the other body. Passing it \nwould end this corrosive stalemate, while contributing billions of \ndollars to deficit reduction. Unfortunately, it appears the nutrition \nprograms that help millions of our most vulnerable fellow Americans are \nthe latest excuse for preventing a House vote to get the farm bill \ndone. In this, the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth, some are \nsaying they will hold this up because we have hungry people who need \nthe support our nutrition programs provide.\n  With so many Americans still struggling to put food on the table, it \nis not only regrettable, but more than that, it is inexcusable that \nsome House Republicans have turned to slashing central nutrition help \nfor struggling Americans as a means to prevent action on the farm bill. \nEnsuring that these programs can continue to serve Vermonters and all \nAmericans, especially those in need, is a key part of enacting a strong \nfarm bill for this economy. It is a reality recognized by the Senate-\npassed farm bill. Unfortunately, consideration of the farm bill is not \nthe first time this Congress has been forced to debate legislation that \nwill greatly reduce the ability of the neediest among us to put food on \nthe table for their families. Bills and amendments have been proposed \nthat would cut tens of billions of dollars from the food stamp program, \neliminating nutrition assistance for millions of Americans and denying \nhundreds of thousands of American children school meals. I am proud \nthat time and again during this Congress the Senate has defeated such \nproposals. I will continue to help fight back against such attacks.\n  The bipartisan Senate-passed farm bill makes an investment in \nAmerican agriculture that benefits our producers, our dairy farmers, \nour rural communities, our Main Street businesses, our taxpayers, and \nour consumers. Now it is being held hostage by House Republicans who \nare demanding Draconian cuts in food assistance programs just as we are \ncoming out of the worst recession in generations. They are preventing \nfinal action on a bill that touches every community and millions of our \nfellow citizens across the Nation. It is ironic that during this \nholiday season, opponents of nutrition programs that help the poor are \ninsisting on making it drastically more difficult, or impossible, for \nthese families and their children to simply eat.\n  No Member of the Senate, no Member of the House of Representatives \ngoes hungry except by choice. None of us do. We don't know what that is \nlike. We don't go home and look at our children and say: We can't feed \nyou tonight; hold on for another day. I know you are hungry. I know you \nare crying. I know you can't sleep. But we can't feed you today. None \nof us face that. But I can tell my colleagues that there are people in \nevery single State we represent where that is their reality.\n  Those advocating for these drastic cuts couldn't have chosen a worse \ntime. As winter approaches, Vermonters and others across the country \nare going to find the demands for paying for heat, electricity, and \nfood a large strain on their family's budget. All this is before we \neven take into account those areas where they are recovering from such \nterrible natural disasters and those communities who probably face \ndisasters in the future. I know there are Vermonters, as there are so \nmany other Americans, who struggle every day to make ends meet and are \nforced to make tough decisions about whether to pay for rent or heat or \nmedications or food. We are talking about essentials.\n  The Presiding Officer and I represent two of the most beautiful \nStates in this country, but we also know that both our States can get \nvery cold in the wintertime. When it is 5 and 10 below zero, heat is \nnot a luxury and food shouldn't be a luxury. When it is 5 below zero, \nthe choice should not be, can we heat or can we eat? This in America? \nThat is wrong.\n\n  While the economy continues to recover, and we hope it will, we still \nhave many Americans who rely on basic assistance to get by each month. \nThankfully, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has \nhelped fill the gap. It offers the most comprehensive assistance \navailable to the poorest Americans.\n  No one can deny the effects of hunger on Americans, especially \nchildren. Children who live in food insecure homes are at a greater \nrisk of developmental delays, poor academic performance, nutrient \ndeficiencies, obesity, and depression. Yet participation in food \nassistance programs turns these statistics on their head. Federal \nnutrition programs have been shown to lessen the risk that a child will \ndevelop health problems, and they are associated with decreases in the \nincidence of child abuse. Children from families who receive SNAP have \nhigher achievement in math and reading. They have improved behavior, \nsocial interactions, and diet quality than children who go without this \nnutrition help.\n  It is unfortunate that during this fall's campaign, we saw candidates \nwho were intent on spreading misconceptions about a program that lifts \nmillions of Americans above the poverty line each year. The contention \nthat SNAP beneficiaries are largely out-of-work Americans is far from \naccurate. Two-thirds of the beneficiaries are children, the disabled, \nor the elderly who cannot be expected to work. The remaining \nparticipants are subjected to rigorous work requirements in order to \nreceive continuing benefits. And while SNAP offers crucial support to a \nfamily's grocery expenses, the benefits far from cover all of a \nfamily's food needs. With a benefit average of $1.25 per person, per \nmeal, it is understandable that families typically fall short on \nbenefits by the middle of the month.\n  Vermont has done a remarkable job at urging Vermonters to register \nfor our SNAP program. We call it 3Squares. But the unfortunate reality \nis that thousands of Vermonters continue to go without food they could \nreceive. I hear from Vermont families who participate in 3Squares about \nthe importance of Federal food assistance. Parents have told me they \nignore their own hunger to ensure their kids are fed, but they don't \nknow how they can cope if benefits are cut further. Kathy, a mother \nfrom Barre, VT, where my father was born, says her child has come to \nher crying, wondering whether they will have enough money for food. \nOthers have noted that expenses for necessities, such as heating and \nrent, are fixed costs. When Three Squares benefits run out, skipping \nbreakfast or lunch is the only way to scrape by.\n  Unfortunately, both the Senate bill and the committee-passed farm \nbill in\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nthe House include cuts to the nutrition assistance. Nonetheless, the \nSenate bill takes a more sensible approach. Of the $23 billion in \ndeficit reduction included in our bill, $4.5 billion comes from \nnutrition programs, nearly four times less than the House Agriculture \nCommittee bill. I do not support the cuts in the Senate bill, and I \nsupported an amendment during the Floor debate to restore this funding \nto SNAP, so that families across the country would not lose an average \nof $90 per month in benefits. But the cuts in the Senate bill represent \na concession from our Chair, and ultimately the Senate farm bill passed \nthe Senate on a bipartisan vote, including mine, as it always has.\n  This concession is not enough for many House Republicans. The $16 \nbillion reduction in nutrition programs they wish to see in a farm bill \nwould devastate nutrition programs nationwide. Millions in every State \nin this country would be left without means to purchase food. These \ndrastic reductions would result in the elimination of food assistance \nfor an estimated 2 to 3 million people, and 280,000 children would lose \neligibility for free school meals. This is shameful.\n  The budget choices we make in Congress reflect who we are as \nAmericans. The American people want budget decisions that are fair and \nsensible. Americans do not want their friends, neighbors, or family \nmembers struggling to feed themselves or their children. Proposed cuts \nto food assistance programs will mean more hungry families in America. \nI have spent nearly 38 years in the Senate fighting hunger and I will \ncontinue to oppose efforts in the farm bill to further roll back hunger \nassistance programs that help our neediest fellow Americans. In a \nnation that spends billions on wasted diet fads, I would like to see us \nspend some money to feed the hungry in the most powerful Nation on \nEarth.\n  Madam President, I see my good friend from Oklahoma on the floor, and \nI know he wishes to speak on behalf of his nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee for allowing me to say something about our \nvote that is coming up.\n  Mr. Dowdell has been nominated to a vacancy on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Oklahoma, which sits in my hometown \nof Tulsa. In fact, he is a neighbor of mine in Tulsa.\n  After graduating from the University of Tulsa's College of Law, Mr. \nDowdell began his legal career as a clerk to the chief judge of the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Since 1983, Mr. Dowdell has accumulated \nextensive State and Federal litigation experience representing a \nvariety of clients working at the same firm in Tulsa of which he is a \npartner.\n  Mr. Dowdell is a native Tulsan and has been extensively involved in \nthe community, in addition to being widely recognized for his work on \nbehalf of his clients. I received a number of letters from members of \nthe legal community throughout Tulsa highlighting Mr. Dowdell's work \nethic, his character, and his abilities as an advocate for his clients.\n  Mr. Dowdell already has experience as a mediator and arbitrator and \nhas served as an adjunct settlement judge in the Northern District for \nthe past 14 years, which is the district for which he is nominated. He \nand his wife of 24 years, Rochelle, like my wife and I, have four \nchildren, which I always remind people is just the right amount. If you \nare ever going to have 20 kids and grandkids, you have to start with 4, \nand he understands that.\n  Although it often seems as if I am on the opposite side of many of \nthis administration's judicial nominees, I can say with confidence that \nthis is not the case with Mr. Dowdell. Mr. Dowdell has the requisite \nexperience and judicial temperament to make a fine judge in the \nNorthern District of Oklahoma.\n  I am particularly impressed with Mr. Dowdell's commitment to ``render \ndecisions fairly and impartially, applying the relevant law to the \nfacts without bias or prejudgment,'' to interpret a statute or \nconstitutional provision in a case of first impression by first \nconsidering ``the statutory text or provision in the context of its \nplain and ordinary meaning''--that says a lot--and to not consult \nforeign law when interpreting the U.S. Constitution. Too often in this \ncountry we have judges applying their own meanings to the Constitution \nand to the laws passed by Congress or allowing their own biases to \naffect their decisions. I can state confidently to my colleagues that \nJudge Dowdell will not be this type of a judge.\n  In his Questions for the Record to the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nMr. Dowdell has stated that he does not agree with the notion that the \nConstitution is a ``living'' document that constantly evolves as \nsociety interprets it. He further states that the ``Constitution \nchanges only through the amendment process, as set forth in Article V \nof the Constitution.'' That is refreshing. ``A court's job is to \ninterpret and apply the Constitution, not to add or amend the rights \ncontained therein.'' That is a quote by him.\n  Based on these statements, I can say that Mr. Dowdell's judicial \nphilosophy is in keeping with the Framers and in lockstep with my own \nphilosophy. My only wish is that we would get more of this type of \njudicial nominee from the administration.\n  It is for these reasons that I support Mr. Dowdell's confirmation to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and I \nhope my colleagues will do the same.\n  This vote should be coming up in about 10 minutes. I do encourage a \npositive vote on Mr. Dowdell.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of John E. Dowdell\n\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of John E. Dowdell, of Oklahoma, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we have been hearing a lot about the so-\ncalled Bush tax cuts from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nGiven the rhetoric being used by some on the other side to describe \nthis tax relief, I would like to take this time to correct the record.\n  But, first, during this talk about the fiscal cliff and about the tax \ncuts that sunset at the end of the year, all we have been hearing since \nthe election is, What are we going to do about taxes? That is very \nsignificant as a result of the last election because I think it is a \nforegone conclusion there is going to be more revenue raised.\n  But if we raise the amount of revenue the President wants raised, and \nraise it from the 2 percent he wants to raise it from--the wealthy--\nthat is only going to run the government for 8 days. So what will we do \nthe other 357 days or, if we look at the deficit, it will only take \ncare of 7 percent of the trillion-plus deficit we have every year. What \nabout the other 93 percent?\n  So the point is that we can talk about taxes and taxes and taxes, but \nit is not going to solve the fiscal problems facing our Nation. We \ndon't have a taxing problem, we have a spending problem. So we should \nhave been spending the last 3 weeks talking about how we are going to \ntake care of the other 93 percent of the problem. The President should \nhave declared victory 3 weeks ago, and we wouldn't have had all this \nlost time between now and right after the election.\n  But I said I wanted to set the record straight. This tax relief of \n2001 and 2003 reduced the tax burden for virtually every tax-paying \nAmerican. It did this through across-the-board tax rate reductions, \nmarriage penalty relief, and enhancing certain tax provisions for hard-\nworking families, such as doubling the child tax credit.\n  Since the passage of this tax relief, there has been a concerted \neffort by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to distort the \ntruth about the present tax policy of the Federal Government. That tax \npolicy has been in place for the last 12 years now. They have attempted \nto distort the truth behind its bipartisan support, its benefits to \nlow- and middle-income Americans, and its fiscal and economic impact.\n  As one of the architects of the 2001 and 2003 tax legislation, I come \nto the floor to correct what I believe have become three common myths \nabout this tax relief. The first myth is that this tax relief was a \npartisan Republican product. The second is that the tax relief was a \ngiveaway to the wealthy. And the third is that the tax relief is a \nprimary source of our current fiscal and economic problems.\n  First things first. We often hear the other side divisively refer to \nthis tax relief as the Bush tax cuts. Given the rhetoric on the other \nside, one would think all this tax relief was forced through along \nparty-line votes. The record proves otherwise. The conference report to \nthe Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001 passed the \nSenate by a vote of 58 to 33. In all, 12 Democrats voted for this \nlegislation. Senator Jeffords, who later caucused with the Democrats, \nalso voted for it.\n  As far as major pieces of legislation goes, it is difficult to find \nsuch major legislation passed with such broad support since there has \nbeen Democratic control of both the Senate and the White House. The \nPresident's 2009 stimulus bill, as an example, only had the support of \nthree Republicans, as well as the Dodd-Frank bill. Of course, there is \nthe health care bill, the President's signature legislation, which \npassed with no Republican votes.\n  Moreover, all the 2001 and 2003 tax relief was extended in 2010, just \n2 years ago, with strong bipartisan support, and signed into law by \nthis President. At that time--2 years ago--the Senate vote tally was 81 \nto 19. Now, understand, that has to be considered overwhelmingly \nbipartisan. So just 2 years ago we had overwhelming bipartisan support \nfor the Bush tax cuts. Yet somehow this is a partisan measure we are \ndealing with. Given this record, instead of calling it the Bush tax \ncuts, as they are called, we really should be calling it the bipartisan \ntax relief.\n  I now would like to turn to the other side's criticism of the \nbipartisan tax relief or, as they say, tax cuts for the wealthy or \nanother way they say it is it is a giveaway to the rich. This rhetoric \ndemonstrates the difference in philosophy between this Senator and my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  First of all, a reduction in tax rates is not a giveaway to anyone. \nThe income a taxpayer earns belongs to that taxpayer. It is not a \npittance the taxpayer may keep based upon the good graces of our \ngovernment. The burden should not be on the taxpayer to justify keeping \ntheir income. Instead, it should be on us in Washington to justify \ntaking more away from them.\n  Secondly, there is a tendency on the other side to view everything as \na zero sum game. In their minds, if someone has more, it means someone \nelse will have less. So I would like to quote Ronald Reagan as the best \nexample of this attitude when he said too many people in Washington \n``can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the \nconclusion that the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the \nthin one.''\n  I believe this is what is driving the animus against the so-called \nwealthy on the other side. They are under the impression the wealthy \ngot rich at the expense of someone less fortunate.\n  The problem with this view is that in a free economy goods and \nservices are transferred through voluntary exchanges. Both parties are \nbetter off as a result of this exchange; otherwise, it wouldn't occur. \nMoreover, wealth is not static. It can be both created as well as \ndestroyed.\n  At worst, the government is a destroyer of wealth. At best, the \ngovernment is a redistributor of wealth. It is through the force of \ngovernment the zero sum exchanges occur. It is the private sector that \ncreates wealth through innovation and providing the goods and services \nwe need and want.\n\n  The leadership of the other side has become fixated on redistributing \nthe existing economic pie. I believe the better policy is to increase \nthe size of the pie. When this occurs, no one is made better off at the \nexpense of anyone else.\n  The constant rhetoric of pitting American against American based upon \neconomic status is not constructive. It also has not been constructive \nto accuse those of us who support the present tax policy for all \nAmericans as agents of the rich. And I will soon get into discussing \nwhy that isn't true, as a result of the 2001 and 2003 tax bills.\n  I do not support tax cuts for the wealthy for the purpose of wealth \nredistribution. I support progrowth policies to increase the size of \nthe economic pie. Free market, progrowth policies are the only proven \nway to improve the well-being of everybody.\n  My objection to the other side's characterization of the bipartisan \ntax relief is not only a philosophical one, but it is a factual one. \nThe truth is that the bipartisan tax relief that was voted on in 2001 \nmade the Tax Code more progressive, not less. With all the rhetoric \naround here over the last 5 or 6 years, nobody believes that, so I have \na chart to show that.\n  Since its implementation, the share of the tax burden paid by the top \n20 percent has increased. Conversely, the bottom 80 percent has seen \nits share of tax burden decrease. Additionally, the percentage \nreduction in average tax rates between 2000 and 2007 was the largest \nfor the lowest income groups.\n  As you can see from this chart, there is a general trend downward \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nbottom 20 percent to the top 20 percent. The bottom 20 percent saw \ntheir average tax rate drop by the 25 percent that is shown there. The \ntop 20 percent, on the other hand, only saw an 11-percent reduction, \nwith the proportionate in between.\n  The truth about the bipartisan tax relief apparently has been \nrecognized by my colleagues on the other side. They do not like to \nadmit this, but this must be so since they now claim to support \nextending 75 percent of the bipartisan tax relief bill. In other words, \n75 percent of what they are condemning of the 2001 tax bill the other \nside wants to make permanent law, which obviously I support too. You \nwould think that if it really was a tax cut for the wealthy, however, \nthe other side would be advocating letting all this tax relief expire. \nCertainly you would not think they would be advocating for more than \nhalf of it to be extended. To get around their seemingly contradictory \nposition, they have stopped referring to the majority of the bipartisan \nrelief as the Bush tax cuts. That term is now reserved only for the 25 \npercent they wish to see expire. They now refer to the 75 percent not \nas Bush tax cuts but as middle-class tax relief. So I have news for my \ncolleagues. The middle-class tax relief you now claim to support is the \nsame relief you previously demonized as tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Finally, it has become en vogue for the other side to blame the \nbipartisan tax relief for everything from the Federal deficit to the \nstate of the current economy. Neither is based in fact nor sound \neconomic reason.\n  It is undisputed that in 2001 the Congressional Budget Office was \nprojecting a 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. However, as a \nJune 2012 CBO report shows, the bipartisan tax relief role in turning \nthis projected surplus into deficits is dwarfed by other factors. This \nis the 2001-2003 tax cuts. See that smaller piece of the pie?\n  Then let's look at what else is the justification, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office--not this Senator--about where the deficit \ncame from.\n  First off, the June CBO report tells us that their budget surplus \nprojections were simply incorrect. That happens a lot with CBO. I like \nto refer to CBO around here as God because what they say goes, and you \nhave to abide by it if you don't have 60 votes. But they aren't always \nright. Unlike God, CBO is not omnipotent. They do not have perfect \nforesight, and every once in a while even they make mistakes.\n  CBO's surplus projections were based on rosy economic assumptions as \nwell as faulty technical assumptions that did not pan out. CBO failed \nto predict the bursting of the tech bubble that was so beneficial in \npropping up the economy of the Clinton years. CBO also could not \npredict the September 11, 2001, tragedy that hit New York and the \nPentagon, killing 3,000 Americans, which wreaked havoc on our economy.\n  So add up all these things. All told, these and other economic and \ntechnical changes account for $3.2 trillion or, as I show in this \nchart, these faulty assumptions accounted for 27 percent of the change \nof the 2001 projections from surplus to deficit.\n  By far, the biggest reason for the change from surplus to deficit was \nan increase in spending. Some of this spending was justified. This \nincludes bipartisan support for increased spending to protect our \nNation against future terrorist attacks. But, of course, as has become \nthe custom around here, we spent and spent and spent some more. This \nspending not only continued but escalated with the election of \nPresident Obama. His first act was to increase the deficit by $800 \nbillion-plus through a failed stimulus package. In all, this increase \nin spending accounts for nearly 50 percent in the change from surplus \nto deficit. That is this part of the pie chart.\n  So how about the tax cuts we hear so much bellyaching about from the \nother side? If you look closely at my chart, you will see I have \ndivided the tax relief into two slices. These two slices add up to \nabout 25 percent. Eleven percent of this, which I labeled ``all other \ntaxes,'' primarily consists of the tax relief provided in President \nBush's 2008 stimulus package, President Obama's 2009 stimulus, and the \npayroll tax holiday. Of course, these provisions had large Democratic \nsupport, as we all know. That leaves us with the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief accounting for merely 12.9 percent of the change in the \nprojected surplus.\n  But understand what other people are saying--including, I think, even \nthe President--about the reason we have this big budget deficit is \nbecause of the Bush tax cuts. Well, that is baloney. That is a far cry \nfrom being the driver of our deficits or even a substantial \ncontributor. The truth is, even using CBO's static scoring assumptions, \nthe tax relief did not push us into deficits. In fact, if the only \nchange since CBO's 2001 projection had been the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief, we would still be experiencing sizeable surpluses each year.\n  Along with blaming the bipartisan tax relief for deficits, my \ncolleagues on the other side have alluded to this tax relief as being a \ncause of our recent recession. The President even made this claim in an \nad during the Presidential election.\n\n  The exact logic of this claim escapes me. Apparently, it also escaped \nWashington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler. He described the reasoning \nsupporting such a claim as a ``Rube Goldberg phenomenon.'' The Post was \nunable to find any respected academic study supporting this convoluted \nlogic. There is good reason the Post could not find such a study. The \nfocus of most economic research in this area is on the degree to which \ntax increases lower economic growth and tax decreases increase economic \ngrowth. There is considerable debate within this research, but it is \ndifficult to find any suggesting that tax increases are good and \ndecreases are bad for the economy.\n  Now that I have explained and hopefully corrected these myths, I hope \nwe can have a more constructive discussion on averting the fiscal \ncliff. Republicans have already stated they are willing to accept some \nnew revenues. Speaker Boehner has put $800 billion in new revenues on \nthe table. However, we still haven't heard any substantive ideas from \nthe President or other leading Democrats about cuts to spending or \nentitlements. We haven't even heard the President say good things about \nthe Simpson-Bowles recommendations--a commission he appointed, a \ncommission that had Republicans and Democrats on it, a commission that \nreported conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats saying: We \nought to do what we can to see the Simpson-Bowles approach through. It \nwould be nice to see the President endorse a recommendation of a \ncommittee he appointed that had a suggestion for taking care of this \nfiscal cliff problem. If he had done that 2 years ago, we wouldn't be \ndebating fiscal cliff today.\n  So there are serious concerns on my side of the aisle that any \nagreement we reach will result in immediate tax hikes but promised \nspending cuts will never occur. We need more than just empty promises \nfrom the other side.\n  The President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need \nto get serious about looking at the spending side. It is time for the \nPresident to make good on his campaign promise of supporting a balanced \napproach to deficit reduction.\n  I repeat what I said at the beginning. All we have heard for 3 or 4 \nweeks now since the election is all about taxes. Too often, that is \nwhat Republicans are talking about, although they have to be considered \nnow as a result of the election. But if we give the President \neverything he wants in the sense of taxing the wealthy with the figures \nhe wants, it still runs the government only for 8 days. What about the \nother 357 days? It only takes care of 7 percent of the deficit problems \nwe face year after year, and it is going to be year after year into the \nfuture if we don't get something done about it. So what about the other \n93 percent? The taxes aren't going to take care of that. You can't tax \nus out of this deficit problem because we have a spending problem.\n  So if we had put as much time into the spending side of the ledger as \nwe put into the taxing side of the ledger over the last 3 or 4 weeks, \nwe would be well on the road and be certain to get out of here by \nChristmas Eve, which I have my doubts that we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                     Tributes To Departing Senators\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to make four separate statements \nin commendation to my fellow colleagues in the Senate and one back in \nGeorgia.\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. President, December of every even-numbered year is a sad time. \nBecause of election outcomes or because of age and longevity, time \ntakes over and some of our Members go and new Members come. I think it \nis important that we take the time to recognize those who served so \nlong and served so well and served each of us--individuals such as Jon \nKyl of Arizona, the whip for the Republican minority in the Senate. He \nis a great American, a great Arizonan, a man who carries a tremendous \nburden--two, as a matter of fact. One is trying to herd cats, known as \nthe Republican conference, and the other is being the junior Senator to \nJohn McCain. Both of those are challenges that anybody would have a \nproblem meeting, but Jon Kyl does it the right way. He has the \ntemperament of a leader. I have been in 38 different legislative years, \nfrom the Georgia Legislature to the U.S. Congress. I have known a lot \nof whips. I have known a lot of them who cracked the whip, I have known \na lot of them who were ineffective, and I have known a very few who \nwere effective. And Jon Kyl is the most effective whip I have ever \nworked with and ever seen. He knows the issues and has the ability to \ncommunicate them. He knows how to put the party ahead of individual \npriorities but keep the country first no matter what it is.\n\n  I will give you one good example. We were debating the START treaty 2 \nyears ago, which is a very important treaty for the United States. The \nPresiding Officer was on the Foreign Relations Committee when we had \nthat debate. He might remember there were a lot of people who were \nconcerned about the modernization of our nuclear arsenal while we were \nrenewing the START treaty and what we would do in the prospective years \nahead while we made a new treaty with Russia in terms of our \nmodernization. It was Jon Kyl's leadership, working with Senator Kerry \nas the chairman of the committee, Secretary of State Clinton as our \nSecretary of State, and interests on both sides who carved out the \nagreement that ensured for the American people that we would have the \nmodernized nuclear force we need to meet whatever challenge might come \nour way. That treaty passed in large measure because he gained the \nassurances from the administration and from those who were opposed that \nwithout modernization and the commitment for the money for it, it would \nnot take place. That is not just a whip, that is a leader. That is a \nman who found a problem, found a solution, married the two, and we \nratified a treaty. America is a safer country because of it, and our \nnuclear arsenal is being modernized.\n  That is the kind of man you look for in a legislator. Jon Kyl is a \ngreat legislator, a great whip, and a great friend of mine. I pay \ntribute to him for his service to the U.S. Senate, for his service to \nthe people of America, and for his service to the people of his State \nof Arizona.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  I would like to turn to Richard Lugar from Indiana. Richard Lugar is \none of those rare people who are referred to as an institution, and he \nis truly an institution: Six terms in 36 years in the Senate, a \ncandidate for President of the United States in the Republican primary \na number of years ago, a bipartisan man who worked with then-chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn to put together the Nunn-Lugar \nagreement, which is allowing us to tear apart nuclear warheads, \nreprocess those nuclear warheads, tear down nuclear missiles and \nballistic missile launchers, and have a safer world. The reason there \nis not a terrorist attack using nuclear fission materials today so far \nis probably more because of Dick Lugar and Sam Nunn than any two \nindividuals in the United States.\n  Dick Lugar is a man I admire greatly. When I came here, I hoped one \nday I could work on the Foreign Relations Committee so I would have the \nopportunity to work with Dick Lugar. That opportunity took place, and \nthe Presiding Officer and I have served together with Dick Lugar for 4 \nyears. I watched Dick Lugar during tough times, during happy times, \nduring good times, and during challenging times. He is always even. He \nhas always got an even keel. His rudder is in the water. He knows where \nhe wants to take the committee, but he doesn't drive it, he leads it.\n  One of the great negotiators of our time, one of the great men of our \ntime in terms of foreign relations, Dick Lugar is the man who has meant \nmore to our country than anybody I can possibly think of today, and he \nhas a legacy of supporting the State of Indiana in any way he possibly \ncould, from the school board, to mayor of Indianapolis, to U.S. \nSenator, to a great lecturer and leader on the national and \ninternational stage. We will miss Dick Lugar very much, and I am sure \nDick Lugar will miss us, but I hope all of us will remember and learn \nfrom that he taught us about a steady hand, good diplomacy, and the \nimportance of diplomacy over guns any day of the week.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  I wish to turn to another individual, a member of the Democratic \nconference and a dear friend of mine, Kent Conrad from North Dakota.\n  When I came to the Senate, the first thing I noticed about Kent \nConrad was how he dressed. The second thing I noticed was his dog \nDakota. You will see Dakota in the evening walking through the Halls of \nCongress, a smart little dog and his pet that he loves very much. His \nwife Lucy is a great lady and great leader in her own right in terms of \nMajor League Baseball.\n  Kent Conrad is a unique Member of the Senate. He has truly taken a \nbipartisan approach to the toughest problems we face in terms of \nspending, deficits, and debt. It was Kent Conrad who was willing to \nhelp support the Simpson-Bowles proposal when it passed the Senate, and \nthen it was Kent Conrad who agreed to serve on Simpson-Bowles and came \nup with the recommendations they brought to us. It was Kent Conrad who \nwent on the Gang of 6 and tried to work out a tough compromise on the \ntough issues before us, and it is Kent Conrad who has served as \nchairman of the Budget Committee of the Senate for the last 6 years. \nAlong with Senator Sessions, he has done a great job, and along with \nhis predecessor, Judd Gregg, they did an even greater job to see to it \nthat we brought forward budgets and principles of spending money to \nhelp us not go into deficit or debt. Kent is one of those rare leaders \nwho find the sweet spot. He looks for the place where people can find \ncommon ground. He understands that the importance of our job is the \nfuture for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Whether North Dakota or Georgia, California or New York, Pennsylvania \nor Ohio, Kent Conrad is a Senator for all America. He has done a \ntremendous job for the United States. I wish him and Lucy and Dakota \nthe very best.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Bill Curry\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I wish to turn to football coaches, which might seem to \nbe a quick turn when you are talking about Senators, but in Georgia we \nare having a retirement that was just announced, the retiring of Bill \nCurry, the head coach of the Georgia State Panthers. Bill Curry is a \nlegend in our State, not only of his time but in all time in terms of \nfootball. He played football in College Park and went on to Georgia \nTech when they were in the Southeastern Conference. He was a small, \n200-pound center on the Georgia Tech football team. He went from \nGeorgia Tech to the Green Bay Packers and played in the first Super \nBowl game as a starting center and was traded to the Baltimore Colts \nand played in the famous game when Joe Namath promised a victory and \ndelivered it against the Colts. He went on to play for other NFL teams \nuntil he was hurt in a game with the Los Angeles Rams with an injury \ncaused by Merlin Olsen, who then later went on to be a great pro \nbowler. But he didn't quit when his career ended in terms of playing \nfootball; he went into coaching. He went back to his home alma mater, \nGeorgia Tech, and coached as an assistant. He then took Pepper Rogers' \nplace and became the head coach at Georgia Tech, took them to the bowl \ngames, took them to conference championships, and was a true leader.\n  From there he was sought out by the University of Alabama--a pretty \nbig job in the South when it comes to football. He came after Bear \nBryant had passed away and two successive coaches had failed to meet \nthe Alabama standard. Bill Curry came and went to Alabama, and he \nscored. He won an SEC championship, 26 out of 36 games, and had a great \ncareer at Alabama.\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\n  He went from there to the University of Kentucky, which had not had a \nwinning record in 9 years when Bill Curry showed up. He molded somebody \nelse's recruits into a winning team with a winning record and a trip to \nthe Peach Bowl in Atlanta, GA. He went from there to take on an \ninteresting challenge. Georgia State University called and said: Bill \nCurry, we are going to start an NCAA division football program. We \nwould like you to start from scratch. We don't have a field, we don't \neven have a football, but we have a desire.\n  Bill Curry took on that challenge and in 4 years built a great \nprogram which he will turn over to a new coach very shortly in Atlanta, \na program where his first year, with a first-time football team that \nhad never been together before, he won 6 out of 11 games and went on to \nhave a great career and turn it over to another coach as he retires.\n  But his legacy is not the SEC championship. It is not playing in the \nfirst Super Bowl or playing in the famous bowl that Joe Namath called \nand guaranteed. It is not his attendance at Georgia Tech. It is not \nwhat he did at Georgia State. It is the fact that everywhere he went, \nBill Curry's legacy was men who played football to learn the game of \nlife because he was always a disciplinarian. He told people how to do \nthings the right way. He set standards for his men that lasted not just \nthrough the football season but through a lifetime. There are men \nplaying football, running banks, running insurance companies, and \nteaching today all over America who learned from Bill Curry.\n  On the occasion of his retirement at the age of 69 and the great \nsuccess he has had throughout his career, I wanted to pause for a \nmoment in the Senate and recognize not just his contribution to \nfootball but his contribution to the lives of young men and the people \nhe has shaped to make this country and the State of Georgia a better \nState and a better country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the bill \nbefore the Senate, a 2-year extension of the TAG Program. As everyone \nknows, this will be the second 2-year extension of a program that was \nput in place as an emergency measure taken during the height of the \nfinancial crisis. It was also meant to end once the crisis passed.\n  I have exceptionally high regard for community bankers in Tennessee, \nas I know you do for those in Pennsylvania. They have had to deal with \nthe financial crisis of 2008, a recession that had been left in its \nwake, and if that is not bad enough, since the passage of Dodd-Frank, \nthey have had to deal with an onslaught of new regulations.\n  Many of these regulations, no doubt, were ill-conceived. If we \nremember, a lot of those were put in place as aspirational goals. All \nof them have dramatically increased the compliance burden of being in a \nsmall banking institution. Yet none of them has been on the table to be \nfixed or improved by us in the Senate since 2010. Obviously, there are \na lot of reasons for this, but from a standpoint of community bankers, \nthere is no doubt this has been a shame.\n  I am very hopeful that in the next Congress we will have a meaningful \ndialog about striking a better balance in terms of bank regulation, \nparticularly as it relates to our community banks. Some of what we \npassed in Dodd-Frank makes a great deal of sense, but much of it does \nnot, and it is for us to devote energy to fixing and improving the law \nwhere there are flaws. If we want to help community banks, this is \nwhere we should focus our energy, and I know there are a lot of \nbipartisan ideas around about how we can do that. I think all of us \nhave heard from community bankers in our States about the onslaught of \nregulations they have, some of which was meant to deal with some of the \nbigger institutions. Again, that, to me, is where we can focus in a \nbipartisan way to give some relief to our community banks.\n\n  Giving out limitless deposit insurance, though, I suppose some people \nhave decided is a consolation prize, and I hate that. That is too bad. \nWe should fix Dodd-Frank if we want to help our community banks. But \nthe vote in front of us today is a TAG extension, so I wish to speak a \nlittle bit about that specifically.\n  There are a series of policy reasons why it is time to end the TAG \nProgram. I will go through a couple of them. First of all, the FDIC's \nDeposit Insurance Fund, or the DIF, is undercapitalized. This is a fund \nof reserves meant to protect taxpayers against an unexpected law \nstemming from bank failures. By law, the DIF is required to be at a \n1.35-percent of total outstanding deposits. It is, however, only at .35 \npercent today. I do not see the wisdom in extending an insurance to \n$1.5 trillion in transaction deposits at a time when the Deposit \nInsurance Fund is already undercapitalized.\n  Second, there is ample liquidity in our banking system as to support \nloan demand. In fact, the ratio of loans to deposits is at a historical \nlow. Liquidity to make loans is not the problem; slow economic growth \nis the problem. Extending insurance to keep these deposits around then \nfixes a problem that simply does not exist.\n  Third, the overwhelming majority of TAG deposits are actually with \nthe largest banks. Some small banks have said they want an extension, \nbut this is largely not a small bank product. Seventy-one percent of \nTAG deposits are in the largest banks. Sixty percent of TAG deposits \nare held by just the top five banks. I do not see the wisdom in \nleveraging the FDIC and the taxpayer to insure the deposits sitting in \nour country's largest financial institutions.\n  Fourth, extension of the TAG Program raises serious moral hazard \nissues. It encourages large deposits in banks that may be troubled with \nno market discipline. Moral hazard is why, throughout the history of \ndeposit insurance, it has always been limited. I think Washington has \ncontributed quite enough to moral hazard problems over the last 5 \nyears--several years--and I think it is time for us to stop.\n  Finally, if we want to help community banks thrive and succeed, our \nfocus should be on dialing back Washington's desire to micromanage our \nbanking institutions. The regulatory pendulum of Washington trying to \nmicromanage these institutions has absolutely gone too far and our \nfocus should be on getting the pendulum back to a more reasonable \nplace. Extending limitless FDIC insurance for these transaction \ndeposits does not further that policy objective. In fact, it takes us \nin the other direction.\n  Let me put it another way: How can we ever get DC out of the business \nof telling banks where and when to lend if we are having DC guarantee \nall their deposits? The answer is we cannot.\n  I am offering a couple amendments that help insulate the taxpayer. \nAlthough, in reality, it is time to fully end this program. Even more \nimportant, it is time for us as members of the Banking Committee to \ntake up the real challenges still facing our financial system.\n  I wish to say one other thing. I know all of us are watching as the \nPresident and Speaker Boehner and others are looking at dealing with \nthe fiscal issue; we call it the fiscal cliff. I think all of us know \nwhat we need to do to deal with the fiscal cliff. We need a true fiscal \nreform package that I hope would be in the range of $4 trillion to $4.5 \ntrillion, so we can put this issue behind us and begin this next year \nwith it in the rearview mirror and our economy taking off. Then we \nwould show the world we have actually dealt with these issues, and \npeople in our own country would have the confidence to invest in our \ncountry because they know we in Washington have been responsible in \nthat way.\n  One of the big discussions taking place right now is revenues. I \nthink, at the end of the day, we are going to come to a conclusion very \nsoon that it is probably time for us to go ahead and rescue the 98 \npercent of the country that have been caught up in all this. My sense \nis we are going to have some resolution to that in the very near \nfuture.\n  What I have found--and one of the reasons we don't have a solution--\nis that people on both sides of the aisle\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nare focused on the revenue side, but so far there has been almost no \ndiscussion on the entitlement reform side. Candidly, I think it is \nuncomfortable for many in Congress and even at the White House, \nobviously, to deal with this issue. As a matter of fact, on this issue, \nwhat I would say--and I know there is a difference of opinion--here we \nhave a country that every developed nation knows its greatest threat is \nfiscal solvency. Economists on both sides of the aisle have said the \ngreatest threat to our country is us not dealing with the fiscal \nsolvency and the $16 trillion debt we have, which is growing. Yet, in \nfairness, we have a President who so far has not been willing to lay \nout a plan to deal with this issue. While it pains me to bring this \nup--because I think we as elected officials and the White House should \nsit down and deal with this issue because we know it is the biggest \nissue our Nation faces--it appears to me it is very possible we may \nmove through the end of this year only dealing with rescuing the 98 \npercent of the people who have been caught up in this debate.\n  So there is a moment--I hate to use this word, but there is another \nmoment coming--which probably will force us to deal with another issue \nin other ways; that is, the debt ceiling. While I don't think it is \nmature that we have to have a line in the sand to force us to sit down \nand deal with this issue, it is where we find ourselves in this \nCongress and in dealing with this White House; that is, needing a point \nof leverage to focus these discussions.\n  I hope we will sit down and come up with a $4 trillion, $4.5 trillion \npackage to put this behind us--one that has both revenues and \nentitlement reforms--a solution that again would put this in the \nrearview mirror. But where I see us going is it is possible that by the \ntime year end comes, all we will have done is rescued the 98 percent of \ntaxpayers who have been caught in this and then moving to the debt \nceiling as the next line in the sand that will be a forcing moment to \ncause us to deal with this issue. I think that is where we are headed \nunless something happens. I hope something big happens that I can \nsupport.\n\n  I will tell my colleagues this: I have been through this process. We \nall have. The 112th Congress knows more about this fiscal issue than \nany Congress in the history of man. We have been through two dry runs. \nWe know what the cost of each change is. We know how much it saves \nCongress and saves our country if we deal with these issues. One thing \nI wish to say is I cannot support another process that leads us to \nanother fiscal cliff.\n  Again, I hope the President and Speaker Boehner will come up with a \nsolution that puts this behind us. We all know what we need to do. What \nwe have lacked around here is the political courage to sit down--both \nsides of the aisle have issues; I understand that, but we have lacked \nthe political courage to sit down and deal with this issue. It appears \nto me, again, that where we may be headed is toward the end of this \nmonth rescuing the 98 percent, putting that issue over to the side, and \nthen using the debt ceiling or the CR as that forcing moment to cause \nus to finally come to terms with this fiscal issue.\n  I regret we are in a place in our country where we have to have these \nforcing moments, but that is where I believe we are headed. I can say \nto everybody in here, what I cannot abide by, one Senator--since we \nknow what all the solutions are, we know the changes that need to be \nmade, we can sit down and go through columns on either side, including \nrevenues and changes, to get us in a place where we need to be, but we \nhaven't done it, and I am afraid we are heading to a place where we are \ngoing to have to have another forcing moment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          VAWA Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in communities across our country, millions \nof Americans, unfortunately, find themselves placed in danger by the \nvery people who are supposed to love, care, and protect them. Domestic \nviolence brings hopelessness, depression, and fear into the lives of \nthose who fall victim to it.\n  I rise this evening on behalf of our victims--they are our neighbors, \nfamily members, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers--as well as those \npeople who are so careful in their desire to serve those who are \nsubjected to domestic violence, to say that now--now--is the time for \nus to send to the President for his signature a bipartisan, commonsense \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization bill. We got caught in a lot \nof partisan bickering, and we failed to do that earlier this year. I \nwould like to rectify that course.\n  Each year more than 2 million women in the United States fall victim \nto domestic violence. In Kansas, my home State, an estimated 1 in 10 \nadult women is domestically abused each year. Studies have shown that \nmore than 3 million children witness domestic violence every year.\n  All of these victims depend upon services and care provided by VAWA \ngrants and funding recipients who benefit from those grants. On a \nsingle day last year shelters and organizations in Kansas that are \nfunded in part by this legislation served more than 1,000 victims, and \nsimilar organizations around the country serve more than 67,000 victims \neach day.\n  A few weeks back I visited one such organization, Kansas SAFEHOME. It \nis a tremendous organization that serves the greater Kansas City area. \nI have always believed we change the world one person at a time. What I \nsaw in my visit to SAFEHOME was exactly that: making the difference in \na person's life each and every day, one person at a time.\n  SAFEHOME provides more than a shelter for those needing a place to \nlive to escape from abuse. They provide advocacy and counseling, an in-\nhouse attorney, and assistance in finding a job. The agency also \nprovides education in the community to prevent abuse and further abuse. \nWe often think it does not exist, and yet this organization is making \nclear that the prevalence of domestic violence is known and combated.\n  Each year SAFEHOME helps thousands of women and children reestablish \ntheir lives without violence. The employees and volunteers there are \nmaking that difference that is so important in the lives of so many.\n  After my visit to SAFEHOME, a Kansan posted a question on my Facebook \nwall. Mr. Bachman asked if I came away from my SAFEHOME visit with \n``any honest sense of how current political game playing [in \nWashington] and proposed legislation compromises not only the work \n[SAFEHOME] does, but also aggravates the conditions that breed and \nsustain violence and hostility against women.'' The question was do we \nknow what our failures in Washington, DC, actually cause in the lives \nof folks across my State and around the country.\n  The point this constituent makes is right on. Despite the important \nand honorable work these organizations are performing, they are faced \nwith uncertainty regarding the level of funding and the support they \nwill receive. We have gambled with the well-being of countless victims \nof domestic violence, and we have left these organizations in limbo and \nunable to provide the maximum amount of care possible.\n  None of us here--Republicans or Democrats--can in good conscience let \nthis continue. The election is over, the results are in, and I am \nhoping the days of extreme partisanship that plagued the 112th Congress \nare now behind us. We must begin to unite as a Congress, and history is \nclear proof that we can unite over the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 and its two \nreauthorizations--one in 2000 and one in 2005--has been the result of \nand demonstrates that we can have successful bipartisan, bicameral \nefforts. In order for us to move forward on combating domestic violence \nand caring for its\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\nvictims, we must set aside the divisive rhetoric that surrounded this \ndebate. Of course, both sides--all of us--want to end discrimination \nand agree that shelters and similar grant recipients should provide \nservices to everybody who needs them.\n  For anyone to suggest otherwise is not only disingenuous, but, more \nimportantly, it is a waste of time. The millions of victims who depend \non the services funded by VAWA deserve better from us; the American \npeople we are here to serve deserve better from their representatives.\n  It is past time for the House and Senate and for the Democrats and \nRepublicans to come together and approach this reauthorization as a \nreauthorization. It is not a major piece of legislation to overhaul the \nlaw as it exists but to reauthorize the programs that are currently in \nexistence. We need to do so with a sense of urgency, of dedication to \nthe cause, and a willingness to compromise.\n  If we do this, I am confident we can sort out the differences with \nrespect to this bill and get it signed during this lameduck period. I \nstand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \non both sides of this building to accomplish exactly that. The American \npeople, the victims of domestic violence, and the shelters and support \norganizations that care for those victims of violence deserve that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McCallister, the highly respected chief \nexecutive officer of Humana, will retire from that position at the end \nof this month. He has served as Humana's CEO for the past 12 years.\n  Mike has spent his entire career with Humana, Kentucky's largest \npublicly traded company. After receiving his bachelor's degree from \nLouisiana Tech University in 1974, he went to work at Humana as a \nfinance specialist. He has steadily risen up the ranks ever since. In \n2000, he was named president and CEO of the Louisville-based company.\n  Humana employs more than 11,000 in Kentucky; thousands of those jobs \nhave been created under Mike's tenure. Mike led the company in \ninnovations such as going all digital to eliminate the use of paper for \ntransactions in 2001, well ahead of the rest of the industry; and in \ncreating consumer-driven products that allowed customers to make more \nof their own decisions about their health care plans. Under Mike's \nleadership, in 2004 it was ranked by Business Week magazine as one of \nthe top-performing companies in the United States.\n  Mike has also been very active in civic and philanthropic endeavors, \nto the benefit of Kentucky and Louisville, the city we both call home. \nHe headed the most successful communitywide fund drive in the history \nof the Louisville Metro United Way, raising $30 million in 2006. He was \nthe communitywide chair of the Greater Louisville Fund for the Arts in \n2003. He has also served on the board of the Committee Encouraging \nCorporate Philanthropy. He is the current chairman of the Workplace \nWellness Alliance.\n  Mike's generous spirit of service has also influenced his company as \na whole. Under his leadership, the Humana Foundation has donated more \nthan $50 million to education, health, and arts initiatives in Kentucky \nand across America.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in extending congratulations and \nbest wishes to Mike as well as his family: he and his wife Charlene \nhave a daughter Megan, and a son Ryan. I am sure they are very proud of \nhim and look forward to seeing more of him. It is my understanding that \nMike has promised he will not golf more than twice a week. Also, Mike \nwill not step away from Humana entirely: He will retain a position as \nits nonexecutive chairman.\n  Mr. Michael B. McCallister has set a remarkable example of dedication \nand service to the people of Kentucky. I wish him every success in his \nnext endeavors in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7742-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 84TH BIRTHDAY OF HIS MAJESTY KING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President. I appreciate this opportunity to pay \ntribute today to a wonderful staff member who is a true example of a \ndedicated public servant. Pat recently retired after 27 years of \nwonderful service to my office and the people of Utah.\n  Pat was the public face and voice of my office. She managed the front \noffice and phones with kindness as she greeted literally thousands of \npeople each year. No matter the issue or the anger, Pat would answer \neach constituent with grace and compassion.\n  She loved people, and it showed in her every day interactions. She \nalways made the time to listen to visitors to our office, and she truly \ncared about the problems they were facing. She became the first-line \nadvocate for many, many Utahns who were having problems with the \nFederal Government, and she would make sure that their calls were \nreturned and their issues addressed.\n  At times the front desk phones would get extremely busy and many of \nthe calls were from angry constituents. Yet you could always find Pat \nwith a smile on her face and a calm demeanor. She was a strong advocate \nfor the policies and issues I was fighting for on behalf of Utah in our \nNation's Capital and always conveyed this in a down-to earth manner. No \nmatter the disagreement, most callers left a conversation with Pat \nfeeling better about why they called.\n  Pat made friends with everyone and was well known throughout the \nFederal Building. Many employees from various agencies would look out \nfor Pat and always inquired about her well-being. She had the building \nmanagement staff and security guards on speed dial and was always able \nto get the needs of the office addressed in a timely, efficient manner.\n  Pat's talents were in evident display at the office, but perhaps her \ngreat achievements came as a loving mother and grandmother. She dearly \nloves her family and expresses it often. Her pride and care for her \nchildren and grandchildren is evident and central to her\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nlife. I want to commend her children, and most especially Deanna, who \nare lovingly caring for their mother now in her time of need.\n  Pat has a strong belief in our Heavenly Father and his son our Savior \nJesus Christ. She has made her testimony in the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-day Saints an important component of her life and has spent \ncountless hours serving others in various capacities.\n  Mr. President. I am truly grateful for the tremendous service Pat \nGodfrey rendered to me, to our community, and to the thousands of \nconstituents whose lives she touched with her kindness and compassion. \nI want to wish Pat the very best in retirement and know that she will \nmake many more wonderful memories in the loving strength of her family. \nMay our Heavenly Father bless Pat for the person she is and the service \nshe has rendered to so many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7743-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL RAY RIUTTA\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \nAlaskan for his extraordinary 34 years of service to the United States \nCoast Guard and our Nation as well as 10 years of leadership within the \nAlaska seafood industry where he had a tremendous positive impact for \nour fishermen.\n  Ray Riutta has held the position of executive director of the Alaska \nSeafood Marketing Institute, ASMI, since August 2002. Since then, he \nhas guided the organization through pivotal changes, including the \nimplementation of the sustainability platform to showcase Alaska's \ncommitment to responsibly managed fisheries. ASMI has worked diligently \nto increase the economic value of Alaska seafood resources through a \ncollaborative partnership with the seafood industry. Since Mr. Riutta's \narrival in 2002, the value of Alaska seafood exports increased nearly \n23 percent from $1.78 billion to $2.2 billion in 2011.\n  Prior to joining ASMI, Mr. Riutta served in the United States Coast \nGuard for 34 years, retiring at the rank of vice admiral. During his \ncareer, he served on six ships, commanding four of them with over 12 \nyears of sea service in the Bering Sea, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as \nwell as the Great Lakes and the Caribbean Sea. For 3 years he was \nassigned to the U.S. Embassy in London. While assigned to Coast Guard \nHeadquarters in Washington, DC, Mr. Riutta was deputy chief of the \nOffice of Law Enforcement and Defense Operations and later chief of \noperations.\n  During his tenure as district commander for Alaska, Mr. Riutta served \nas a member of the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. He \nworked closely with the Pacific Region Coast Guards, China, Japan, \nKorea, Canada and Russia, while in command of all U.S. Coast Guard \nforces in the Pacific, a post he held on September 11, 2001. Mr. Riutta \nis originally from Astoria, OR, where many members of his family were \ninvolved in the fishing industry. Prior to entering the service, he \nworked part time commercial fishing on the Columbia River.\n  Mr. Riutta is a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and a \n1990 graduate of the National War College. He is married to Barbara \nStarr Kramer of Chester Springs, PA. They have two sons, Ian and Aaron.\n  On behalf of the State of Alaska, I ask my distinguished colleagues \nto join me in recognizing Vice Admiral Riutta's exceptional career. We \nowe him a debt of gratitude for his commitment to the Coast Guard, our \nNation and Alaska's seafood industry. We wish him well in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7743-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARKANSAS FARM FAMILY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nDeSalvo family for earning the distinction of 2012's Arkansas Farm \nFamily of the Year.\n  This honor reflects the dedication of Tony DeSalvo, his son Phillip, \ndaughter-in-law Beth, and grandchildren Benjamin and Isabelle to \nranching and the importance of agriculture as Arkansas's No. 1 \nindustry.\n  As owners of Big D Ranch, the DeSalvos oversee a 350-head commercial \ncow-calf operation. It is one of the largest herd of registered \nUltrablack cattle in the State, and includes a 150-head of registered \nUltrablack cattle 30 to 40 of which are registered bulls. The DeSalvos \nalso grow around 900 acres of wheat and sorghum-sudan silage and \nBermuda hay on the ranch. The DeSalvo family settled near Center Ridge \nin the late 1800s, and the family continues to work on that same land \ntoday. Phillip is passing along his passion for ranching with Benjamin \nand Isabella, and now they are learning the rewards of farm work.\n  The Arkansas Farm Bureau's program honors farm families across the \nState for their outstanding work both on their farms and in their \ncommunities. This recognition is a reflection of the contribution to \nagriculture at the community and State level and its implications for \nimproved farm practices and management. The DeSalvos are well-deserving \nof this honor.\n  I congratulate Tony, Phillip, Beth, Benjamin, and Isabelle on their \noutstanding achievements in ranching and agriculture and ask my fellow \ncolleagues to join me in honoring them for this accomplishment. I wish \nthem continued success in their future endeavors and look forward to \nthe contributions they will continue to offer Arkansas ranching and \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7743-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7743-S7744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOHN GRAY\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life \nof John Gray, a son of the great State of Oregon, and a true pioneering \nspirit whose legacy will live on through his contributions to \ncommunities throughout our State.\n  John Gray, born in the small town of Monroe, OR, to a family of \nmodest means, achieved personal success most can only dream of.\n  It was once written about John Gray that one ``might expect a man \nsuch as Gray, who has made it so big so quickly, to behave like the \ntycoon he is. Instead, he has the manner of a bashful lepidopterist \nmaking his first trip to the big city.''\n  At the time of that profile, Salishan was a new community, Sunriver \nhad yet to open, and Skamania was but a twinkle in John Gray's eye. \nMore than 4 decades later, the man who has forever changed the \nlandscape of Oregon remains humble.\n  John Gray's longstanding commitment to preserving and protecting \nOregon's natural beauty is evident in the communities he's developed, \nsuch as Sunriver, which complement their surroundings with signature \nelegance.\n  That commitment was matched by his passion for strengthening urban \ncommunities. Over the last several years, John Gray gave $2 million to \nHabitat for Humanity in Oregon. His cornerstone contribution of $1 \nmillion to Habitat's ``Block by Block'' initiative laid the foundation \nfor a $10 million land-bank fund, which allowed Habitat to purchase \nlarge groups of home lots on Portland's east side. On these lots, \nHabitat will build entire blocks of new homes for low-income families, \nmost of whom will be first-time homeowners.\n  Mr. Gray's generosity was expansive, extending beyond homeownership \nto a range of efforts to make Portland a better place. Twenty years \nago, he established a fund at Reed College to make sure the school's \nstudents are able to enjoy ``cultural, social, and recreational \nprograms of excellent quality'' outside the classroom. In 2011, he gave \nnearly half a million dollars to a private Portland-area school serving \nstudents from homeless and very low-income families to build a new \nclassroom for its expanding roster of students. That same year, he \npledged $5 million to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & \nScience University to create an endowed professorship and to fund \nresearch and clinical care.\n  Mr. Gray's professional and civic accomplishments are widely known. \nAs a developer, he created several of Oregon's signature communities. \nAs a businessman, he led Omark Industries and was a director of \nTektronix, Precision Castparts and First Interstate Bank.

Mr. President, a piece of jewelry can tell a story, \ntrigger a memory, or commemorate a special occasion. The beauty and \ncharm captured in a ring or a necklace can precisely convey a meaning \nwithout words. For birthdays, engagements, celebrations, and sometimes \n``just because,'' a piece of jewelry is a popular and personal gift. \nToday I wish to recognize a jewelry store whose emphasis on detail, \ncreativity, and quality sets it apart.\n  A downtown staple for nearly two decades, Folia Jewelry in Portland, \nME, specializes in custom-made pieces of jewelry fashioned from \nprecious metals and gemstones. The owner and creative mind behind these \nbeautiful pieces of wearable art is Edith Armstrong. Edith studied \njewelry making and metalsmithing at the Rhode Island School of Design \nand brings more than 25 years of expertise to the custom jewelry \nmarket. It is her passion and imagination that first brought Folia to \nPortland. Her work is now known throughout the area and even the world \nfor its excellence and originality.\n  The custom design and quality of Edith and the other designers at \nFolia is exquisite. Folia showcases the talents of several of Maine's \ngifted and experienced artisans. The designers at Folia individually \nsit down with each customer interested in specially crafted pieces to \ndiscuss, sketch, and render models to exact specifications prior to \nwork on the actual piece. This detail-oriented process yields pieces \nwhich are unique, beautiful, and personal. The philosophy of Folia is \nall in the personalization. If you do not see exactly what you're \nlooking for in the many display cases, Edith and her team of artists \nwill happily work with you to give form to your vision. Through their \ndedication to their craft and attention to detail, the designers at \nFolia have garnered a reputation as one of the best jewelry stores in \nMaine, and it is easy to see why.\n  Along with custom jewelry making, Folia also offers a wide array of \nprefabricated designs for customers to choose from, all made from the \nhighest quality stones and metals. These designs are ready-made but \neach has that artistic flare so characteristic of Folia's custom \ncreations. The intricacy with which each piece is fashioned is truly \noutstanding. Their expert craftsmen also specialize in restoration and \nrepair of older jewelry.\n  In a world increasingly concerned with on-demand and instant \ngratification, it is comforting to know that there are delightful shops \nlike Folia, run by designers who care more about their final product \nand intimate relationships with customers than the bottom line. I \nproudly offer my congratulations to Folia on their success and wish \nEdith and everyone at Folia all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7744-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. AKAKA, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \n     amendments:\n       S. 2024.

Res. 613\n\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated Hizballah as \n     a foreign terrorist organization since October 1997;\n       Whereas the United States Government designated Hizballah a \n     specially designated terrorist organization in January 1995 \n     and a ``Specially Designated Global Terrorist'' pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13224 (66 Fed. Reg. 49079) in October 2001;\n       Whereas Hizballah was established in 1982 through the \n     direct sponsorship and support of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and continues to \n     receive training, weapons, and explosives, as well as \n     political, diplomatic, monetary, and organizational aid, from \n     Iran;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in multiple acts of \n     terrorism over the past 30 years, including the bombings in \n     Lebanon in 1983 of the United States Embassy, the United \n     States Marine barracks, and the French Army barracks, the \n     airline hijackings and the kidnapping of European, American, \n     and other Western hostages in the 1980s and 1990s, and \n     support of the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia that \n     killed 19 Americans in 1996;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     issued by the Department of State, ``Since at least 2004, \n     Hizballah has provided training to select Iraqi Shia \n     militants, including on the construction and use of \n     improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that can penetrate \n     heavily-armored vehicles.'';\n       Whereas, in 2007, a senior Hizballah operative, Ali Mussa \n     Daqduq, was captured in Iraq with detailed documents that \n     discussed tactics to attack Iraqi and coalition forces, and \n     has been directly implicated in a terrorist attack that \n     resulted in the murder of 5 members of the United States \n     Armed Forces;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in the terrorist \n     attacks in Buenos Aires, Argentina on the Israeli Embassy in \n     1992 and the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in 1994;\n       Whereas Hizballah has been implicated in acts of terrorism \n     and extrajudicial violence in Lebanon, including the \n     assassination of political opponents;\n       Whereas, in June 2011, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, an \n     international tribunal for the prosecution of those \n     responsible for the February 14, 2005, assassination of \n     former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, issued arrest \n     warrants against 4 senior Hizballah members, including its \n     top military commander, Mustafa Badr al-Din, identified as \n     the primary suspect in the assassination;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 Country Reports on Terrorism \n     issued by the Department of State, Hizballah is ``the likely \n     perpetrator'' of 2 bomb attacks that wounded United Nations \n     Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeepers in Lebanon \n     during 2011;\n       Whereas, according to the October 18, 2012, report of the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations to the United Nations \n     Security Council on the implementation of Security Council \n     Resolution 1559 (2004) (in this preamble referred to as the \n     ``October 18 Report''), ``The maintenance by Hizbullah of \n     sizeable sophisticated military capabilities outside the \n     control of the Government of Lebanon. . .creates an \n     atmosphere of intimidation in the country[,]. . .puts Lebanon \n     in violation of its obligations under Resolution 1559 \n     (2004)[,] and constitutes a threat to regional peace and \n     stability.'';\n       Whereas John Brennan, Assistant to the President for \n     Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, stated on October 26, \n     2012, that Hizballah's ``social and political activities must \n     not obscure [its] true nature or prevent us from seeing it \n     for what it is--an international terrorist organization \n     actively supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps - Quds Force'';\n       Whereas David Cohen, Under Secretary of the Treasury for \n     Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stated on August 10, \n     2012, ``Before al Qaeda's attack on the U.S. on September 11, \n     2001, Hizballah was responsible for killing more Americans in \n     terrorist attacks than any other terrorist group.'';\n       Whereas, according to a September 13, 2012, Department of \n     the Treasury press release, ``The last year has witnessed \n     Hizballah's most aggressive terrorist plotting outside the \n     Middle East since the 1990s.'';\n       Whereas, since 2011, Hizballah has been implicated in \n     thwarted terrorist plots in Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Thailand, and \n     elsewhere;\n       Whereas, on July 18, 2012, a suicide bomber attacked a bus \n     in Burgas, Bulgaria, murdering 5 Israeli tourists and the \n     Bulgarian bus driver in a terrorist attack that, according to \n     Mr. Brennan, ``bore the hallmarks of a Hizballah attack'';\n       Whereas Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \n     stated of the Burgas terrorist attack, ``We have \n     unquestionable, fully substantiated evidence that this was \n     done by Hizballah backed by Iran.'';\n       Whereas Bulgaria is a member of the European Union and a \n     member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas, according to the October 18 Report, ``There have \n     been credible reports suggesting involvement by Hizbullah and \n     other Lebanese political forces in support of the parties in \n     the conflict in Syria.. . . Such militant activities by \n     Hizbullah in Syria contradict and undermine the \n     disassociation policy of the Government of Lebanon, of which \n     Hizbullah is a coalition member.'';\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan stated, ``We have \n     seen Hizballah training militants in Yemen and Syria, where \n     it continues to provide material support to the regime of \n     Bashar al Assad, in part to preserve its weapon supply \n     lines.'';\n       Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the Department of the Treasury \n     designated Hizballah pursuant to Executive Order 13582 (76 \n     Fed Reg. 52209), which targets those responsible for human \n     rights abuses in Syria, for providing support to the \n     Government of Syria;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of the Treasury, since \n     early 2011, Hizballah ``has provided training, advice and \n     extensive logistical support to the Government of Syria's \n     increasingly ruthless effort to fight against the \n     opposition'' and has ``directly trained Syrian government \n     personnel inside Syria and has facilitated the training of \n     Syrian forces by Iran's terrorism arm, the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps - Qods Force'';\n       Whereas, on September 13, 2012, the Department of the \n     Treasury designated the Secretary-General of Hizballah, Hasan \n     Nasrallah, for overseeing ``Hizballah's efforts to help the \n     Syrian regime's violent crackdown on the Syrian civilian \n     population'';\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan stated, ``Even in \n     Europe, many countries. . .have not yet designated Hizballah \n     as a terrorist organization. Nor has the European Union. Let \n     me be clear: failure to designate Hizballah as a terrorist \n     organization makes it harder to defend our countries and \n     protect our citizens. As a result, for example, countries \n     that have arrested Hizballah suspects for plotting in Europe \n     have been unable to prosecute them on terrorism charges.''; \n     and\n       Whereas, on October 26, 2012, Mr. Brennan called on the \n     European Union to designate Hizballah as a terrorist \n     organization, saying, ``European nations are our most \n     sophisticated and important counterterrorism partners, and \n     together we must make it clear that we will not tolerate \n     Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the governments of Europe and the European Union \n     to designate Hizballah as a terrorist organization so that \n     Hizballah cannot use the territories of the European Union \n     for fundraising, recruitment, financing, logistical support, \n     training, and propaganda;\n       (2) urges the governments of Europe and the European Union \n     to impose sanctions on Hizballah for providing material \n     support to Bashar al Assad's ongoing campaign of violent \n     repression against the people of Syria;\n       (3) expresses support for the Government of Bulgaria as it \n     conducts an investigation into the July 18, 2012, terrorist \n     attack in Burgas, and expresses hope that the investigation \n     can be successfully concluded and that the perpetrators can \n     be identified as quickly as possible;\n       (4) urges the President to provide all necessary \n     diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement support to the \n     Government of Bulgaria to investigate the July 18, 2012, \n     terrorist attack in Burgas;\n       (5) reaffirms support for the Government of Bulgaria by the \n     United States as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO), and urges the United States, NATO, and \n     the European Union to work with the Government of Bulgaria to \n     safeguard its territory and citizens from the threat of \n     terrorism; and\n       (6) urges the President to make available to European \n     allies and the European public information about Hizballah's \n     terrorist activities and material support to Bashar al \n     Assad's campaign of violence in Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/11/senate-section/article/S7745-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7745-S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3312.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the following bills en bloc: Calendar \nNo. 344, H.R. 4014; and H.R. 4367, which was received from the House \nand is at the desk.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills \nen bloc.\n\n\n                           ATM Fee Disclosure\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the last few years, a number of \ncolleagues and I have grown increasingly worried about the fees that \nconsumers face when using an automated teller machine, ATM. According \nto Bankrate.com 2010 Checking Survey, the average surcharge a consumer \npays to use an ATM has increased to $2.33. Over 99 percent of ATM \noperators charge this fee. Some ATM operators also charge balance \ninquiry fees.\n  In addition, consumers are also increasingly likely to face a fee \nfrom their own financial institution for using an ATM not owned by \ntheir institution. According to the same Bankrate study, 75 percent of \nchecking accounts charge this fee, which is now up to $1.41 on average. \nTherefore, frequently, consumers may face fees of almost $4.00 for \naccessing their own cash.\n  Consumers who use prepaid cards are especially likely to pay a \nvariety of fees for using an ATM. They can face ATM withdrawal fees, \nbalance inquiry fees, and denied transaction fees. They may get no \nnotice at the ATM of fees charged by the prepaid card.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator.\n  I too am concerned by the rising consumer ATM costs. As you know, the \nSenate recently passed legislation that does away with the requirement \nthat ATMs post a physical sign notifying consumers that they may be \ncharged multiple fees for a transaction. In many ways this requirement \nwas outdated and it put our local institutions at risk for frivolous \nlawsuits. While I supported the bill we passed, I believe we must \nproceed with caution.\n  All of my friends speaking on this issue today, myself included, \nbelieve that this legislation was only intended to remove duplicative \ndisclosures and not to lessen the important information consumers rely \non when making an ATM transactions. We are concerned that one of the \nunintended consequences of this legislation is that consumers will lose \naccess to information about the fees that they might face at an ATM, \nincluding, for example, fees for simple transactions like a balance \ninquiry and additional fees imposed by their own institution.\n  I would like to ask Senator Johnson, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, for his input on this point as well.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I thank Senators Udall and Harkin.\n  The Senator has raised an important point about this legislation. The \nintent of this legislation is not to lessen the amount of information \nthat a consumer receives prior to conducting a transaction at an ATM. \nAs the Senator has laid out, it is important that consumers be fully \ninformed of the types of fees that they may face at the time of the \ntransaction. The point was to modernize the information that consumers \nget, taking into account technological changes. But this bill is only \none step toward modernization. The CFPB may wish to look at other steps \nto ensure that consumers are fully informed about the fees they may \nincur, whether that be through improved onscreen ATM disclosures, \nbetter disclosures at point of sale, or other methods.\n  I understand that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is already \ntaking a look at this issue as part of an existing rulemaking to \nstreamline inherited regulations, and I agree that it is important for \nthem to keep this fact in mind as they move forward on this rulemaking.\n  Mr. MERKLEY: I thank Chairman Johnson.\n  Yes, I would like to reiterate that the intent of this bill is to \nstreamline duplicative disclosures and not make consumers less aware of \npotential fees that they face. Like you, I encourage the Bureau to use \ntheir upcoming rulemaking to ensure that this is not the case. I now \nturn to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank Senator Merkley.\n  I would like to echo the concerns of my friends and colleagues, \nSenators Harkin, Udall, Merkley, and Chairman Johnson. This legislation \nis intended to provide relief from a physical signage requirement that \nis subject to abuse, not reduce the disclosure available to consumers \nusing ATM machines. I encourage the CFPB to issue regulations that \nclarify that consumers should have, at a minimum, the same access to \ntimely information as they had prior to the passage of this \nlegislation. Consumers are in the best position to make the financial \ndecisions that are best for them, but to do so, they must have the \nrelevant information at the appropriate time. I am pleased that so many \nof my colleagues have come together to support this legislative \neffort--one that remedies a problem affecting so many of our community \nbanks and credit unions, but that retains protections for American \nconsumers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bills be \nread three times and passed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nrelated statements to these matters be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
