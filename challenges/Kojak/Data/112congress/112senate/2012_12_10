Mr. President, first of all, it is very unusual to have one \nof the most senior Members of the Senate presiding and especially at \nthis time of the day. I would say to my friend, this is how the Senator \nhas conducted himself all the time he has been in the Senate. We had a \nlittle emergency here today. The Senator who was expected to be here \nwas unable to make it due to the fog we have around the eastern part of \nthe United States, and so the Senator from Vermont agreed to preside.\n  I say to everyone, the people of Vermont are so fortunate to have the \nlongest serving Senator from Vermont, a man of such quality. Those of \nus who work with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy \nof Vermont, consider it an honor to be able to talk to him--speaking \nfor myself, but I am sure we all feel this way--and to learn from him. \nI am the majority leader in the Senate, but I talk to my friend from \nVermont often to get ideas as to how we handle the difficult issues of \nthe day.\n  For me, as a person, I will always remember, as long as I am on this \nEarth, the kindness Senator Leahy and his lovely wife Marcelle extended \nto my wife. As most of my colleagues know, she was in a violent car \naccident. Her neck was broken in a couple places and her back was \nbroken and so she had a lot of surgery. When that was over, she learned \nshe had breast cancer, and so she has been fighting that. Marcelle, who \nis a nurse, has been so thoughtful and kind to my wife, calling her \noften to help her work through the sickness that comes with breast \ncancer. So this is an opportunity for me to say something about my \nfriend from Vermont.\n  I can still remember the first day we met, the first night we met in \nFlorida. He was running for reelection and I was running for the \nSenate. I want the Record spread with the fact that I have so much \nconfidence and appreciation for this good man who, on a minute's \nnotice, came over to make the Senate work again. I thank our Acting \nPresident pro tempore very much.\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7692-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last week the country received more good \neconomic news. The private sector created 150,000 jobs--these are new \njobs--and once again the unemployment rate fell. Unemployment is now at \nits lowest rate since December 2008. While too many families across the \nNation are still struggling, especially in Nevada, there is no doubt \nour economy is headed in the right direction.\n  America is poised for a rebound this year if a few good things \nhappen. The last thing we can afford is yet another crisis manufactured \nby Republicans in Congress just as the economy finally gains some \nmomentum. If Republicans force a $2,200 tax increase on 98 percent of \nAmerican families and 97 percent of small businesses to protect the \nrichest of the rich, the economy will suffer greatly.\n  If Republicans again threaten default on the full faith and credit of \nthe United States, the economy will suffer. We have seen the terrible \nimpact of these contrived emergencies before. When Republicans \nthreatened to shut down the government and force a default on the \nNation's debt, the economy stumbled and middle-class families were in a \nstate of peril. Who paid the price? Middle-class families.\n  Republicans face a real difficult choice in Congress. Will they \ncooperate with Democrats and put the country on a path to provide \ncertainty for families and investors? As my friend the senior Senator \nfrom Missouri said, the Speaker has a chance to do some good things, \nbut he also has a problem because he has to decide whether he is going \nto work to save his speakership or the country.\n  Will they cooperate with Democrats or will they force us to lurch \nfrom one crisis to the next in 2013 as they did in 2011 and 2012? We \nneed long-term solutions, not temporary fixes to problems that dragged \ndown the economic recovery over the past 2 years.\n  The House should take up the Senate-passed middle-class tax cut which \nprovides lasting security for families and businesses making less than \n$250,000 a year. The number of Republicans calling on the Speaker to \nallow a vote to give middle-class families confidence their taxes will \nnot go up has grown. Speaker Boehner could end this suspense with just \none vote.\n  Over the weekend, the junior Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, \njoined a number of Senate Republicans and more than one dozen House \nRepublicans in calling for that vote. Senator Corker, admitting \nRepublicans have little leverage in this faceoff, said: ``I actually am \nbeginning to believe that is the best route for us to take.''\n  Democrats agree sending the Senate-passed tax cut to President \nObama's desk is the quickest and most sensible way out of this crisis. \nBut avoiding the fiscal cliff is no excuse for Republicans to replace \nthis artificial crisis with another one.\n  Congress should also pass Senator McConnell's proposal to end \nperiodic standoffs over the debt ceiling. His plan would give President \nObama the authority to avoid default on the Nation's bills without a \nprotracted fight. Senate Democrats are ready to vote on the minority \nleader's sensible suggestion at any time, but first Senator McConnell \nneeds to stop filibustering his own legislation.\n  Right now, Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader McConnell are the only \nones standing between Congress and compromise. It is time for them to \nprove to American families they are more interested in protecting the \nmiddle class than pleasing the tea party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7692-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7692-S7693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor our colleague the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, Ben Nelson, upon his retirement from the Senate. \nThis will become effective after the first of the year.\n  For 12 years, Ben has been a valued member of the Democratic caucus \nand an exemplary Senator for Nebraska and the country. But his life in \npublic service dates back to his youth. He spent his college days \nserving his Nebraska community in another way--as a lay minister. But \neventually he chose law over ministry and went to law school. He \nattended law school at the University of Nebraska, where he got his \nbachelor's and master's degrees.\n  He spent many years practicing insurance law. He served as director \nof the Nebraska Department of Insurance and as president of the Central \nNational Insurance Group. Then, in 1990, he was elected Governor of \nNebraska. Four years later, he was reelected--with almost 75 percent of \nthe vote--to become the first Nebraska Governor in 20 years to win a \nsecond term. So it was not a surprise when he ran for the Senate in \n2000. He won, even though President Bush took Nebraska handily.\n  It is easy to see Ben Nelson truly possesses the same independent \nspirit as his Nebraska constituents. He served his constituents with \ndistinction in the Senate and, of course, when he was Governor and as \ninsurance commissioner. He has always provided a strong voice for \nfiscal responsibility, and he has been terrific for the State's energy \nindustry, agricultural sector, and even tourism.\n  Similar to many of his Nebraska constituents, Ben is an avid hunter, \nfisher, and outdoorsman.\n  As a sidelight, one of the things we learn as kids--and as we get \nolder it is something we must adhere to--is that one should not be \nenvious. Envy isn't something that is very becoming of human beings, \nespecially in an adult. But I think if the truth were known, many \nSenators would be very envious, as I am--and I would even think the \nActing President pro tempore would be--about that hair of Ben Nelson's. \nI mean that is a mop of real hair.\n  It is often people call his office and they believe he has a toupee, \nbut it is his hair. He will pull it for you anytime just to show you it \nis real. I mean he has hair like a 15-year-old. So I have to \nacknowledge I am a little envious of his hair, and I think, if the \ntruth were known, maybe others are as well.\n  My wife has said on many occasions--and she tells me this all the \ntime--how handsome Pat Leahy is and she is so glad he doesn't do a \ncomb-over.\n  Anyway, Ben Nelson is an avid hunter, fisher, and outdoorsman. He has \nbagged pheasants and turkey, and one time, to the consternation of all \nof us, he decided he was going to take Senator Schumer from New York \nhunting for pheasants. He did that. Everybody survived it alive, and \nBen Nelson still boasts about that; that he was able to bring Schumer \nback all in one piece. More important, the people who went\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nhunting with them all came back in one piece. The story goes that \nSenator Schumer even shot a bird or two.\n  A lot of us have some trouble accepting that, but that is what Ben \nsays and I will take him at his word. He has bagged all kinds of game \nbirds--dove, quail, pheasants, turkey--but he has also had the \nopportunity to hunt all over the world and has bagged some of the most \nexotic game that is possible for a hunter to hunt. He is the epitome of \na sportsman.\n  Ben isn't just a great hunter, though. He is also an accomplished \npractical joker and a wonderful singer. That may surprise some people. \nIn our caucus, I proved to everyone that he could sing, and sing quite \nwell. He recorded a few years ago a song called ``Western Town'' to \nraise money for visually impaired children. He was one of a dozen \nNebraskan celebrities to record songs for this charity. I obtained a \ncopy of this and played it at a Democratic caucus a few years ago. It \nwas a hit. He was singing--it is his voice--and it was very good. Here \nis how it goes:\n\n       I'm from a western town in Nebraska. Don't know why I left \n     so long ago. All I know is this western town in Nebraska \n     lives in my heart and in my soul.\n\n  He did a great job of that song, as he has done everything since I \nhave known him.\n  I am sure Ben is looking forward to going home to the western town--\nOmaha--where he lives with his wife Diane. She is wonderful. She was a \ngreat first lady and a wonderful Senator's spouse. I like her for lots \nof reasons, the smile she has, but also she makes some of the best \nchocolate chip cookies I have ever eaten. They have four children and \nfive grandchildren. As he departs for Omaha, he will be sorely missed \nhere in the Senate.\n  He has always been a loyal and dedicated member of this caucus, even \nwhen he was showing loyalty by questioning the wisdom of the party \nsometimes. He is arguably the most conservative member of the caucus. \nAnd while there are a few things Ben and I disagree on, we agree on \nmost everything. Through the last 12 years he has been a valued member \nof the team. He has made many of our accomplishments possible through \nhis dedication to country first and State second. That is how it should \nbe.\n  Edwin Chapin, a North American preacher and poet, said:\n\n       No more duty can be urged upon those who are entering the \n     great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best \n     convictions.\n\n  Ben Nelson lives by his convictions, even though it may put him at \nodds with his party or his constituents. His highest duty is to country \nand his conscience.\n  We had a retirement party a week ago tomorrow, and when it was over, \nI grabbed Ben and we embraced. I care a great deal about him. He has \nmade some extremely difficult votes, but he did it because it was the \nright thing to do. His duty is to country and his conscience, and I \nrepeat, I have such high respect for Ben Nelson. I will miss him. I \nhave enjoyed working with him.\n  I congratulate Ben Nelson on his career in public service, including \nhis service in the Senate, and wish him the very best in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7693-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I begin today, I know there are \nmillions of people around the world and in this country who are \nmourning the loss of a singer by the name of Jenni Rivera, who was a \nhuge star, particularly in Latin America but also in the United States. \nShe died yesterday evening in a plane crash in northern Mexico.\n  Jenni was a real American success story. She was born in California \nto immigrants from Mexico. She started working at her father's small \nrecord label in Long Beach, CA, and she recorded from there. She made a \nnumber of top hits that made all the charts around the world. She was \nrecently in Florida to receive a Billboard Music Award and performed at \nthe Billboard Music Awards. We saw that on TV. My mom was a huge fan of \nhers--and also kind of the equivalent of ``The Voice'' in Mexico on the \nTelemundo network. She passed away last night.\n  Her calling card was she was a singer in a genre of music that is \nlargely dominated by males. Yet she brought a powerful voice to that \ngenre where she sang frankly about her struggles to give her children a \nbetter life in this country. Her death at a young age is a real \ntragedy. I know there are millions of people across the country and \naround the world mourning her loss today. She is survived by her five \nchildren and two grandchildren.\n  Our prayers go out for her that God may grant her family the peace to \ndeal with this difficult circumstance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7693-5", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7693-S7695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come here on December 10, Human Rights \nDay. I want to briefly discuss human rights because, I would just say, \nwhile we have made great advances around the world in the cause of \nhuman rights, there are still a lot of roads to travel. Today is a good \nopportunity to take note of some of the struggles and challenges around \nthe world with regard to human rights.\n  The first issue I want to talk about with regard to human rights is \nmodern-day slavery. When people think about slavery they think about \nthe historic nature of slavery in this country or around the world. It \nis hard to imagine that today, in the 21st century, that there are \nslaves in the world. It is even harder to believe there are slaves in \nthe United States, but the fact is there are. It has been well \ndocumented that human trafficking around the world numbers in the \nmillions.\n  Of course, sex trafficking is a big part of that, a grotesque part of \nthat, and we are all aware that it is a very serious problem. So too is \nforced labor-type slavery, which we find around the world and even in \nthe United States. In fact, there is no major city in the United States \nthat does not have an element of human trafficking and human slavery \nwithin its confines. I think it is important to understand that exists, \nit is real, and it is happening.\n  To that extent, remember there are things we are trying to do in this \nlegislative body, in the Senate, in Washington, to deal with this \nissue. One of the issues we are going to have a chance to deal with \nsoon, I hope, is reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nwhich was sponsored last year by Senator Brown and Senator Leahy. \nHopefully, we can finish that before the end of this year, but if we \ncannot, I hope early in the next Congress we will address it.\n  As you know, there are also reports that the State Department does \nrank countries around the world on the efforts they are making to deal \nwith human trafficking, and they actually rank them in three tiers, the \nthird being the worst, those nations not doing enough. I hope we look \nat how we reform the process of giving some of these countries waivers. \nThere are countries that are perpetually on the list of the worst \npossible places with regard to government policy toward human \ntrafficking. Yet they are getting waivers from the implications and the \nconsequences of being a tier 3 country. There are countries getting \nthat waiver every single year.\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\n  I hope we will examine the process legislatively, of how we grant \nthose waivers, so we can have more information as to exactly why it is \nour government is granting waivers to other governments and other \nnations that are not making any advances whatsoever on human slavery \nand trafficking.\n  Another aspect we should take some time to look at is some \ntransparency from the business community, particularly large \ninternational companies that do business around the world. We should \nlook for ways to encourage and incentivize companies to report \nvoluntarily on their supply chains to ensure the products we use in the \nUnited States are not the product of human slavery, modern slavery \naround the world. We can do that as well.\n  Obviously, we do not want to put any more onerous costs on our \nbusinesses, and we will be careful how we approach it, but I think it \nis important that we know the products sold in the United States are \nnot directly or indirectly benefiting from slavery around the world. \nThat is something I hope we will remember; that human trafficking and \nhuman slavery is real, it exists all around the world, and exists in \nour own country. I hope we will continue making strides dealing with \nthis issue.\n  One last point on that is a few months ago several of my colleagues \nand I sent a letter to the Village Voice, which is a newspaper in the \nUnited States, which actively--and unfortunately--advertises in its \nback pages, including in a site called backpage.com. It advertises the \nservices of people being held against their will in those \ncircumstances. It is outrageous to believe a major American publication \ncontinues to advertise the services of young girls and young boys, some \nof whom are minors, and is doing so shamelessly. I hope they will heed \nour call to stop that from happening. It is a massive source of revenue \nfor that company. It is outrageous, it is disgusting, it is grotesque, \nand I hope more of our colleagues will join us in writing a new letter \nto them in continuing to call attention to this because it is simply \nunacceptable.\n\n  Secondly, I want to turn to the issue of religious freedom, which is \nanother human rights cause around the world. Sadly there is not enough \nadvancement being made in that regard. We are seeing a step backward \nwith regard to religious liberty and religious freedom around the \nworld.\n  In April of this year the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom released its latest report with some very grim news. I want to \ngo through some of it, but it is important to understand we are not \ntalking about the countries, we are talking about the governments. \nThere are some governments that are aiding and abetting the persecution \nof unprotected religious minorities. I want to highlight some of those \ncountries and governments. The list is long, but these are a few I \nwanted to point to today that are truly unacceptable.\n  Let's start with the People's Republic of China, which is not exactly \na beacon of hope for those who are looking for religious liberty. Of \ncourse we all know the situation in Tibet, which is not just a \nreligious issue, it is a cultural issue. We see the self-immolation of \nfolks who are willing to burn alive because of the effort of that \ngovernment to wipe out their identity. What they are going through is \nintolerable.\n  It goes much deeper than that. Proselytizing Christians and the \northodox, ``nonpatriotic'' Catholic Church, face significant \noppression. The Chinese Government actually authorizes who the \nleadership of the Catholic Church can be. It is truly unique that in \nall the world there is a government that will tell them who their \nbishops are and who will run their church. If they worship outside of \nthat setting, they are persecuted.\n  There are others, of course, such as the Tibetan Buddhists whom I \nmentioned before. Here is a report that talks about that. It is not \njust the religious believers who are facing persecution in China. This \nis from the report:\n\n       The Chinese government also continues to harass, detain, \n     intimidate, disbar, and forcibly disappear attorneys who \n     defend vulnerable religious groups.\n\n  Again, we need to understand that we are not talking about the people \nof China; we are talking about the government of China which is aiding, \nabetting, and allowing this religious persecution to go on. We hope \nwith the change in leadership in China that has taken place there will \nbe a change in attitude.\n  The truth is that China has much to offer the world. We hope for a \npeaceful, prosperous rise for the people of China. We look forward to \nworking together with them to make the world a better place. But China \ncannot assume that role as long as there is no respect for religious \nliberties as far as these practices that are happening in that country \nwith the direction of its government.\n  Of course Egypt has been in the headlines lately. I think it has been \nwell documented that violence particularly against orthodox Christians \nhas been high. This is from the report:\n\n       In 2011, violent sectarian attacks, targeting primarily \n     Coptic Orthodox Christians, have resulted in nearly 100 \n     deaths, surpassing the death toll of the previous 10 years \n     combined.\n\n  I think the Arab spring has a lot of promise, but I think it also \nbrings with it some warning flags. One of those warning flags is the \npersecution of religious minorities in places such as Egypt. So as \nEgypt works its way forward--and we know it has problems it is facing \nin its own society with regard to what kind of government and powers it \nneeds and should have--we should keep an eye on how the new \nconstitution, the new laws, and the new government treat religious \nminorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians who suffered the \ndeath of 100 of their members.\n  Iran does not have a sterling record on human rights. Its treatment \nof religious minorities is particularly egregious. The violations of \nreligious freedoms in Iran include prolonged detention, torture, and \nexecutions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the \naccused. All religious minorities in Iran are at risk, but even the \nrecognized non-Muslim religious minorities that are supposedly \nprotected under their so-called Constitution, including Jews, Armenian, \nand Assyrian Christians, face increasing discrimination, arrests, and \nimprisonment, according to the report. So too are dissenting Muslims. \nThey are basically Muslims who are not following the Shia line. They \nare being intimidated, harassed, and detained. That is the record of \nIran, which has a terrible human rights record, but in particular with \nthe issues of religious liberty.\n  Saudi Arabia bans any non-Muslim worship. Even private religious \nactivities are suppressed if they are discovered. I think it is \nimportant to point that out as well.\n  Closer to home is the island of Cuba, which is a place, of course, \nbecause of my heritage which is close and near to our heart so we keep \na close eye on what is happening there as well.\n  The report finds:\n\n       Serious religious freedom violations continue in Cuba . . . \n     Violations by the Cuban government include: detention, \n     sporadic arrests, and harassment of clergy and religious \n     leaders, as well as interference in church affairs. The Cuban \n     government also controls and monitors religious belief and \n     practices through surveillance and legal restrictions.\n\n  In Russia the report finds:\n\n       The government increasingly used its anti-extremist law \n     against peaceful religious groups and individuals, \n     particularly Jehovah's Witnesses and Muslim readers of the \n     works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi.\n\n  Russia is a country that is beginning to backslide on religious \nliberty as well.\n  Finally, here in this hemisphere, just as in Cuba, Venezuela. The \nreport finds that violations of religious liberty include:\n\n       The government's failure to investigate and hold \n     accountable perpetrators of attacks on religious leaders and \n     houses of worship, and virulent rhetoric president \n     Hugo Chavez, government officials, state media, and pro-\n     Chavez media directed at the Venezuelan Jewish and \n     Christian communities.\n\n  I think sometimes we take for granted the religious liberties we have \nin this country, and we should never do so. The fact is we may have \nsome cultural divisions in America when it comes to religion, and that \nis not tolerable either. But one of the great things we have had in \nthis country since its inception is the belief in religious liberty and \nreligious freedom enshrined in our governing Constitution. It is \nsomething that is the exception rather than the rule around the world. \nI think our example should inspire the world in that regard, but I \nthink we should always use our voice, our power, and our example to \nlead the way around the\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nworld on this Human Rights Day on the issue of religious liberty.\n  Last but not least, the cause for women around the world is something \nthat bears watching as well. Some of these issues are interrelated. \nWhen I talk about human trafficking and human slavery, a \ndisproportionate number of those held in bondage around the world are \nyoung women and young girls.\n  On the issue of human rights with regard to women, there are a couple \nof parts of the world that are very troubling. Afghanistan comes to \nmind because just today we got the report that a senior advocate for \nwomen in Afghanistan was shot down by unknown gunmen on Monday. It is \nthe latest assassination against women's rights activists in the \ncountry. Najia Seddiqi was headed to her office in the eastern Laghman \nprovince when she was shot and killed. She was the head of the Women's \nAffairs Department for the Laghman province. Her predecessor in that \npost was killed just 4 months ago. The Taliban, which many hold \nresponsible for the attack, has not yet had a comment, but it comes \njust a week after a teenage girl who was volunteering at an anti-polio \ndrive was fatally shot northeast of Kabul. The Taliban has targeted \nsenior female officials in the past for working in the U.S.-backed \nAfghan Government. That is just one issue of a coordinated attack to go \nafter women who dare to participate in the political life of the \ncountry. It goes beyond that.\n  There is this very troubling law in Afghanistan which the government \nclaims to have tried to clear up. It is called running away. Basically \nsome judges have interpreted running away as a crime. It has been used \nagainst young girls and women who run away from home because it is a \nhome where they are being abused or a home where they are being forced \nto marry somebody.\n  There are some sad stories I want to share. A 17-year-old leapt from \nher roof to the streets of Kabul in an effort to avoid marriage \nordained by her grandfather when she was only 9 years old. The judge \nwho heard the case mentioned that Farima ruined her life. The judge \nstated in a court that the court is a place where a woman can plead for \ndivorce or custody of her children only if and when she has five male \nwitnesses and a husband or a fiance who condones the separation.\n  This is the 21st century we are talking about. We are not reading \nsomething from history. This is happening right now. Of course we all \nknow the story of the brave little girl in Pakistan who was shot. We \nhear these cases every single day. It goes on and on. I could be here \nfor 3 hours highlighting abuses against women, against religious \nliberty, the abuses of human trafficking and human slavery around the \nworld. I think what is important today on December 10, Human Rights \nDay, is to take a moment and understand that the cause of human rights \nis not a partisan cause; it is not even a nationalist cause. It is a \nhuman cause that requires each and every one of us to raise our voice \nand to call attention to any time and any place where human rights are \nviolated.\n  I want to congratulate the leading role this government has played in \ncalling attention to those abuses around the world and in being honest \nwith ourselves when these things are happening here at home. Of course, \nlike anything else, we have to first set the example before we can \nlead, and that is why I think it is so important that on the issue of \nhuman trafficking and modern-day slavery that the United States have \ncutting-edge legislation which deals with an emerging problem that \nkeeps changing and so the laws have to adapt to it. I hope we will take \nthe first step in doing that by authorizing the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act as soon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7695-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7695-S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DEATH TAX\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are in the midst of an intense debate \nabout how to deal with the expiration of bipartisan tax relief at the \nend of this year.\n  The President and the Democratic Party campaigned primarily on \nraising the top marginal rates. Yet income tax rates are not the only \ntax policy set to expire at the end of this month. If Congress does not \nact, the currently low death tax rates which have previously been \nsupported on a bipartisan basis will skyrocket. They will go from an \nexemption amount of $5 million and a tax rate of 35 percent to an \nastonishingly low exemption amount of $1 million and a 55-percent tax \nrate.\n\n  The question is clear: Where are the Senate Democrats on this issue? \nAgain, a low death tax has previously been a rare point of bipartisan \nagreement. Yet this past July, my friends on the other side of the \naisle proposed and passed a bill that included a tax cut extension for \nindividuals making under $200,000 or families making under $250,000.\n  Conversely, the bill would have designated the millions of families \nin New York, New Jersey, Florida, Virginia, and elsewhere who make in \nexcess of $250,000 as rich and subject to higher taxes. Still, when it \ncame to the death tax, this bill, which was supported by all but one \nDemocrat in this Chamber, was silent.\n  In other words, that bill assumed that current death tax rates would \nexpire--a crushing blow to America's families and businesses and farms. \nThis bill, which, once again, was supported by nearly every Senate \nDemocrat, would allow the death tax to skyrocket and the exemption to \nbe reduced to the lowest amount in over a decade, creating an \nadministrative and compliance burden for nearly 1 million estates.\n  Allowing death tax policy to expire is another example of the \nPresident putting ideology and sentiment ahead of economic reality. \nWhile the death tax targets the transfer of wealth from one individual \nto an infinite amount of other individuals, the repercussions are felt \nthroughout all income levels.\n  From a person working in the cornfields, to a cashier at a mom-and-\npop store, to a gas station attendant, the long arm of the death tax \naffects more than the so-called wealthy. It is called the death tax not \nonly because it is a tax imposed at a time when family members are \ngrieving over the loss of a loved one but also because it can be a \ndeath sentence for the family businesses and farms that American \nworkers depend on for their livelihoods.\n  I know a lot of my friends on the other side of the aisle understand \nthis. Some have spoken on the floor of the Senate in favor of extending \nthe death tax rate. Some have introduced legislation to do so.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, where I serve as \nthe ranking member, has indicated he would like to see the current \ndeath tax regime extended. So what is the problem? Unfortunately, bare-\nknuckle politics is getting in the way of good policy. And the \nPresident's insistence on a $2 trillion tax increase is undermining \nprogress on resolving the death tax.\n  I have been a longtime proponent of repealing the whole death tax. \nNot only is it double taxation and a deterrent to savings, but it also \nsucks up capital in the marketplace. The death tax adds inefficiency to \nour economy. It is what economists refer to as deadweight loss. In \nother words, it creates another burden on our free market system that \nprevents the full potential of economic growth.\n  For instance, many family farms have to purchase insurance in order \nto prepare for paying the death tax so they do not end up having to \nliterally sell the farm just to pay the death tax. This added cost is \nembedded into the cost of goods when sold. In other words, American \nconsumers, American workers, or Americans looking for work are those \nwho will ultimately pay the death tax.\n  This past July, the Joint Economic Committee analyzed the costs and \nconsequences of the death tax. In a report the committee found that, as \nof 2008, the death tax has cumulatively reduced the amount of capital \nstock in the U.S. economy by roughly $1.1 trillion since its \nintroduction as a permanent tax in 1916, equivalent to 3.2 percent of \nthe total capital stock.\n  Coincidentally, since its inception nearly 100 years ago, the death \ntax has\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nraised just under $1.3 trillion in total revenue. By comparison, that \nis equivalent to the U.S. Federal deficit for fiscal year 2011 alone. \nBut that was over all those years--100 years. And keep in mind, the \nloss is $1.1 trillion, and yet all it has raised is $1.3 trillion. So \nthink it through.\n  I have some news for those seeking to engage in class warfare. The \ndeath tax does not reduce income and wealth inequality. Perversely, the \nestate tax creates a barrier to income and wealth mobility.\n  In an interview this past year with the Associated Press, Deputy \nSecretary of Agriculture Kathleen Merrigan described an epidemic of \nsorts that is hitting our farmlands across the United States. She did \nnot talk about rising fuel prices or droughts. Instead, Secretary \nMerrigan discussed how our country's farmers and ranchers are getting \nolder and fewer young people are taking their place. I have heard time \nand time again that the death tax is the No. 1 reason family farms and \nbusinesses fail to pass down to the next generation.\n  Consider also that heirs are often forced to sell an asset of the \nfarm in order to meet this arbitrary tax. These assets are likely \ngenerating revenue and could be a vital part of the family farm. But \nbecause of the death tax, family farms and ranches are instead forced \nto sell these assets or sell the farm to pay the death tax.\n  This chart shows just in a few States the drought-stricken farmers \nwho are at risk for the death tax in 2013. I have chosen to show South \nDakota, Nebraska, Iowa, California, Wyoming, and Montana. You can see \nthe percentages.\n  As you can see from the chart, in South Dakota, farms over $5 \nmillion, 15 percent, farms over $1 million, 49 percent; in Nebraska, \nfarms over $5 million, 16 percent, farms over $1 million, 49 percent; \nIowa, farms over $5 million, 15 percent, farms over $1 million, 47 \npercent; California, farms over $5 million, 11 percent, farms over $1 \nmillion, 42 percent; Wyoming--just so I do not leave out the \nIntermountain West--farms over $5 million are 8 percent of the farms, \nfarms over $1 million are 33 percent. Or take Montana: Farms over $5 \nmillion are 7 percent of the farms, and farms over $1 million, 30 \npercent.\n  We ought to repeal the death tax. I do not want these farmers to have \nto sell the farm to pay the death tax. It might make sense in a college \nsocial justice seminar, but it has no place in serious discussions \nabout fiscal policy; that is, the death tax.\n  Recently, the Joint Committee on Taxation released an estimate on how \nmany more taxable estates, farming taxable estates, and small business \ntaxable estates would be affected by the increase in the death tax over \nthe next 10 years. This chart I have in the Chamber shows that.\n  The numbers are astonishing. If Congress does not act, we will see \nmore than 15 times the number of taxable estates, more than 13 times \nthe number of small business taxable estates, and a whopping 24 times \nthe number of farming taxable estates. And to add fuel to the fire, \nfarmers already have to recoup the economic losses incurred from the \nrecession.\n\n  This is kicking farmers and ranchers while they are down. The recent \ndroughts--and that is what this other chart shows--have caused an \nunprecedented economic hardship. If we decrease the exemption amount \nfor the death tax from $5 million to $1 million, just look at how many \nmore farms will possibly be exposed to the death tax in certain \ndrought-stricken areas.\n  As you can see on the chart, that central part, shown in the real \ndark purple or black--whatever that is--that is the big drought area. \nThe States shown in red are not as bad, but they still have very severe \ndrought. The States shown in the darkened area basically are in extreme \ndrought. They have been going through that.\n  According to the information compiled from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, as you can see on that chart, 15 percent of the farms in \nSouth Dakota are valued over $5 million. But look at the number of \nfarms valued over $1 million--an astonishing 49 percent.\n  Look at California: 11 percent of the farms are valued at over $5 \nmillion, but 42 percent of the farms are valued at over $1 million. \nThen there is Montana where 7 percent of the farms are valued over $5 \nmillion but 30 percent are valued over $1 million. Not all of these \nfarms will necessarily be impacted by the death tax next year, but I \ncan guarantee you that most of them will down the road.\n  The fiscal cliff presents us with a pivotal moment. How we tax our \ncitizens is ultimately a question of what we stand for. With respect to \nthe death tax, the question is whether we stand for families and jobs \nor whether we stand for redistribution regardless of the consequences.\n  We need to resolve death tax policy. We can no longer afford to put \nsmall businesses, family farms, and individuals in a position where \neach year uncertainty about the death tax rate and exemption amount \ncauses them to divert income away from creating jobs and toward \nunnecessary death tax planning. This is important stuff, and it is not \nsomething we can just blindly or blithely wipe out.\n  It is time for the President to lead on this issue. The President, \ntellingly, said when he was running for President in 2008 that his \nexperience running for President was one of the critical bullets on his \nresume qualifying him for the job. Other than writing and part-time \nteaching, President Obama has made a career running for office. Well, \nhe will never run for office again, as far as he is concerned. It is \ntime to put aside the campaign and take up the mantle of leadership. It \nis time to make the tough decisions necessary to get our economy moving \nagain.\n  Resolving the death tax is a good place to start, and should he \ndecide to lead, he will find partners on both sides of the aisle to \njoin him.\n  As you can see from those charts, these are serious matters. To have \nto sell the family farm in order to pay the death tax is not a good \nthing or to have to borrow to keep it alive is not a good thing. To \nhave to pay heavy insurance rates through the years to be able to pay \nat least something of the death tax--it may be a better way of trying \nto help, but it puts these farmers and their families in a real bind.\n  We should get rid of the whole death tax, but I do not believe our \nfriends on the other side are willing to do that. So then the least we \nshould do is keep the tax rate at 35 percent, with an exemption of $5 \nmillion, doubled to $10 million for the family. That would help a lot \nof these farmers keep their farms, it would help our country to still \nbe an agriculture-related country, and it would stop voracious people \nfrom hovering over those farms, swooping them up at low rates.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7696-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7696-S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAST VOTING ACT\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, like millions of Americans, on November 6, \njust over a month ago, on election day, I stood at the polls and I cast \nmy vote, and then when I got home I stayed up late to see the results \ncome in. I was still awake when President Obama delivered his \nacceptance speech. In those remarks, he said:\n\n       I want to thank every American who participated in this \n     election, whether you voted for the very first time or waited \n     in line for a very long time. By the way, we have to fix \n     that.\n\n  There is so much we have to fix. It was 11:38 p.m. on the east coast \nwhen the Associated Press called the election for President Obama, but \nAndre Murias, an 18-year-old first-time voter in Miami Dade County, FL, \nwas still in line waiting to cast his ballot. Andre had been in line at \nSouth Kendall Community Church for nearly 5 hours by the time he cast \nhis ballot just before midnight, and that is nothing compared to the 7 \nand 8 hours many other Floridians waited to cast their ballots during \nthe State's condensed early voting period. ``This is a mess,'' one \nvoter said. ``It is chaos.''\n  Rashell Hobbs, another first-time voter, waited 5 hours in \nChesapeake, VA. ``This is just horrible,'' Rashell said. ``There is no \nreason it should take this long.''\n  Voters across the country had other challenges or problems voting. \nVoters\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nin Pueblo, CO, said they checked the box on their touch screen panel to \nvote for Mitt Romney, but it kept switching their pick to President \nObama. ``I wonder whether my vote really counted,'' one Colorado voter \nsaid.\n  Voters in Pennsylvania reported a similar problem, although in that \ncase it was the President for whom they were seemingly unable to vote.\n  Poll watchers in Davidson County, TN, could only stand by as would-be \nvoters saw the very, very long line of people waiting to cast their \nballots and drove away, pressed, I am sure, by commitments of family or \nwork to choose not to spend hours standing in line to exercise that \nmost fundamental of American rights--the right to vote.\n  In Philadelphia, longtime registered voters who showed up to cast \ntheir ballots discovered their names simply weren't on the rolls \nanymore.\n  In Ohio, Wisconsin, South Carolina, New York, Montana--more than a \ndozen States experienced some kind of basic breakdown in the \nadministration of their elections in 2012.\n  This is the United States. The right to vote is fundamental to who we \nare. It is basic to our democracy. It is in our DNA. We have to get \nthis right.\n  That is why I introduced the Fair, Accurate, Secure, and Timely--or \nFAST--Voting Act of 2012, along with Senators Warner and Whitehouse. \nAnd I am grateful that Congressmen Connolly and Langevin in the House \nhave introduced it and are cosponsors there.\n  In my view, long lines are simply another form of disenfranchising \nvoters. Running out of ballots is simply another form of voter \nsuppression. Incomplete and inaccurate voter rolls, disregarded voter \nregistrations, misleading phone calls and mailing pieces--things that \nmake it harder for citizens to vote are simply a violation of voters' \ncivil rights.\n\n  We can and must do better. As widespread as the problem was in 2012, \nthere are also many States that are getting it right, and these States, \nin my view, continue to be laboratories of democracy from which we \nshould learn. The FAST Voting Act creates a new competitive Federal \ngrant program roughly modeled on Race to the Top, which encourages \nStates to pursue reforms in a different field, in education. States \nthat demonstrate the most comprehensive and promising reform plans win \na greater portion of the grant funding in that model. Instead, the FAST \nVoting Act would inspire election reform. This bill authorizes a \nFederal program that would award grants based on how well States \nimprove access to the ballot in at least 9 different ways: through \nflexible registration opportunities, including same-day registration; \nthrough early voting at a minimum of 9 of the 10 calendar days \npreceding an election; through what is called no-excuse absentee \nvoting; assistance to voters who do not speak English or have \ndisabilities or visual impairments; effective access to voting for \nmembers of our armed services; formal training of election officials, \nincluding State and county administrators and volunteers; audited and \nreduced waiting times at poorest performing polling stations; and, as \nwe learned given that Sandy, Superstorm Sandy, occurred close to the \nelection, contingency plans for voting in the event of a natural or \nother disaster that compels a delay of an election.\n  These are the big areas mentioned in this FAST Voting Act, making it \neasier to register, making it easier to vote early, making it easier to \nvote absentee, shortening lines, better preparing for catastrophes, \nmaking it easier for Americans to exercise their right to vote.\n  This is a good one, and I am working with a host of civil rights and \nvoter protection groups who work, day in and day out, on strengthening \nour electoral process. It encourages States and localities to find new \nand creative and local solutions that other States can learn from.\n  Mr. President, as you know, in my service prior to coming to this \nbody I was a county executive and long active with NACO, the Nation \nAssociation of Counties. Counties have different roles in different \nStates. There are more than 3,000 counties spread across our 50 States \nbut in most States they are responsible in part for administering \nelections. Many election officials are county-elected officials and \nmany voter boards are parts of county government. One of the things I \nthink is best about this bill, this FAST Voting Act of 2012, is that \nrather than mandating some specific response it encourages and \nincentivizes State and local officials to put together plans for how to \nlearn from the lessons of 2012, how to learn from the long lines and \nthe barriers that were put in front of those who came out to vote, and \nfinding the best solutions; rather than imposing or compelling, \nincentivizing and leading in a way that I think State and local \nofficials will respond to well and will accept and celebrate.\n  There is strong momentum. Although the election is now more than a \nmonth behind us, my hope is that we will continue to focus on the \nchallenges of this last election and fix them before the next. The Pew \nConference, today and tomorrow, on voting in America is bringing \ntogether some of our Nation's foremost experts and scholars. For that \nwe are grateful to the Pew Charitable Foundation.\n  The Judiciary Committee on which we serve has a hearing announced \nthis coming week and I applaud Chairman Leahy and Senator Durbin for \nhighlighting the need to get to the bottom of what happened in 2012 and \nchampioning the need to get reform. Other Members, Senators Gillibrand \nand Boxer, have introduced bills as well and I look forward to working \nclosely with them to harmonize our bills and making sure we have the \nbest approach moving forward.\n  In addition to serving on the Judiciary Committee, I am chairman of \nthe African Affairs Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. In \nthat role I advocate for free and fair elections with African leaders \nevery day. The United States is often cited as their role model. We \nneed to act like it and we need to earn it.\n  What kind of message are we sending to electoral commissions, to \nheads of State, to members of civil society, and advocates of free, \nfair, and open elections in the rest of the world when we so visibly \nand publicly fail to deliver on that promise here in our own country? \nWhat kind of message are we sending to Andre Murias, a first-time \nvoter? What kind of message are we sending to Rashell Hobbs? What kind \nof message are we sending to first-time voters about the value of their \nright to vote, for which so many fought, worked, struggled, sacrificed, \neven died in the course of our history? What message do we send to them \nwhen we allow modern-day barriers to be put in their place?\n  Voting is a fundamental civil right, and when States prevent their \ncitizens from exercising that right, whether deliberately through law \nor through regulations or accidentally through lack of preparation or \nmere incompetence, it is a violation of voters' civil rights. The Fair, \nAccurate, Secure and Timely Voting Act is one critical way we can try \nto fix our elections and make sure what happened across our country in \n2012 never happens again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7697-S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor and was \nhonored to give tributes to some of our departing colleagues. Tonight I \nam going to take advantage of this time to pay tribute to two other \noutstanding Senators, colleagues and friends of mine whom I will miss \ngreatly. They are Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Scott Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in her marvelous book entitled ``American \nHeroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country,'' Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison wrote the following: ``No history can be written \nappropriately without acknowledging the part women have played in \nbuilding the greatness of our country.''\n  As my valued colleague and good friend begins a new chapter in her \nlife, I hope she finds the time to add a new chapter to her own book, \none that will be fascinating, inspiring--and autobiographical.\n  Like the women Kay celebrates as an author, from Amelia Earhart to \nSally Ride, from Clara Barton to Condoleeza Rice, Kay Bailey Hutchison \nis a pioneer, a breaker of barriers. In the special election in 1993, \nthe people of\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nTexas made her the first woman to represent them in the Senate. In the \nthree regular elections since then, they have confirmed their trust in \nher by ever-increasing margins. As the leader of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, Kay has been a strong voice for transportation systems that \nare efficient, safe, and secure. In my own work on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I am well aware of the major role she played in \ndrafting the airline security bill that Congress passed after the \nattacks on 9/11/01. She has also worked successfully to include more \neffective air cargo screening.\n  From the America COMPETES Act to her steadfast support for NASA, Kay \nis determined our country will not cede its position as the world's \nleader in science, technology, and space exploration. When the NASA \nrover Curiosity thrilled all of us with its perfect landing on Mars \nthis past August, the hands of Kay's legislative leadership were on the \ncontrols. Working with Kay as a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nI know how dedicated she is to ensuring that taxpayers' dollars are \nspent wisely and efficiently. She is a champion for our small business \nowners and for policies that promote free enterprise and job creation.\n  Her complete commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces is \nreflected in her years of service on the Armed Services Committee as \nwell as the Military Construction Subcommittee on Appropriations, and \nher unanimous election this year to serve as chairman of the Board of \nVisitors at West Point.\n  In the afterword to her book, Kay wrote that as a young girl growing \nup in Texas she was so inspired by the lives of great Americans that by \nthe sixth grade she had exhausted all of the biographies on the school \nlibrary shelf and had to turn elsewhere for book report material. I am \nsure the story of her own contributions and accomplishments will be \navidly read by generations of girls and boys to come.\n  I wish her all the best as she turns a new page in what has truly \nbeen a remarkable life of public service.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, when Scott Brown, a fellow New Englander, came to the \nSenate 2 years ago, I immediately saw in him those traits shared by the \npeople of our two New England States: a strong work ethic, a \ndetermination to always do what he thought was right, and a spirit that \nwas independent and dedicated to doing what was best for his \nconstituents and for his country.\n  My initial assessment was confirmed by our time working together on \nso many issues. Scott conducted his inspiring 2010 campaign via his now \nlegendary pickup truck. When he got to Washington, he kept his foot on \nthe gas. His work in government at the State and local level in \nMassachusetts and his distinguished service in the Army National Guard \nprepared him with experience that made him a respected and effective \nlegislator from day one. His intellect, energy, and character made him \na valued colleague and a dear friend.\n  Scott is a person one could always count on. I have had the \nopportunity to work closely with Scott on so many key issues. In each \nand every case he brought an informed, thoughtful, and open-minded \napproach to every issue.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I have gotten to know Scott very well \nand I appreciate his service on our committee. He placed his top \npriority on helping to keep our Nation safe from the continuing threat \nof terrorism. He also worked hard to make our Federal Government more \nefficient and transparent.\n  With Scott's leadership, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to \nhelp put the Postal Service back on a more sound financial footing and \nto ensure that this institution could endure. He also authored the \nSTOCK Act, the new law that clearly prohibits insider trading by \nMembers of Congress and their staff.\n  Scott has long been an effective champion for our small business \nowners, working to ensure that entrepreneurs and innovators in \nMassachusetts and across the country have the ability to survive and \nthrive and, most of all, to create good jobs. He has advocated for our \nNation's veterans through the Hiring Our Heroes Act that he coauthored, \nwhich provides tax credits to small businesses that hire a returning \nveteran or member of the National Guard Reserve.\n  Scott has been a devoted advocate in the Senate for fiscal \nresponsibility and a balanced budget amendment. At the same time, he \nkept a firm commitment to helping those most in need. He fought hard \nfor such vital programs as the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program, \nwhich is so important to getting through those cold New England \nwinters.\n  Equally important to Scott's hard work in the Senate has been the \napproach he has always taken in legislating. He studies the issues. He \nseeks areas where a consensus can be found. From the very first day in \nthe Senate, he demonstrated his belief that compromise is not a dirty \nword but an absolute necessity if we are to meet the challenges facing \nAmerica. Scott always looked at the issues before Congress not through \nthe lens of a partisan politician but, rather, through the lens of a \npragmatic problem-solver.\n  Scott's tenure in the Senate has been far too brief but, perhaps more \nimportant, it has been characterized by a remarkable degree of success \nin transforming good ideas into public laws. Given his Maine roots and \nstrong commitment to Massachusetts, I am sure we will remain good \nfriends in the years to come. But, oh, how I will miss serving with my \nfriend Scott Brown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is Human Rights Day, and I wanted to \nsimply add my voice to the many others who have spoken about the \nimportant work the United States can do to continue our leadership \naround the world as a country that holds itself accountable and leads \nothers toward being accountable for a world in which human rights have \nmeaning and substance. There are two things we can do between now and \nthe end of this calendar year that will make a significant contribution \nto human rights and to the U.S. global leadership.\n  First, the House of Representatives can take up and pass VAWA, the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization bill passed months ago by \nthis Chamber. It is a strong, broad, sensible reauthorization bill that \nI think well deserves consideration and passage by the other Chamber.\n  Second, TVPA, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, needs to be \nreauthorized. I was proud last month to join with Senator Portman and \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Blumenthal, as the three of us jointly \nfounded the Caucus to End Human Trafficking. Slavery exists in the \nworld today. In this country and around the world, there are victims of \nhuman trafficking whose voices demand to be heard. By reauthorizing \nTVPA, this Chamber and this country can make a meaningful contribution \ntoward ending trafficking of persons in the United States and around \nthe world.\n  I simply wanted to add today, Human Rights Day, those two simple \ncalls for action so this Congress and this country can continue our \nglobal leadership.\n  The House of Representatives needs to take up and pass VAWA and the \nSenate needs to pass the TVPA reauthorization. Together let us continue \nto make history in America's leadership on human rights.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today on Human Rights Day. Now,\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\nthere are a plethora of days in this Nation known for various causes, \nfor issues, and for historical occurrences. Human Rights Day is \nfundamentally American.\n  The rights of human beings are the reason this Nation was founded and \nthe motivation for the war that was fought to make us free. Human \nRights Day is about advancing equality, and the U.S. Constitution as it \nhas expanded over the years to include new groups of people and strike \ndown barriers of race, gender, ethnic background, and national origin. \nIt is about the progress of human rights and equality, the noblest of \ncauses for this Nation. It is about what brings us together as \nAmericans, the fight for freedom, the search for equality and justice.\n  I want to talk about three specific ways we can advance the cause of \nhuman rights in this Chamber, in this session, through measures that \nare now before us. The first concerns human trafficking. I have been \nparticularly interested in the rampant human trafficking problems on \nAmerican military bases abroad in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. \nVictims are recruited from developing countries like Bangladesh and the \nPhilippines. They are charged exorbitant, illegal fees to travel to \ntheir worksites, often misled about where they are going, what their \nsalaries will be, and what their living conditions will be like. \nFrequently, their passports are confiscated so they cannot return home, \neven if they are able to scrape together the money to make that \njourney.\n  This kind of human trafficking is no less than modern-day slavery, \nsubsidized by our government with taxpayer money. It is reprehensible. \nBut, for me, the number one issue is the safety of our American troops \non these bases. That safety is compromised if our bases are filled with \nunauthorized, potentially unsafe foreign workers.\n  That is why I introduced the End Trafficking in Government \nContracting Act of 2012, which provides the most comprehensive \nlegislative approach to solving this problem ever undertaken by the \nUnited States Congress. It is bipartisan legislation, which now is \nincluded in the Defense Reauthorization bill that passed the Senate \nlast week, and I am hopeful that this provision will be retained in \nconference committee and signed into law soon with strong bipartisan \nsupport from my colleague, Senator Portman of Ohio.\n  In addition, I want to thank Senator Leahy for advancing the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a broader measure \nknown by its initials, TVPRA, which takes an even more inclusive view \nof this problem to make sure America stands against human trafficking \nrather than be complicit in it.\n  The second issue I want to raise is the VAWA, or the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which continues to be stalled in the House of \nRepresentatives. Tragically, incomprehensibly, and passed by this body, \nVAWA still has not been approved in a form that is acceptable by the \nHouse of Representatives. Reauthorizing VAWA is a top priority for me, \nand I know for many in this body, as well. My hope is that the House of \nRepresentatives will act in the final weeks of this session.\n  VAWA is a landmark statute aimed at combating domestic violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking. It provides billions of dollars to \nsupport investigations and prosecutions of vicious, heinous acts, and \nit provides remedies and protection for assaulted women.\n  On this day, when we celebrate human rights, what better way than to \ncommemorate the advances that VAWA made in fighting violence against \nwomen and to broaden its provisions to protect Native Americans, \nimmigrants in this country, and the gay and lesbian community. That is \nthe nature of our democracy: we advance human rights, we make them more \ninclusive, and we broaden their provisions. The reauthorization of this \nlegislation is badly needed.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the DREAM Act, which should be part of \nimmigration reform in this country. I think the vast majority of the \nMembers of the Senate have accepted and indeed espoused the need for \nthorough, comprehensive immigration reform. That kind of reform should \ninclude the DREAM Act. I have spoken about it on many occasions, and on \nmany of those occasions I have presented to this body an individual \nstory as I have, for example, about Solanlly Canas.\n  I brought her photograph with me today. She is a young woman of \nenormous promise who simply wants to stay in this country, and have a \npath to citizenship. Having been brought here at the age of 12, she \ndidn't choose to come, she was brought here through no fault or doing \nof her own, and this is her country. This is where her friends are; \nthis is the language she speaks. She lives in East Haven, Connecticut, \nwhere she attended school, and she has thrived there. She became a \nmember of the National Honor Society. She is on the executive board of \nthe student council. She is president of the Interact Club.\n  She was born in Colombia, but her roots are in America. She has \ndreams and goals for the future like any young woman her age, and she \nis proud of her connection, her roots in this country. She wants to go \nto college, but for so long has feared that she would not be able to \ngo.\n  She is eligible to apply for the Deferred Action Program announced by \nthe administration, but that program would simply give her a reprieve \nwithout the security and certainty that she needs to advance and \ncontinue her schooling. That is the path to citizenship that our \nDreamers need and deserve so that they can go to school, serve in our \nmilitary, give back to this country, and earn their citizenship through \ndeeds--not just words, but deeds--that make us all proud, and \ncontribute to the quality of life in our Nation.\n  That is what they want to do is to earn the citizenship that so many \nof us take for granted. So many people in this country have this as a \nbirthright--without the effort that she will devote to becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. We have great citizens born here who value and prize their \ncitizenship. But Solanlly is one who deserves a path and the ability to \nearn it through her deeds and her accomplishments in school and \nafterwards.\n  On this Human Rights Day, I thank this body for giving me the honor \nof speaking about these issues. It is an extraordinary honor to say how \nmuch human rights mean in this country. We are the paragon of equality, \nfreedom, and rights. We are the greatest Nation in the history of the \nworld, and we are still a work in progress. We still have progress to \nmake, and these three measures will help us to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7699-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recognize Buddy \nGuy, who was recently honored here in Washington at the Kennedy Center \nfor his contribution to the arts.\n  George ``Buddy'' Guy was born in 1936 into a Louisiana sharecropper \nfamily. He first learned to play music on handmade instruments.\n  With no money, Guy moved to Chicago in 1957 at the peak of the \nChicago's blues era. A stranger introduced him at Chicago's 708 Club, \nwhere he eventually landed a steady gig. He also played at other local \nvenues, and eventually he signed a record deal. Chicago connected Guy \nwith legendary artists and allowed him to play guitar with blues greats \nlike Muddy Watters and Howlin' Wolf. However, it was not until his 1991 \nrelease of ``Damn Right, I've Got the Blues'' that his career started \nmaking national headlines. The album earned him his first Grammy Award \nfor Best Contemporary Artist and five W.C. Handy awards.\n  After that, the awards started streaming in. He earned 5 more\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nGrammy Awards and 18 more W.C. Handy awards--more than any other \nartist. In 2003, he received the National Medal of Arts for his \nextraordinary contributions to the creation, growth, and support in the \narts. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 and \nthe Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2008. Billboard Magazine gave him \nthe Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, and Rolling \nStone ranked him at No. 23 on the list of 100 Greatest Guitarists.\n  If that is not impressive enough, Eric Clapton once described him as \nthe best guitar player alive. And Guy's songs have been covered by Led \nZeppelin, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Stevie Ray Vaughan, John \nMayall, Jack Bruce, and others.\n  Although Guy was born in Louisiana, today Chicago, IL, is proud to \nclaim him as one of our own. In 1989 he opened Buddy Guy's Legends in \nChicago, and it remains one of the most successful blues joints in the \ncity. He has been called Windy City's reigning blues artist and the \nlast strand linking the immortal Chicago bluesmen of the 1950s with the \ncontemporary blues scene. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Guy a ``great \nChicago treasure.''\n  As one of his album titles suggests, he ``Can't Quit the Blues.'' \nEven well into his seventies, he is making music. Guy tours constantly, \nappearing at blues clubs and festivals around the world, and he won his \nmost recent Grammy in 2012.\n  President Obama called Guy ``one of the last guardians of the great \nAmerican blues.'' And on December 2, Guy was recognized at a White \nHouse reception as one of the 2012 Kennedy Center honorees for his \ncontribution to the arts.\n  As Guy said himself, ``From picking cotton in the field to picking a \nguitar in the White House, that is a long ways man.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7700-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVE WHITE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after nearly four decades of service with \nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, last week, Mr. Dave White settled into \nretirement. He will be missed for his dedication, enthusiasm, and \nsteadfast support of conservation causes, as well as his keen sense of \nhumor and sharp wit, which kept both his staff, and Members of \nCongress, on their toes.\n  During his long career, Dave has shown great leadership in \nconservation, improving the Nation's land management policies and \npractices, and ensuring that we meet our shared goal for sustaining \nagriculture and natural resources. His work has ensured that private \nlands are conserved, restored, and more resilient to environmental \nchallenges, a goal that has grown in importance as weather disasters \nlike Tropical Storm Irene, Hurricane Sandy, and the record drought \nstill gripping the Midwest become more frequent and severe.\n  Dave wore many hats during his time at NRCS. From 2002 to 2008, he \nserved as the State Conservationist in Montana where he helped farmers \nand ranchers improve agricultural production, while at the same time \nreducing their impact on the environment. After learning about Dave's \nmany outstanding achievements in Montana, my only regret was that we \nwere not able to add NRCS State Conservationist in Vermont to Chief \nWhite's already sterling resume.\n  Later, in 2007 and 2008, Dave was detailed to Senator Harkin's \noffice, where his help in drafting the conservation title of the 2008 \nfarm bill was immeasurable. I am deeply thankful for his assistance on \nthis vital legislation, and for his thoughtful consideration of \nprograms that have been so vital to Vermont's conservation efforts, \nsuch as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the Farmland \nProtection Program, and Regional Equity, which have all contributed to \nthe protection and improvement of Lake Champlain. President Obama then \nappointed Dave to lead NRCS, a role that he has filled admirably for 4 \nyears working closely with Secretary Vilsack to advance voluntary, \nincentive-based private land conservation.\n  I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to Chief White for his \nyears of dedicated service to this Nation. I wish him well in his \nretirement and I hope he will come visit us soon in Vermont to sample \nour many delicious ``value-added'' agricultural products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7700-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT RUSSELL NEARY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Lieutenant \nRussell Neary, a brave volunteer firefighter who was killed in the line \nof duty during Hurricane Sandy. He served the Town of Easton as \nPresident of the Easton Volunteer Fire Company and volunteer EMT and \nworked in Stamford as a vice president of General Reinsurance Company. \nHe was deeply respected as a friendly and compassionate resident and \nbeloved father and husband. I know his family well.\n  When Sandy struck Connecticut the evening of October 29, Lieutenant \nNeary responded to a call without hesitation--one of the many evenings \nover the past 13 years when he put himself in harm's way to respond to \na resident in need. Tragically, when clearing the road of a fallen \nbranch, he was fatally injured. Lieutenant Neary was the first \nfirefighter in Easton's history to die in the line of duty. His family \nhas a history of public service, including his brother Fire Marshal \nPeter Neary.\n  In the following days after this tragedy, members of neighboring fire \ndepartments and emergency responders volunteered their time to assist \nEaston Fire Company firefighters, allowing them to mourn the death of \ntheir colleague and friend--a demonstration of brotherhood and \nsolidarity across Connecticut public safety personnel.\n  Regarded as family by Chief James M. Girardi and fellow members of \nthe Easton Volunteer Fire Company, Lieutenant Neary was tearfully \nmourned and remembered for days after his tragic death as ``a powerful \nforce of good will and compassion to all who met him.'' He was recalled \nby many as a sincere member of the community who genuinely cared for \nand enjoyed helping others. I joined more than 1,000 people--gathered \nfrom around Connecticut, the Nation, and even Canada to pay tribute to \nthis remarkable public servant. His legacy will live on through this \nspirit of giving that has touched and inspired so many.\n  I am honored to salute Lieutenant Neary and invite my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in commemorating the life of this gracious first \nresponder, friend, and family member, who lost his life while keeping \nothers safe from harm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7700-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7700-S7701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING DONALD SINGER\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor of Col. Donald M. \nSinger, an airman who fought in Vietnam and a hero of America.\n  Donald and his wife Elizabeth had four children.\n  He was stationed as an Electronic Warfare Officer at Barksdale Air \nForce Base in Louisiana. This Nation called Donald Singer to service in \nVietnam in April of 1966. After training in California and before his \ndeployment overseas, Donald got to attend the confirmation of his \noldest daughter, 10-year-old Susan. That was the last time Susan saw \nher dad.\n  Maj. Donald Singer was selected to be part of an elite group of \nairmen known as the ``Wild Weasels.'' In August of 1966, on a mission \nnorth of Hanoi, North Vietnamese forces shot down his F-105 fighter \njet. Both men on board ejected.\n  Nobody knows exactly what happened after that. But reports indicate \nDonald's parachute never fully opened. And he was never heard from \nagain. The U.S. Government considered Donald missing in action and \ndespite his status, promoted him to the rank of colonel.\n  Eleven years later, in 1977, the Singer family got a phone call. \nDonald's remains had been found. And at last, he was coming home to the \nUnited States. Today, Colonel Singer's remains rest at Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  Although Colonel Singer was a decorated airman, his family never \nreceived all the honors he earned in service to this Nation.\n  It was my honor to present them to his daughter Susan, on her \nbirthday, December 7, 2012. On behalf of a grateful nation, I presented \nCol. Donald Singer's Purple Heart, Air Force Commendation Medal, and \nhis Presidential Unit Citation.\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\n  It was also my honor to present the Bronze Service Star for the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross \nwith Palm Ribbon, and the Bronze Service Star for the Vietnam Service \nMedal.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  They are presented on behalf of a nation that will never forget \nDonald Singer's heroism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7701-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7701-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7701-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of December 6, 2012, \nthe following enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed on December 6, 2012, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the Acting President pro tempore (Mr. Reid).\n\n       S. 3486.

A bill to rename section 219(c) of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 as the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nrename the section of the tax code that is currently known as the \n``Spousal IRA'' so that it carries the name of its champion--my friend \nand colleague from Texas--Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  Senator Hutchison has been an excellent partner to work with on the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science subcommittee watching over the nation's \ncheckbook for investments in research, discovery, innovation, and law \nenforcement. We have sought to find the sensible center in addressing \nissues like cancer research, building a balanced space program at NASA, \nand most recently--on legislation to stop inmates from using cell \nphones in prison.\n  Senator Hutchison must be recognized for her long-standing advocacy \nfor women. Her advocacy has been steadfast. We have worked together on \nthe women's health agenda. We have mammogram standards in this country \nbecause of the Hutchison-Mikulski amendment. We have helped with breast \ncancer research funding because we have worked together, and I could \ngive example after example.\n  But what I rise to discuss today is the very first issue that Senator \nHutchison and I took on together--expanding the availability of \nIndividual Retirement Accounts, IRAs, for spouses who work at home. \nAlong with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, I am the author of the Spousal \nIRA bill.\n  I have always said that one of my principles is to listen to the \npeople and the stories of their lives. My best ideas come from the \npeople. The Spousal IRA bill was one of those kinds of ideas. This bill \nwas a product of Senator Hutchison's personal experience before joining \nthe Senate. After putting aside money for her retirement as a single \nworking woman, Senator Hutchison found that she could only put aside \n$250 in an IRA once she married her husband.\n  This kind of policy, that discouraged women from saving for \nretirement, was completely backwards. Women tend to live longer than \nmen. Women are more likely to take years off of work outside of the \nhome because of family responsibilities. And women are more likely to \nwork in jobs that don't have a pension.\n  When Senator Hutchison joined the Senate in 1993, she came to me to \nsign on as the lead Democratic sponsor for her idea to help women save \nfor retirement. Together we worked to build support for this bill and \nafter 3 years and 62 cosponsors, the Spousal IRA bill became the law of \nthe land.\n  Suddenly, women weren't limited to $250, they could put away $2,000. \nAll women--single, married, working outside the home, or working at \nhome--could set aside the same amount for retirement. Over time, that \namount has grown, and so it is not $2,000, but it can be $2,500 or \n$3,000 or $5,000, depending on a woman's age.\n  This law is important because it reflects the values of our nation, \nit rewards good parenting and families, and it recognizes that not all \nwork is done in the marketplace. American families feel the pressure \nfrom all sides, paying for their children's education, their homes, \ntaking care of elderly parents, and being prepared for unforeseen \nemergency medical care costs. What the Spousal IRA law finally said \nwas, ``Moms and dads are struggling to do the right thing for their \nfamily, and they should not be penalized for staying at home.''\n  Earlier this year, an interviewer on PBS asked Senator Hutchison what \nshe's most proud of in her Senate career, and she said the Spousal IRA. \nSenator Hutchison has a lot to be proud of, but we must recognize her \nwork in fixing federal policy to help women save for retirement. We \nshould amend the tax code so that women in America know that they're \nbenefitting from the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7703-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7703-S7704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 612--HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE \n  ARLEN SPECTER, DISTINGUISHED FORMER SENATOR FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OF \n                              PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \nBlunt, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown \nof Ohio, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chambliss, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, \nMrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heller, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nInhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, \nMr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \nKohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Manchin, Mr. McCain, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Risch, \nMr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. \nVitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

BILATERAL, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL, AND \n                   MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Where applicable, the President shall explore opportunities \n     to negotiate bilateral, subregional, and regional agreements \n     that encourage trade and eliminate nontariff barriers to \n     trade between countries, such as negotiating investor \n     friendly double-taxation treaties and investment promotion \n     agreements. United States negotiators in multilateral forum \n     should take into account the objectives of this title. To the \n     extent any such agreements exist between the United States \n     and an African country, the President shall ensure that the \n     agreement is being implemented in a manner that maximizes the \n     positive effects for United States trade, export, and labor \n     interests as well as the economic development of the \n     countries in Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/10/senate-section/article/S7706-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. REID.
