Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 396, H.R. 2072.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072, a bill to \n     reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nEx-Im Bank bill. We are working on an agreement to begin consideration \nof the bill. I don't know if we can reach that, but we are trying.\n  At 4:30 today the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider two U.S. district judges from Maryland and Illinois. At 5:30 \nthere will be up to three rollcall votes. The first two will be on \nconfirmation of George Levi Russell and John J. Tharp, and the third \nwill be on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Ex-Im Bank bill.\n  There was a time when legislation that would reduce the deficit and \nsupport hundreds of thousands of jobs would fly through the Senate with \nbipartisan support but not so anymore. Instead, a worthy measure that \nwould support 300,000 American jobs--the Export-Import Bank--may stall \nin the Senate this evening. The holdup is more Republican \nobstructionism.\n  Tonight the Senate will vote on whether to end the filibuster of \nreauthorization of this most important legislation. The bank helps \nAmerican companies grow and sell their products overseas. Last year \nthis bank financed 3,600 private companies and added almost 300,000 \njobs in more than 2,000 American communities.\n  The last time the Senate considered this in legislation, it was \noffered by a Republican Senator and it passed by unanimous consent. \nWhat that means is it comes to the floor, sponsored by a Republican, \nand everybody agrees and we don't even have a vote here. It is done by \nunanimous consent. So it is unfortunate that I had to file cloture \nagain. I have filed cloture, cloture, cloture on so many different \nthings. We\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\nshouldn't have to argue over bipartisan proposals such as this one. It \nshould just pass as it has in the past. But I remain hopeful that we \ncan find a way to work together on it.\n  The Export-Import Bank has the support of two groups that rarely see \neye to eye--the chamber of commerce and labor unions. Today I got a \nletter from the National Association of Manufacturers, as did every \nother Senator. It says: The National Association of Manufacturers--we \nrefer to it as NAM--the largest manufacturing association in the United \nStates, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector in all 50 \nStates, urges us to support the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act.\n  The Export-Import Bank of the United States--referred to as the Ex-Im \nBank--is one of the only tools manufacturers in the United States have \nto counter hundreds of billions of dollars of export financing foreign \ngovernments offer to their exporters. In 2010 Canada, France, and India \nprovided 7 times and China and Brazil 10 times more export assistance \nas a share of GDP than did the United States. The Ex-Im Bank levels the \nplaying field for U.S. exporters by matching credit support other \nnations provide, ensuring that our Nation's manufacturers can compete \nbased upon the price and performance of their products. It also enables \nsmall and medium-sized manufacturers to capture new markets in emerging \neconomies abroad. In 2010 the bank supported more than $41 billion in \nexport sales from more than 3,600 companies, supporting approximately \n290,000 jobs here--rather than the 300,000 I said--export-related \nAmerican jobs.\n  Denying Ex-Im reauthorization will hurt manufacturers of every size \nand threaten thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Small and medium-\nsized companies are particularly vulnerable and those that receive \ndirect Ex-Im Bank support as well as those who supply larger companies. \nSo manufacturers urge your support of H.R. 2072, which authorizes the \nbank through September 2014 and provides a modest increase in its \nlending authority and enhances congressional oversight over the bank.\n\n  That letter was signed by one of the officers of the bank.\n  This legislation has Republican cosponsors. Why do we have to go \nthrough this endless procedural process? Why can't we just pass it, as \nwe have done in so many years past? They are saying: We want \namendments. Amendments to kill the bill after saying they support the \nbill?\n  The House passed this bill without amendment--I repeat, without \namendment--on a 330-to-93 vote last week. But that 93 kind of says it \nall. Ninety-three is the mainstay of the tea party caucus in the House. \nThey are opposed to everything, just as almost 50 percent of the Senate \nRepublicans are against everything. That is what we have here. Even \nthough there is outward support for this legislation, they want to kill \nthis bill. They don't want the government to have anything to do with \nour lives--period, nothing--which is unrealistic in this modern world \nand, in fact, in any world.\n  This legislation is exactly the kind of smart investment Congress \nmust make to keep the economy on the road to recovery, and it is the \nkind of consensus proposal that shouldn't require Democrats to have to \ntry to break a filibuster.\n  When Senate Democrats brought this reauthorization to the floor \npreviously--in fact, in March--we assumed it would pass by a strong \nbipartisan vote. Surprise was here--the Republicans voted against it. \nNearly unanimously they voted against it in March despite their public \nconfessions of support for it. Then a day or two after they voted no, \nthey sent me a letter saying: We have to get this done. So they voted \nagainst it in March, and now they are threatening to do it, for \ndifferent reasons this time: They don't have enough amendments. They \nwant amendments. So they are once again forcing us to run out the clock \non this measure, which expires at the end of this month.\n  Frankly, the behavior of my Republican colleagues over the last week \nhas been a little baffling. They say they support our efforts to keep \ninterest rates on Federal loans from doubling for 7 million college \nstudents. They voted the proposal down. Now, a few days later, they say \nthey support the Ex-Im Bank, but they voted it down once and they are \nthreatening to do it again.\n  With Republicans willing to use every obstructionist tactic in the \nbook--even some that are not in the book, even on bills they support--\nit is a wonder the Senate gets anything done at all.\n  Further delay would allow the bank's lending authority to lapse, \nputting jobs at risk. But there is still time for my colleagues on the \nother side to reverse course. There is still time to work together to \npass this measure.\n  I understand my Republican colleagues want to offer amendments to the \nbill. I have already said so. Their amendments generally would just \neliminate the bank--not make it stronger, not lessen it a little bit, \njust gut the Export-Import Bank, and some just eliminate it altogether. \nEven if those amendments weren't egregious, changing this legislation \nnow would only waste more time. And we have been told the House isn't \ngoing to accept any amendments. But why would we accept any amendment \nthat gets rid of the bank?\n  The process of reauthorizing this bank has taken months already. \nThere is really no reason to waste more time. American exporters are \ncounting on us to get something done this week. So I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will consider the consequences of yet another filibuster and \njoin Democrats to reauthorize this Export-Import Bank without delay.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 4:30 p.m., under the previous \norder, the Senate will proceed to executive session.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask I be permitted to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Arrest and Detention of Nambaryn Enkhbayar\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for about the past week I have been \nvery concerned and involved in a situation involving Mongolia. It is a \nsmall country. It has been a democratic country for the past 20 years. \nAt one time it was part of the Soviet bloc but no longer.\n  I have talked to many people at the State Department, the Vice \nPresident's office, the chairman of Brookings, the former Ambassador to \nMongolia. I come to the floor to address the situation of Mr. Nambaryn \nEnkhbayar, the former President of Mongolia from 2005 to 2009.\n  I was in Mongolia when he was President and had the opportunity to \nget to know him as a distinguished international statesman who, sadly, \nis facing so-called allegations of corruption in the country he led so \nwell and so long. Mr. Enkhbayar, in addition to being President of the \ncountry, was previously Prime Minister and has held many other \nleadership positions in government over the years. As President, he \ndesigned and effectively executed Mongolia's ``third neighbor'' policy \nof diversifying its diplomatic and economic relations beyond the strong \nties with its immediate neighbors, China and Russia.\n  Specifically, Mr. Enkhbayar personally emphasized relations with the \nUnited States; with our Asian allies such as Japan, Korea and \nAustralia; and with Europe.\n  At the request of the Bush Administration, he dispatched Mongolian \ntroops to fight alongside Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, held two \nsummits with President Bush and concluded Mongolia's Millennium \nChallenge pact in 2007.\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\n  Under his leadership, the Mongolian Government strengthened its \ninternational peace-keeping role with the United Nations, joined and \nthen took a leading role in the Community of Democracies, provided \nhumanitarian transit for North Korean refugees through Mongolia, and \ndeveloped important intelligence exchanges with American counterparts.\n  Domestically, Mr. Enkhbayar contributed to Mongolia's political \nmaturation with his graceful concession and cooperation after he lost \nhis re-election bid in the 2009 presidential election to Mr. Elbegdorj, \nthe current President of Mongolia. This smooth transition of the \npresidency from one party to another at that time did much to solidify \nthe foundations of democratic politics in the country.\n  Sadly, the atmosphere in Mongolia has become less conducive to such \nfair play this year, as Mongolia approaches an important parliamentary \nelection in June.\n  After retiring from politics with the end of his presidential term in \n2009, Mr. Enkhbayar re-entered the public arena again this year with \nthe formation of a third major party and the fielding of a slate of \ncandidates, including for himself, for the parliament.\n  Just as the campaigning for this election was starting in earnest a \nmonth ago, Mr. Enkhbayar was arrested under charges brought by the \nAnti-Corruption Agency of Mongolia, an organization established while \nhe was president.\n  It is important to say that building practices of good governance and \nchallenging corrupt practices form an important benchmark of \nachievement for any developing democracy. We should applaud vigorous \nefforts to combat corrupt practices in the country. That is needed.\n  But it is equally important that those fighting corruption avoid a \nsense of involvement in such practices themselves. Certainly, to say \nthe least, the bringing of charges against a political leader in the \nmidst of an important election campaign is unusual.\n  As extraordinary as the timing of the charges, the process of Mr. \nEnkhbayar's subsequent arrest and incarceration was of even more \nconcern.\n  Mr. Enkhbayar was ostensibly wanted for questioning, but on the \nevening and early morning of April 12 13, he was forcefully removed \nfrom his home by several hundred law enforcement officials and without \nany resistance on his part and then spirited away for confinement in a \nremote prison where all access was severely limited.\n  In incarceration, Mr. Enkhbayar suffered further indignities and \nirregularities of due process.\n  He had inadequate access to family and counsel. He reportedly \nreceived abusive verbal treatment. After initiating a ``dry hunger \nstrike'' without liquids to protest these circumstances--which is his \nright under international law as a prisoner--he was denied adequate \nmedical treatment and endured attempts to force feed him.\n  Only after his health was at risk, Mr. Enkhbayar was released on bail \nthis morning so he could receive the medical treatment he so \ndesperately needs.\n  It is my hope he will be well enough to continue with his campaign \nfor parliament.\n  Yet I am deeply concerned that he still may be charged with \ncorruption, allegations that have been deemed by one of his attorneys \nto be ``insubstantial, stale and petty.''\n  Our concern now should be, in the first instance, Mr. Enkhbayar's \nhealth and even his physical survival of this ordeal.\n  Secondly, we need to press for due process in the adjudication of his \ncase and ensure he is afforded his full rights to a speedy, transparent \nand fair hearing of the charges, with full legal assistance with his \ndefense.\n  We cannot be sure at this time that either of these considerations, \nthe minimum that is owed any citizen or any human being under the rule \nof law in a democracy, can be secured. So I call upon the authorities \nof Mongolia to announce that the procedures and schedule for \nadjudication of his case will proceed and that President Enkhbayar will \nbe accorded full due process rights to which he is entitled. To do less \nwould be to reinforce fears the process employed here is politically \ndriven and meant exclusively to remove Mr. Enkhbayar from participation \nin the parliamentary election now underway.\n  Finally, this brings me to a larger issue concerning fears for the \nfate of Mongolian democracy and for the now strong relationship between \nMongolia and the United States. Mongolia has been rightly acclaimed for \nthe extraordinary progress it has made in building democratic practices \nand institutions since the collapse of the Soviet Union 20 years ago. \nIndeed, Mongolia is the only successful, functioning democracy from the \nPacific Ocean to Eastern Europe through the entire expanse of inner \nAsia. A small country, due to its achievement, has become a country of \nlarge significance on the world stage--the best argument that a free \nand brave people can move their country from authoritarianism to \ndemocracy in a relatively short period of time. Having done so, \nMongolians have enjoyed an extraordinary degree of support and \nattention from the outside world, led by our country, the United \nStates.\n  The Mongolian-American relationship now encompasses Mongolia's \nimpressive economic potential as it develops its rich mineral resources \nwith the help of foreign partners, many of them American companies with \na strong interest in investment there. However, all this promise could \nbe negatively impacted by the emergence of the practices we have seen \nin the case of Mr. Enkhbayar.\n  The chill of intimidation is felt by every Mongolian citizen, for if \nsuch treatment can be applied to a former President and still popular \nleader, no one is safe. And then such harsh treatment tends to bring \nreciprocity, and the country is in danger of falling into a vicious \ncycle of political score settling. For the sake of Mongolia and the \nfuture of its people, the country's leaders must step away from this \nrisk immediately.\n  It is equally true that once having lost one's good reputation, it is \nalmost impossible to restore it. There is still time for Mongolia's \nauthorities to correct a dangerous turn of events probably no one \nexpected or wanted. There are many friends abroad, including this \nSenator, who pray they will do so. Should the troubling circumstance of \nMr. Enkhbayar's case continue, it would thereafter be impossible for \nMongolia's friends in America and around the world in other democracies \nto continue speaking with the hope, promise, and optimism for the \ncountry's future with which we have for the last two decades. Much is \nat stake in Mongolia now. Its political leaders and people have been \nwise and skillful in choosing the right course in many times of \nchallenges and crises in the past.\n  I call upon our friends there to help their country, their \nsupporters, and themselves by taking the humane and lawful actions that \nare needed now to reclaim their reputation at the forefront of the \ncommunities of democracies. I hope it has been obvious that I speak as \na friend--a concerned friend--but one who wishes Mongolia well.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Before I give my remarks, let me compliment the Senator from \nCalifornia not only on what she just said but on the remarks she made \non television yesterday concerning the danger to our country when \npeople leak information relating to our effort to defeat terrorists, \nwhich makes it all the more difficult for us to accomplish our job, and \nit undercuts the mission of the many men and women in the military, our \nintelligence services, and the civilian forces of government and, \nfrankly, in the governments of allies that are working very hard to \nidentify and prevent terrorism from occurring. When leaks such as this \noccur, it undercuts that effort tremendously. I thought the Senator \nfrom California did a very good job of pointing out how that is so and \nwhy we have to go after the people who are responsible.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I can't thank the Senator enough. I am very worried \nabout this leak. I was reading the London news clips, and as the \nSenator knows, I chair the Senate Intelligence Committee. I believe I \ncan speak for the leadership of both committees in saying we have not \nbeen briefed. This has been very closely held because of the \nseriousness of the operation. And to see what is now in the papers, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nessentially endangers the asset, puts him in fear of his life, tells \nour allies we cannot be trusted to carry out a mission without leaking \nthat mission and also thereby alerting al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula that they need to increase their security to prevent \npenetration--it is, I think, the most serious leak certainly in the \ntime I have been chairman of the committee.\n  I thank the Senator for raising it and for the Senator's solidarity \nin that belief.\n  Mr. KYL. I compliment the chair of the committee for her very wise \nremarks. I know the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, is in full \naccord. This is a very bipartisan effort. I hope we can succeed in \ngetting to the bottom of it.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to talk today a little bit about unemployment \nand the economy. There have been a lot of news stories--some very \nserious, as the one we just discussed, and some a little bit more \nfrivolous--that I think are distracting from what I believe is the top \ndomestic problem in the United States today, the lagging unemployment. \nI wish to focus on that today and what we could do about it versus what \nwe are or are not doing about it. There are troubling economic trends, \nand I think maybe we can make some recommendations to the President \nabout how we can help to get out of the ditch we are in.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has been claiming that the economy \nis continuing to heal and touting the latest jobs report, and I think \nthat misleads the American people, and here is why: It is true that by \ntheir measure the unemployment rate has declined from 8.2 percent to \n8.1 percent, but that doesn't represent progress if you look behind the \nnumbers. If you look behind the numbers and the actual employment data, \nemployers added only 115,000 jobs last month. That is less than the \n180,000 Wall Street was expecting and, more importantly, it is less \nthan the 150,000 jobs that have to be created each month to keep up \nwith the new entrants into the workforce, for example, the kids \ngraduating from college and high school who are entering the workforce. \nIn order to keep up with that number, about 150,000 per month, the \nprivate sector has to create that many jobs to stay at zero, and if it \ndoesn't, then we are actually getting behind.\n  The fact that we have had several straight months where there has \nbeen an actual increase in the number of jobs created doesn't measure \nthe success properly. We have to measure those months where job \ncreation was above 150,000, and in that case less than half of the \nmonths since the President has been in office have met that criteria. \nSo we are actually sliding backward, not moving forward.\n\n  Here is another way to look at the unemployment picture: There are so \nmany people who have given up looking for work under the Obama economy \nnow that they don't show up in the unemployment statistics. That is why \nthis number, 8.2 percent, actually goes down to 8.1 percent, not \nbecause there are a lot more people finding work but, rather, a whole \nlot more people have stopped looking for work so they are not counted \nin the unemployed looking for work.\n  In March, for example, there were about three people dropping out of \nthe system for every one job created. Think of that. In April the rate \nwas 4.5 dropouts per new job. So each month we are finding more and \nmore people are simply not looking for work. They are dropping out of \nthat group of people who wish to be employed and who are looking for \nwork. They have stopped so they don't show in the unemployment numbers.\n  In fact, in the month of April, 522,000 people dropped out of the \nlabor force. Remember, last month 115,000 jobs were created and some \npeople thought that was great. Well, it is nice that it was 115,000 and \nnot none, but the reality is if 522,000 people dropped out of the labor \nforce that same month, it shows there is not much to cheer about. What \nthat meant in terms of overall statistics was that a number that the \nLabor Department calls the labor force participation rate, which is how \nmany of the people who could be working here are actually working, \ndropped to 63.6 percent, which is the lowest level since 1981 when we \nwere headed into a big recession at that time. In other words, we have \nfewer people actually working in this country as a percentage of those \nwho could than at any time since 1981.\n  James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute said:\n\n       If the size of the labor force as a share of the total \n     population was the same as it was when Barack Obama took \n     office--65.7 then versus 63.6 today--the unemployment rate \n     would be 11.1 percent.\n\n  That is why you hear people say the real unemployment rate is not 8.1 \npercent, it is 11.1 percent. What that means is the more people who \ngive up looking for work, the better the official unemployment number \ngets, but it doesn't tell the real story. Pethokoukis also noted--and I \nam quoting:\n\n       If the participation rate just stayed where it was last \n     month, the unemployment rate would have risen to 8.4 percent!\n\n  So the unemployment rate is primarily a factor of how many people are \nstill looking for work. And if they have given up, then they don't show \nin these statistics anymore. This is very troubling because it also \nshows that Americans do not see their situation bettering; they don't \nhave a sense of optimism that things are getting better. There is a \nresignation beginning to be created here that things are not going to \nget better and there is no point in trying to look for work, and of \ncourse that has ramifications up and down the economy, a couple of \nwhich I will mention here.\n  Because there is this view that the economy is not continuing to \nheal, as the President said, we have got very sluggish economic growth. \nBack at the very same point in the Reagan recovery, the very same point \nthat President Obama is at right now, at that time economic growth was \n6.1 percent. Today it is 2.4 percent under the Obama economy.\n  Social Security disability claims are rising, and they are rising \ndramatically. What it shows is that instead of people continuing to \nlook for work, they are filing for disability, and a lot of them are \ngetting on disability. We have had a tremendous increase in disability \nclaims and determinations of disability in this country. More Americans \nare using food stamps than at any other point in our history. One out \nof two recent college graduates cannot find a job or is underemployed \nfor their skill.\n  I gave a commencement address on Saturday and talked to some of the \nstudents about what they were going to be doing. Most of them had \nsomething to do, but a lot of kids do not have a job even though they \nhave spent 4, 5, or 6 years and untold thousands of dollars getting a \ncollege education.\n  Senator Thune recently noted that the poverty rate among women has \nreached a 17-year high, and that there are nearly 700,000 fewer women \nworking today than when President Obama took office. I don't mean to \ndivide this into gender or any other kind of group, but the reality is \nthat groups in this country suffer when we have poor economic growth \nand are not creating enough jobs. If you want to get it right down to \nwhat kind of people are having a problem, here is a situation: 700,000 \nfewer women working today than when President Obama took office. There \nare 22.8 million Americans who remain unemployed or underemployed or \nwho are only marginally attached to the workforce. These are 22.8 \nmillion Americans who could be working productively, and if they were, \nour economy would be doing much better. Guess what would also be \nhappening. People would be earning income and paying income taxes, the \ngovernment would have more revenue, and we would be better able to \nafford all of the things the American people expect of the government.\n\n  The number of long-term unemployed has increased by 89 percent under \nthe Obama administration. These are the people who have been out of \nwork for a long period of time--at least 6 months and many of them more \nthan a year. And all of this as the cost of living for middle-income \nAmericans soars. For example, worker health insurance has gone up 23 \npercent, even after ObamaCare. Gas prices are now about $4 a gallon. \nThey have doubled since President Obama took office. Home values \nnationwide have plunged by 14 percent in my State of Arizona, and in \nmany places it is by 50 percent.\n  So instead of creating a to-do list for the Senate, as the President \nhas done\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\njust 6 months before the election--asking us to vote on what a lot of \npeople call show votes and dividing the country by pitting one group \nagainst another--I urge the President to make some real steps to steady \nthe economy and reassure the job creators.\n  Let me give four specific examples of what the President could do to \nlead and what I think Congress would be willing to do to follow.\n  First of all--and a couple of these things are to stop doing \nsomething that is bad. A lot of people say government can usually do \nbest by just getting out of the way because we have a very robust \nprivate sector if it is not too tied down with government regulation \nand taxation. So the first suggestion I have is let's stop the largest \ntax increase that will automatically occur--it is the largest tax \nincrease in the history of our country--on January 1.\n  Someone may say: What? I didn't hear about that.\n  I am speaking about the so-called Bush tax cuts. Ten years ago \nCongress passed these tax cuts, but they had a limit of 10 years. \nActually, it was a shorter period than that. They were extended 2 years \nago because the President said it would be bad for the economy if these \ntax rates were allowed to go up, and he was right. He was right then, \nand he is right today. It would be bad for the economy. It would be bad \nfor businesses, especially small businesses. It would be bad for the \nAmerican family. Yet, automatically, if Congress does not act and the \nPresident does not act, every one of the marginal income tax rates will \ngo up. Things such as the marriage tax penalty, the child tax credit, \nthe capital gains rate, dividends tax rate, the death tax rate--all of \nthese combined will go up, resulting in the largest increase in the \ncountry.\n  When we consider economic growth, when we talk about a wet blanket or \nwhen we talk about something that will kill economic recovery, that \nkind of a tax increase, which means taking money out of the private \nsector and giving it to government, is about the worst medicine one \ncould think of. So my hope is that the President will lead and Congress \nwill provide the support necessary to extend our current Tax Code and \nto ensure we don't have the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry.\n  I mentioned taxation and regulation. Well, regulation is No. 2. Over \n28,000 pages of new Federal regulations have been added to the books in \njust this calendar year. Think about that--28,000 pages. We think of \ngoing to the store and buying a book of 200 pages, or 300 pages if it \nis a really big one. How about 28,000 pages of new Federal regulations \njust this year.\n  Bureaucracies such as the National Labor Relations Board and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency continue to churn out rules and \nregulations that confuse job creators and hamper their ability to \nexpand and hire. One example: Because of a public outcry, it was \nfinally decided that the Department of Labor won't issue regulations \nbasically saying that kids couldn't work on the family farm. Many of us \nworked on family farms. Maybe we didn't like it at the time, but we all \nagree it did us a lot of good. The reality is that it is not something \nthe Federal Government ought to be poking its nose into. So there was \nfinally enough political push-back from the FFA and the 4 H Clubs and \nthe Farm Bureau and really everybody who was sensible about looking at \nit that they pulled it back. But unless the American people apply \npressure and push back against this stuff, bureaucrats and the Federal \nGovernment are going to continue to figure that they can run our lives \nbetter than we can do it ourselves.\n  One of the biggest burdens in terms of regulations is ObamaCare. It \nhas made the regulatory state much bigger and much more expansive. It \nhas resulted in an estimated 58.5 million annual paperwork hours, \naccording to the American Action Forum--58.5 million annual paperwork \nhours. I have talked to businessmen and I have talked to medical \noffices and so on, and they are going nuts trying to figure out how to \ndeal with all of these new regulations.\n  The House of Representatives has passed numerous bills that would \nreduce the regulatory burden Washington imposes on the economy, but the \nPresident and the Senate Democratic leadership have refused to bring \nthose to the Senate floor. So that is the second thing we could do.\n  It all boils down to this: We should rely more on the power of \nfreedom than on the power of government. If we do, the American people \nwill do the rest. So let's stop this biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country. Let's stop issuing these burdensome \nregulations.\n  How about the third thing: American energy. We could be one the most \nenergy-wealthy countries in the world--if not the most--just taking \nadvantage of our own resources. We would no longer have to be dependent \non the Middle East for our sources of energy. But unfortunately, here, \ntoo, the President and Senate Democrats have repeatedly pursued tax \nincreases on the oil and gas industries, raised the cost of gasoline, \nand increased our dependence on foreign oil, according to the \nCongressional Research Service--the nonpartisan entity that looks into \nthese things when we ask them.\n  Instead of basing an energy strategy on punitive tax hikes, we think \nit would be better if the President would just work with us and work \nwith the House of Representatives to expand the development of domestic \nresources offshore, on our Federal lands, in Alaska. We have plenty of \noil and gas and we have plenty of other kinds of reserves of energy \nthat could make this country not just no longer dependent on the Middle \nEast but much wealthier than we are today. Part of that is just simply \napproving the Keystone Pipeline. This isn't even American resources; it \nis in Canada. They meet all of their environmental requirements. It \ndoesn't damage the environment here in the United States. They have \nalready done the environmental reviews for the pipeline. There are \nthousands of pipelines crisscrossing our country. This pipeline is not \ngoing to create an environmental problem. The President has said that \nthe part that goes from Oklahoma down to Texas is fine with him but not \nthe part that requires EPA's go-ahead.\n\n  So that is the third thing. Let's have an energy policy that takes \nadvantage of what we have, including approving the Keystone Pipeline.\n  Finally, what the President and our Democratic friends here in the \nSenate could do is to join the House of Representatives and clear the \ndeck of all of the legislation that has been piling up here on the \nSenate floor that isn't getting done that we all know has to get done \nbefore the end of the year. These are not optional. This is our \nhomework. This is stuff we have to do, and it is all being put aside \nfor the lameduck session.\n  The lameduck session is the time in between the election when new \nMembers of Congress have been elected and the time they are sworn in--\nessentially at the end of the first week in November to the first week \nin January. I will be a lame duck; I am not running for reelection. I \nwould rather the new Senator from my State make the decisions about the \nfuture of the country, but because all of these things are piling up, I \nwill be one of the people here making these decisions for the future of \nour country. I don't mind being here, but it will be very bad for the \ncountry to pile up all of these things and expect to get them done \nsmartly in the 5 or 6 weeks that surround Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n  What are some of these things? First of all, just funding the \ngovernment--the appropriations bills. Nobody expects we are going to \ncomplete work on all of the appropriations bills to run the government, \nas a result of which we will have to, at the end of the year, pile a \nwhole bunch of bills into what have been called Omnibus appropriations \nbills--``omnibus'' meaning we throw everything into the same pot. The \nproblem with that, coupled with the fact that the Senate hasn't \napproved a budget in 3 years and won't approve a budget this year, \npresumably, is that nothing is prioritized; it is just basically a \ncontinuation of the spending from years past. So we are not making the \ncritical decisions about dropping this and adding this that would \nprovide more sensible funding of our Federal Government. So that is the \nfirst thing we ought to be doing, and that leads me to the second \nthing.\n  We have been borrowing so much money that it is very clear we are \ngoing to once again run up against the\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\ndebt ceiling. We have borrowed so much that we have to increase the \ndebt ceiling in order to pay the money we have borrowed. Nobody likes \nto do it. Nobody likes to say they voted to increase the debt ceiling. \nWell, then, why vote to incur the debt in the first place? Oh, we have \nno trouble doing that--at least some Members in this body and in the \nHouse don't--but the reality is that when those people have incurred \nthat much spending, we have to pay the debt, and that means the debt \nceiling has to be raised. When will this come to pass? Right after the \nelection. We wouldn't want to take it up before the election. It might \nremind the American people about how much--too much--we are spending. \nForty cents on every dollar we spend in this country we had to borrow. \nSo the debt ceiling is something we are going to have to deal with.\n  Here is one of the biggest of all: sequestration. We agreed in the \nBudget Control Act last year that we would save about $1 trillion over \n10 years on discretionary spending and we would try to save another \n$1.5 trillion in mandatory spending--the so-called entitlement programs \nthat are really costing us big bucks, including Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security, and there is a whole variety of other programs that \nare included in entitlement spending. Nobody is talking about ending \nthese programs as we know them. What politician is going to call for an \nend to Social Security or Medicare? That is not what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about effectuating savings. There is a huge \namount of waste and fraud and abuse that everybody acknowledges. We \ncould save billions of dollars in all of these programs, and we need to \ndo that.\n  We need to save $1.2 trillion, which is the actual amount required by \nlaw, over 10 years. When we subtract interest, that comes out to about \n$908 billion or $918 billion--I have forgotten which--each year. So \nsome of us have introduced legislation to pay for this $900-plus \nbillion for next year, to offset with spending reductions the cost of \nthis sequestration. ``Sequestration'' is a fancy word for across-the-\nboard spending cuts. Half of them go directly to the Department of \nDefense, and the other half are spread all across the other programs in \nour budget, from education, housing, you name it. Well, does it make \nsense to just take a meat ax and lop off the top 10 percent or top 12 \npercent or whatever it might be of the spending in all of these \ndifferent programs? Would we want to buy four-fifths of an airplane in \nthe military? Does that make sense or does it make more sense to save \n$10 here so we can spend $10 over here? Obviously, it makes more sense \nto do that.\n  Everybody assumes that somehow we are going to avoid sequestration in \nthe lameduck session of Congress. Who is doing anything about it? Well, \nsome of us have introduced legislation. Also, we hope that this week in \nthe House of Representatives they will be able to amend the Defense \nauthorization bill by adding a provision that says the numbers in that \nbill assume we have resolved this sequestration problem as a way to \nbegin negotiations so we can find a solution that both Houses will \nagree to and both political parties will agree to. This shouldn't be \npartisan. Everybody loses if sequestration occurs. So let's solve that \nproblem, and let's solve it before we get to the lameduck session. That \nis the third thing we can do.\n  Everybody familiar with our Tax Code knows there is a fourth thing. \nWe have something that happens each year. There are 60 provisions in \nthe Tax Code that expire every year. We have to renew them, and we do, \nso let's get about it. They have already expired. These are the so-\ncalled tax extenders--extending certain provisions of the Tax Code that \neverybody wants to see extended. They have already expired. We need to \ndo it retroactively the first of the year. Everybody knows we are going \nto extend most of them; maybe we won't do all of them. We need to do \nthat, so why not? Let's get that done.\n  We know there are other things that are occurring. There is something \ncalled the doc fix. Each year we have to figure out how to pay the \ndoctors who take care of Medicare patients. It costs a lot of money. If \nwe don't pay them, we are not going to have any doctors who will take \ncare of Medicare patients. So it is always a dance: Well, we have to \nfigure out how to pay the doctors. The reality is that if we don't pay \nthem, then we only have ourselves to blame when our senior citizens \ncan't find a doctor to take care of them when they need that care.\n  There are others as well. The payroll tax holiday expires, and there \nare many others we need to do as part of our business as \nRepresentatives and Senators. This isn't optional. These have to be \ndone to keep the government running, the things we promised our \nconstituents in legislation that we would do.\n  So another suggestion is let's start working on these big problems. \nMany of us who will be in a lameduck position are putting a letter \ntogether to our leadership asking them to please tackle these big \nproblems. We should not be voting on a lot of these things. We should \nbe done as of the end of the year. But if we have to, we will. It is \nnot that we are not ready for the work. It is that these things should \nbe done before the election.\n\n  This is my last point. You ask, why, if these are things we are \nsupposed to do--the appropriations; dealing with the Tax Code, because \nit will automatically have a big tax increase if we do not; the \nsequestration; the debt ceiling; paying the doctors--if we have to do \nall of these things, why are we putting them off?\n  Well, here is the dirty little secret. Because if we actually tackled \nthem, we would have to make some tough decisions. If we made tough \ndecisions, we would have to take votes. If we take votes, those votes \nare going to be on the record. And if those votes are on the record \nbefore the election, our constituents will know what we think and how \nwe act, and some of them may not like it.\n  So we do not want to be on the record, some of my colleagues say. \nAgain, it does not bother me; I am not running for reelection. We do \nnot want to be on the record before the election. It is a little bit \nlike when the President leaned over to then-President of Russia Dmitry \nMedvedev and he said: Look, after my last election, I will have a lot \nmore flexibility to deal with these issues. You tell Vladimir.\n  Well, after the election it is too late. The people have cast their \nballots. Shouldn't the politicians be willing to say before the \nelection what they stand for? And instead of making campaign promises, \nhow about taking votes on real issues so the American people know where \nthey stand? Then they can make an informed judgment: I like this person \nover that person because I like the way this person voted or I do not \nlike the way that person voted.\n  That is what democracy is supposed to be all about. You make the \ntough decisions. You stand for election. The people either say yes or \nno. Then, by the way, they hold you in account. After you are elected, \nthey continue to watch how you vote to decide whether they want to vote \nfor you again. But in this day and age, we are playing hide the ball \nfrom the American people: Let's do not bring anything up until after \nthe election. That way the American people will not see how we feel \nabout these things.\n  Some of these are tough votes, I acknowledge. It is hard to figure \nout how to effectuate savings. If you have to come up with $100 billion \nin savings over 10 years, something has to go. So you cannot promise \neverything to everybody. You actually have to find $100 billion in \nsavings somewhere.\n  Senator McCain and I and Senators Cornyn and Ayotte and Rubio and \nGraham and some others have introduced legislation to say: Here is how \nwe would do it. If somebody has a different way of looking at it, tell \nus.\n  I will tell you the way we would do it. You can save $100 billion by \ndoing two things. When people leave government employment, instead of \nhiring somebody to replace them, we would hire two people for every \nthree who leave. The Bowles-Simpson Commission says only hire one for \nevery three who leave. So we are being a lot more liberal than Bowles-\nSimpson. We say, every time three people leave the government, let's \nonly hire two back. I bet we could get by as a country doing that. The \nother thing is, the President froze increases in Federal salaries, and \nwe would simply extend that freeze through the middle of 2014.\n  There are other ways to do it. There are hundreds of billions of \ndollars to be\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nsaved. If you have a better idea, we are all for it, but at least come \nup with something and do not be afraid to vote. The American people are \npretty smart. They get this stuff, and they know there is no free \nlunch. They know that government costs money, and they know you cannot \nsave money by continuing to promise everything to everybody.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the leadership in \nboth the House and the Senate, let's get serious about this. First of \nall, let's not raise taxes. Let's reduce regulations. Let's have a real \nenergy policy. Let's get our work done--the work we know has to be \ndone. And let's get it done as soon as we can. That would give families \nand businesses the knowledge of how to plan for the future. That would \nhelp them understand what they have to deal with and not have to incur \nthis huge uncertainty, which is so much of a drag on our economy today.\n  These are four constructive suggestions. There is a lot more we could \ndo. But when our economy is in as bad a shape as it is right now--and \nit is not getting much better; we have this many people not even \nlooking for work anymore--we need to do something more than be out on \nthe campaign hustings talking small ball and trying to blame it on the \nother side.\n  Let's get to work, follow these four ideas, and I think we could make \ntremendous progress to get our country moving again. Frankly, if we \ndid, I think the American people would reward us. They would say: Thank \nyou. Thanks for finally doing something. That is what we sent you there \nfor, and we will reward you for it. So ironically, good policy turns \nout to be good politics. I think we need a little bit more good policy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nenter into a colloquy with my colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, by now, it should come as no \nsurprise that the Senate has not passed a budget in over 3 years. I \nbelieve it has been 1,111 days. When I go to back to Wisconsin--and I \nthink it is probably true of my colleagues--the people of Wisconsin, \nand I think the people all over America, want us to work together and \nsolve our debt and deficit issue. Since I have been here, the \nRepublicans have fulfilled the responsibility to show what the plan is \nfor stabilizing our debt and deficit. The House passed a budget in the \nlast 2 years, but the Democrats in the Senate have not. It is because \nthey simply refuse to be held accountable. That is a real shame.\n  I realize the American public wants us to work with each other, but \nmy suggestion is that the first individuals who need to work with each \nother, the first compromise that needs to be done is with our \nDemocratic colleagues in this Chamber. They have 53 percent, and they \nonly need 51 to pass a budget. They need to get together and work \ntogether, and they need to hammer out a compromise and pass a budget. \nThe way that we get together and compromise in the entire process is \nthe House budget would be presented with the Senate budget, we would do \na conference, and we would have a process for being able to compromise. \nThat is the basic minimum of what I think needs to be done in the \nSenate.\n  One point I want to make is that President Obama has made a number of \npromises during his administration, and one I will talk about now is on \nFebruary 23, 2009. In his opening remarks to the fiscal responsibility \nsummit, the President stated:\n\n       Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half \n     by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. \n     It will require us to make difficult decisions and face \n     challenges we have long neglected. But I refuse to leave our \n     children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means \n     taking responsibility right now in this administration for \n     getting our spending under control.\n\n  I point out that when he made those remarks, the most recent estimate \nfor what the deficit would be in fiscal year 2009 was put forward by \nCBO on January 7, 2009. They were estimating that the deficit for that \nyear would be $1.186 trillion or 1.2 rounded up. Half of that amount \nwould be $593 billion. That is the promise President Obama made to this \nNation in terms of the work he would put in and what he would deliver \nto our Nation in terms of deficit control.\n  The facts are far different. In 2009, largely because of the very \npartisan stimulus package the President passed, the deficit wasn't $1.2 \ntrillion, it was $1.4 trillion. That was followed in 2010 by $1.29 \ntrillion. Then in fiscal 2011, it was $1.3 trillion. The latest CBO \nestimate for deficit for this year will be $1.253 trillion, almost $1.3 \ntrillion. That is double what the President promised he would be \ndelivering to the American people in terms of deficit control.\n  Moving forward, this President in his budget is projecting increasing \nour debt from $15 trillion to over $25 trillion. I am not sure that is \nbelievable. The other quote of his was on September 26, 2011, in \nremarks at a DNC fundraiser in San Diego when he was trying to sell his \nAmericans Job Act. He said the following:\n\n       What I have said is that this is a very simple principle \n     that everybody should understand. Warren Buffett's secretary \n     should not pay a lower tax rate than Warren Buffett. A \n     teacher making $50,000 a year, or a firefighter making \n     $50,000 a year, or $60,000, should not be paying a higher tax \n     rate than somebody making $50 million a year. And that basic \n     principle of fairness, if applied to our Tax Code, could \n     raise enough money that not only do we pay for our jobs \n     bill--\n\n  And here is the key quote:\n\n     --we would also stabilize our debt and deficits for the next \n     decade.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know what you call that last statement, but I \nthink it could be called a doozy. I think the President has a very \nserious responsibility not to mislead the American public. I think that \nstatement was a gross violation of that duty.\n  I have one chart here, a simple one. It shows the 4-year deficit \nfigures for the last 3 administrations. Here's Bush's first 4-year \nadministration, which is a $.8 trillion total deficit in 4 years. In \nthe second 4 years, it is $1.2 trillion in deficit spending. This \nPresident will accumulate $5.3 trillion in deficit spending in his 4 \nyears. Four years of the Buffett rule--that tax President Obama said \nwould stabilize the debt and deficit--would be $20 billion. I realize \nthe people in the gallery probably cannot see that line on the chart, \nbut it is obviously not enough to stabilize the debt and deficit.\n  I think the President has the obligation and duty not to mislead the \nAmerican public. That is what he did in this case.\n  Senator Corker has been a real leader on this issue in terms of being \na real hawk in trying to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. I \nwonder if he has any comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments, and I \nsee the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Wyoming here also.\n  Look, I think the No. 1 responsibility we have in the U.S. Senate is \nto pass a budget and to lay out for the American people how we are \ngoing to spend the resources that come in. The last time we passed a \nbudget was 1,111 days ago, and we spent over $10 trillion of the U.S. \ntaxpayer money during that time.\n  To be honest, I have quit voting for any spending bills--any spending \nbills--until we come to a point in time where we at least lay out for \nthe American people how much of their money we are going to spend and \nwhat we are going to spend it on.\n  Again, each year we have $3.5 trillion to $3.6 trillion being spent \nby the Federal Government with no plan. I am embarrassed for this body, \ncandidly, that we have not even tried to take up a budget. I know that \nthe committee itself began to take one up a few weeks ago, and the \nchairman was asked not to do it because it made no sense to do a budget \nat this time. Thankfully, the Parliamentarian ruled in this body that \nit was appropriate for us to take up a budget. Again, I cannot imagine \na greater shirking of our responsibility than to not lay out to the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\npeople exactly where their dollars are going.\n\n  What worries me most is that this is the greatest transference of \nwealth from these pages--from their generation to my generation--that \nhas existed in modern history in this country. There is a tremendous \ntransference of wealth as we do not deal with the issues of Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. What we are doing is actually piling up \ntremendous amounts of indebtedness so that the people of America will \nlike us more as politicians, as we don't make difficult decisions and \ndon't have to wrestle with the fiscal issues that we have as a Nation.\n  This is the thing that is ailing Western democracies around the \nworld. We are seeing this play out, obviously, in Europe right now, as \ncitizens are rising up in protest over having to deal with the tough \nissues of the day. There has been this grand bargain in Western \ndemocracies--ours being one--where politicians have given citizens what \nthey wish without asking them to pay for it.\n  I think we all understand that this is up now. We have a dilemma in \nthis Nation. We have a dilemma around the world right now because of \nour inability to deal with this issue. So in the process, what we are \ndoing is basically transferring wealth from that generation to my \ngeneration. It is absolute generational theft. I think it speaks to the \ngreatest vulnerability we have as a Nation.\n  If you speak to all of our national security analysts or you speak to \nanybody in this body, we know our greatest threat is not what is \nhappening in China, it is not what is happening in Iran, it is not what \nis happening in Syria, but the greatest threat to this Nation is us, \nourselves. For some reason, this body has chosen to totally shirk our \nresponsibilities as they relate to dealing with this issue.\n  I know over the next couple of weeks we are going to have the \nopportunity to vote on some budget resolutions. I agree with the \nSenator from Wisconsin. I hope there will be at least some way this \nbody can come together and present a budget for debate. If not, I know \nthere will be alternatives put forward. Again, this is the greatest \nthreat to our Nation; that is, our inability to show the kind of \ndiscipline we need to show as a Nation. Our country's greatness is \ndissipating as we continue to shovel this under the rug and not deal \nwith it. I do hope the Senate at some point soon will rise and deal \nwith the major responsibilities we have in this Nation, and that is \nputting our country on sound footing.\n  I will close with this. I don't think there is anything we can do \nthat would cause our economy to lift off more quickly than for people \nin this Nation and around the world to know that we actually have dealt \nwith progrowth tax reform and entitlement reform, and passing longer \nterm budgets and discretionary caps that would put this Nation on sound \nfooting. I believe the economy would take off. I hope that is what we \nrise to do before the end of this year.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague and great friend from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. It \nis interesting, because there are four of us on the floor right now--\nthe Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, and myself. We have one thing in common. Every one of us \nhas run a business. Every one of us was in business before we came to \nthe Senate. So we know when we are talking about new taxes--which is \nall we hear from the administration--that is not going to help this \neconomy grow, because our small businesses are scared to death out \nthere.\n  I know because I have heard the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Wisconsin, who came straight out of a business and who ran \nfor the Senate because he was so frustrated in business--we know that \nsmall business people out there today are looking at the increased \ntaxes that are already in place with the Obamacare added taxes and \nsurtaxes that have already been passed by the Democrats in Congress, \nwithout one single Republican vote. Those taxes are already on board to \nincrease, plus you have the fines they are facing if they don't have \nthe government-prescribed plan for the Obama health care plan. They are \ngoing to have to pay fines on top of the surtaxes to pay for the bill \nthey are not going to be able to use. Then they are looking at the \nregulations that are coming out of this administration and saying: And \nCongress wants to spend another trillion dollars this year?\n  Every one of us knows we are looking at hitting the debt ceiling \nagain--over $16 trillion--this fall, because this administration will \nnot even consider lower taxes and lower spending levels. So I look at \nall of us on the Senate floor right now who have been in business, who \nhave run a business, who have met that payroll, who have met the \nregulatory environment, and I think: Why on Earth don't we listen to \nthe small businesspeople of this country and in this body and do what \nthey do every year--pass a budget?\n\n  The Senator from Wyoming is here, and I would just ask if he has an \nidea of when was the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I would tell my colleague from Texas, who has \nbeen a leader in this fight asking for a budget, demanding a budget, as \nof today it has been 1,111 days since the Senate passed a budget, in \nspite of the law that says they must do so by April 15 of each year. So \nApril 15 came and went this year, as it did last year and the year \nbefore, and yet there is no budget.\n  So I look to the leadership of the Senator from Texas, who knows how \nthe hard-working families in her State and the hard-working families of \nmy State resent the fact that Washington refuses to be accountable. The \nDemocrats in this body refuse to be accountable to the American people.\n  All the American people are asking for, in my view, is value for \ntheir money. They want to make sure the money they send to Washington \nis being spent effectively and efficiently, and they are actually \ngetting value for their money.\n  I assume that is what my colleague is hearing from Texas as well.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, of course. And the spending issue is very \ninteresting. I look to my colleague from Tennessee, who is really one \nof the deficit hawks in the Senate, and when I look at the statistics \nthat are being put out about the entitlement spending, the entitlement \nspending today is over 50 percent of our spending every year--mandatory \nspending. In 10 years it is going to be 75 percent of the spending in \nthis country.\n  So I would ask my friend from Tennessee--because he has been pure on \nthis issue, being the deficit hawk he is--how would we be able to solve \nthe spending problem of this country without addressing Social \nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid--mandatory spending--which will be at \n75 percent of the budget in 10 years if we continue at this rate?\n  Mr. CORKER. I know the Senator from Texas spends a tremendous amount \nof time on appropriations issues and knows a great deal about this, and \nshe knows more than me if we wiped out all discretionary spending--\nwhich this year will be capped at $1.47 trillion--we still wouldn't \nwipe out the budget deficit.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. We could do away with all \ndefense spending, all educational spending, all research and \ndevelopment, and we could still not cause our budget not to have a \ndeficit. Let me give a stat--and I talk about this a lot back home, and \nI am so glad the Senator has given me this opportunity.\n  The average American worker earns $43,500 today. So in a two-wage-\nearner family, that is $87,000. Over their lifetime, in today's \ndollars, that family will pay into the Medicare Program $119,000, and \nthat includes the part the employer pays on their behalf. So between \nwhat they pay in and the employer--and the Senator from Texas has been \nan employer before and knows about paying the Medicare taxes into the \nsystem--that combined amount of money for the average American family \nis $119,000 in today's dollars. That same family, if they retired, \nwould take out of the system, over their lifetime, $357,000. Now think \nabout that. That is in today's dollars. Again, $119,000 going into \nMedicare on their behalf and $357,000 coming out of Medicare.\n  I think most people in this body--even people who haven't been in \nbusiness--realize we cannot make that up\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nwith volume. Yet volume is on the way. There are 20 million more \nAmericans over this next decade who are going to be part of that same \nformula--$119,000 in and $357,000 out.\n  I have been quoting these stats every year, and the numbers get \nfurther and further apart every quarter.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to ask the Senator from Tennessee, because he \nbrought this up, not only is it so clear there is more going out than \ncoming back in, what would he say to the fact we also--not we, because \nhe, along with myself and the Senator from Wyoming--voted against the \nObama health care bill, but interestingly, with those numbers the \nSenator just quoted, that bill cuts $500 billion more out of Medicare \nto pay for that overdraft the Senator is talking about. He was talking \nabout a generational change as well. Oh, my goodness.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, $529 billion, to be exact. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming has brought out over and over the unsustainable growth \nproblem we have, meaning every year we come to this cliff with \nphysicians--and he is a physician and used to practice on a daily \nbasis--and instead of dealing with that issue over a decade, which \nwould have cost about $300 billion, instead, we swept that issue under \nthe rug and took the full $529 billion to help create this entitlement.\n  I think most people in this body know there is no way this bill is \ngoing to work the way it is laid out; that the costs are going to be \nsubstantially more because in a free enterprise system, people act on \ntheir own behalf, in their own self-interest. The subsidies are so high \nfor families up to $88,000 a year, the penalty is so low, what is going \nto happen is we are going to have millions and millions of people out \non this program far beyond the projections that have been laid out.\n  So anyway, because we are talking about Social Security and Medicare, \nall of us want it to be solvent. That is what we want to see. We want \nto make sure Medicare and Social Security are here for generations down \nthe road. But we all know--the Medicare trustee has said so--it is \ngoing to be insolvent by the year 2024.\n  One way to do deal with it is to put our heads in the sand and just \nlet it happen in the years after we are gone, let it happen to the good \ncitizens of this country. Another solution is to recognize: Hey, this \nis a big ship, and we need to turn it a little in another direction so \nthese young people sitting in front of us don't have to carry the tab.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am so pleased the Senator from Tennessee brought \nthat up because there is a way for us to at least fix one of the \nentitlements in a relatively painless way, and that is Social Security. \nIt is going to have a few changes that some people will not like, but \nit could be so gradual if we do it now. We could simply raise the age 3 \nmonths a year.\n\n  In the bill I have proposed--and there are others that are equally as \ngood, although none of them have been taken up--it would say: If you \nare 59 years old, you wouldn't have any change at all. If you are 58, \nyou would retire 3 months later. So it would be very gradual. If we do \nthat, and adjust the cost-of-living increase, we would not have to \nraise any social security taxes, we would not cut the core benefits at \nall, and we could gradually ease into a system that would be solvent \nfor 75 years. Then our elderly, who need Social Security, will have it \nthere.\n  That is a proposal on the table now. But what is happening in \nCongress? And where is the leadership from the White House? Nothing. \nNothing.\n  I am going to turn to the Senator from Wyoming because he is one of \nthe two actual physicians in the Senate, and he knows more about the \nObama health care system. When we look at what the Obama health care \nsystem is doing to Medicare--cutting it $\\1/2\\ trillion--and then this \nSocial Security issue we have discussed, the overall Medicare issue the \nSenator from Tennessee addressed, and what the Senator from Wisconsin \nhas brought out in his charts--and he has been the real hands-on, most \nrecently experienced small businessperson--I would ask the real doctor \nin this body: What is going to happen if the Supreme Court doesn't save \nAmerica by throwing out the individual mandate on constitutional \ngrounds and we actually have the implementation of ObamaCare, with the \ntaxes and fines that are going to come in on January 1 of next year if \nwe don't act? Where are we going to be in health care in this country?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would tell my colleague and friend from Texas, who is \na wonderful student of this as well, this health care law is bad for \npatients, it is bad for providers--the doctors and nurses who take care \nof those patients--and it is terrible for taxpayers, who are going do \nget stuck footing the bill. So it is not a surprise this administration \ndoesn't want to come to the Senate, is embarrassed to come to the \nSenate with a budget, because they know the American people would be so \noffended by the irresponsibility and the nature of such a budget.\n  That is the situation we find ourselves in now. As both my colleagues \nhave said, they took $500 billion from Medicare--and not to save \nMedicare, not to strengthen Medicare--to start a whole new government \nprogram for someone else. That is why when I travel the State of \nWyoming and I talk to seniors, they say they don't like this health \ncare law. It is why the health care law is even more unpopular today \nthan it was the day it was passed.\n  But I do notice our colleague from Wisconsin has a new chart I am \ntrying to read from here, and so I will ask if he could share with us \nwhat is on that chart so that everyone gets a chance to see it and hear \nthe explanation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I came \nprepared with charts, and a number of things that have already been \nmentioned by my colleagues I am ready for.\n  We are talking about the true cost of the health care law. When this \nwas passed--and I actually grossed up these figures because they \nactually netted out--the savings of Medicare with new spending in \nMedicare, the way ObamaCare was originally going to be paid for was \nabout $1.3 trillion to cover about $1.1 trillion in outlays. That was \nsplit up in basically two ways: about $590 billion in taxes, fees, and \npenalties, and then $665 billion in reductions in Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Medicare Advantage.\n  Now, we have not imposed the $208 billion of the doc fix, the \nsustainable growth rate formulas, because even Washington realized if \nwe reduce payments to providers, there will be less access for seniors. \nSo I guess I don't have any reason to believe those cuts in Medicare \nwill actually occur.\n  If we move the budgetary window forward to the timeframe when \nObamaCare truly kicks in--because, initially, by the way, we had 10 \nyears of revenue and only 6 years of outlays. But really we only had 4 \nyears of full outlays. If we move the budget window forward, the true \ncost of ObamaCare over a 10-year window is $2.4 trillion, and that is a \nvery minimal estimate. That is very conservative. If we don't impose \nMedicare cuts, and we only grow the taxes, fees, and penalties--about \n$816 billion--that leaves a $1.6 trillion deficit risk over 10 years.\n  We are talking about these deficits now that for 4 years have been \n$1.4 trillion, $1.3 trillion, and $1.3 trillion, $1.3 trillion. We are \ntrying to close a $1.3 trillion deficit with about $1 trillion worth of \ndiscretionary spending. The other graph I had--and this plays into what \nthe earlier part of the conversation was--reflects the 1960s, when 68 \npercent of our expenditures were appropriated. They were under some \ncontrol in Congress. And 32 percent were the mandatory programs and \ninterest. Currently, about 36 percent of government expenditures are \nappropriated and 64 percent are basically off-budget, on automatic \npilot.\n  As the Senator from Texas pointed out, 10 years forward, only about \n25 percent of our Federal budget will be appropriated--will be \ndiscretionary spending. Everything else is on automatic pilot. That is \nsimply not sustainable.\n  The last graph I want to put up--and we haven't talked about this \nyet--reflects what I really fear. If we take a look at the average \nborrowing costs for the United States from 1970 through 1999, when we \nwere a far more creditworthy nation, our debt's GDP ratio ranged from \nabout 40 percent to 67 percent. Our average borrowing cost as a nation \nwas 5.3 percent. Over the last 3 years, from 2010 to 2012, our average \nborrowing cost has been 1.5 percent because we have held rates \nartificially low.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  If we just revert to that mean, that would actually be a 3.8-percent \ndifferential. Applied to our debt, that would be $600 billion to $700 \nbillion per year in additional interest expense. Compare that to $1 \ntrillion worth of discretionary spending, and that would totally wipe \nout the defense budget, for example, or if we maintain the defense \nbudget, it would wipe out all discretionary spending.\n  That is what we need to be concerned about. That is the day of \nreckoning I am concerned about: when creditors from around the world \ntake a look at the United States and say: You know what. I am not going \nto loan you any more money. What is more likely to occur is they will \nsay: I will loan you more money but at a far higher interest rate.\n  I know the Senator from Tennessee is fully aware of these types of \nfigures.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would say to the Senator from Wisconsin and everyone, \nthat is an outstanding chart, and I like the one before it even better. \nBut the fact is that it is so easily known, the illumination is so \nbright that we have a major fiscal issue in this country, and we are \nwatching how that can play out and be so destructive to people's lives \nright now in Europe as they try to deal with these issues.\n  Our Nation is so large and the economy is so big that there will not \nbe anyone to come to our rescue such as we are seeing play out in some \nof these other countries. And for us to see what is happening and to \nknow we are participating in this--we are participating in this because \nspending here in America is on auto pilot. We are going to spend $45 to \n$47 trillion of the American people's money over the next decade. We \nhave not a single document in place to lay out how that is going to \ntake place. I think it is incredibly irresponsible.\n  It would be an embarrassment to me if I had some ability to run this \nplace and to know that we had no budget and yet we know the calamity \nthat is going to occur if we do not deal with this issue. We understand \nit full well, and we are doing nothing about it. Instead, we are \ndealing with all kinds of issues that are all about elections and \nwhether one side can make the other side look bad and is this going to \nmake a tough vote for somebody else, instead of dealing with our No. 1 \nresponsibility.\n  I am hoping that somehow at least 60 folks in this body will be \nwilling to pass a budget to then create a conference between the House \nand Senate so we can take a major step toward living up to our \nfinancial obligations as a country.\n  I thank the Senator so much for organizing this today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. The Senator from Wyoming looks as though he \nmight have another concluding comment.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I just want to thank my colleagues who are here today \nsharing their time and their insight. They have a lot of insight \nbecause they have run businesses, they have worked to actually meet a \nbudget and live within a budget, have dealt with government \nregulations. And the Senator from Texas was talking about these \nregulations. They are burdensome, they are expensive, and they are \ntime-consuming. It is hard to budget when you don't know what to \nexpect. That is what the American people who create jobs and who work \njobs need--some predictability and some certainty so they can make wise \ndecisions. And when you have a Congress led by the Democrats in the \nSenate who do not pass a budget, the predictability isn't there, the \ncertainty isn't there. There is so much confusion and uncertainty that \npeople have a hard time making the longer term decisions.\n  To my colleague from Wisconsin, I know that is what I saw in my \nmedical office, and as I talk to my colleague, I know they have the \nsame situation in Wisconsin.\n  I thank my colleague from Wisconsin as well as my colleagues from \nTexas and Tennessee for their leadership and their continued efforts to \ntry to get the Democrats in this body and this administration to pass a \nbudget, which by law they are mandated to do. Yet, even today, now we \nare at 1,111 days without a budget. To me, that is inexcusable.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I appreciate those comments.\n  I will conclude.\n  There really are two plans on the table right now. One is from the \nHouse Republicans. It actually passed the Chamber. Republicans were \nwilling to put their votes to a budget. Republicans are willing to be \nheld accountable. Of course, the other plan would be the President's \nbudget, which last year lost in this body 0 to 97, and his current \nbudget lost in the House 0 to 414. So I guess you can say that is a \nplan that doesn't sound like a particularly serious plan.\n  So I join my colleagues, and I thank the Senators from Texas and \nWyoming and Tennessee for joining me. I would join them in asking this \nbody to please exercise your responsibility, own up to your duty, and \nlet's pass a budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Congratulating John Paul Hammerschmidt\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, my colleague and I would like to extend a \nspecial birthday greetings to former Congressman John Paul \nHammerschmidt. So with the President's approval, I will turn it over to \nSenator Boozman and let him lead off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be with the senior \nSenator from Arkansas discussing somebody for whom we both have a great \ndeal of affection; that is, the former Congressman of the Third \nDistrict of Arkansas, the district I used to represent. Congressman \nHammerschmidt represented the district for 26 years, and he just \nrecently celebrated his 90th birthday on May 4.\n  John Paul has led a life dedicated to public service. In fact, that \nis truly an understatement. Along with that, he served as a combat \npilot during World War II and is part of the ``greatest generation.''\n  Once he returned home to Harrison, AR, he ran the family lumber \nbusiness while spearheading efforts to create a two-party political \nsystem in the State of Arkansas. John Paul helped mold the political \nlandscape of the State of Arkansas, and he never lost sight of the \nreason why he was doing that and why he worked so hard to provide a \ntwo-party system, that being the people of Arkansas.\n  By the time he was elected to Congress in 1966 as the first member of \nhis party to represent Arkansas in Congress since Reconstruction, John \nPaul had a reputation of working to help others. He did that for 26 \nyears as a Member of Congress. By the time he retired, he was the \nranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee. He served in Congress with the same enthusiasm that \npropelled him into office and was well respected by his colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for his strong work ethic, approach to getting \nwork done, and his responsiveness to constituent service.\n\n  Eleven years ago, when I was a newly-elected Member of Congress who \nalso represented the district John Paul used to represent, he gave me \nadvice that I continue to follow; that is, the key to good governing \nand the key to good public service is that, once elected, there aren't \nany more Republicans, there aren't any more Democrats--there are just \nthe people of Arkansas and the people of America, and we need to take \ncare of them.\n  His words ring as true today as they did 11 years ago. His efforts to \nwork with his colleagues in both political parties benefitted Arkansas \nand America and show what it truly means to be bipartisan. Despite \nbeing in the House minority, he was able to achieve much success in \nCongress because he recognized that the key to good governing and good \npublic service is that you treat everyone fairly and set aside \npolitical differences. This ideology allowed him to be influential in a \nvariety of different areas. He is credited with securing improvements \nfor roads and infrastructure projects, including Interstate 540 and the \nNorthwest Arkansas Regional Airport, protecting the Buffalo River under \nthe designation as a national river, and setting the\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nexample of exemplary constituent service that we strive to continue \ntoday.\n  He is showing no signs of letting his age slow him down by any means. \nHe continues his service on numerous boards and for organizations with \nthe same vigor he demonstrated throughout his career. John Paul played \nan important role in our State's history, and he is still continuing to \nplay an important role in our State's history. He also was an important \ninfluence on me, as he was to so many others in Arkansas. I consider \nhim a friend and a mentor.\n  I recall the first time that I was in Washington being sworn in, in \n2001. He took my brother and me to the Members' dining room. It was a \nvery special time, and just his hospitality to all of us throughout the \nyears was so gracious. I appreciate very much his advice and \nfriendship.\n  John Paul is able to leave his fingerprints on projects important to \nArkansas through his hard work, dedication, and commitment. He never \nforgot about the people he was sent to Washington to represent, and we \nare truly grateful for his tireless efforts to represent the people of \nArkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, John Paul Hammerschmidt is 90. There are \nmany colleagues here in this Chamber, who serve in this body today, who \nworked alongside him either during their service in the House or when \nthey were in the Senate. He is one of the Arkansas greats. He served \nnorthwest Arkansas, which is the Third Congressional District, 26 years \nin the Congress. Looking back at his career, John Paul once said, ``The \nonly reason people should be in public office is to purely serve other \npeople.'' Indeed, he set the bar for constituent service--from \ndelivering a Social Security check to a senior bogged down in \nbureaucracy or fighting for disability benefits for a veteran. Today, \neach of us in Arkansas congressional delegation tries to emulate his \nlegendary casework management.\n\n  One of John Paul's most significant contributions was preserving the \nBuffalo River as a free-flowing stream. According to the Pryor Center \nfor Arkansas Oral and Visual History, John Paul first floated the \nBuffalo at age 12 after taking wood from his father's lumberyard to \nbuild himself a boat. Nearly 40 years later, he established the Buffalo \nas the first National River. This was not an easy achievement, but one \nthat was built with persistence and through relationships within the \ncommunity. Today, tens of thousands of Arkansas families, including \nmine, enjoy floating the Buffalo National River.\n  John Paul also used his time in Congress to help northwest Arkansas \nexpand its infrastructure to keep up with the region's fast growth. It \nis one of the fastest growing sections of the country. As a member of \nthe Public Works Committee, John Paul was credited with securing \nbipartisan support on key infrastructure legislation. We could use a \nlittle of his magic today. You can't go far in northwest Arkansas \nwithout seeing his impact. We have the John Paul Hammerschmidt Highway, \nan access road to Carter Field near Rogers, an industrial park at \nDiamond City, JPH Plaza, the John Paul Hammerschmidt Business and \nConference Center at North Arkansas College in Harrison, John Paul \nHammerschmidt Lake at Fort Smith and the JPH Federal Building in \nFayetteville.\n  Upon John Paul's retirement, former Congressman, Commerce and \nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta spoke on the floor of the House \nof Representatives, saying:\n\n       There is no individual in the House who is more loved and \n     respected than John Paul Hammerschmidt. His honesty, \n     gentleness, decency, and integrity are second to none. Don't \n     be swayed by his quiet manner, because underneath is a man \n     with strong convictions, a sense of purpose, and a keen \n     desire to get things done.\n\n  It is fair to say that John Paul never actually retired. He remains \ninvolved in many civic organizations, including the Northwest Arkansas \nCouncil and March of Dimes. Higher education continues to be a \npriority. John Paul serves on not one but two boards of trustees--the \nBoard of Trustees at the University of the Ozarks and he is a Trustee \nof Arkansas State University.\n  John Paul Hammerschmidt has spent decades serving others and giving \nback to his community. I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay \ntribute to all he has achieved so far and to wish him a happy 90th \nbirthday and many more years of health and happiness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These nominees have the \nsupport of their home State Senators and were reported 3 months ago \nwith the bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I hope the fact that the majority leader was able to obtain consent \nto move these nominations signals that the Senate is being allowed to \nreturn to regular order, and that the majority leader will be able to \nschedule a vote without further delay on the nomination of Paul Watford \nof California to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth \nCircuit. His nomination was reported before those being considered \ntoday and has been skipped in the order. He is a fine nominee with \noutstanding qualifications and bipartisan support.\n  Last week, we were finally able to confirm Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit \nafter a needless 5-month delay. Her nomination had been reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee and was confirmed by a vote of \n91 3. It took the filing of 17 cloture petitions in March to get Senate \nRepublicans to agree to consider her nomination.\n  The Ninth Circuit is still in dire need of judges. With nearly three \ntimes the number of cases pending as the next busiest circuit, we \ncannot afford to further delay Senate votes on the other two \nnominations to the Ninth Circuit. Paul Watford of California passed the \nCommittee more than 3 months ago. Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona passed the \nCommittee more than 2 months ago. There is no good reason for Senate \nRepublicans to further delay votes on these Ninth Circuit nominees. The \n61 million people served by the Ninth Circuit are not served by this \ndelay. The circuit is being forced to handle more than double the \ncaseload of any other without its full complement of judges. The Senate \nshould be expediting consideration of Paul Watford and Justice Andrew \nHurwitz, not delaying them.\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan \nappointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth \nCircuit, wrote to the Senate months ago emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's \n``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial \nnominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly 5 months longer for the Ninth \nCircuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to all \nother circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of the end of 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 14,041 cases pending before it, far more than any other circuit.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended last year when they filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not be delaying the \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. \nIf caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would consent to \nmove forward with votes on Paul Watford and Andrew Hurwitz without \nthese months of unnecessary delays.\n  Paul Watford was rated unanimously well qualified by the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest rating \npossible. He clerked at the United States Supreme Court for Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg and on the Ninth Circuit for now Chief Judge Alex \nKozinski. He was a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. He has the \nsupport of his home State Senators and bipartisan support from noted \nconservatives such as Daniel Collins, who served as associate deputy \nattorney general in the Bush administration; professors Eugene Volokh \nand Orin Kerr; and Jeremy Rosen, the former president of the Los \nAngeles chapter of the Federalist Society.\n  Justice Hurwitz is a respected and experienced jurist on the Arizona \nSupreme Court. His nomination has the strong support of both his \nRepublican home state Senators, Senator John McCain and Senator Jon \nKyl, who introduced him to the Judiciary Committee at his hearing in \nJanuary. Senator Kyl said of Justice Hurwitz:\n\n       It is very easy to see and it is obvious to those of us who \n     have been in Arizona a long time why Justice Hurwitz was \n     awarded the ABA's highest rating, unanimous well qualified. \n     So it will be my privilege to support his nomination, and I \n     am honored to be able to introduce him to the panel today.\n\n  Given that both nominees are superbly qualified mainstream nominees \nwith bipartisan support, the long delays that have plagued these \nnominations are hard to understand.\n  While discussing the Ninth Circuit, I should also clear up the \nhistory of President Bush's Ninth Circuit nominees. Senate Democrats \ndid not oppose Randy Smith joining the Ninth Circuit. Judge Smith was \nconfirmed unanimously by a vote of 94 0. His nomination was \nunnecessarily complicated and delayed by President Bush who initially \ninsisted on nominating Judge Smith to a California seat on the Ninth \nCircuit. He is not a Californian and was not supported by the \nCalifornia Senators. When President Bush took my advice and renominated \nJudge Smith to fill an Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit at the \nbeginning of 2007, he was confirmed quickly.\n  Carolyn Kuhl was another nominee President Bush tried to ram through \nthe Senate in spite of the opposition of her home State Senators. It \nwas Senate Republicans and the Republican chairman who blatantly \ndisregarded Senate Judiciary procedure by proceeding with that \nnomination despite the objection of both home State Senators. At the \ntime I noted that this was a provocative step that ratcheted up \npartisanship and the use of judicial nominees for partisan political \npurposes. By contrast, I have respected objections of Republican home \nState Senators, even when they change their position from support to \nopposition, as happened recently with a Kansas nominee to the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  Senate Democrats opposed William Gerry Myers because he was an \nideologue who spent over 20 years of his career as a lobbyist and as an \noutspoken antagonist against long-established environmental \nprotections. Mr. Myers' advocacy often took positions that were legally \nunsupportable. Mr. Myers' record as a partisan ideologue was not offset \nby other qualifications to be a court of appeals nominee; he received a \npartial not qualified rating from the American Bar Association, had \nnever tried a jury case, nor had he served as counsel in any criminal \nlitigation.\n  The fact is, even after the Senate was forced to invoke cloture to \novercome Republican filibusters of President Clinton's nominations of \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm seven of the nine Ninth Circuit nominees of \nPresident Bush. We reduced vacancies on the Ninth Circuit during \nPresident Bush's two terms to only a single vacancy. Four of President \nBush's Ninth Circuit nominees were confirmed during his first 4-year \nterm: Judge Richard Clifton, Judge Jay Bybee, Judge Consuelo Callahan, \nand Judge Carlos Bea. By contrast, Senate Republicans are opposing our \nmoving forward to consider and confirm Paul Watford and Andrew Hurwitz, \nwho are both strongly supported by their home State Senators, to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies, and they filibustered the nomination of \nGoodwin Liu, who also had the strong support of his home State \nSenators.\n  The American people deserve better. Our courts need qualified Federal \njudges, not vacancies, if they are to reduce the excessive wait times \nthat burden litigants seeking their day in court. It is unacceptable \nfor hardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to \nsuffer unnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover \nthe cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have \nto wait 3 years before a judge hears the case. When two small business \nowners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for \na court to resolve their dispute.\n  We have much more work to do to help resolve the judicial vacancy \ncrisis that has persisted for more than 3 years. When the Majority \nLeader and the Republican leader came to their interim understanding in \nMarch, it resulted in votes on 14 of the 22 judicial nominations then \nawaiting final consideration. Because the arrangement took months to \nimplement what the Senate could have done in hours, the backlog of \njudicial vacancies and judicial nominees continues. Today we are almost \nback to where we started with 19 judicial nominees awaiting action.\n  We are still lagging far behind what we accomplished during the first \nterm of President George W. Bush. During President Bush's first term we \nreduced the number of judicial vacancies by almost 75 percent. When I \nbecame Chairman in the summer of 2001, there were 110 vacancies. As \nChairman, I worked with the administration and Senators from both sides \nof the aisle to confirm 100 judicial nominees of a conservative \nRepublican President in 17 months.\n  We continued when in the minority to work with Senate Republicans to \nconfirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations well into 2004, \na Presidential election year. At the end of that Presidential term, the \nSenate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and district court nominees. In \nMay 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to below 50 on the way to 28 \nthat August. Despite 2004 being an election year, we were able to \nreduce vacancies to the lowest level in the last 20 years. At a time of \ngreat turmoil and political confrontation, despite the attack on 9/11, \nthe anthrax letters shutting down Senate offices, and the ideologically \ndriven judicial selections of President Bush, we worked together to \npromptly confirm consensus nominees and significantly reduce judicial \nvacancies.\n  In October 2008, another Presidential election year, we again worked \nto reduce judicial vacancies and were able to get back down to 34 \nvacancies. I accommodated Senate Republicans and continued holding \nexpedited hearings and votes on judicial nominations into September \n2008. We lowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly as Senate \nRepublicans have allowed during President Obama's first term.\n  By comparison, the vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at \nthis point in the first term of President Bush, and has remained near \nor above 80 for nearly three years. Again, if we could move forward to \nSenate votes on the 19 judicial nominees ready for final\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\naction, the Senate could reduce vacancies below 60 and make progress.\n  The Senate needs to consider these judicial nominees if we are to \nmake real progress in reducing the burden of judicial vacancies. That \nis what we did in the most recent Presidential election years of 2004 \nand 2008 and what we should be doing this year. We have a long way to \ngo. We need to work to reduce the vacancies that are burdening the \nFederal judiciary and the millions of Americans who rely on our Federal \ncourts to seek justice. Let us work in a bipartisan fashion to confirm \nthese qualified judicial nominees so that we can address the judicial \nvacancy crisis and so they can serve the American people.\n  Today, we can finally fill two judicial emergency vacancies with \nexcellent nominees. George Levi Russell III is nominated to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the District of Maryland, where he has \nbeen an active member of the legal community for over 20 years. \nCurrently an Associate Judge in the Circuit Court of Maryland for \nBaltimore City, he previously spent 10 years as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the District of Maryland, serving in both the criminal and \ncivil divisions. Judge Russell's nomination has the strong support of \nthe Maryland Senators, Senators Mikulski and Cardin.\n  John ``Jay'' Tharp is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy \non the Northern District of Illinois. This is the second time Mr. Tharp \nhas been nominated to that position, having also been nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush in July 2008. A former Captain in the Marine \nCorps, Mr. Tharp is currently a partner in the Chicago office of Mayer \nBrown LLP. He began his legal career as a Federal prosecutor in the \nNorthern District of Illinois and clerked for Judge Joel Flaum on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Tharp well \nqualified, its highest rating. Mr. Tharp's nomination has the \nbipartisan support of Illinois' Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and \nRepublican Senator Mark Kirk.\n  Both Judge Russell and Mr. Tharp were favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on February 16th of this year. I look forward to \ntheir confirmations today.\n  Mr. President, using the time allocated to the majority, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Senator Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the remaining time between now and 5:30 be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to offer my strong endorsement \nfor the nomination of John ``Jay'' Tharp to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of Illinois.\n  Jay Tharp will be an outstanding addition to the Federal bench. He \nmade a name for himself as an assistant U.S. attorney whose cases \nincluded political corruption and money laundering. His impressive \ntenure in that office includes service in the General Crimes Division \nand the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Since leaving the \nU.S. Attorney's office in 1997, Tharp has worked at Mayer Brown LLP, \nwhere he was made partner in 1999. He is currently coleader of Mayer \nBrown's securities litigation and enforcement practice.\n  I want to thank Senator Durbin for his continued dedication and hard \nwork to ensure the Senate's timely confirmation of both Illinois \njudicial nominees, Jay Tharp and John Lee.\n  Under Senate tradition for Illinois, the senator from the party not \nin control of the White House makes nomination recommendations to the \nWhite House for one Federal district court judgeship for every three of \nthe party in power. The arrangement is intended to ensure the orderly \nfiling of Federal judge vacancies on the Illinois bench. Under that \ntradition, John Tharp was my first recommendation.\n  Jay served our country in the Marine Corps from 1982 to 1988, \nachieving the rank of Captain and earning the Navy Achievement Medal \nand the Navy Distinguished Midshipman Award. He subsequently attended \nNorthwestern University Law School on a full merit John Henry Wigmore \nScholarship. While at Northwestern, Jay served as book review editor of \nthe Northwestern Law Review. He graduated magna cum laude in 1990.\n  Last week, the Senate voted to confirm John Lee to fill one of the \nvacancies for the Northern District. Senator Durbin and I worked \nclosely to recommend both Jay Tharp and John Lee and today's vote on \nJay's nomination will hopefully conclude the process to fill these two \nvacancies.\n  I would also like to thank my Judicial Review Advisory Board, chaired \nby Peter Baugher of Schopf & Weiss LLP, for their hard work in \nselecting Jay Tharp. In February 2011, I formed this 14-member \nbipartisan, Statewide screening committee and charged it with \nidentifying ``the strongest applicants from Illinois for consideration \nby the President and U.S. Senate.''\n  My Advisory Board received nearly 50 applications, met five times, \nand spent over 300 man-hours to review judicial candidates. The \nAdvisory Board's review process included personal interviews as well as \ncalls to colleagues, opposing counsel, and judges.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Jay Tharp's nomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is the \nnomination of Jay Tharp to serve on the District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois. Senator Kirk and I have agreed on a bipartisan \napproach to this. We each have appointed bipartisan committees who \nreview prospective applicants and then make recommendations. We each \nhave a veto over the other's recommendation, so it is totally \nbipartisan. In the case of Jay Tharp, there was no veto--certainly not \nby me--and in this case, he was sponsored by Senator Kirk. He is an \nextraordinarily talented individual.\n  The reason I have entered into the Congressional Record the official \nstatement of Senator Kirk is because, obviously, he can't be here. He \nis in rehab at this point from a stroke he suffered in January, and \nthere was an encouraging video released last week showing the progress \nhe is making. We are all anxious for him to return. I promised him in a \nphone conversation last week that I would move this nomination as \nquickly as possible so that his nominee is approved. His statement now \nin the Record speaks to his feelings about Jay Tharp's nomination, and \nit speaks for itself. I will now add my own comments.\n  I am glad Mr. Tharp is finally getting a vote in the Senate. It has \ntaken a long time. In fact, it has taken too long for this day to come. \nNominees who are noncontroversial, eminently qualified, who go through \nthe committee without even a hint of resistance from Democrats or \nRepublicans shouldn't have to sit on this calendar for week after week \nand month after month. It has now become standard around here, as have \nthese mind-numbing filibusters become standard around here, and it \nisn't fair.\n  It isn't fair first to the country to leave vacancies on the Federal \nbench, creating hardships in courts around the Nation where people come \nto the courthouse expecting timely consideration of important matters, \nfrom criminal charges to civil litigation.\n  It isn't fair to the nominees. It really takes a pretty stalwart \nindividual to put their name up to be a Federal judge because they are \ngoing to go through three or four different levels of investigation and \nsome pretty serious investigation by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, for example. That is part of the process. There are \ninvestigations by the White House, by the Senators' offices, by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. So it is not an easy undertaking. There \nmight have been a time--I know there was--when these nominations were \nmade in 48 hours with hardly a question asked. It doesn't happen \nanymore. Hard questions are asked, and then comes the\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nsuspense of starting the process and waiting for it to end. These poor \nnominees sit there with their professional and personal lives on hold, \nhaving said they are prepared to step forward and serve a lifetime \nappointment on the Federal judiciary, and then they wait day after \nweary day, week after weary week, month after month, sitting on this \nExecutive Calendar so that at some point there will be a bargaining \nsession and some names will go forward and some won't.\n  This is what happened to Jay Tharp, but it shouldn't have, nor should \nit have happened to John Lee, the nominee who was approved last week \nfor Illinois. Both nominees are extraordinarily qualified and should \nhave gone through without this resistance, but this reflects what is \nhappening in the Senate.\n  What is interesting about Jay Tharp is that every aspect of his \nnomination has been bipartisan. As I said, Senator Kirk put him through \na bipartisan process for selection, and Senator Kirk reviewed and \napproved all of the candidates and then recommended him. It was last \nNovember 10 that the White House sent two nominations to the Senate to \nfill vacancies: John Lee, who was approved last Monday, and Jay Tharp, \nwho we will be considering this evening.\n  John Lee was my choice; Jay Tharp was Senator Kirk's choice. We \nagreed, as I said, on both nominees. They were both nominated on the \nsame day. They appeared together at the hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee in January. Both were reported out of the committee in \nFebruary--about 3 or 4 months ago--in a bipartisan voice vote.\n  It was my hope we could bring them to a quick vote. There was an \nurgent need to fill the vacancies. We had been contacted by the chief \njudge of the district in Chicago, Jim Holderman. He had written to both \nof us, Senator Kirk and myself, and asked: Please move on these judges.\n  I felt an obligation, after Senator Kirk's illness, to try to get \nthis job done. I knew Senator Kirk would be here in person if it were \nhumanly possible. I put his statement in the Record. I know how \nstrongly he feels about the qualities of Jay Tharp.\n  Unfortunately, for reasons hard to understand, this has dragged on \nfor almost 6 months since their nominations were sent to the Senate. Up \nuntil a few years ago, this, as I said, was not the way things were \nhandled--not when it came to bipartisan nominees who were coming out of \nthe committee with no controversy. That certainly is the case now. We \nnow see routine objections. There is a presumption that something must \nbe wrong with a nominee, and we will just sit on it for weeks and \nmonths. That is not good. It is not fair to the nominees. It is not \nfair to the process. It certainly is not good for the judiciary.\n  Under the last nominations agreement negotiated in March, for some \nreason John Lee made the cut, Jay Tharp did not. I appealed to Senator \nKyl, to Senator McConnell. I sent a letter in writing and spoke to it \non the Senate floor.\n  This is Senator Mark Kirk's first nomination for a Federal judgeship, \nand I know how important it is to him. I thank those who were \nresponsible for bringing it forward today. I am sure he will be \nrelieved. I know Jay Tharp will be relieved when this is over.\n  I have been very happy to stand and support Jay Tharp, as well as \nJohn Lee. They are both extraordinary individuals. There are other \nwell-qualified nominees sitting on this Senate calendar in a similar \ncircumstance. After today's votes, there will be 17 nominees pending on \nthe calendar, and nearly all of them--almost all of them--were voted \nout of committee without any dissenting votes, with the exception of \nSenator Lee of Utah, who votes customarily against all judicial \nnominees. These nominees, but for a few, have not had any controversy. \nSix of these nominees are in areas designated as judicial emergencies, \nincluding two nominees for seats in the Ninth Circuit--Paul Watford and \nAndrew Hurwitz, who are extraordinarily well qualified.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will give us a break. These people \ndeserve to get their moment on the Senate floor. They deserve a vote, \nand the areas they are going to serve deserve a full complement of \ncompetent jurists.\n  It is time to restore sanity, comity, and good faith to the way we \ntreat judicial nominations on the Senate floor. That should start \ntoday.\n  Let me discuss Jay Tharp's background for the record. He was \nnominated when a judgeship opened up after Judge Blanche Manning took \nsenior status. He is currently a partner in the Chicago office of Mayer \nBrown, where he is the co-leader of the firm's securities litigation \nand enforcement practice.\n  He was born into a military family--he is very proud of it--as the \nson of a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.\n  Jay Tharp attended Duke University on an ROTC scholarship. He \nreceived his undergraduate degree summa cum laude and was commissioned \nas a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps.\n  He served on Active Duty with the Marines for 6 years, achieving the \nrank of captain and earning the Navy Achievement Medal and the Navy \nDistinguished Midshipman Award.\n  After his military service, he attended Northwestern University Law \nSchool. He graduated magna cum laude and served on their Law Review. \nUpon graduation, he was a clerk for Judge Joel Flaum on the Seventh \nCircuit, and then worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago for 6 \nyears.\n  After his tenure as a Federal prosecutor, he joined Mayer Brown, \nwhere his practice has been in complex commercial litigation and \ncriminal investigations. He has received numerous recognitions. He has \nserved as an adjunct professor of trial advocacy at Northwestern \nUniversity Law School, and he is a member of the Law Fund Board at \nNorthwestern, which oversees fundraising efforts.\n  In short, Jay Tharp is a picture-perfect nominee for the Federal \nbench. He has the qualifications, temperament, and integrity to serve \nthe Northern District well. I urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  I just say to Jay Tharp, the day has come, finally. I am sorry you \ngot caught up in what has become a tiring political exercise, where \npeople are just stuck on a calendar waiting for something to happen \nwhich springs them loose. This evening will be your opportunity.\n  I hope the Senate--and I know Senator Kirk will join me in saying \nthis--will give Jay Tharp the unanimous vote he deserves. He is an \nextraordinarily well-qualified nominee, and I am happy to support his \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will be urging the people in my caucus \nto vote for these nominees, both of them. Today, the Senate is expected \nto confirm these two nominees: Judge Russell to the District of \nMaryland and Mr. Tharp to the Northern District of Illinois. As I said, \nI support the nominees, and I do, in fact, expect that both of them \nwill be confirmed.\n  We continue to confirm the President's nominees at a brisk pace. In \nfact, with today's confirmations, we will have confirmed 145 of \nPresident Obama's district and circuit court nominees. I would like to \nput this in perspective.\n  We confirmed two Supreme Court nominees during President Obama's term \nso far. Everyone knows it takes a tremendous amount of time and \nresources to consider Supreme Court nominees.\n  The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was \nduring President Bush's second term. During President Bush's entire \nsecond term, the Senate confirmed only 120 district and circuit court \nnominees.\n  Compare that, if you will, to the 145 district and circuit court \nnominees we have confirmed so far since President Obama has become \nPresident. Let me say that same thing a different way. We have \nconfirmed 25 more nominees for President Obama than we did for \nPresident Bush in a similar time period. Of course, President Obama's \nterm is not over yet.\n  With these facts in mind, I hope my colleagues will understand why I \nget a little frustrated when I hear all of these complaints about how \nwe are not confirming enough nominees. The fact is President Obama is \nbeing treated much more fairly than Senate Democrats treated President \nBush.\n\n  It is especially frustrating to hear the other side complain about \nthe vacancy rate. The fact is the Senate is\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\ndoing its job. We are confirming the nominees who are sent to us. Of \ncourse, we cannot confirm nominees who are not up here from the White \nHouse. If there is a problem, then it rests with the President.\n  Right now, there are 77 judicial vacancies. But the President has \nmade only 29 nominations. That means 48 vacancies or over 60 percent--\nactually, nearly 63 percent--have no nominee. Stating it another way, \nthere are currently 44 million Americans living in districts with \nvacancies where the President has not submitted a nominee to the \nSenate.\n  I suspect the President neglected to share that statistic with all \nthe groups he summoned to the White House 1 week ago today to discuss \njudicial nominees, probably with the point of getting those \norganizations to put more pressure on the Congress to approve more \nnominees, and somehow approve nominees who are not even here yet for us \nto approve.\n  I could go on, but I do not intend to. I do not like to get into this \nback-and-forth with the other side. But it gets a little tiresome to \nhear the same misleading statements over and over. I want to set the \nrecord straight, and I have done that.\n  I congratulate the nominees who will be confirmed tonight. Both the \nnominees and their families should be proud.\n  George Levi Russell III, presently serving as an associate judge to \nthe Circuit Court of Maryland, is nominated to be U.S. District Judge \nfor the District of Maryland. Judge Russell received his BA from \nMorehouse College in 1988 and his JD from the University of Maryland \nSchool of Law in 1991. Upon graduation from law school, he clerked for \nHon. Robert M. Bell, chief judge for the Court of Appeals of Maryland. \nJudge Russell then worked as an associate at the law firms Hazel and \nThomas, P.C. and Whiteford, Taylor, and Preston, where he handled cases \ninvolving personal injury, product liability, and medical malpractice. \nIn 1994, Judge Russell became an assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Maryland. He worked in the civil \ndivision for 5 years, defending government agencies in discrimination, \nautomobile accident, and medical malpractice cases. In 2000, Judge \nRussell rejoined the private sector for 2 years, working at the law \noffices of Peter G. Angelos, where he represented plaintiffs in class \naction and private personal injury cases. In 2002, he returned to the \nU.S. Attorney's Office and joined the criminal division for 5 years. \nThere Judge Russell prosecuted those accused of violent crimes and \nnarcotics cases.\n  In 2007, then-Governor Robert Ehrlich appointed Judge Russell to be \nan associate judge on the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. \nIn November 2008, he was elected to a 15-year term. Judge Russell has \nsat on each of the four dockets of this court: criminal, civil, family, \nand juvenile.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has given Judge \nRussell a rating of Substantial Majority ``Qualified'' and Minority \n``Not Qualified'' for this position.\n  John J. Tharp, Jr., is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois. Mr. Tharp was first nominated to this \nposition by President Bush in 2008. Mr. Tharp received his BA from Duke \nUniversity in 1982 and his JD from Northwestern University School of \nLaw in 1990. Mr. Tharp served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1982 to \n1988, became a captain in 1987, and has received several military \nhonors. Following graduation from Northwestern University School of Law \nin 1990, Mr. Tharp began his legal career as a clerk for Judge Flaum on \nthe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. After working as an associate at \nKirkland & Ellis for a year, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for \nthe Northern District of Illinois, Chicago, as a Federal prosecutor \nwhere he served in the Criminal Receiving and Appellate Division, \nGeneral Crimes Division, and Organized Drug Enforcement Task Force. He \nhandled cases involving narcotics and money laundering investigations, \nfinancial frauds, political corruption, tax crimes, bank robberies, and \nfirearms offenses.\n  In 1997, Mr. Tharp left the U.S. Attorney's Office and moved to his \ncurrent firm, Mayer Brown, where his practice focuses on civil \nconcerns, including tort, contract, intellectual property, environment, \ntax, and unfair competition claims, securities fraud, professional \nliability, and governmental investigations.\n  In 2009, Mr. Tharp's firm selected him to serve as coleader of the \nsecurities enforcement practice. In 2010, that group merged with the \nsecurities litigation group, and he continues to serve as coleader of \nthe combined Mayer Brown securities litigation and enforcement \npractice. He has an ABA rating of Unanimous ``Well Qualified.'''\n  I urge my colleagues to support these nominees. I think they probably \nwill be supported overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so proud to be here on the floor of \nthe Senate to support the nomination of Judge George Russell III. He is \nnominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, and \nhe has the enthusiastic support of Senator Cardin and myself. Senator \nCardin will speak right after me.\n  I thank Senators Leahy and Grassley for moving this nomination, and I \nthank Senators Reid and McConnell for their cooperation.\n  I take my advice-and-consent responsibilities very seriously. When I \nconsider someone for the Federal bench, I have four criteria: absolute \npersonal integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment \nto core constitutional principles, and a history of civic engagement in \nMaryland.\n  I cite these standards because I mean it. I must say Judge Russell--\nhe is currently on the Circuit Court of Baltimore City--brings the \nright values to the bench. He has the necessary experience. He has seen \nthe legal system from all perspectives and brings forth a top-notch \nbackground.\n  He is nominated to fill the seat of Judge Peter Messitte, who took \nsenior status 3 years ago. I think it is a matter of urgency to confirm \nJudge Russell because of the backlog we have in our Maryland Federal \ncourt.\n  Prior to taking the bench, Judge Russell spent his legal career as a \nlitigator. He spent 10 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland. \nHe handled both criminal and civil cases. While there he was also a \ncommunity outreach coordinator. What does that mean? For an assistant \nU.S. attorney, it meant he worked with the community creating vital \nprograms to reduce violent crimes.\n  As a young attorney, Mr. Russell also served as a law clerk for Judge \nRobert Bell. Judge Bell is the chief judge of the Maryland Court of \nAppeals. I might add, Judge Bell enthusiastically endorses this \nNominee.\n  Judge Russell is a man born and raised in Baltimore. He graduated \nfrom the University of Maryland School of Law and has spent his entire \ncareer in Maryland. His father, also a judge, was a legal pioneer in \nMaryland, serving as the city's first African-American circuit judge.\n  This judge, Judge Russell, has public service in his DNA, both \nworking as a U.S. attorney and on the Federal bench and also in his \nconnection to the everyday life of people. He has been on the board of \ndirectors of the Enoch Pratt Library, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and \nthe Community Law Center. He has often been recruited to be a \nmotivational speaker, an inspirational speaker, particularly to high \nschool and middle school students to encourage them to stay in school \nand off the street. He has particularly been enthusiastic about \nmentoring young attorneys and law students.\n\n  The reason I talk about his civic engagement is that we want judges \nwho do not live in a bubble. It is great to be a legal scholar, it is \ngreat to know the law inside and out, but a great judge knows people. \nThis man, Judge George Russell III, by being out there--whether it is \nmaking sure the library is there for young people who want to move up; \nBig Brothers and Sisters, to keep young people out of trouble; or \nworking at the Community Law Center--he\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nhas involved himself in the gritty aspects of Baltimore City. He is a \ndevoted public servant. He comes with a great background.\n  He brings together recommendations from both the public and private \nsector. I urge my colleagues to endorse the nomination of Judge \nRussell. I ask their support in voting for him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Mikulski for her \nleadership on the process we have used in Maryland on filling judicial \nvacancies. I am very proud to work with Senator Mikulski in a process \nthat screens lawyers who are interested in becoming Federal judges in \norder that we can get the very best to recommend to the President.\n  We think the President has chosen the very best in Judge Russell to \nfill the district court vacancy for the District of Maryland. But I \nreally wanted to applaud my colleague in the Senate for the seriousness \nthat we both take on filling these vacancies. We understand these are \nlifetime appointments. We want to make sure we get individuals who have \nthe qualifications, who have the temperament, who have the integrity, \nand have the commitment to public service to serve our judiciary.\n  I rise today to urge the Senate to confirm Judge George Levi Russell \nIII, of Maryland, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nMaryland. Judge Russell was reported by voice vote out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on February 16. Judge Russell currently sits as a trial judge \nin the Baltimore City Circuit Court.\n  Judge Russell is an excellent candidate. He received bipartisan \nsupport from the Judiciary Committee and is ready to take office upon \nconfirmation of the Senate. Judge Russell brings a wealth of experience \nto this position in both State and Federal courts. Earlier in his \ncareer he served as a Federal prosecutor and as an attorney in private \nlaw practice. He now sits as a State court trial judge in Maryland.\n  Judge Russell graduated from Moorehouse College with a B.A. in \npolitical science and a J.D. from the Maryland Law School in 1991. He \npassed the Maryland Bar and was admitted to practice in Maryland in \n1991. He then clerked for Chief Judge Robert Bell on the Maryland Court \nof Appeals, which is our highest State court. He worked as a litigation \nassociate for 2 years at Hazel & Thomas, and then briefly at Whiteford, \nTaylor. He then served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District \nof Maryland from 1994 to 1999, handling civil cases. In that capacity \nhe represented various Federal Government agencies in discrimination, \naccident, and medical malpractice cases. He then worked as an associate \nat the Peter Angelos law firm for 2 years.\n  In 2002, he went back to the U.S. Attorney's Office, handling \ncriminal cases until 2007. He represented the United States in the \ncriminal prosecution of violent crimes and narcotic cases during the \ninvestigatory stage, at trial, and on appeal. This included the \ninitiation of monitoring of wiretaps to infiltrate and break up violent \ngangs in Baltimore City.\n  He also served as the Project Safe neighborhood coordinator for the \noffice from 2002 until 2005. He participated in community outreach \nprograms in coordination with the Baltimore City State's Attorney's \nOffice to reduce violent crime in Baltimore communities.\n  In 2007, Governor Ehrlich, a Republican, appointed him to serve as an \nassociate judge of the Baltimore City Circuit Court for a term of 15 \nyears. As a trial judge, Judge Russell has presided over hundreds of \ntrials that have gone to verdict or judgment and he has experience in \nhandling jury trials, bench trials, civil cases, and criminal cases. He \nhas the professional experience which has been recognized by a \nRepublican Governor and a Democratic President.\n  Judge Russell has strong roots, legal experience, and community \ninvolvement in the State of Maryland. He was born and raised in \nBaltimore City and has extended family who live in Baltimore. He served \nas a director and trustee of the board of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nwhich serves the disadvantaged throughout the State of Maryland. He \nserved on the board of directors of the Community Law Center, which is \nan organization designed to help neighborhood organizations improve the \nquality of life for their residences.\n  He has also served as a board member on several organizations that \ndevote substantial resources to helping the disadvantaged, including \nthe Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Maryland. I know he has often \nspoken to young people in school about the obligations, duty, and \nmandate of a judge, and he tries to demystify the role of a judge in a \nblack robe.\n  Judge Russell is particularly concerned with addressing the drug, \nviolence, and mental health problems that plague Baltimore City. Judge \nRussell comes from a very distinguished family in the legal profession \nof Maryland. Judge Russell's father, George L. Russell, Jr., was also a \ngroundbreaking African-American lawyer in Maryland. He was the first \nAfrican-American judge on the Maryland Circuit Court in the 1960s and \nwas later Baltimore's first African-American Solicitor.\n  He was also the first African-American president of the Baltimore \nCity Bar Association. In later years, Judge Russell was named by the \nGovernor to chair the Maryland Museum of African-American History and \nCultural Commission and served as chairman of the board of the Maryland \nAfrican-American Museum Corporation.\n  He was also asked to chair Baltimore's Judicial Nominating \nCommission. He has received numerous awards from the Maryland Bar \nFoundation and NAACP.\n  His family is deep in public service, including his wife who serves \nas a judge on the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. I am \nabsolutely convinced that Judge Russell possesses the qualifications, \ntemperament, and passion for justice that will make him an outstanding \nFederal trial judge. He will serve the people of Maryland very well in \nthis position. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote for the \nconfirmation of Judge Russell to serve as a judge for the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maryland.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2072\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:15 a.m, \nTuesday, May 15, the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072, \nbe adopted; that the only first-degree amendments in order to the bill \nbe Lee No. 2100, Paul No. 2101, Corker No. 2102, Vitter No. 2103, and \nToomey No. 2104; that there be no amendments in order to any of the \namendments prior to the votes; that there be no motions or points of \norder in order other then budget points of order and the applicable \nmotions to waive; that there be up to 2 hours of debate to run \nconcurrently on the amendments and the bill equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees prior to votes in relation to the \namendments in the order listed; that upon disposition of the \namendments, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as \namended, if amended; that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to \neach vote, and all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; that the \namendments and passage of the bill require 60 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have pending now a cloture vote. I have \nspoken to the Republican leader very recently. We think it would be in \nthe best interests of the Senate to do away with the cloture vote. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for \nthis evening be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. There should only be one rollcall vote tonight because the \nMaryland judge we expect to be able to voice-vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of George Levi Russell III, of Maryland, to \nbe United States District Judge for the District of Maryland.\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of John J. Tharp, Jr., of Illinois, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the Export-\nImport Bank reauthorization's importance to strengthen manufacturing \nand creating jobs in places such as my home State of Ohio.\n  Ohio is the third leading manufacturing State in the country. Only \nTexas, which has twice our population, and California, which has three \ntimes our population, produce more goods than we do.\n  The Export-Import Bank's mission is simple: It facilitates exports \nand contributes to job creation in the United States. It does this \nthrough loans and guarantees of insurance, filling in gaps in trade \nfinancing at no ultimate cost to taxpayers. Yet, despite this record of \nsuccess, exports and jobs are at stake because Congress cannot agree to \nEx-Im reauthorization, in large part because there is a group of people \nin this body and down the hall in the House of Representatives who \nsimply think the Federal Government should not have a role in much of \nanything.\n  The bank's lending authority is set to expire May 31, 17 days from \nnow. We must act. The Export-Import Bank has been reauthorized by both \nChambers, by both parties, decade after decade, and we know how \nimportant it is for job creation, but it has taken too long to get this \nreauthorization moving. While manufacturers wait, Congress has stalled. \nWe cannot wait any longer.\n  We know that Ohio workers can compete with anyone in the world when \nthe playing field is level. When we stamp the ``Made in Ohio'' label, \nit is a sign that an item was made with pride by some of the finest \nworkers in the United States and some of the finest workers in our \ncountry.\n  We know that U.S. manufacturing is getting stronger due in no small \npart to increased exports with the help of the Ex-Im Bank. Ohio has had \nquicker increases in job growth than other States.\n  We know that the manufacturing sector nationally has gained back some \nnumber of jobs that it lost. As an example, from 1965 to 1998 or 1999, \nthis country had roughly the same number of manufacturing jobs. It was \na smaller percentage of GDP and a smaller percentage of the workforce \nbut a pretty constant similar number of jobs in 1999 as we had in 1965. \nBut in the decade after 1999, we lost between 3 and 4 million \nmanufacturing jobs in this country.\n  Since 2010, almost every single month we have seen manufacturing jobs \nincrease in Ohio, in the Presiding Officer's home State of North \nCarolina, and in State after State in this country. That is good, \nobviously, but too many people in my State are still out of work or \nunderemployed. What will happen to Ohio workers in our growing \nmanufacturing sector if we fail do what we should be doing here, if we \nfail to fund this critical resource?\n  Ohio's manufacturers have been able to increase their exports with \nthe assistance and the assurance that the Ex-Im Bank provides. In \nFremont, OH, workers at Crown Battery, an employee-owned company, make \nrenewable energy systems. With the help of the Ex-Im Bank's short-term, \nmultibuyer insurance policy, about $400,000 worth of Crown Battery's \nstorage battery manufacturing equipment was exported to South Africa. \nMiddletown Tube Works in Butler County in southwest Ohio exports \ntubular steel to Spain and Portugal with less risk because of the Ex-Im \nBank. Before that support, Nook Industries in Cuyahoga County required \ninternational customers to pay cash in advance of every order, which is \nan average of 4- to 6-weeks. Now Nook Industries has major customers in \nplaces such as China, South Korea, and Israel because of Ex-Im Bank \nsupport.\n  Exporting is especially tough for small businesses. Large businesses \nneed this less than the small company that makes things, that \nmanufactures things. Less than 1 percent of the Nation's nearly 26 \nmillion small businesses export their products. Imagine if we can \nincrease that only a little bit in percentage terms.\n  One of the most important resources to help small and medium-sized \nbusinesses--especially those that make things--boost their exports is \nthe Ex-Im Bank. That is why the Ohio Manufacturers Association strongly \nsupports its reauthorization. They said:\n\n       The Ex-Im Bank is the only tool that American manufacturers \n     have to counter the huge sums of export financing--many \n     hundreds of millions of dollars--that other countries and \n     other governments provide their exporters.\n\n  Tom Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of \nMachinists, told the Senate Banking Committee:\n\n       America's working families struggle in today's difficult \n     economy [and] have little patience for Beltway politics that \n     continue to stall a proven instrument of export growth and \n     job creation.\n\n  I hear from the head of the Ohio Manufacturers Association and I hear \nfrom small business owners who want to expand and gain access to \nforeign\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nmarkets but can't secure private financing due to the credit risk \nassociated with some overseas investments.\n  Export-supported jobs linked to the manufacturing sector already \naccount for an estimated 7 percent of our total private sector \nemployment. More than one-fourth of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio \ndepend on exports for their jobs.\n  In 2011 the bank worked with nearly 100 Ohio businesses to support \nmore than $400 million in export sales. To renew the Bank's charter \nshould be a cause that all Senators support just like the 25 times that \nthe Senate unanimously reauthorized the agency since its establishment \nalmost 80 years ago. It is a matter of American jobs and a matter of \nglobal competitiveness.\n  Some people who seem to oppose everything the Federal Government \nwants to do because of this philosophy that the Federal Government \nnever does anything of use--forgetting Medicare, Social Security, clean \ndrinking water, all that--even though the Senate has reauthorized this \nprogram 25 times, they are standing in the way and blocking it.\n  We faced a trade deficit with China of almost $300 billion in 2011, \nmeaning that we imported about $800 million a day more than we exported \nto China. We know that China's export-import and development banks \nprovide as much as $100 billion in export credits each year. That is \nmore than three times as many new export credits as our U.S. Export-\nImport Bank.\n  It is time we continue fighting for and investing in American \nmanufacturing. It is so important, like we do so well in Ohio, that we \nmake things. It creates wealth, it creates a strong middle class, and \nit creates opportunity for our young people. It is time to end the \ndelay and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was fortunate to be able to attend the \nargument before the U.S. Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the \nprovision in the affordable care act providing that individuals should \ntake personal responsibility for paying for their health care by \nobtaining health insurance or pay a fine. I have watched a lot of \narguments in the Supreme Court. Obviously, as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee I pay close attention--as do all Members--to what \ngoes on there. I heard a great deal of instant analysis from \ncommentators after the argument, including their predictions on how the \nCourt will rule. I didn't hear much devoted to the role of the Chief \nJustice of the United States.\n  When I watched the arguments, I saw a Chief Justice that day who I \nthought seemed well aware of the significance of this decision. Chief \nJustice Roberts had not been appointed when the Court intervened in the \nPresidential election of 2000, but he certainly saw the reaction to \nthat decision in Bush v. Gore, a 5-to-4 decision that the country \nviewed as partisan. In fact, many in the country felt that five people \non the Supreme Court decided a Presidential election that was actually \nfor the person who got less votes than the one they said lost. That \ndecision was unprecedented. In a shocking admission, the Court itself \nsaid that it should never be considered precedent or cited in the \nfuture. That decision shook the confidence of the American people in \nthe Supreme Court and, as Justice Stevens observed at the time, the \nloser in that decision was ``the Nation's confidence in the judge as an \nimpartial guardian of the rule of law.'' That activism undermined the \nreputation of the Court as fair and impartial.\n  But the Chief Justice did participate in the Court's recent 5-to-4 \ndecision in Citizens United that divided along ideological lines and \ncontinues to engender a significant backlash. That decision was one in \nwhich the Supreme Court reached out to decide a matter not argued \ninitially and in which it made a broad constitutional ruling that \nreversed nearly 100 years of progress in the country to control the \ncorrupting influence of money in our elections and politics. That \ndecision led directly to the super PACs and campaign excesses that are \nnow plaguing our Democratic elections, and actually plagued this year's \nRepublican Presidential primaries. As bad as its effect is on both \nRepublicans and Democrats and elected offices, I believe it has \ncontributed to the further erosion of the public's confidence in the \nSupreme Court to be an independent arbiter.\n  The constitutional challenge to the affordable care act is the \ncurrent instance in which narrow ideology and partisanship are \npressuring the Supreme Court to intervene where it should not, to \noverride the law and constitutional legal understandings that have been \nsettled since the Great Depression, and also to overturn the actions of \nthe people who are elected to represent all Americans in both the House \nand the Senate. I was struck by how little respect some of the Justices \nshowed to Congress and of how dismissive they were to the months of \nwork that included dozens of hearings, or the committee actions and the \ndebate of amendments and motions and points of order on the Senate and \nHouse floors before the measure was enacted, how that was almost \nsummarily dismissed by some.\n  Their actions will not help restore Americans' confidence in the \nCourt to fairly apply the law. According to a recent poll, half of all \nAmericans expect the justices to decide the challenge to the affordable \ncare act mainly based on their ``partisan political views,'' while only \n40 percent expect them to decide the case ``on the basis of the law.'' \nThat has contributed to the historically low percentage of Americans, \nfewer than half, that said in a recent poll that they approve of the \nSupreme Court.\n  I am not going to be offended if some of the Justices don't like us \npersonally or disagree with the policy judgments reflected in the law \nas individuals, as citizens, or as human beings; they are entitled to \ntheir personal views just as we are. But as Justices, they are supposed \nto put those petty personal views and feelings aside. They are supposed \nto begin their inquiry by respecting the will of the people as \nreflected in the work of Congress and to defer to Congress unless the \nlaws we pass violate the Constitution. However, during the argument, it \nseemed that the Justices were second guessing the policy judgments that \nwere made during the extended legislative process. That is not the \npurpose or proper exercise of judicial review. Acting out based on \ntheir personal views in this matter would be the height of conservative \njudicial activism. Let me repeat that. Acting out based on their \npersonal views in this matter would be the height of conservative \njudicial activism.\n\n  The Chief Justice seemed to understand that deference to the elected \nbranch is fundamental to the proper exercise of judicial review. I was \nstruck that more than once he commented on the extreme arguments coming \nfrom other Justices by noting they were not being fair. Chief Justice \nRoberts was right in that regard.\n  I thought I saw--at least the day I watched--a Chief Justice who \nunderstands the importance of this case to all Americans, including \nthose millions who would otherwise continue without health care \ninsurance and access to affordable health care--the kind of health care \ninsurance and access to affordable health care each one of us in this \nChamber has and each member of the Supreme Court has. This case is also \nsignificant because of the impact it will have on the American people's \nview of the Supreme Court.\n  We all remember when the Chief Justice was nominated, and he \ntestified that if confirmed, he would act with judicial modesty, he \nwould honor precedent, and he would acknowledge the\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nlimited role of the judiciary and seek to bring the Court together. \nWhen I voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts as Chief Justice of the \nUnited States--and many of my Democratic colleagues voted the other \nway, and I respect them for that--I said that I was voting with hope \nand faith. I credited his testimony. I trusted that he would act to \nfulfill his responsibilities in accordance with the testimony he gave \nto the Senate.\n  I said then that if I thought he ``would easily reject precedent'' or \n``use his position on the Supreme Court as a bulwark for activism,'' I \nwould not have supported his confirmation. I contrasted the technical \nreasoning and unjust holding of Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott \ncase with the leadership that Chief Justice Warren provided in the \nunanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education. I spoke about the \nneed to curtail the current activism of the Supreme Court and for \nappropriate deference to congressional action taken by the people's \nelected representatives, which is precisely what should happen in the \nmatter currently before the Supreme Court.\n  I was encouraged by the assurances he gave during the confirmation \nprocess that he would respect congressional authority. Well, this case \nis a fundamental test. After all, he relied heavily during the hearing \non the recent Gonzales v. Raich decision as controlling precedent in \nupholding congressional authority to act under the Commerce Clause. He \nalso assured us that despite his previous record of advocacy, as Chief \nJustice he would not continue to urge additional restrictions on \nCongress's Spending Clause powers.\n  I trust that he will be a Chief Justice for all of us and that he has \na strong institutional sense of the proper role of the judicial branch. \nIt is the Supreme Court of the United States, not the Supreme Court of \nthe Democratic Party or the Republican Party; not the Supreme Court of \nliberals or conservatives but the Supreme Court of the United States. \nAnd the Chief Justice is the Chief Justice of the United States, all \n320 million of us. The conservative activism of recent years has not \nbeen good for the Court.\n  Given the ideological challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the \nextensive, supportive precedent, it would be extraordinary for the \nSupreme Court not to defer to Congress in this matter that so clearly \naffects interstate commerce. This case should not become an instance in \nwhich a conservative, activist majority on the Supreme Court intervenes \nby way of another 5 4 decision driven by ideology to rewrite the law. \nThe law is consistent with the understanding of the Constitution the \nCourt and the American people have had for the better part of a \ncentury, and should be upheld. To do otherwise would undoubtedly \nfurther erode the reputation and legitimacy of the Supreme Court.\n  Last month's Supreme Court argument gave me reason to hope the \nSupreme Court will do the right thing. The authority of Congress to \nenact the Affordable Care Act is firmly rooted in what previous \nCongresses enacted and the Supreme Court has upheld as constitutional \nover the last century to protect hardworking Americans. Working \nAmericans have long been required to pay for Social Security and \nMedicare by the deduction of taxes reflected in their paychecks every \nmonth. I said at the time that, after all, if they could overturn the \nAffordable Care Act, why couldn't they overturn Social Security or \nMedicare? There would be just as much reason to overturn those.\n  The key to the test for constitutionality under the Commerce Clause \nis whether the law substantially affects interstate commerce. That is \nthe long-established constitutional test supported time and time again \nby the Supreme Court. As a law passed by Congress passed to regulate a \nmarket that makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy, the Affordable Care \nAct is well within the limits set by the Supreme Court's own precedent \non Congress's Commerce Clause power.\n  The personal responsibility requirement that is the focus of the \nlegal challenge is necessary to ensure that Americans who have paid for \ntheir health care by buying health insurance are not stuck with paying \nthe $43 billion in health care costs incurred by millions of Americans \nwho do not buy health insurance and then must rely on expensive \nemergency health care when inevitably faced with medical problems. That \nis what Congress concluded after extensive study and debate and what we \nincluded in the text of the law itself. There is no question this act \nby Congress regulates matters undeniably affecting interstate commerce.\n  Even though this law easily meets the tests established by the \nSupreme Court's own precedent on the limits of the Commerce Clause, \npartisan opponents of President Obama want judges to override these \nlegislative decisions properly made by Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. They want to challenge the \nwisdom understood by generations of Supreme Court justices from the \ngreat Chief Justice John Marshall in upholding the constitutionality of \nthe national bank nearly 200 years ago to Justice Cardozo in finding \nSocial Security constitutional early in the last century.\n\n  The outlandish examples of hypothetical laws Congress has not passed \nreduce these matters to ridiculous absurdities. That may be popular in \nFederalist Society circles or on political blogs or to those who want \nto bind the Constitution enough to be on a bumper sticker slogan, but \nthey have no place in the Supreme Court's determination. There may come \na time when Congress passes a law that is law at the edge of its \nauthority, when the boundary of what should be seen as affecting \ncommerce needs to be more closely considered. That time may come. I \nhope it doesn't. That time may come, but this is not the time and this \nis not the case. The Affordable Care Act is squarely within \nlongstanding constitutional lawmaking to deal with an important \nnational problem.\n  For years, we have heard Republican Senators say that they do not \nwant judges making law from the bench. That is precisely what they are \nasking the Supreme Court to do in this case. Republican opponents lost \nin Congress. Their opposition and obstruction delayed but did not \nprevent enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Now they want \nconservative activists on the Supreme Court to intervene and turn their \npolicy disagreements into law by reading them into the Constitution. \nThat is wrong.\n  In his efforts to reach out to Republicans, the President adopted a \nmodel Republicans proposed in the 1990s so as not to replace private \ninsurance with a program of Government insurance like Medicare, but to \nrely on personal responsibility to obtain private insurance in the \nmarketplace or pay a tax penalty. What is telling about the partisan \nnature of these challenges is that many of those who now claim that \nthis is unconstitutional are the very ones who proposed it. Senate \nRepublicans were in favor of ensuring personal responsibility with an \nindividual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they are \nagainst it. Their views may have changed, their partisan interests may \nhave shifted, but the Constitution has not.\n  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of the \nAffordable Care Act. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost \nprescriptions are starting to receive help when trapped within a \ncoverage gap known as the ``donut hole.'' Since the Affordable Care Act \nwas signed into law, young adults in Vermont and around the country \nhave gained health insurance coverage by being able to stay on their \nparents' health insurance plans until their 26th birthdays. Americans \nare receiving preventative screening coverage with no deductible or co-\npay. The law is making possible more and better care while controlling \ncosts.\n  The Affordable Care Act builds on some of the cornerstones of \nAmerican economic security built over the last century. I believed that \nwhen it passed, and I still believe it today, that Congress acted \nwithin its constitutional authority to enact laws to help protect all \nAmericans. Just as some in this country disagreed when Congress passed \nSocial Security, the Court agreed that we acted within our authority to \ndo so. One may agree or disagree with parts of the Affordable Care Act, \nbut the fact is that Congress acted within its authority. I hope and \nhave faith that the Supreme Court will not overstep the judiciary's \nrole by substituting policy preferences for the legislative \ndeterminations of Congress.\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3126-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          HYDROPOWER POTENTIAL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, a strong economy needs affordable, \nabundant, and reliable energy. In recent years, Americans have \nexperienced higher prices for energy across the spectrum. This has led \nto an enormous growth in private and public research and development of \ninnovative and advanced energy technologies. These innovative \ntechnologies include fuel from algae, solar, and wind generation, \nbattery manufacturing, advanced nuclear, and many others.\n  I recently had an opportunity to visit with Virgil Vanderloo, of \nAckley, IA. It was immediately apparent that Virgil has a passion for \nnew and innovative ideas regarding hydroelectric power generation. \nVirgil does not have an engineering background he is a retired farmer. \nFor 30 years he farmed land in Hardin, Plymouth, and Woodbury Counties. \nIt is because of this time as a farmer that Virgil came to appreciate \nthe land and its rich natural resources. Now, he is pursing a concept \nto capture the power from our Nation's rivers to generate electricity.\n  After speaking with Mr. Vanderloo and reviewing the material he \ncompiled, he believes that his concept may have the potential to \nincrease the production of hydroelectricity and capture a renewable \nenergy source that currently goes uncollected. Mr. Vanderloo's concept \nincludes placing barges below dams fitted with water turbines to \nproduce electricity. He reasons that this type of electricity \ngeneration could be viable on the 30 or so dams along the Mississippi \nRiver. If viable, this concept could conceivably be implemented on many \nof the more than 50,000 nonpowered dams in the United States.\n  After all, the U.S. Department of Energy just last month published a \nstudy that indicated the United States could get as much as 12 \ngigawatts of energy per year by utilizing the hydropower potential of \nexisting dams. The idea proposed by Virgil could be one the innovations \nin hydropower technologies that could help us use existing dams to \ngenerate renewable energy.\n  I would like to make an appeal to hydroelectric designers and \nengineers to review the concept presented by Mr. Vanderloo. I have \nposted his information on the Internet which can be accessed at httP//\n1.usa.gov/JlA5Ky. I hope those with scientific and engineering \nexpertise in this area will review his proposal and contact him \ndirectly. It may have promise, and I hope this brings attention to his \nideas regarding hydroelectric power generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3126-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

SMITH, JR.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nCommander Merle J. Smith, Jr., of Mystic, CT, who was honored on April \n1, 2012, during the Coast Guard's annual Eclipse Week, as the first \nAfrican-American graduate of the Coast Guard Academy in 1966.\n  Founded in 1876 in New London, CT, the Coast Guard Academy has made \nfundamental progress since its first African-American cadet. Over the \npast decades, it has diversified its student body, provided support to \nunderrepresented students, and raised awareness about the Coast Guard, \nits Academy, and military training more generally among a wide range of \ncommunities. Commander Smith was honored this year with the inaugural \nMerle J. Smith Pioneer Award as one of the first to realize the ideal \nof minority participation and for his contributions to our Nation since \npaving the way for future cadets on that infamous graduation day.\n  After leaving the Academy, Commander Smith served in Vietnam in 1969, \ncommanding a patrol boat on more than 80 missions and becoming the \nfirst African-American member of the maritime service to earn a Bronze \nStar. While in the Coast Guard, he received a law degree from George \nWashington University, and after his military tenure, dedicated many \nyears as an attorney for Groton-based Electric Boat. Commander Smith \nalso taught at the Academy as a part-time law teacher and then later as \nan adjunct professor. He is a shining example of the wide range of \npossibilities offered to Academy graduates--whether they choose to \npursue a career in the military, in a civilian profession, such as the \nlaw, or both--and is a stellar role model for cadets past and present.\n  The Coast Guard and Coast Guard Academy began adopting equal \nopportunity policies in earnest when President Kennedy ordered the \ndiversification of the forces defending our coasts. Now, each year, the \nCoast Guard hosts Eclipse Week, a week-long effort to put its diversity \nefforts in the spotlight. Discussions on openness and inclusivity are \nfacilitated. Minority alumni are welcomed on campus to form \nrelationships with current and incoming Academy students as well as \ninterested high school students.\n  In addition to Commander Smith, the Coast Guard honored three other \nvaluable members of their community--partners in the pursuit of equal \nrepresentation--during this year's Eclipse Week. Frances Neal was \nawarded this year's Humanitarian Award for her legacy of lovingly \nserving food to cadets for 25 years. One of the Academy's most beloved \nequal opportunity officers, JoAnn P. Miller, or ``Mama Miller,'' as she \nwas affectionately called by cadets, was also celebrated. And, Vice \nAdmiral Manson K. Brown, a student of Commander Smith's, was given this \nyear's Genesis Award for his service as a Pacific Area commander and \nhis work founding the Genesis Club while attending the Academy--an \norganization still in existence that supports underrepresented cadets.\n  The Coast Guard promotes diversity not only though Eclipse Week, but \nalso by running community-based initiatives such as the U.S. Coast \nGuard Office of Diversity and its various programs, including Diversity \nChampion of the Week, Affinity Groups, and Strategic Education \nPartnerships. It also has an active Office of Inclusion and Diversity, \nheaded by Chief Diversity Officer, Antonio Farias, that facilitates \npartnerships between high school and college students, as well as \ncadets, so that citizens of all backgrounds can see what it means to \nwork towards a career in the Coast Guard and in the U.S. military. And, \nin 2011, Rear Admiral Sandra Stosz became the first female Service \nAcademy superintendent in our Nation's history. She was recently named \nas one of Newsweek's ``150 Women Who Shake the World.'' More than 30 \nyears ago, Eclipse Week's goal was racial inclusivity. Today, this \nyearly event aims to promote diversity more comprehensively.\n  Displayed in the historical archive of the Coast Guard's Web site, is \na photograph of Commander Smith on the day of his graduation, proudly \nshaking the hand of his father, Colonel Merle J. Smith, Sr., and \nsmiling at the camera. This image speaks of generational advancement, \ncommunity, and hope. However, the weathered sepia of the photograph of \nfather and son also reminds us that we cannot become complacent, stuck \nin stories of progress from previous decades. We must always be ready, \n``Semper Paratus,'' for progress. The theme of this year's\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nEclipse Week--``openness, inclusion, change''--is apt and inspiring for \nthe work ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3127-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING JOSEPH WILLIAM AUBIN\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, this past Sunday, the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Fund, VVMF, held a dedication ceremony on the \nNational Mall, commemorating ten courageous men whose names recently \nhave been carved on the black granite walls of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial.\n  One of them--a brave and beloved airman, Joseph William Aubin--hailed \nfrom Bridgeport, CT. On the morning of May 26, 1966, Chief Warrant \nOfficer Aubin, an experienced Chief Aviation Electronic Technician, was \nasked at the last minute to join a mission. He unquestioningly boarded \nthe Skywarrior aircraft with his team from NAS Cubi Point in the \nPhilippines to explore critical suspicious activity in Vietnam. On the \nway, he and his team encountered damaging weather conditions that \nunexpectedly doomed the engines. In this critical moment, Chief Warrant \nOfficer Aubin was instructed to ``bail out'' into the South China Sea. \nAlong with three of his team members, he died there.\n  Since that day in 1966, Chief Warrant Officer Aubin and the three \nother men who perished during the mission--ATR3 Richard Carl Hunt from \nGuys Mills, PA, LT Walter Allan Linzy from Nashville, AR, and ATR3 \nRichard Dwaine Stocker from Jacksonville, AR--have been remembered as \nthe ``Lost Back End Crew.'' Chief Warrant Officer Aubin's body was \nnever recovered, but he is no less deserving to be memorialized. Now, \nthe entire Nation can visit the site of the Vietnam Memorial to honor \nhim and his ultimate sacrifice.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Aubin will never be forgotten. Names carved \ninto the wall are written into our national memory and history for all \ngenerations to visit emotionally and physically. Newly inscribed names \nreaffirm the message that the Nation recalls all commemorated at this \nmemorial with deep gratitude and appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3127-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3127-S3128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING JOHN T. CYR AND SONS, INC.\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, today I wish to offer my \ncongratulations to John T. Cyr and Sons, Inc., on its 100th \nanniversary. This outstanding Maine company demonstrates why family \nbusinesses are so important to our Nation's economy and to communities \nin every State. The determination and vision that led to a century of \nsuccess define America's entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Sometime around 1903, John Thomas Cyr moved his family from Caribou, \nME--my hometown--to Old Town, near Bangor, where he found work in a \nlumber mill. Nine years later, in 1912, at the age of 51, John T. Cyr \nstruck out on his own. Joined by his son, Joseph, they started a livery \nstable and delivery business.\n  What began with horses, buggies, and wagons is today a thriving \nenterprise of 22 luxury motor coaches, 200 school buses, and nearly 250 \nemployees. A company that got its start hauling lumber for a local \ncanoe factory now serves 17 school districts across Maine with an \nexemplary safety record. They offer tours throughout the United States \nand Canada from New York City at Christmas to Washington, D.C., in \ncherry blossom season. As a native of Aroostook County, I know how \nvaluable their daily intercity service is to the towns and cities of \nnorthern Maine.\n  Handed down and nurtured through the generations, this is a true \nfamily business, owned and operated by the founder's grandson, Joe Cyr, \njoined by his brother, Pete, son Mike, and daughter Becky.\n  Their remarkable story of growth, of meeting challenges, and of \ndelivering value was expertly told in a recent article in Maine Trails \nmagazine. I would like to complement that account with my personal \nobservations.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I worked at Husson University in Bangor, \nwhere I had the pleasure of getting to know Joe Cyr, Class of 1962, and \nhis wonderful wife, Sue, Class of 1965. Joe has been a longtime member \nof the Husson Board of Trustees, and Sue been a volunteer supporter of \nuncommon energy. Joe and Sue's generosity to Husson includes \nsignificant gifts to athletic programs, a new home for the university \npresident, the annual fund, and most recently, the new Cyr Alumni \nCenter. The countless ways they serve--from the Boys Scouts and the Y \nto St. Joseph Hospital--touch people of all ages.\n  People throughout Maine are fortunate to have such a family as the \nCyrs, but I am especially lucky--my summer camp on Cold Stream Pond is \njust down the road from theirs. As much as I cherish our time together, \nhaving dinner, playing cards, and enjoying the beautiful Maine summer \nevenings, I cherish even more being in the presence of those who give \nso much to others and who see the act of giving as the greatest reward. \nI am delighted to extend my congratulations to the Cyr family in their \nbusiness's centennial year and to thank them for their contributions to \nthe State of Maine.\n  I ask that the Maine Trails article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the Maine Trails, Feb./Mar. 2012]\n\n                        Driving Through History\n\n                          (By Kathryn Buxton)\n\n\n  From horse drawn wagons to modern coaches and school buses, Cyr Bus \n Line travels through history into an elite club of 100-year-old Maine \n                               businesses\n\n       It's midday at Cyr Bus Line, and about a dozen drivers in \n     black company jackets are gathered, waiting for the next wave \n     of activity to begin. That's when the company's fleet of \n     school buses head out to pick up students for the trip home \n     from Old Town's high school, middle school and three \n     elementary schools. A fresh layer of snow covers the ground \n     outside, and everyone is alert and ready to get to work. \n     Outside, a coach bus pulls in to the lot, returning from its \n     daily run to Aroostook County. The bus will be washed down \n     and ready for its 6 p.m. departure from downtown Bangor.\n       It is a scene that has played out countless times over the \n     past 100 years since John T. Cyr and his son Joseph founded \n     the company on South Water Street in 1912. Previous to that, \n     John had been working for the Jordan Lumber Company in Old \n     Town. Joseph had been working for the Old Town Woolen Mill. \n     They applied for a trucking license and were approved by the \n     Old Town city council on May 21, 1912. John and Joseph had \n     two horses and the company's frst jobs were hauling lumber \n     for Old Town Canoe. The Cyrs also operated a livery stable at \n     the family homestead on French Island (also known as Treat-\n     Webster Island), and for many years, the Cyr stable was the \n     go-to place if you needed a horse and buggy to visit friends \n     or family. The company's wagons and carriages also delivered \n     mail and served as hearses, transporting local citizens to \n     their fnal resting place.\n\n\n                            Fathers and Sons\n\n       John T. Cyr & Sons, Inc./Cyr Bus Line celebrates its 100th \n     anniversary this year, putting it in an elite group of Maine \n     companies that have been in business for a century or more. \n     Old Town Canoe, located nearby in Old Town is one. Another is \n     the famous outdoor retailer L.L. Bean, which as Mike Cyr is \n     quick to point out, is also celebrating its 100th anniversary \n     this year.\n       ``Cyr Bus is a fxture here,'' said Mike Cyr, one of a \n     fourth generation of Cyrs to work in the family business. ``A \n     lot of people figured we had already been here for 100 \n     years.''\n       For the Cyrs, a century of company history is inextricably \n     meshed with the family history. Through the years many family \n     members have left their mark on the business. Four of John's \n     five sons--Joseph, Albert, Arthur and Harvey--all worked for \n     the company in its infancy (Clibby, a ffth son who worked in \n     the woolen mill, eventually became an Old Town firefighter). \n     Albert, 19 and a weaver at the Old Town Woolen Mill in 1912, \n     was a silent partner for many years, coming on board full-\n     time as the business continued to grow through the 1920s. \n     Arthur and Harvey, young children when their father and \n     brothers founded the company, grew up in the business and \n     eventually joined their brother Albert in running the company \n     in the 1930s and 40s after their father and brother died \n     unexpectedly in 1934. Harvey bought out his brothers in 1951. \n     Today, the company is run by Harvey's son, Joe Cyr. His \n     brother, Pete, works in the company's body shop. Joe's son, \n     Mike, oversees the company's coach division and manages \n     information technology--everything from the company's two-way \n     radio system to its computer hardware and software. Daughter \n     Becky Whitmore is the bookkeeper. Helping them these days, is \n     general manager Rick Soules, who the Cyrs hired not quite two \n     years ago. Bringing Rick in was a necessity as the company \n     has grown and diversified, and as Joe, now 71, has begun to \n     scale back the time he spends at the office.\n       Working with family has always been one of the great joys \n     of the business, according to family patriarch and company \n     president, Joe Cyr, with the business officially for nearly \n     50 years.\n       Joe drove trucks for H.E. Sargent and worked as a surveyor \n     for James W. Sewall\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\n     during the summers before coming to work at Cyr with his dad. \n     His memories of working alongside family go even further \n     back--to being with his dad in the office when he was six or \n     seven, driving a company truck when he was 11 and washing \n     buses as a kid. At 15, he was driving buses for the family \n     concern. He also found time to get his degree from Old Town \n     High School and a year of study at University of Maine at \n     Farmington and another year and a half at Husson College. He \n     left school and joined the company full-time in 1962 when a \n     cousin who had been the company bookkeeper died. For a while, \n     Joe was not only the bookkeeper, he served as the company \n     mechanic, secretary and payroll clerk. In just a few years, \n     Joe was running the company, and after his father Harvey died \n     in 1967, he bought the business from his mother for $25,000.\n       Looking back, Joe said he has never regretted the decision \n     to spend his professional life at the helm of the family firm \n     and he always has considered himself honored to work \n     alongside his father, son, daughter, brother and cousins. \n     ``Frankly, I feel pretty darn lucky,'' said Cyr talking from \n     his winter home in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida where there \n     is a small community of Old Town snowbirds. Joe started \n     heading south in the winter 10 years ago, but he still \n     maintains close contact with Mike, Rick Soules--Cyr's general \n     manager--and others via phone and e-mail several times a day. \n     And he reels off facts about the business in quickfire \n     fashion. How many vehicles in the company fleet? ``250.'' How \n     many coaches? ``22.'' How many square feet at the company's \n     headquarters?\n       ``We've got about 20,000 under cover there,'' said Cye, \n     stopping only to calculate the many expansions they have made \n     at the 10-acre site since 1980.\n\n\n                       milestones and challenges\n\n       The company has lived through good times and bad. There was \n     1934 when the family's two male patriarchs died--John in May \n     and Joseph in August. There were also two devastating fires \n     at the company's headquarters on French Island. The first was \n     in the early 1950s and the company garage and its full fleet \n     of eight buses were destroyed. The second fire hit in 1970, \n     destroying the company garage, an apartment over the garage \n     and one bus. In both cases, the family and employees came \n     together to get buses back on the road quickly.\n       There were good times, as well. Nineteen hundred and \n     twenty-two was an important landmark. That was when John and \n     Joseph Cyr helped usher in the era of the automobile. They \n     bought the company's first motorcars--Studebakers--to \n     transport Old Town children to school. Four years later, \n     after housing the company fleet at several different \n     locations in Old Town, Cyr consolidated its operations at a \n     single location on French Island. The area was growing, and \n     by the early 1930s, cars were no longer large enough to \n     transport all the students traveling to Old Town schools from \n     Stillwater and Gillman Falls. So the city asked Cyr to buy a \n     bus.\n       Cyr also had a taxi service, begun soon after the company's \n     founding, as well as freight hauling and storage services. By \n     the late 1930s, brothers Albert, Arthur and Harvey were also \n     operating a regular bus service connecting Old Town, Great \n     Works, Milford and Bradley, with special runs to locations \n     including Trenton and Green Lake. By the mid 1940s, the \n     company's regular motor coach routes had expanded to include \n     Old Town, Eddington, North Brewer and Bangor.\n       The company also operated a limousine service, and during \n     the war transported German prisoners of war for the U.S. \n     Government to detention camps in the rural reaches of the \n     state. In the late 1950s and early 60s, Harvey, now head of \n     the company, expanded its stake in the school bus business. \n     By 1962, Joe had joined his father, Harvey, in the business \n     full-time, and John T. Cyr & Sons boasted a fleet of 12 \n     buses, several cars and two dump trucks at its headquarters \n     on French Island.\n       In 1976, Joe purchased the fleet of Pinecrest Bus Service, \n     the company that had been providing school bus service to the \n     city of Brewer (two years later, Cyr bought Pinecrest's lot \n     and garage). Then, Cyr bid for the contract to serve the \n     Bangor school system in 1978. They won the business. The \n     ramifcations were enormous for the small family-run firm. It \n     required purchasing more than two dozen new school buses at a \n     cost of about $17,000 each. It was one of the few times since \n     Joe had taken the helm they had to borrow money, but it was, \n     Mike recalled, a calculated risk his dad felt he had to take.\n       ``He figured if he didn't do it, one of the big guys would \n     come in and take the business,'' said Mike. That year, there \n     was a 60-cent-per-gallon run up in fuel costs which caused \n     several anxious hours for the Cyrs. At the time, fuel for \n     buses was purchased by the bus company. Now, it is common for \n     school systems to purchase their own fuel, and Joe Cyr said \n     that adds more stability to contracts. Still, it all worked \n     out well. ``I still hate to borrow money, though,'' admitted \n     Joe recently.\n       Perhaps the biggest milestone came when the city was in the \n     midst of a two-decade effort to redevelop French Island that \n     had, over the years, become increasingly overcrowded. As a \n     result, Cyr moved its headquarters across the river to its \n     current location at 153 Gilman Falls Avenue in Old Town in \n     1980. Long-time local residents can still remember the day in \n     late October when the company's fleet of buses made their way \n     across the bridge from the island to Cyr's new home on Gilman \n     Falls Avenue.\n       Over the years, the Cyrs have also been active in the \n     community. The business has been a long-time member of the \n     MBTA where Joe has served as a board member. Joe was for \n     several years president of the Bangor Chamber of Commerce \n     during the 1980s and has sat on several boards, including St. \n     Joseph's Hospital and Merrill Merchant Bank. The family was a \n     major contributor to the Cyr Family Field House at the Old \n     Town-Orono YMCA completed in 2001.\n\n\n                             close at hand\n\n       In 1984, Cyr took over the Aroostook County route, operated \n     by Bangor & Aroostook Railroad (B & A) since 1957 when the \n     railroad had ceased service to The County. The same day B & A \n     shuttered its service, Cyr bought the firm's coach bus and \n     hired its driver. Passengers didn't miss a day of service. \n     Today Cyr continues to run the daily transportation lifeline \n     to the county, connecting Bangor, Caribou, Fort Kent, \n     Houlton, Howland, Limestone, Oakfield, Orono, Madawaska, Mars \n     Hill, Medway, Presque Isle, Sherman and Van Buren. (The \n     service, considered an essential transportation link, \n     receives an operating subsidy from MaineDOT.) A Cyr bus \n     departs Bangor every afternoon and makes the return trip from \n     Presque Isle every morning.\n       In 1990, the company purchased North-star Tours and began \n     offering charter tours throughout the country and to Canada \n     as Cyr Northstar Tours. In 2003, Cyr purchased Maine Line \n     Tours & Charters, a South Portland-based division of Peter \n     Pan Bus Lines. The move made John T. Cyr Maine's largest \n     charter operation, and in 2004, the company was honored as \n     Metro magazine's tour operator of the year. Nonetheless, the \n     long hours and splitting energies between operations in Old \n     Town and Southern Maine took its toll. The Cyrs sold the \n     South Portland charter operation in 2007.\n       ``It was profitable,'' remembered Mike of the decision to \n     sell. ``But we just weren't comfortable being in two places \n     at one time.'' Today the company operations have become \n     increasingly complex, with three divisions and increasing \n     federal regulations regarding hours of service for the \n     company's long-distance drivers and expanded environmental \n     requirements on buses. At the same time, this year, the Cyrs \n     estimate, their buses will log more than 3 million miles. \n     Mike describes the Cyr philosophy as one that has grown from \n     his dad's unique combination of conservative fiscal approach, \n     a hands-on understanding of the business and a willingness to \n     step up when someone presents a challenge. Much of their \n     business--in both the school bus and tour charter divisions--\n     comes to them through word-of-mouth. ``My dad hardly ever \n     says `no,' '' said Mike. ``Someone asks us to do something, \n     and we fgure out how to get it done.''\n       ``We could have grown a lot more,'' said Joe. ``Instead we \n     take what comes and do the best job we can. We're not trying \n     to be the biggest.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3128-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3128-S3129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LORIN JOHNSTON\n\n Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Master \nPolice Officer Lorin Johnston of the Chattanooga Police Department who \nwas one of ten law enforcement officers honored at the White House on \nSaturday as a National Association of Police Organizations TOP COP. The \nTOP COPS awards pay tribute to law enforcement officers for actions \nabove and beyond the call of duty.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations states:\n\n       Officer Lorin Johnston has lived one of a cop's worst \n     nightmares. On a bright spring morning last April, Officer \n     Johnston, along with three other officers, investigated a \n     silent alarm at a pawn shop, indicating that an armed robbery \n     was in progress. As soon as they arrived, they were spotted \n     by the suspect, who engaged them in a frantic gun battle. \n     During the gunfight, Johnston was struck by a bullet in the \n     middle of the back, despite his vest.\n       As the perp tried to flee out a side door, Sgt. Tim Chapin, \n     Johnston's close personal friend, was waiting in his patrol \n     car. The suspect took aim at the car, shooting straight \n     through the windshield. Sgt. Chapin hit the gas and knocked \n     the suspect down, causing him to drop the .45-caliber Glock \n     he was carrying along with a loaded clip of ammunition.\n       Assuming he had disarmed the robber, Sgt. Chapin jumped out \n     of the car and gave chase. Then, without warning, the suspect \n     pulled out a second gun, turned and fired. His bullet struck \n     Chapin squarely in the face, killing him instantly. Just then \n     Officer Johnston came on the scene as the cop-killer was \n     running around the corner, where he was pursued, and \n     ultimately taken down by two other brave officers. Johnston \n     knelt protectively over his friend, shielding him until help \n     arrived. Not until he received medical treatment did Officer \n     Johnston realize he had taken a second bullet to the leg. \n     Johnston's courage and loyalty, despite his own injuries, \n     make him a living testament to the outstanding qualities \n     found only in America's TOP COPS.\n\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n\n  Lorin Johnston's acts of selflessness and heroism in the line of duty \nexemplify the meaning of true public service. As a former mayor of \nChattanooga, I am particularly proud and grateful for the bravery and \ndedication of officers like Lorin Johnston who enter into harm's way in \norder to keep us safe.\n  As we honor Officer Johnston, we also remember Sergeant Tim Chapin, a \n26-year veteran of the Chattanooga Police Department, for paying the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  I am proud to join my fellow Tennesseans in congratulating Officer \nJohnston on this well-deserved honor and in remembering law enforcement \nofficers across the country who go above and beyond the call of duty to \nkeep our communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3129-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE NEVADA MILITARY SUPPORT ALLIANCE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to recognize an \norganization from my home State of Nevada whose continuous support of \nmilitary servicemen and women and their families is truly inspiring. \nTheir unwavering commitment to military families across the Silver \nState is unmatched and demonstrates their passion for those in need.\n  Members of our military serve the United States to preserve and \nprotect our freedom, and for that I am forever grateful. They dedicate \ntheir lives to serving this great nation and constantly make sacrifices \nto ensure the safety of our country. Generations of Americans enjoy \ngreater peace and security because of the tireless efforts of these \nbrave men and women.\n  The Nevada Military Support Alliance provides comfort and care, both \npersonal and financial, to the families and survivors of Nevada's \nfallen and returning patriots. When a soldier does come home from a war \nzone, returning to civilian life is not an easy task. Both the soldier \nand their families experience an incredible amount of stress during \nthis transition. This is where the Nevada Military Support Alliance \nsteps in. They offer unprecedented levels of assistance for Nevada \nmilitary members and their families for the rarities of challenges they \nface on a day-to-day basis.\n  We can never do enough for our nation's veterans, but with the help \nof the Nevada Military Support Alliance, we can ensure that more \nassistance is provided. Their continued dedication to our active \nmilitary, veterans, and their families is unparalleled and stands as an \nexample for us all.\n  As the Nevada Military Support Alliance celebrates their Second \nAnnual Gala this weekend, I want to thank them for everything they have \ngiven to Nevada's men and women in uniform and for ensuring that \nsupport is provided for these heroes. We owe our veterans and their \nfamilies a great deal of gratitude for their personal sacrifices. On \nbehalf of everyone who enjoys the freedoms that are unique to our great \nnation, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3129-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3129-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3129-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, and requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 5326.

A bill to allow funds under title II of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to be used to provide training to \nschool personnel regarding how to recognize child sexual abuse; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Hutchison, to introduce bipartisan legislation that would \nexpand No Child Left Behind professional development funding to include \ntraining for teachers and school personnel on how to recognize signs of \nsexual abuse in students.\n  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, \n695,000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2010. Approximately \n9.2 percent, or 63,940 children, were victims of sexual abuse; this is \nan increase from 7.6 percent in 2009.\n  Recent events have shown that warning signs of sexual abuse in \nchildren are being missed. The vast majority of States mandate that \nteachers report suspicions of child abuse, yet not all States require \nteachers to participate in training.\n  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, 60 \npercent of all reports of child abuse and neglect are made by \nprofessionals, yet only 16 percent of abuse and neglect is reported by \neducation personnel.\n  Given the amount of time teachers and school personnel spend with \nchildren, it is of absolute importance that the warning signs of child \nsexual abuse be identified, reported, and acted on. It is critical to \nmake sure all school personnel have access to training on how to \nrecognize child sexual abuse.\n  The Helping Schools Protect Our Children Act of 2012 expands the list \nof allowable uses for Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nTitle II funding to permit States to use this funding to train \nteachers, principals, and other school personnel on how to recognize \nchild sexual abuse. Under current law, Title II provides grants to \nStates for a variety of purposes related to recruitment, retention, and \nprofessional development of K 12 teachers and principals. Our bill \nwould allow professional development funds in schools to be used to \nprovide teachers with the tools to recognize child sexual abuse.\n  I am proud that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senate Minority Whip \nJon Kyl, and my colleague Senator Frank Lautenberg have joined me as \noriginal cosponsors on this bill.\n  It is essential that as mandated reporters, school personnel should \nhave the proper training to recognize child abuse. When there are no \nwitnesses, what happens behind closed doors in an abusive home can scar \na child for a lifetime. The more we learn to recognize the signs of \nabuse or neglect, the better we will foster a safe environment for \nyoung people to learn and grow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a \nvocational and technical entrepreneurship development program; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Vocational and \nTechnical Entrepreneurship Development Act to provide critically needed \nsupport to help expand entrepreneurship education programs for young \nadults. At a time when young adults ages 18 24 face an unemployment \nrate of approximately twice the national average, it is more important \nthan ever to provide additional resources to help them start their own \nbusiness. Young entrepreneurs need our help to give them the skills \nnecessary to turn their passion into a successful career.\n  The Vocational and Technical Entrepreneurship Development Act \nprovides support through small business development centers for high \nschools, technical schools, and nonprofit organizations serving young \nadults to develop and implement entrepreneurship education programs. \nEntrepreneurs who have access to business education programs are more \nlikely to succeed, which often translates to jobs not only for them but \nfor their communities as well. Small businesses are the engine of our \neconomy and the ingenuity of young American entrepreneurs will continue \nto help drive our economic growth in the future. It is critical that we \ndo everything possible to support our young entrepreneurs and harness \ntheir great ideas today that will turn into jobs tomorrow. I ask my \ncolleagues to support job growth and the entrepreneurs who are the \nfuture of our economy by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3175. A bill to amend subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, \nUnited States Code, to authorize certain employees to be automatically \nenrolled to increase contributions to Thrift Savings Plan accounts; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Save More \nTomorrow Act of 2012. This act seeks to make a modest, commonsense \nmodification to the Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, which is the tax-\ndeferred, defined contribution plan for Federal employees, similar to \nprivate sector 401(k) plans.\n  The Save More Tomorrow Act would build on the Thrift Savings Plan \nEnhancement Act of 2009, which was enacted with support from large, \nbipartisan majorities in Congress. Under the Thrift Savings Plan \nEnhancement Act, new Federal employees are automatically enrolled in \nthe TSP unless they opt out, with a default employee contribution rate \nof 3 percent of basic pay. This legislation would adjust the TSP's \nautomatic enrollment mechanism to allow it to automatically increase \nemployee contributions, unless the employee chooses a different \ncontribution rate. To accomplish this, the bill authorizes the Federal \nRetirement Thrift Investment Board, the agency that administers the \nTSP, to pair the current auto enrollment at 3 percent with automatic \nescalation of 1 percent per year, for at least 2 consecutive years \nfollowing the first year of enrollment. This promotes a goal of the \nFederal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, often referred to as \nFERSA, which was designed to encourage Federal employees to save at \nleast 5 percent of their pay in the TSP.\n  This ``three plus one plus one'' model closely mirrors the model \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\nprescribed for the private sector in the Pension Protection Act of \n2006, which Mr. Boehner of Ohio introduced, the House and Senate passed \nwith significant bipartisan support, and President George W. Bush \nsigned into law. In enacting the Pension Protection Act, Congress \nendorsed pairing automatic enrollment with automatic escalation, by \nincentivizing companies to automatically enroll employees in 401(k) \nplans at no less than a 3 percent savings rate, and automatically \nescalate that rate by at least 1 percent for at least 3 years.\n  This act is informed by rigorous oversight I have conducted as \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \nFederal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. For example, at a \nrecent Subcommittee hearing, Dr. Brigitte Madrian, a Harvard Kennedy \nSchool professor and leading expert on employer-sponsored retirement \nsavings plans, stated, ``the evidence from the private sector is that \nautomatic escalation is, in fact, extremely effective at increasing \nemployee savings rates. And you asked specifically is this [automatic \nescalation] something that should be considered for the Thrift Savings \nPlan, and I would say absolutely.''\n  To preempt any possible misconceptions or misunderstandings that may \narise regarding this act, I want to be clear from the outset about \nwhich employees the Save More Tomorrow Act applies to, and the \nvoluntary nature of the bill. Since this act builds on the statutory \nframework established by the Thrift Savings Enhancement Act, it only \napplies to newly hired Federal employees who are eligible to \nparticipate in the TSP's automatic enrollment feature. Additionally, \njust like the TSP's auto enrollment feature, auto escalation authorized \nby this act would be voluntary, and allow participants to terminate \ndefault contributions, or change contribution rates, at any time.\n  This bill has a limited, targeted scope. It would increase the \nsavings only of the small percentage of new employees who enroll in the \nTSP, but do not raise their contribution rate enough to reach the goal \nCongress established with FERSA of having most Federal employees \ncontributing at least 5 percent of basic pay. Under the Thrift Savings \nPlan Enhancement Act, an impressive 97.2 percent of new Federal \nemployees are enrolling in the TSP--82,632 Federal employees have been \nautomatically enrolled in the TSP since the practice began in August \n2010. Most of those employees increase their contributions far above \nthe default rate of 3 percent. These enrollees boast an average TSP \nsavings rate of 12.1 percent. Currently, only about 9 percent of \nemployees in the Federal Employee Retirement System enrolled in the TSP \ncontribute less than 5 percent.\n  Of course, one must not confuse this act's limited scope with the \npotential benefits. From the most recent survey of TSP participants, we \nknow that just like in the private sector, low-income workers who can \nleast afford to forgo matching contributions are the most likely to do \nso. Lower-income Federal employees are more than twice as likely as \nhigher-income employees to cite automatic enrollment as the reason they \nare contributing to the TSP. Many employees who contribute less than 5 \npercent are not even aware of the benefits of increasing the amount \nthey save--18 percent of this group reported they did not contribute 5 \npercent because they were unaware agencies matched contributions \ndollar-for-dollar on the first 3 percent of basic pay, and 50 cents on \nthe dollar for the next 2 percent.\n  Today's Federal workers must plan carefully to ensure their \nretirement security. Fortunately, the vast majority of the Federal \nemployees are responsibly saving for retirement, exhibiting average \nsavings rates that are far greater than the private sector. However, I \nam concerned that the most financially vulnerable Federal employees, \nindividuals earning less than $25,000 a year, are saving at a lower \nrate that will hinder their ability to retire with dignity. We should \nbuild on the success of the Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act by \nmaking it as easy as possible for employees to increase their \ncontributions.\n  The Save More Tomorrow Act is a limited, yet effective legislative \nresponse to do just this. Informed by rigorous data from real world \nexperiences in the private sector, this act represents the best in \nserious, evidence-based policymaking. The modest authorities provided \nby the Save More Tomorrow Act will enhance the Federal Retirement \nThrift Investment Board's ability to meet FERSA's goal of encouraging \nTSP contributions of 5 percent of pay. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Wood gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country \n     in support of the mission in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the members of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, \n     25th Infantry Division are now returning to Alaska to their \n     proud families and to an appreciative and admiring country;\n       Whereas the strength and unflinching support of the \n     families of the members of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat \n     Team, 25th Infantry Division have made the United States as \n     strong as it is today; and\n       Whereas the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry \n     Division has served with courage, compassion, and \n     selflessness, and has earned the respect of not only \n     Alaskans, but of all people of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the members of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat \n     Team, 25th Infantry Division for their exemplary service to \n     the United States and the completion of their first \n     deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; and\n       (2) recognizes the service and sacrifice of the members of \n     the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division \n     and their families.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the 1st \nStryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division from Fort \nWainwright, AK upon completion of their deployment to Afghanistan in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom. I am pleased to offer a \nresolution with Senator Lisa Murkowski to recognize the service of \nthese Arctic Wolves and honor the 21 brave soldiers who made the \nultimate sacrifice for the Nation.\n  Deployed to Kandahar, one of the most volatile areas of Afghanistan, \nthe 1/25 SBCT conducted more than 7,500 patrols and over 60 named \noperations. They made significant gains against insurgents in the \nSouthern region. Our nation will forever be grateful to them and we \nwill never forget those who perished or were wounded during their tour.\n  We must also never forget Private Danny Chen. While the actions of \nthose involved in the maltreatment of Private Chen are not a reflection \nof the honorable service of thousands of others in the brigade, abuse \nand hazing of another individual must never be tolerated under any \ncircumstances. Private Chen was a son, he was a friend, he was a \nsoldier. He will be remembered.\n  I also want to thank the families of the Arctic Wolves for their \nservice and sacrifice. The support of their loved ones gives strength \nto our military.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking the Arctic Wolves and \ntheir families for the sacrifices they make every day on behalf of our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/14/senate-section/article/S3133-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
