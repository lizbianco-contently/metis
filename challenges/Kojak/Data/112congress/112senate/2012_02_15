Madam President, we are here today as a result of stalling \nby my Republican colleagues. We have a judge for whom the vote was \noverwhelmingly in his favor. It was 89 for him, with 4 or 5 against him \non a motion to proceed. But now we are being forced to eat up 30 hours \nof valuable time, just sitting around and doing nothing. It is really \nunfortunate.\n  We have not confirmed the judge yet because under the rules I have \nhad to file cloture on this noncontroversial judge. After I file \ncloture, and cloture is invoked, and then the Republicans get 30 hours \nunder the Senate rules. This has happened scores of times--scores of \ntimes--during the past year, all last year, and certainly it is already \nhappening this year. We can't move to anything unless we file cloture.\n  Early in this Congress, Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico, Merkley of \nOregon, and others suggested the rules be changed, and in good faith a \nnumber of Senators believed: Well, let's see how the system works if we \nmake a few minor changes--hoping things would get better because they \nwere told they would get better. We were told the other side would not \nmake us file motions to proceed to every piece of legislation that came \nup. Absolutely untrue. We have virtually had to file cloture on \neverything. We have wasted weeks of this Congress, months of this \nCongress, on dilatory tactics.\n  We have a bill before this body that is so very important, creating 2 \nmillion jobs. Is it something that Senator Boxer, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Inhofe, the ranking member, just dreamed up and \nsaid let's try something new for a change? No. The legislation allowing \nus to have a highway system expires at the end of March. So we have to \ndo something.\n  This isn't something where Senator Boxer said: Well, I think this is \na great idea. Her idea is not unique, nor is Senator Inhofe's idea \nunique. It goes back to when Eisenhower was a major in the Army, and he \nwas asked to bring a caravan of vehicles across the country. He was \nstruck with this idea when he saw that the roads were awful. So after \nhis successful tour of duty in the military and he became President of \nour country, he decided he wanted to do something about it.\n  Here is what President Eisenhower did: He got the Congress to \nappropriate $50 billion. In today's dollars, that would be $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion. He got that through Congress. He wanted to build about 50,000 \nmiles of roads in this country so that when another young major was \ndirected to bring military vehicles across the country, he would have \nroads, highways, and freeways to do\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\nthat. Eisenhower said it would free the Nation from the ``antiquated \nshackles of secondary roads.'' That is what General Eisenhower said. It \nwould give America a modern highway system for moving people and goods \nacross the country.\n  Presidents since that period of time have recommitted to this idea. \nJohnson did it. Someone who spoke about it as much, if not more, than \nanyone since Eisenhower was President Reagan. Reagan said:\n\n       Common sense tells us it will cost a lot less to keep the \n     [transportation] system we have in good repair than let it \n     disintegrate and have to start over.\n\n  Since those 8 years of President Reagan, here is where we are today. \nWe have 70,000 bridges in this country that are in a state of \ndisrepair. They are unsafe.\n  I was in a meeting yesterday where they talked about a bridge in \nReno, NV, that was built during the Depression by the Works Progress \nAdministration. I was meeting with a flood control district from Washoe \nCounty, NV, and they said they have a bridge--a beautiful bridge--that \nis so unsafe they will not let schoolbuses drive over it anymore with \nkids in it. The bus can go without kids in it. There are hundreds and \nhundreds of bridges in our country in this same state of disrepair.\n\n  It is time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and this bill \ndoes it in a good way. We talk about this system as if it didn't have \nany bearing on individuals, but people's lives depend on it--not only \non the bridge I just talked about, but the highways I talked about and \nthe sidewalks. We have a person injured or killed as a pedestrian every \n7 minutes in the United States. Why? Because they are walking in unsafe \nconditions. There are lots of roads back here in Washington and lots of \nthem in Nevada where there are no sidewalks. So investing in our \ninfrastructure, as I have said, and I continue to say, will create 2 \nmillion jobs.\n  The Republican caucus is not doing this all in one big band. There \nare a few Republican Senators over there who are ruining it for \neverybody. No one can accuse Jim Inhofe of being some radical liberal. \nHe represents the State of Oklahoma. So what do we have here? We have \n100 amendments that have been filed already on this bill. Very few of \nthem are related to the bill. We have an amendment that some refer to \nas an abortion amendment, we have some referring to an amendment \ndealing with contraceptives, and we have an amendment to cut off aid to \nEgypt.\n  Now, tell me, what in the world does aid to Egypt have to do with \nthis highway bill? We have a Foreign Relations Committee. They have TV \ncameras there. Let them have a hearing in that committee, and the \nperson offering the amendment can make his speech before the Foreign \nRelations Committee. There is no chance of this amendment passing. \nNone. Zero.\n  Senator McCain is going to Egypt next week. Why? Because he is a \nperson who is an expert in foreign affairs. He is respected around the \nworld, and he is going to go there to try to work with the Egyptians to \nresolve some of these problems. He does not even want this amendment to \nbe voted on. He has told me that.\n  We have an amendment to keep poisons out of the air. It is called \nBoiler MACT. It is to keep arsenic and mercury and stuff out of the \nair--excuse me, to keep it in the air. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, chairman of that committee.\n  We have an amendment that takes us back to Keystone--building a \npipeline from Canada to the southern part of our country. I would \nconsider that or take a look at it. If they were going to use American \nproducts in doing that and the oil would be used in the United States, \nI might even consider that. I am not sure, but I would consider it. But \nthat is not where we are.\n  So we have a handful of Republican Senators holding up what we are \ndoing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the leader.\n  First, I just want to thank the Leader so much for his remarks this \nmorning. They are so close to my heart. Frankly, they are close to the \nhearts of the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nall the committees that have done their work in a bipartisan way. It is \na unique moment when we have four committees complete their work and \nhere we sit.\n  Before I ask my question, I think the people of this country need to \nunderstand what is going on. We are wasting, as my friend said, minute \nafter minute, hour after hour, day after day because Republican \nSenators, for whatever their reasons, want to bring progress in this \ncountry to a halt, to a stop. We have to wonder, is this politically \nmotivated?\n  As my friend said, 2 million jobs are at stake. I would say to my \nfriend, it is actually up to 2.8 million because there are 1.8 million \njobs we protect, and up to 1 million new jobs we would create because \nof the bipartisan cooperation we have had across the board in the \nSenate on the highway bill. So I thank my friend.\n  My question is, Is my friend aware we have more than 1,000 \norganizations representing millions of Americans who are Republicans \nand Democrats and Independents, who work out there on the roads or who \nare the business leaders from the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL CIO, \nto the general contractors or the granite people--it goes on and on--\nthe cement people, to the coal ash people, and the fact is a thousand \ngroups are out there and they are watching us, minute after minute?\n  I hope this is an opportunity to tell them to activate their people \nand let them know why we are not passing a bill that will save or \ncreate 2.8 million jobs and help our businesses across the board and \nhelp our States. When we talk about safety, as my friend pointed out, \nSenator Inhofe tells an eloquent story of a woman killed in Oklahoma \nwalking with her child under a bridge and concrete falls on her. She is \ngone, and he is so motivated by that.\n  So I hope my friend will address whether he is aware of the broad \nsupport in America for this bill regardless of party label.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my friend from California that \nyesterday I gave some remarks, and the outline of the speech mentioned \nthere were scores of organizations supporting this bill. I looked at \nthat and said to myself: There are hundreds and hundreds of \norganizations supporting this bill. So I recognize that, I say to my \nfriend, the chairman of that committee.\n  To rub salt in the wound of what we are going through, the House of \nRepresentatives, led by the Republican caucus--which is overwhelmingly \ntea party--decided they were going to do some legislation.\n  That is dandy. Their legislation is so bad that the Congressional \nBudget Office said it would bankrupt the trust fund. We are trying to \nreplenish the trust fund; they are bankrupting the trust fund. But as I \nhear on the news this morning, the Republican caucus over in the House \nis fractured, and now they can't figure out what to do with that bill. \nThey are thinking, maybe we will break it into three different pieces. \nEven with the power of the tea party, it is so obnoxious and so out of \ncontrol, that piece of legislation, they appear they are not going to \nallow a vote to take place on that bill itself because it is so bad.\n  There is a simple way to avoid this headache; that is, Democrats and \nRepublicans work together. We are here. We want to do this. Let's \nassume that I decide to file cloture on this bill. What I would do is \nhave a substitute amendment. Let's say I decide to do that. I can't \nimagine why the Republicans wouldn't join with us in doing that. If \nthere is something in the substitute that I disagree with, the \namendment process is still there. To not allow the bill to go forward \nis repulsive. I can't imagine how a majority of the Republicans who say \nthey want this bill done wouldn't allow us at least to get on the bill \nitself and move forward with amendments.\n  I am terribly disappointed where we are. I hope the House will take a \npage out of our playbook over here and work together, as Boxer and \nInhofe have done, to come up with a bill that is a good bill. That bill \nwe are trying to get through was passed unanimously out of committee. \nSo I am cautiously optimistic that the American people will see what is \ngoing on and put some pressure on my Republican colleagues to get this \nbill passed. It is just unfair what is happening on this and other \npieces of legislation.\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S663-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 2105\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I do wish to speak about the fiscal \nyear 2013 budget that came out this week from the President, and I \nguess I would start by saying here we go again. Here we go again.\n  We have another budget given to us by the President that increases \nspending and increases taxes to a huge extent. It is stunning, $1.9 \ntrillion in tax increases in the President's proposal over the next \ndecade.\n  Instead of coming forward and giving responsible solutions to a $1 \ntrillion annual deficit--which is what we have, $1 trillion. My gosh, \nwe didn't even have debt that was $1 trillion. Now we have debt that is \nalmost $16 trillion, and we are talking about more deficits?\n  Most important, the President didn't put anything in his budget on \nentitlement reform. So he gave us another budget proposal that spends \ntoo much, borrows too much, and taxes too much, which is the same thing \nthat happened last year.\n  The President's request proposes $11 trillion in gross new debt--$11 \ntrillion in gross new debt--over the next 10 years that would make our \ntotal national debt, if we stuck to this budget, $25.9 trillion in \n2022. Oh, my gosh, $25.9 trillion, and we are talking about this as a \nserious proposal? These numbers are untenable. It is a path that is \nunthinkable for this country.\n  So $1.4 trillion of the President's proposed tax increases over the \nnext decade would fall on individuals. The budget that the President \nput forward explicitly states: Immediate broad tax cuts for the middle \nclass are far more effective at creating jobs and growing the economy. \nI would agree with that. Broad tax cuts for the middle class would be \neffective at creating jobs and growing the economy.\n  But the President fails to acknowledge where the tax increases fall. \nIt is on the people who own and work in small businesses, and they are \nthe ones who have the ability to hire if we would let them.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 50 percent of all \nflowthrough business income will be subject to the proposed tax \nincreases. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that \n75 percent of small businesses pay taxes on their business income at \nthe individual tax rate because they are organized as flowthrough \nbusinesses, such as partnerships, S corporations, LLCs, and sole \nproprietorships. So the President is going to the heart of the \npotential hiring in our economy; that is, small business, and they are \ngoing to increase taxes.\n\n  I would say the constant drumbeat of this administration for new \ntaxes is putting a blanket on present-day potential hiring. It is \nputting a blanket on growth because our small businesses see the \nPresident continuing to come forward again and again and again and talk \nabout new taxes on the people who could create jobs.\n  Incredibly, the $1 trillion in new taxes doesn't even pay down the \ndebt. It doesn't lower the deficit. The new taxes the President is \nproposing just increase spending. Oh, my gosh. Instead of cutting \ndeficits and responsible spending cuts, we are talking about new taxes \nand new spending.\n  Where have we heard this before? We have heard it out of Washington, \nDC, for years. It is the wrong approach, and it is why we are in \ntrouble right now with a $15 trillion debt.\n  Instead, we need to have sensible spending reductions that meet the \ncaps set under the Budget Control Act and carefully considered \ninvestments in strategic, nationally important projects that will have \na long-term effect on job increases because of creativity and \nentrepreneurship.\n  We must cut spending. It is simple. That is it. We have to cut \nspending if we are going to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Most important, we need to address entitlements, which the President \ndid not do in his budget proposal. If there is anything urgent in this \ncountry that the President should take the leadership position to do, \nit is a bipartisan approach to entitlement reform. Our fiscal problems \nare inextricably linked if we can't fix our broken entitlement system.\n  Today, mandatory spending--entitlements--are approximately 55 percent \nof our Federal budget. So we have less than half the budget in the \ndiscretionary spending that we pass appropriations for each year. If we \ndon't take that other 50 percent and stop that growth, do you know what \nis going to happen?\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, our mandatory spending \nby 2022--10 years from now--will be approximately 74 percent of total \nFederal spending. Over seventy percent of Federal spending will be \nmandatory. This is out of control.\n  If we are going to stop this growing deficit and debt cycle, we have \nto address entitlements. People are living longer than they were living \nwhen Social Security was passed in 1935, but we have not addressed that \nchange in our demographics to make sure the program will last. The \nlonger we put it off, the harder it is going to be. If we do not solve \nthis problem, current and future retirees will confront a guaranteed 23 \npercent cut in benefits in 2036. In today's dollars, that would be a \n$271 cut in a beneficiary's monthly payment. There is not anyone here \nwho wants that to happen--we know that.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Kyl, the ``Defend and Save \nSocial Security Act.'' It gradually increases the retirement age over \n11\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\nyears--that is how gradual it is. It would go from 66 to 67 to 68 and \nend at 69--over 11 years. It is 3 months a year that the increase would \noccur, and it decreases the annual cost-of-living adjustment if it \nexceeds 1 percent. When inflation goes above 1 percent, the cost-of-\nliving adjustment will kick in. So if you have rampant inflation, such \nas 2 or 3 percent, there will be a cost-of-living adjustment. My bill \nwith Senator Kyl will make the Social Security trust fund solvent \nthrough 2085 without raising taxes or cutting core benefits.\n  Saving our programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, will \nrequire bipartisan leadership. We cannot do it with one party. We \ncannot do it with one party because of the 30-second ad. We must do it \ntogether.\n  I know my time is up, and my colleague from Arkansas is on the Senate \nfloor. I would just say that we could cut $416 billion, nearly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion over 10 years, if we would start addressing just Social \nSecurity right now. Let's do it with bipartisan leadership, starting \nwith the President, the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, and \nthe House, which is controlled by Republicans. We will have to do it \ntogether. Let's do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, on Monday morning the country was \npresented with President Obama's budget proposal for the fiscal year. \nIf you were only to listen to the President and his advisers, you would \nthink this proposal is great for the Nation. The Acting Budget Director \nsays the President's budget ``makes the right investments.'' The head \nof the President's National Economic Council used several sports \nmetaphors to make the case that ``the President has very much stepped \nup to the plate,'' and the President himself said his budget makes \n``some tough choices in order to put the country back on a more \nsustainable fiscal path.'' The reason they are so excited about this \nproposal is that they believe, in an election year, they have offered \nevery ally something to woo their support. This budget proposal truly \ndoes try to be everything for everyone. The problem is that no one wins \nwith it.\n  When you scratch the surface of this proposal, the shine quickly \nwears off. The deficit reduction claims the administration throws out \nto defend this proposal simply do not hold water. You cannot claim $1 \ntrillion in cuts that Congress pushed through during the debt ceiling \ndebate as new cuts, nor can you say with all honesty that $850 billion \nin war savings are real cuts. This money was never going to be spent in \nthe first place.\n  When you get down to it, President Obama was never serious about his \npledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. Like \nevery budget this administration has proposed, this one was written \nwith red ink. The deficit spending proposed in the President's fiscal \nyear 2013 budget topped $1 trillion again. This is simply an \nunsustainable rate of spending.\n  On Monday, the President's team was doing a full-scale PR push for \nthat budget. At one point during the rollout, a reporter asked the \nPresident's top economic aides what ever happened to that pledge the \nPresident had made to the American people. Gone from their answers was \nthe tough talk about making difficult decisions and facing challenges \nwe have long neglected. Instead, his advisers were left to pull out the \nold standby excuse that the President's team simply did not realize how \nbad the economy actually was when they first took over.\n  Clearly, they still do not realize it now. Not only does the \nPresident's budget ignore the very real disarray our fiscal house is \nin, it makes it worse. Since President Obama took office, our national \ndebt has shot up 42 percent. Under President Obama's watch, the \nnational debt has jumped to a jaw-dropping $15.1 trillion. This is the \nfourth year in a row that the budget would run a deficit above $1.29 \ntrillion. When it comes to fiscal responsibility, this is not a record \nof which to be proud.\n  America deserves better than a collection of tax hikes, phony \nsavings, and additional debt. The President's budget proposal is bad \nfor seniors, as it takes no steps to protect and strengthen Medicare \nand Social Security. It will hurt the chances of an economic recovery \nthrough tax hikes and will add $11 trillion more to our already \nstaggering national debt in a 10-year period. We cannot continue to \nkeep going down this road. America's fiscal health is at stake. We have \nto stop spending more than we take in. If not, we risk going in the \ndirection of Greece, Portugal, Italy, and other European countries that \nhave spent their way to the brink of default.\n  As we head into the final year of President Obama's first term, we \nhave already witnessed the most rapid increase in debt under any U.S. \nPresident. With our national debt already the size of our entire \neconomy, the President has proposed a budget that calls for hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in new spending. If we follow through with this \nbudget, deficit spending would exceed $600 billion every year but one \nover the next decade. Our national debt would grow to $18.7 trillion.\n  President Obama would like you to believe that if we simply raise \ntaxes we can solve all of our fiscal problems. A recent CBO report \nshows that spending is the primary cause of our fiscal crisis and \nsupports spending cuts rather than tax increases to reverse the trend. \nBut the President is holding steadfast to his desire to raise taxes as \nan answer. The President's failed policy of borrowing, spending, and \ntaxing is just what the CBO is warning us to avoid. It has not worked \nin the past, and it will not work in the future.\n  Washington does not have a revenue problem, Washington has a spending \nproblem. The fact that President Obama still believes we can tax our \nway out of the problem reveals a huge disconnect with the American \npeople. When it comes to our country's budget, Americans have a right \nto expect accountability, honesty, and responsibility. This proposal \nhas none of those.\n  If President Obama refuses to acknowledge and address the very real \neconomic crisis facing our country, let's show America that we will. We \ncan do so by rejecting the White House's proposal and passing a \nresponsible budget that puts our Nation back on a fiscally responsible \npath.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, now what is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in a period of \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S664-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S664-S665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to claim 10 minutes to speak on \nbehalf of a bill which I hope will return to the Senate today, which is \nthe surface transportation reauthorization bill. I hope we take it up. \nI hope we actually vote on it, and I hope there are not a lot of \nextraneous amendments that are not relevant to getting America moving \nagain, creating jobs that result in public safety, a better \nenvironment, and people actually working. What I like about the surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill is that, in effect, this could be \nthe only vehicle we have that is a version of the infrastructure bank, \na topic on which I know the Presiding Officer has worked assiduously.\n  We need an infrastructure bank. We need to have jobs in construction \nto build highways, byways, subways, and we can do it, but it looks as \nthough it will be difficult to do. In the meantime, we have a regular \norder bill, the surface transportation reauthorization bill. This is \nthe bill that Congress reauthorizes every couple of years to do \nconstruction on highways, byways, and beltways, and at the same time in \nthe very important area of mass transit, something the gentlelady from \nNew York knows is important since she has one of the busiest subways in \nAmerica. We have a busy subway called the Metro, and I am going to talk \nabout that in a minute.\n  Right now we must pass this long-term transportation bill to put \npeople back to work, repair our aging roads and bridges and tunnels, \nkeep the public safe, and lower our carbon footprint. This is a \nbipartisan bill, and it is\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nactually paid for and meets a sense of a frugal government but smart \nspending. It is time to show the American people that we can govern, \nthat we can actually pass legislation in a regular order, conducting \nourselves with civility as we debate our amendments.\n  We have to keep America rolling. This is a jobs bill. One of the best \nways to put people to work is through infrastructure projects. It \nbuilds America and builds our economy. This bill will contribute to \nsaving over 1.8 million jobs and actually creates new jobs in \nconstruction, in the supply chain, and in design and engineering, and \nall the vendors it supports.\n  In my own home State we estimate that 10,000 jobs will be created if \nwe pass this bill. I cannot speak about this in a more firm and \ninsistent way. When I met with the building trades guys, it was a bleak \nconversation with the unemployment rate in construction still sky-high. \nThis bill will jump-start the economy. All the people who analyze this \ntype of data say that for every dollar we spend on infrastructure \nconstruction, we get $2 in economic output back into our economy \nthrough the multiplier effect.\n  Let's do an inventory of why this is a compelling need. We know we \nhave a high unemployment rate and that we are running big debts and we \nare running deficits. One of the ways to reduce the debt and the \ndeficit is to have people working where they are paying revenue in to \nthe government. We also have an infrastructure deficit. Do you know \nthat right now 700,000 bridges are structurally deficient? That is not \na fact, that is a danger zone. Fifty percent of our roads are in need \nof serious repair. More than 4 million people travel over these bridges \nevery day. This would address that kind of problem.\n  Then there is this whole issue of, again, roads, highways, byways, \nand beltways. There is also the issue of mass transit. One of the parts \nof the bill I am most proud of is creating Federal safety standards for \nthe metro systems nationwide.\n  On June 22, 2009, there was a terrible accident in the national \ncapital region. Nine people were killed and 50 more injured in a \nterrible metro transit accident when a red line train struck another \ntrain. The woman who was the conductor on that train tried valiantly to \nsave her passengers. She died as a result. Well, we went to the \nfunerals, we listened to the people, and we always say: We will never \nforget, but we do. Well, I didn't forget and the Maryland delegation \ndidn't forget. Ben Cardin didn't forget, Chris Van Hollen didn't \nforget, and Donna Edwards didn't forget. We worked very hard in \ncreating legislation. The first thing we did was listen to the National \nTransportation Safety Board that gave us recommendations and said there \nwas not only a failure of Metro being fit for duty, but all of the \ntransit systems in America face this kind of risk where there is a \nfailure of technology, the failure of cars to be crash resistant, the \nfailure to have exit doors, and the failure to have a black box.\n  When you look at the Congress, we are the failure. Give us an F \nbecause we have safety standards for how you open a bottle cap but not \nhow you open a subway car in a disaster. So it wasn't Senator Barb \nmaking up safety rules on her own; we went and listened to the National \nTransit Safety Board. I put in legislation to give the Federal Transit \nAdministration the authority to establish and enforce national safety \nstandards for Metro. We had aggressive oversight hearings. Metro \nleadership initially was dragging its axles, but I wouldn't take no for \nan answer. We shook up the management, we shook up the board, and now I \nwant to shake up the Congress.\n  I want to thank Senator Bob Menendez. He had a parallel bill. I want \nto thank Tim Johnson, the chair of the committee. They have taken my \nideas and have actually done a version of their own, and working \ntogether we have come up with a great solution that has bipartisan \nsupport. This checklist for change that I insisted on would replace the \noldest cars in the fleet. It would develop real-time automatic controls \nso that technology would have redundancy in it. It would develop a \ntraining and certificate program so that the personnel not only know \nhow to operate their cars but what to do in the danger zones. Runaway \ncars make a great movie. Denzel Washington did that one, but I don't \nwant to see another movie where there is another transit system that \nwent through the horrific accident here in the national capital region.\n\n  In this checklist for change legislation, working again with Senator \nMenendez, my colleague Senator Cardin, whom I cannot give enough credit \nto, our new bill gives the Transportation Secretary, Mr. LaHood, \nauthority to establish and enforce safety standards, and allows Federal \nfunding for these safety improvements. I am pleased that this was \ninculcated.\n  The story goes one step farther, and this is an example. Last year, \nthrough the appropriations, I was able to get funding, working with \nSenator Murray, to be able to replace the Metro cars, the ones that are \nold, dated, and cannot withstand all the problems I just enumerated.\n  I am going to tell you the rest of the story as if Paul Harvey were \non the floor. A couple of weeks ago during one of our work weeks when \nwe were visiting our constituents, I went to a place called Knorr \nBrakes in Carroll County, which was once very rural. Knorr Brakes \nactually makes the brakes for these Metro cars and makes the brakes for \nAmtrak and makes the brakes for many transit systems in the United \nStates of America. Because of the improvements at Metro, they have been \nable to hire more people.\n  I wish you could have walked that factory floor with me. It is not \nyour grandfather's factory floor, which was often dark and dangerous. \nIt is clean, uses the best of engineering, a few robots, engineers, \nwith skilled blue-collar workers who are machinists who are working on \nthis very specialized equipment. These brakes have to work, and they \nare the best in the world. Workers in Maryland are the best in the \nworld. Yes, they are part of a German holding company, so we are ready \nto be global, and at the same time they are fixing not only \nWashington's Metro but they are working on transit systems.\n  My whole point is smart funding in the area of infrastructure and in \ntransportation safety creates American jobs. Every time we modernize \nour transit fleet, we are building railroad cars in the United States \nof America. Many of those brakes that will go on that car will be made \nin Maryland by Maryland workers, competing with other American \ncompanies. And you know what. That is what it is all about. That is \nsmart funding that creates safety and creates jobs.\n  I want to thank the Banking Committee for including this, and I also \nwant to thank all three committees: Banking, Environment, and Public \nWorks, under the leadership of Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Tim Johnson, and my colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Shelby.\n  This could be a great day. This could be a great day or a great week. \nBut, yes, while we are working on the payroll tax and its temporary \nholiday, the real thing we could get done this week is to pass this \nlegislation. America will be safer, our economy will grow, and it will \nbe a win-win situation.\n  Madam President, I want to thank you for your kind attention. I want \nto thank all my colleagues who worked on a bipartisan basis. We \nactually listened to each other. I had a set of ideas. Others had as \nwell. Some had flashing lights about costs, we went back and forth, and \nthat is the subject of negotiation, and we were able to do it. I think \nwe have come up with a great bill for surface transportation. We have \ncome up with a great bill for transit safety, and I am going to be \nhappy to vote for it. Let's get Congress rolling so we can get our \neconomy rolling.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor because of a new \nreport that has come out by the chief economist of Gallup, the polling \norganization, dated today, February 15, 2012. The headline is: ``Health \nCosts,\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\nGov't Regulations Curb Small Business Hiring.''\n  As a Member of the Senate as well as a physician who has taken care \nof families across the State of Wyoming for about a quarter of a \ncentury, I am concerned about jobs in this country, the economy in this \ncountry, and also the health care needs of the American people, which \nis why week after week I come to the Senate floor with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about a health care law that was supposed to give people \nwhat they were looking for, which was the care they need, from the \ndoctor they want, at a cost they can afford.\n  Regrettably, what this President and this Senate and this House--at \nthe time controlled by the Democrats--gave them is something very \ndifferent. So the result of this report today--first line: U.S. small \nbusiness owners who aren't hiring, that is 85 percent of the 600 who \nwere surveyed, those small business owners who are not hiring are being \nasked: Why not?\n  Nearly half the small business owners point to the potential health \ncare costs and government regulations as two big reasons. Those worried \nabout the potential cost of health care: 48 percent. Those worried \nabout new government regulations: 46 percent.\n  But yet when the President addressed the Nation about health care, \nwhat he promised was that if people liked the care they had, they could \nkeep it, and they would see their premiums drop by $2,500 a year a \nfamily.\n  When I have townhall meetings, I ask how many people believe the \nhealth care costs are going to go up as a result of the health care \nlaw. Every hand goes up in the room. So the President has misled the \nAmerican people both in terms of the cost of the health care law as \nwell as he misled the people in regard to regulations. He stood in \nfront of us in the House of Representatives as he gave his State of the \nUnion Address and talked about removing expensive regulations. But that \nis not what the small business owners, those who create the jobs in \nthis country, that is not what they are finding.\n  Then the President came out with his budget on Monday. It is his \nfiscal year 2013 budget. As I have said before, it is ``debt on \narrival.'' The Obama budget spends $3.8 trillion. It runs a deficit of \nnearly $1 trillion. It raises taxes by nearly $1.9 trillion. It is the \nlargest tax increase in the history of our country, and it is the \nfourth year in a row to run a deficit of over $1 trillion.\n  Yet the President goes on. To me, this is another clear example of \nPresident Obama's lack of leadership and his bad habit of saying one \nthing and doing the exact opposite. Instead of saving money, which he \npromises, he just spends more. Instead of leveling with the American \npeople about our fiscal future, he misleads them.\n  So I would like to focus on one specific part of this budget. It is \nthe part referring to and regarding the President's health care law. As \nwe all remember, the President promised the American people repeatedly, \nnot just once but repeatedly, that his health care reform would not add \na dime to the deficit. Two years later, the American people know that \nis just not true. In fact, the President's new budget asks for almost \n$1 billion--$1 billion, that is 1,000 million--$1 billion to fund his \nhealth care exchange.\n  As The Hill newspaper recently reported, ``The health reform law did \nnot set aside any money specifically for the creation of the Federal \nexchanges.'' Let me repeat that. The health care law did not set aside \nany money specifically for the creation of the Federal exchanges.\n  Two years ago, did the President and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle seriously believe Washington would be able to implement an \nunprecedented health care exchange for free, that it would just be \nfree? Of course not. But the fact is, they knowingly--knowingly--\nignored the costs of the President's major new entitlement program. \nWhy?\n  To try to score a political victory. What do we know about that \nvictory? We know it is going to be bad for patients, bad for the \nproviders, the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients, and \nbad for the American taxpayers. The health care law, when it was \ncrammed down the throats of the American people and forced through \nCongress, we knew it was unpopular then, and we know it is even more \nunpopular today.\n  The whole time the Democrats were drafting the bill behind closed \ndoors, right outside this Senate Chamber, they knew it would cost \nAmerican taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. But they did not \nwant to admit it. They did not admit it. They refused to admit it. So \nthey shaded the numbers. They punted this down the road. Here we are 2 \nyears later and now they are finally trying to pay for it--listed in \nthe President's budget.\n  To make matters worse, the 2013 Obama budget wants to spend $290 \nmillion for ``consumer beneficiary education and outreach'' within the \nexchanges. What does this mean? It basically means they want to educate \nAmericans about the exchanges in the health care law to the tune of 290 \nmillion of taxpayer dollars.\n  I think it is important to keep the American people informed. But my \nquestion is: Why are President Obama and the Democrats in Congress \nfocused on educating people about the health care law now? Why? Why \ndidn't they take the time 2 years ago to educate the American people \nabout the exchanges and the costs of doing this?\n  We know the reason. The reason is because they knew the American \npeople would never support the new law, would never give up their \nfreedoms. Instead, the White House and Democrats in Congress covered up \nthe costs, drafted the bill behind closed doors, and jammed it through \nCongress.\n  Now the financial bills are coming due, but the checks are not in the \nmail. The United States is running out of money and running out of \nmoney fast. Instead of proposing a serious budget that would get our \ncountry back on the right track, the President has put forward not a \nserious budget but a campaign document. No matter what he says, he is \nmuch more interested in winning votes now than in winning what he calls \nthe future.\n  Earlier this week, the President spoke to students at a community \ncollege. He said his budget would make their futures brighter. I \nwatched on television as he said that. His words could not have been \nfurther from the truth. The fact is, the President and his budget will \nmake these students have to work even harder to pay off the Nation's \nincreasingly growing debt. These students and all future generations of \nAmericans will pay for the choices they never made and programs they do \nnot want.\n  The new $800 million pricetag on the exchanges is bad, and that is \njust the beginning. In fact, the cost of the President's health care \nlaw is going to continue to skyrocket each and every year. When we are \nalready $15 trillion in debt, we cannot allow this health care law to \nmove forward. When we look at trillion-dollar deficits for each of the \n4 years of the Obama Presidency, we say this cannot continue. Yet when \nwe look at this budget, it adds $11 trillion to the national debt over \nthe next 10 years.\n  We need to repeal this health care law. We need to replace it with \nsomething that will not make it harder for future generations to get \nout of debt, and we need to pass a law that will allow Americans to get \nwhat they wanted in the first place; the care they need, from a doctor \nthey want, at a price they can afford.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S666-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S666-S668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to draw my colleagues' attention \nto an issue of great importance to our rural communities. If Congress \ndoes not act, many of our rural counties will face an increasingly dire \nstate of affairs in the months to come. Across the United States, \ntimber counties are facing local budgets suddenly and deeply in the \nred. This fiscal crisis could mean reduced schooldays, fewer sheriffs, \nmore offenders on the street, and cuts to other basic county services.\n  Congress has the power to avert this impending disaster, and Congress \nmust\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nutilize that power. So we must act without delay to extend the Secure \nRural Schools and Communities Self-Determination Act. Secure Rural \nSchools is not an entitlement program; it is a commitment this Nation, \nour Federal Government, made to rural forest counties out of fairness \nand common sense when it determined it would put environmental overlays \nover large blocks of forest land that we dedicated to timber production \nwith revenue shared with the local county. This contract between the \nFederal Government and our rural counties has been at the foundation of \nour National Forest System, and we in this Chamber need to honor it. \nMany folks come here and talk about how the Federal Government needs to \nuphold its share of the bargain. Well, this is an explicit contract \nwith our rural counties, and we need to uphold that bargain.\n\n  Since 1908--more than 100 years--the Federal Government has \nappropriately shared timber revenues with counties for the \ninfrastructure they develop because this timber land is in Federal \nhands and produces no property tax revenue to support that \ninfrastructure.\n  Let me give some background on what the scale of this issue is for \nStates such as Oregon. Oregon has 2.2 million acres of O lands. These \nlands were granted to the Oregon and California Railroad in 1866 and \nlater reverted to the Federal Government when the railroad failed to \nlive up to its terms of the grant. They also included a class of lands \nthat originated from a similar situation--the Coos Bay Wagon Road \nlands. These lands make up a large percentage of the acreage in \nsouthern and western Oregon. Then there are Forest Service lands--\ntimbered lands owned by the Federal Forest Service--that make up 14 \nmillion additional acres across the State of Oregon. When you add it \nall together, more than half of Oregon's lands are federally owned. \nThat means they do not produce a penny of property taxes to support \ninfrastructure in our rural counties. The O lands and the Wagon Road \nlands were dedicated to timber production, with the counties receiving \n50 percent of all revenues. Counties with national forest lands \nreceived 25 percent of the timber revenues. This created jobs and a \nsource of money to provide counties with that needed infrastructure.\n  In the early 1990s timber production began a long decline--a \nprecipitous decline. Trends such as automation and trade hit the sector \nhard, as they had so many more sectors. On top of this, there were the \nenvironmental overlays that dramatically reduced timber harvesting.\n  To compensate for the newly imposed Federal structure that changed \nthe entire pattern of timber production in our rural counties, our \nNational Government developed the Secure Rural Schools Program to \nprovide payments to counties based on historic timber harvest levels \nbut no longer tied directly to the annual timber harvest.\n  This type of arrangement is not unique to Oregon, nor are the \nproblems arising from the lapse of the Secure Rural Schools Program. \nThere are a great many States, particularly in the West, where much of \nthe land is federally owned and counties rely on this program and \nsimilar programs to support key infrastructure.\n  It is no wonder that when the Secure Rural Schools payments lapsed in \n2006, drastic measures had to be taken to adjust to the loss. Let me \ngive some sense of what this is like in Oregon.\n  In Josephine County--southern Oregon--two-thirds of the county's \ngeneral fund came from county payments. So loss of county payments \nmeans cutting public safety programs. Overnight, in 2006, patrols were \ncut down to just six individuals to cover an area the size of the State \nof Rhode Island.\n  In Lake County, where Federal lands make up 61 percent of the county, \nthey cut their Federal road department from 42 individuals to 14--14 \nfolks for a road department covering a land area equal to the combined \nsize of Connecticut and Delaware.\n  In Jackson County, where one-third of the general fund comes from \nFederal payments, the county eliminated 117 jobs in parks, human \nservices, roads, and public safety, and they closed all of their \nlibraries.\n  Let me be clear. When the Federal Government fails to uphold the \ncontract it has struck with our rural timber counties, the suffering is \nintense. It is an embarrassment that we would permit the Federal \nGovernment not to fulfill its commitment under this framework.\n  This impact is so substantial that the Oregon Legislature, when I was \nserving as speaker, redirected $50 million in transportation funds to \nthe rural counties. In the year of 2007, I organized a bipartisan, \nbicameral tour of our most affected counties. We went out to talk to \nthe county officials, and when we came back I advocated for and \nsupported this $50 million emergency transfer to compensate for the \nfact that the Federal Government was breaking its contract with the \ntimber counties in America. Let's not let that happen again.\n  Later, Congress restored this contract. But here we are now, 5 years \nlater, facing the worst-case scenarios all over again. As Yogi Berra \nsaid, it is deja vu all over again. Because we failed to pass an \nextension before we left for the holidays, the last payment occurred a \nfew weeks ago and timber counties don't know what is going to happen \nnow. They would like to think folks in this Chamber will honor and \nsupport sustaining this Federal contract with our rural timber \ncounties, but this Chamber has to act to make that happen.\n  The Eugene Register-Guard recently published an editorial about the \nsituation in Lane County, stating:\n\n       The emerging picture looks like a multi-car pileup on \n     Interstate 5.\n\n  Lane County is facing a $14 million shortfall. More than half of \nthis--$7.2 million--will have to be absorbed by the sheriff's office. \nWhat does that mean for Lane County? It means the end of 24-hour \npatrol, with coverage limited to just 16 hours a day. It means so few \nofficers that they would be unable to respond except ``to the most \nserious of crimes.'' It means parole and probation supervision will be \neliminated for hundreds of offenders and 130 jail beds would have to be \nclosed. In addition, the district attorney's office faces a $1.9 \nmillion reduction in county funding, which would mean the loss of \nbetween 12 to 20 employees in the criminal division and potential \nshutdown of the county's medical examiner's office. And this is one of \nthe counties that is in better shape. Others could go bankrupt as early \nas June of this year. As the Register-Guard newspaper says, it is ``a \ndire predicament, and in desperate need of help from Congress.''\n  Rural counties in Oregon and elsewhere deserve to have the Federal \nGovernment honor its contract and to have the peace of mind that funds \nguaranteed to pay for their infrastructure are there--for the roads, \nfor schools, for public safety. In this contract between the Federal \nGovernment and rural America, the Federal Government must uphold its \nend of the bargain. Rural counties have been on a roller coaster for \nfar too long. They have been flying off the tracks. Pick any metaphor \nyou want--a pileup on I 5, a roller coaster or a train running off \nthe tracks--this is the situation in our rural timber counties. And \nthose Members who don't have rural counties have other situations where \nthere are vital Federal commitments. This one must be honored by this \nChamber.\n\n  The first step is to extend the Secure Rural Schools Program as soon \nas possible. President Obama has supported and proposed and included in \nhis budget a 5-year reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools and has \nmade it mandatory spending. This short-term funding is a critical \nbridge to maintain schools and law enforcement in timber counties while \nwe work for a viable long-term, sustainable management solution for \nFederal forests.\n  I want to be clear. Timber counties would rather have forest \npractices that allow sustained production of timber, as these lands \nwere dedicated to. That creates jobs, it supports the whole supply \nchain, and it provides logs to the independent mills that don't own \ntheir own forest land. That is the vitality of rural communities.\n  My father worked at a sawmill when I was born--Harbor Plywood in \nRiddle, OR, and I lived in the adjoining town of Myrtle Creek.\n  Those of us with a timber background understand the essential nature \nof this Federal contract. We must get it done in this Chamber. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, there are reports in some of the \nnewspapers this morning that there is an effort to try to slip into the \nnegotiation about extending the payroll tax break for the next year a \nbig loophole for the rich and for the investment bankers and for most \nof the people President Obama keeps talking about as people whose taxes \nhe would like to raise. What I mean by this is I have heard there may \nbe an effort to put into the payroll tax agreement a 4-year extension \nof the so-called production tax credit, which is a big tax break for \nwind developers. I cannot think of anything that would derail more \nrapidly the consensus that is developing about extending the payroll \ntax deduction than to do such a thing. We are supposed to be talking \nabout reducing taxes for working people. This would maintain a big \nloophole for investment bankers, for the very wealthy, and for big \ncorporations.\n  We hear a lot of talk about Federal subsidies for Big Oil. I would \nlike to take a moment to talk about Federal subsidies for Big Wind--$27 \nbillion over 10 years. That is the amount of Federal taxpayer dollars \nbetween 2007 and 2016, according to the Joint Tax Committee, that \ntaxpayers will have given to wind developers across our country. This \nsubsidies comes in the form of a production tax credit, renewable \nenergy bonds, investment tax credits, federal grants, and accelerated \nappreciation. These are huge subsidies. The production tax credit \nitself has been there for 20 years. It was a temporary tax break put in \nthe law in 1992. And what do we get in return for these billions of \ndollars of subsidies? We get a puny amount of unreliable electricity \nthat arrives disproportionately at night when we don't need it.\n  Madam President, residents in community after community across \nAmerica are finding out that these are not your grandma's windmills. \nThese gigantic turbines, which look so pleasant on the television ads--\npaid for by the people who are getting all the tax breaks--look like an \nelephant when they are in your backyard. In fact, they are much bigger \nthan an elephant. They are three times as tall as the sky boxes at \nNeyland Stadium, the University of Tennessee football stadium in \nKnoxville. They are taller than the Statue of Liberty in the home State \nof the Presiding Officer. The blades are as wide as a football field is \nlong, and you can see the blinking lights that are on top of these \nwindmills for 20 miles.\n  In town after town, American residents are complaining about the \nnoise and disturbance that come from these giant wind turbines in their \nbackyards. There is a new movie that was reviewed in the New York Times \nin the last few days called ``Windfall'' about residents in upstate New \nYork who are upset and have left their homes because of the arrival of \nthese big wind turbines. The great American West, which \nconservationists for a century have sought to protect, has become \nlittered with these giant towers. Boone Pickens, an advocate of wind \npower, says he doesn't want them on his own ranch because they are \nugly. Senator Kerry, Senator Kennedy, Senator Warner, and Senator Scott \nBrown have all complained about the new Manhattan Island sized wind \ndevelopment which will forever change the landscape off the coast of \nNantucket Island.\n  On top of all that, these giant turbines have become a Cuisinart in \nthe sky for birds. Federal law protects the American eagle and \nmigratory birds. In 2009, Exxon had to pay $600,000 in fines when oil \ndevelopments harmed these protected birds. But the Federal Government \nso far has refused to apply the same Federal law to Big Wind that \napplies to Big Oil, even though chopping up an eagle in a wind turbine \ncouldn't be any better than its landing and dying on an oil slick. And \nwind turbines kill over 400,000 birds every year.\n  We have had some experience with the reliability of this kind of wind \npower in the Tennessee Valley Authority region. A few years ago TVA \nbuilt 30 big wind turbines on top of Buffalo Mountain. In the Eastern \nUnited States, onshore wind power only works when the wind turbines are \nplaced on the ridge lines of Americas most scenic mountains. So you \nwill see them along the areas near the Appalachian Trail through the \nmountains of scenic views we prize in our State. But there they are, 30 \nbig wind turbines to see whether they would work. Here is what \nhappened:\n  The wind blows 19 percent of the time. According to TVA's own \nestimates, it is reliable 12 percent of the time. So TVA signed a \ncontract to spend $60 million to produce 6 megawatts of wind--actual \nproduction of wind--over that 10-year period of time. It was a \ncommercial failure.\n  There are obviously better alternatives to this. First, there is \nnuclear power. We wouldn't think of going to war in sailboats if \nnuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers were available. The \nenergy equivalent of going to war in sailboats is trying to produce \nenough clean energy for the United States of America with windmills.\n  The United States uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the \nworld. It needs to be clean, reliable electricity that we can afford. \nTwenty percent of the electricity that we use today is nuclear power. \nNearly 70 percent of the clean electricity, the pollution-free \nelectricity that we use today is nuclear power. It comes from 104 \nreactors located at 65 sites. Each reactor consumes about 1 square mile \nof land.\n  To produce the same amount of electricity by windmills would mean we \nwould have to have 186,000 of these wind turbines; it would cover an \narea the size of West Virginia; we would need 19,000 miles of \ntransmission lines through backyards and scenic areas; so 100 reactors \non 100 square miles or 186,000 wind turbines on 25,000 square miles.\n  Think about it another way. Four reactors on 4 square miles is equal \nto a row of 50-story tall wind turbines along the entire 2,178-mile \nAppalachian Trail. Of course, if we had the turbines, we would still \nneed the nuclear plants or the gas plants or the coal plants because we \nwould like our computers to work and our lights to be on when the wind \ndoesn't blow, and we can't store the electricity.\n  Then, of course, there is natural gas, which has no sulfur pollution, \nvery little nitrogen pollution, half as much carbon as coal. Gas is \nvery cheap today. A Chicago-based utility analyst said: Wind on its own \nwithout incentives is far from economic unless gas is north of $6.50 \nper unit. The Wall Street Journal says that wind power is facing a \nmake-or-break moment in Congress, while we debate to extend these \nsubsidies. So that is why the wind power companies are on pins and \nneedles waiting to see what Congress decides to do about its subsidy.\n  Taxpayers should be the ones on pins and needles. This $27 billion \nover 10 years is a waste of money. It could be used for energy \nresearch. It could be used to reduce the debt. Let's start with the $12 \nbillion over that 10 years that went for the production tax credit. \nThat tax credit was supposed to be temporary in 1992.\n  Today, according to Secretary Chu, wind is a mature technology. Why \ndoes it need a credit? The credit is worth about 3 cents per kilowatt \nhour, if we take into account the corporate tax rate of 35 percent. \nThat has caused some energy officials to say they have never found an \neasier way to make money. Well, of course not.\n  So we do not need to extend the production tax credit for wind at a \ntime when we are borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar, at a time when \nnatural gas is cheap and nuclear power is clean and more reliable and \nless expensive.\n  I would like to see us put some of that money on energy research. We \nonly spend $5 billion or $6 billion a year on energy research: clean \nenergy research, carbon recapture, making solar cheaper, making \nelectric batteries that go further. I am ready to reduce the subsidies \nfor Big Oil as long as we reduce the subsidies for Big Wind at the same \ntime.\n  So let's not even think about putting this tax break for the rich in \nthe middle of an extension of a tax deduction for working Americans \nthis week. Let's focus on reducing the debt, increasing\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\nexpenditure for research, and getting rid of the subsidies.\n  Twenty years is long enough for a wind production tax credit for what \nour distinguished Nobel Prize-winning Secretary of Energy says is a \nmature technology.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a film review \nfrom the New York Times on February 3 entitled, ``Turbines in the \nBackyard: The Sound and the Strobes.'' This is about the movie \n``Windfall,'' about upstate New York communities that have experienced \nhaving these huge things in their backyards. An article by Robert \nBryce, ``Why The Wind Is Full Of Hot Air and Costing You Big Bucks,'' \nan article from the Los Angeles Times on wind farms, and another \narticle from February 2 in the Globe, ``Town turns off wind, opts for \nsolar energy.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2012]\n\n          Turbines in the Backyard: The Sound and the Strobes\n\n                           (By Andy Webster)\n\n       We can all agree that energy independence is a worthy \n     objective, right? Alternative energy sources like solar power \n     can help free the United States from fossil fuels and the \n     grip of unstable Persian Gulf states. And wind power--wait, \n     not so fast, says ``Windfall,'' Laura Israel's urgent, \n     informative and artfully assembled documentary. An account of \n     rural Meredith, in upstate New York, when wind turbines came \n     to town, the film depicts the perils of a booming industry \n     and the bitter rancor it sowed among a citizenry.\n       In 2004 residents of this once-flourishing dairy center \n     were approached by companies offering to pay a nominal fee to \n     erect turbines on their property while insisting on \n     confidentiality agreements (to keep competitors ignorant of \n     costs). Economically beset, some people, like Ron and Sue \n     Bailey, jumped at first. But others, like Keitha Capouya, now \n     the town supervisor, dug into the research and sounded an \n     alarm.\n       Turbines are huge: some are 40 stories tall, with 130-foot \n     blades weighing seven tons and spinning at 150 miles an hour. \n     They can fall over or send parts flying; struck by lightning, \n     say, they can catch fire. Their 24/7 rotation emits nerve-\n     racking low frequencies (like a pulsing disco) amplified by \n     rain and moisture, and can generate a disorienting strobe \n     effect in sunlight. Giant flickering shadows can tarnish a \n     sunset's glow on a landscape.\n       People in Lowville, N.Y., farther north, express despair on \n     camera at having caved to the wind companies' entreaties; \n     Bovina, N.Y., banned turbines entirely. Meredith is riven by \n     the issue, which pits the Planning Board against the Town \n     Board and neighbor against neighbor. Former city dwellers \n     escaping urban anxieties are surprised to see themselves as \n     activists. Concerns like setback (the distance of turbines \n     from a property line) are debated.\n       Government officials are seen only in glimpses of \n     television talk shows. Conspicuously absent are \n     representatives of corporations like Airtricity, Enxco or \n     Horizon Wind Energy (though the financier and wind advocate \n     T. Boone Pickens comes off as a wolf in good-old-boy \n     clothing). And despite Ms. Israel's inspired use of a local \n     demolition derby as a metaphor for Meredith's struggles, her \n     accelerated pacing almost overheats.\n       But the film's implications are clear: The quest for energy \n     independence comes with caveats. Developers' motives must be \n     weighed, as should the risks Americans are willing to take in \n     their own backyard. Despite BP's three-month blanketing of \n     Gulf of Mexico beaches in crude oil; the nuclear disaster in \n     Fukushima, Japan; and the possible impact of hydraulic \n     fracturing (fracking) on the water table, energy companies \n     remain eager to plunder nature's bounty in pursuit of profit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From FoxNews.com, Dec. 20, 2011]\n\n    Why the Wind Industry Is Full Hot Air and Costing You Big Bucks\n\n                           (By Robert Bryce)\n\n       The American Wind Energy Association has begun a major \n     lobbying effort in Congress to extend some soon-to-expire \n     renewable-energy tax credits. And to bolster that effort, the \n     lobby group's CEO, Denise Bode, is calling the wind industry \n     ``a tremendous American success story.''\n       But the wind lobby's success has largely been the result of \n     its ability to garner subsidies. And those subsidies are \n     coming with a big price tag for American taxpayers. Since \n     2009, AWEA's largest and most influential member companies \n     have garnered billions of dollars in direct cash payments and \n     loan guarantees from the US government. And while the lobby \n     group claims to be promoting ``clean'' energy, AWEA's biggest \n     member companies are also among the world's biggest users \n     and/or producers of fossil fuels.\n       A review of the $9.8 billion in cash grants provided under \n     section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009 (also known as the federal stimulus bill) for renewable \n     energy projects shows that the wind energy sector has \n     corralled over $7.6 billion of that money. And the biggest \n     winners in the 1603 sweepstakes: the companies represented on \n     AWEA's board of directors.\n       An analysis of the 4,256 projects that have won grants from \n     the Treasury Department under section 1603 over the past two \n     years shows that $3.37 billion in grants went to just nine \n     companies--all of them are members of AWEA's board. To put \n     that $3.37 billion in perspective, consider that in 2010, \n     according to the Energy Information Administration, the total \n     of all ``energy specific subsidies and support'' provided to \n     the oil and gas sector totaled $2.84 billion. And that $2.84 \n     billion in oil and gas subsidies is being divided among \n     thousands of entities. The Independent Petroleum Association \n     of America estimates the US now has over 14,000 oil and gas \n     companies.\n       The renewable energy lobby likes to portray itself as an \n     upstart industry, one that is grappling with big business and \n     the entrenched interests of the hydrocarbon sector. But \n     billions of dollars in 1603 grants--all of it exempt from \n     federal corporate income taxes--is being used to fatten the \n     profits of some of the world's biggest companies. Indeed, the \n     combined market capitalization of the 11 biggest corporations \n     on AWEA's board--a group that includes General Electric and \n     Siemens--is about $450 billion.\n       Nevertheless, the clock is ticking on renewable-energy \n     subsidies. The 1603 grants end on December 31 and the \n     renewable-energy production tax credit expires on January 1, \n     2013. On Monday, AWEA issued a report which predicted that \n     some 37,000 wind-related jobs in the US could be lost by 2013 \n     if the production tax credit is not extended.\n       But the subsidies are running out at the very same time \n     that a cash-strapped Congress is turning a hard eye on the \n     renewable sector. The collapse of federally backed companies \n     like solar-panel-maker Solyndra and biofuel producer Range \n     Fuels, are providing critics of renewable subsidies with \n     plenty of ammunition. And if critics need more bullets, they \n     need only look at AWEA's board to see how big business is \n     grabbing every available dollar from US taxpayers all in the \n     name of ``clean'' energy. Indeed, AWEA represents a host of \n     fossil-fuel companies who are eagerly taking advantage of the \n     renewable-energy subsidies.\n       Consider NRG Energy, which has a seat on AWEA's board. Last \n     month, the New York Times reported that New Jersey-based NRG \n     and its partners have secured $5.2 billion in federal loan \n     guarantees to build solar-energy projects. NRG's market \n     capitalization: $4.3 billion.\n       But NRG is not a renewable energy company. The company \n     currently has about 26,000 megawatts (MW) of generation \n     capacity. Of that, 450 MW is wind capacity, another 65 MW is \n     solar, and 1,175 MW comes from nuclear. So why is NRG \n     expanding into renewables? The answer is simple: profits. \n     Last month, David Crane, the CEO of NRG, told the Times that \n     ``I have never seen anything that I have had to do in my 20 \n     years in the power industry that involved less risk than \n     these projects.''\n       Or look at E.On, the giant German electricity and natural \n     gas company, which also has a seat on AWEA's board of \n     directors. In 2010, the company emitted 116 million metric \n     tons of carbon dioxide an amount approximately equal to that \n     of the Czech Republic, a country of 10.5 million people. And \n     last year, the company--which has about 2,000 MW of wind-\n     generation capacity in the US--produced about 14 times as \n     much electricity by burning hydrocarbons as it did from wind.\n       Despite its role as a major fossil-fuel utility, E.On has \n     been awarded $542.5 million in section 1603 cash so that it \n     can build wind projects. And the company is getting that \n     money even though it is the world's largest investor-owned \n     utility with a market capitalization of $45 billion.\n       Another foreign company with a seat on AWEA's board: \n     Spanish utility Iberdrola, the second-largest domestic wind \n     operator. But in 2010, Iberdrola produced about 3 times as \n     much electricity from hydrocarbons as it did from wind. \n     Nevertheless, the company has collected $1 billion in section \n     1603 money. To put that $1 billion in context, consider that \n     in 2010, Iberdrola's net profit was about 2.8 billion Euros, \n     or around $3.9 billion. Thus, US taxpayers have recently \n     provided cash grants to Iberdrola that amount to about one-\n     fourth of the company's 2010 profits. And again, none of that \n     grant money is subject to US corporate income taxes. \n     Iberdrola currently sports a market cap of $39 billion.\n       Another big winner on AWEA's board of directors: NextEra \n     Energy (formerly Florida Power & Light) which has garnered \n     some $610.6 million in 1603 grants for various wind projects. \n     NextEra's market capitalization is $23 billion. The subsidies \n     being garnered by NextEra are helping the company drastically \n     cut its taxes. A look at the company's 2010 annual report \n     shows that it cut its federal tax bill by more than $200 \n     million last year thanks to various federal tax credits. And \n     the company's latest annual report shows that it has another \n     $1.8 billion of ``tax credit carryforwards'' that will help \n     it slash its taxes over the coming years.\n       The biggest fossil-fuel-focused company on AWEA's board is \n     General Electric, which had revenues last year of $150 \n     billion. Of that sum, about 25 percent came from what the \n     company calls ``energy infrastructure.'' While some of that \n     revenue comes from GE's wind business, the majority comes \n     from building generators, jet engines, and other machinery \n     that burn hydrocarbons. The company is also rapidly growing \n     GE Oil &\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n     Gas, which had 2010 revenues of $7.2 billion. GE Oil & Gas \n     has more than 20,000 employees and provides a myriad of \n     products and services to the oil and gas industry.\n       GE has a starring role in one of the most egregious \n     examples of renewable-energy corporate welfare: the Shepherds \n     Flat wind project in Oregon. The majority of the funding for \n     the $1.9 billion, 845-megawatt project is coming from federal \n     taxpayers. Not only is the Energy Department providing GE and \n     its partners--who include Caithness Energy, Google, and \n     Sumitomo--a $1.06 billion loan guarantee, as soon as GE's 338 \n     turbines start turning at Shepherds Flat, the Treasury \n     Department will send the project developers a cash grant of \n     $490 million.\n       On December 9, the American Council on Renewable Energy \n     issued a press release urging Congress to quickly extend the \n     1603 program and the renewable-energy production tax credit, \n     because they will ``bolster renewable energy's success and \n     American competitiveness.''\n       But time is running short. Backers of the renewable-energy \n     credits say that to assure continuity on various projects, a \n     bill must be passed into law by March 2012. If that doesn't \n     happen, they are predicting domestic investment in renewable \n     energy could fall by 50 percent. A bill now pending in the \n     House would extend the production tax credit for four \n     additional years, through 2017. The bill has 40 sponsors, 9 \n     are Republicans. The bill is awaiting a hearing by the House \n     Ways and Means Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Los Angeles Times, July 24, 2011]\n\n       Wind Farms Multiply, Fueling Clashes With Nearby Residents\n\n                            (By Tiffany Hsu)\n\n       Tehachapi, CA.--Donna and Bob Moran moved to the wind-\n     whipped foothills here four years ago looking for solitude \n     and serenity amid the pinyon pines and towering Joshua trees.\n       But lately their view of the valley is being marred by a \n     growing swarm of whirring wind turbines--many taller than the \n     Statue of Liberty--sweeping ever closer to their home.\n       ``Once, you could see stars like you wouldn't believe,'' \n     Donna Moran said. ``Now, with the lights from the turbines, \n     you can't even see the night sky.''\n       It's about to get worse.\n       Turbines are multiplying at blistering speeds as wind \n     developers, drawn by the area's powerful gusts, attempt to \n     meet an insatiable demand for clean energy.\n       Helo Energy plans to scatter 450-foot machines across \n     hundreds of acres in nearby Sand Canyon. A few miles away, \n     near the Old West Ranch enclave, Terra-Gen Power is building \n     the nation's largest wind farm with hundreds of turbines, if \n     not more. The project, Alta Wind Energy Center, is backed by \n     hundreds of millions of dollars from Google Inc. and \n     Citibank.\n       Federal and local officials hail the Tehachapi Valley, a \n     harsh desert expanse about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, as \n     an alternative energy mecca that will help wean Americans off \n     fossil fuel. Kern County, home to the nation's largest \n     concentration of wind farms, is looking forward to millions \n     of dollars in much-needed tax revenue and has approved most \n     proposed installations.\n       But wind projects aren't only proliferating in the region's \n     outskirts. Nearly 3,000 turbines, many of them bigger than \n     Ferris wheels, were installed across the country last year.\n       The growth is being propelled by federal incentives and \n     state clean-energy mandates. In April, Gov. Jerry Brown \n     signed a law that requires California utilities to get 33% of \n     the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2020. As of \n     the first quarter of 2011, they're at 17.9%.\n       But with thousands more wind projects on the drawing board, \n     they're increasingly generating opposition among local \n     residents. Less than 100 miles from Tehachapi in the Antelope \n     Valley, proposed turbine developments are facing similar \n     resistance. Across the country, Cape Cod, Mass., residents \n     and political heavyweights such as Sen. John Kerry waged war \n     against what could be the country's first offshore wind farm.\n       And the issue isn't just with wind turbines, said Tom Soto, \n     an environmental activist and managing partner of Craton \n     Equity Partners.\n       ``These large projects enter at their own peril without \n     involving the community,'' Soto said. ``Just because they're \n     renewables instead of landfills doesn't mean they're off the \n     hook.''\n       Residents of Blythe, Calif., near the border with Arizona, \n     showed up at the recent groundbreaking of Solar Millennium's \n     massive solar plant there to protest its proximity to sacred \n     Native American sites. Gleaming mirrors will blanket nearly \n     6,000 acres, helping to generate electricity for Southern \n     California Edison.\n       In San Diego County, critics have spent the better part of \n     a decade trying to block the Sunrise Powerlink transmission \n     network, which would bring electricity from far-flung solar \n     and wind farms.\n       Activists there and elsewhere say that the fight is more \n     than a classic case of ``not in my backyard'' resistance. \n     Large, remote projects aren't the only solution to the \n     nation's energy woes, they say.\n       City-dwellers could produce just as much clean electricity \n     without the transmission hassles, they said, using rooftop \n     solar panels, small wind turbines, fuel cells and other \n     adaptable forms of renewable energy generation.\n       ``We're going to need to find space to place these \n     projects,'' Soto said. ``A successful portfolio will be \n     balanced, with some utility-scale projects and some urban \n     projects.''\n       Tehachapi activist Terry Warsaw said he's worried his \n     community will soon be surrounded by turbines.\n       ``Alternative energy has lulled us into a sense of \n     complacency,'' he said. ``The potential is here to take over \n     every ridge and every mountainside if the community isn't \n     careful.''\n       Veterinarian Beverly Billingsley has been hosting anti-\n     turbine community meetings in her new Sand Canyon barn, just \n     up the slope from where the cluster of 450-foot machines is \n     slated for construction.\n       ``They are not benign things,'' she said. ``We've seen \n     turbines go berserk.''\n       The machines get no more sympathy from Mother Mary \n     Augustine, who lives cloistered at the Norbertine Sisters \n     Monastery in a cradle of hills recently eyed for wind \n     development.\n       ``Monstrous insects,'' she calls them. ``I look at the \n     propellers for a moment and my head gets dizzy.''\n       It's not that they dislike alternative energy, residents \n     say. Many employ solar panels and smaller turbines to power \n     their homes.\n       Lately, though, locals say that farm animals have begun \n     cowering as construction vehicles rumble across lawns and \n     surveyor helicopters roar overhead. There are worries about \n     turbine oil leaking into water wells and turbines obstructing \n     landing maneuvers at the local airport.\n       ``Avian cuisinarts,'' said Sand Canyon resident April \n     Biglay. She worries that more turbines could slaughter birds \n     or cause ground vibrations that could decimate native \n     species.\n       ``We are resembling hundreds of towns around the country,'' \n     she said.\n       Last year, an older machine began spinning uncontrollably, \n     forcing authorities to shut down a main freeway for hours. \n     The resulting traffic was an anomaly in a community where \n     most jams are caused by high school football games and \n     meandering sheep.\n       Fire is also a concern, with turbines' finicky electrical \n     wiring, long fire department response times and limited roads \n     on which to flee.\n       And the turbines could topple in an earthquake, since \n     they're situated in sedentary soil directly on the Garlock \n     fault line, residents say.\n       Some suggest that removing trees to make way for the \n     machines could lead to erosion and flooding.\n       They also argue that the projects aren't helping the local \n     economy. Local residents say pickup trucks driven by \n     construction workers often have out-of-state license plates. \n     Each new project causes nearby property values to plunge as \n     much as 40%, city officials say.\n       And because companies aren't required to dismantle the \n     turbines when they stop functioning, many will join the \n     hordes of ``mechanical dinosaurs'' that already crowd the \n     area, critics say.\n       Other residents say they're tired of making sacrifices for \n     electricity that will go to other counties.\n       ``It's a question of what you're willing to give up to be \n     green,'' said local lawyer Kassandra McQuillen of some recent \n     project plans. ``It's like proposing clear-cutting Griffith \n     Observatory or the cliffs of Malibu.''\n       Residents say they've won some victories. Developer Terra-\n     Gen yanked its 7,000-acre Pahnamid project last month after \n     opponents slammed plans to set up nearly 150 turbines on the \n     Tehachapi crests.\n       ``It is not unusual for projects to fall by the wayside \n     early in the development process,'' Terra-Gen said in a \n     statement. ``The decision to pull back in an early stage on \n     the Pahnamid project was a result of several important \n     development concerns, including local opposition.''\n       By the end of the year, the developer said it will have \n     invested $2.2 billion in Kern County, become the county's \n     third largest taxpayer with $30 million a year and made more \n     progress building its 1,100-megawatt Alta project.\n       But with so many projects on the plate for the region, \n     Tehachapi city officials are urging Kern County to impose a \n     temporary moratorium on wind projects near homes. And the \n     city that has long been associated with the fields of \n     propellers is now trying to draw tourists by talking up its \n     chili cook-offs, historic downtown and pristine mountains.\n       ``We've coexisted with the turbines for a long time,'' City \n     Council member Susan Wiggins said. ``But we don't want to \n     look like one big wind park.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Boston Globe, Feb. 2, 2012]\n\n               Town Turns Off Wind, Opts for Solar Energy\n\n                            (By Robert Knox)\n\n       At a time of accelerating production of both wind and solar \n     energy, Duxbury officials have decided to buy solar energy \n     produced elsewhere and take their own wind project off the \n     table.\n       ``It's an opportunity to save money,'' Jim Goldenberg, \n     chairman of the town's Alternative Energy Committee, said \n     after town selectmen signed a 20-year agreement with a solar \n     energy company that plans to build its facility in Acushnet.\n       The deal is expected to save the town up to $30,000 a year \n     in energy costs and supply\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\n     about 25 percent of the energy the town needs to run \n     facilities such as schools, Town Hall, and other buildings, \n     officials say. The producer, Pegasus Renewable Energy \n     Partners LLC of Marstons Mills, has yet to begin construction \n     of the solar farm. It's expected to take about a year to \n     begin producing power.\n       Duxbury is also moving ahead on a plan to lease its capped \n     landfill to a private developer, American Capital Energy, a \n     national company whose customers include the Army, to build a \n     solar energy farm there. Town Meeting backed the project last \n     fall.\n       The town's move to buy solar energy was made in conjunction \n     with the Alternative Energy Committee's decision to put a \n     hold on the possibility of building a wind turbine. The \n     decision comes at a time when neighboring Kingston is touting \n     the construction of five turbines within its borders. \n     Kingston officials said their town's wind and solar projects \n     together would earn up to a $1 million a year in new revenue.\n       Until recently Duxbury was planning to build a wind \n     turbine, too. Goldenberg's committee had planned to seek \n     funding from Town Meeting to continue its feasibility study \n     of a wind turbine on town property next to its North Hill \n     golf course.\n       But that plan came under attack by a group of residents who \n     said they feared that living near a turbine would undermine \n     their health, lower their property values, and alter the \n     neighborhood's residential character. They hired an attorney, \n     produced a report attacking the financial basis of the \n     project, and won a vote from selectmen urging the committee \n     not to seek funds for the project.\n       Local wind power advocates cried foul. They said opponents \n     were relying on a corporate-quality website and dubious \n     information supplied by an anti-wind lobby with little \n     connection to the town.\n       But Goldenberg said his group chose the solar option solely \n     based on a comparison of the economics of the wind turbine \n     project relative to the solar deals committee members have \n     been working on. The bottom line, he said, is that a wind \n     turbine on North Hill would produce electricity at $.155 per \n     kilowatt hour versus $.10 per kilowatt hour to buy solar, a \n     35 percent cost differential.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are going to vote on Judge \nJordan, a Cuban-American Federal district judge, who has been named by \nthe President to go to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Jordan came out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. As \nSenator Rubio and I spoke on Monday, the two of us, in a bipartisan \nway, do all of the selection of our Federal district judges--and it is \nall done in a bipartisan way.\n  In this case, with Judge Jordan being elevated to the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals--again, done in a bipartisan way and, indeed, \nthe motion for cloture on the nomination; that is, to stop all debate \non the nomination, was passed at a 5:30 vote Monday afternoon by a vote \nof 89 to 5. So at noon today, we are going to vote on the actual \nconfirmation, which is the second step in the process: after the \nPresident nominates, the Senate confirms. Judge Jordan, by our vote \ntoday--which I expect will be rather overwhelmingly bipartisan--will \nascend to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals as the first Hispanic \njudge on that Court of Appeals.\n  I think it is instructive that we could have done all of this Monday \nat about 6:00 after the vote had occurred 89 to 5 to cut off debate. \nYet the Senate rules allow even one Senator, if they object--which one \nSenator did object--to the waiving of the cloture cutting off debate. \nThe Senate rules say there can be up to 30 hours of debate before the \nmatter at hand is voted on.\n  Of course, with a vote of 89 to 5, it is pretty well determined, \nespecially since Senator Rubio and I were the ones who were bringing \nthis judge to the attention of the Senate. Yet here we are.\n  It is now Wednesday at noon that it is going to take us to get to \nthis judge. This is illustrative of how the Senate is not working. For \nwhatever reason, the Senator who objected--which, by the way, it is my \nunderstanding that the Senator had no objection to the judge; it is \nsome other extraneous matter and, therefore, wanted to slow up and \nthrow rocks into the gears of the Senate so that what could have been \ndispensed with on Monday evening at 6:00 is now taking all the way \nuntil noontime on Wednesday, after the 30 hours have run.\n  For the Senate to function it has to have a measure of trust among \nSenators. It has to be bipartisan. The two leaders have to get along. \nIn the process, a lot of the work is done by unanimous consent, with \nthe consent of the two leaders, the Democratic leader and the \nRepublican leader. But when things get too hyperpartisan or too \nideologically rigid, then that is when the whole process, the mechanism \ngoes out of kilter. It is just another illustration in this time of an \nelection cycle for President where things are highly sensitive from a \npolitical, partisan, and ideological standpoint that a judge who is \nwarmly embraced by both sides for his confirmation is getting held up.\n  I will close by recalling the reason that Judge Jordan got a vote of \n89 to 5: He has had a stellar record as a Federal district judge. He \nhas, over the course of his career, clerked, when he came out of law \nschool, for a judge on the Eleventh Circuit. Then he clerked for \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. He went back and was an assistant U.S. \nattorney, and then went to the bench and has been there for over a \ndecade.\n  This is the kind of person we want to have in the judicial branch of \nour government.\n  I commend him on behalf of Senator Rubio. The two of us have been in \na meeting all morning in duties of another committee, the Intelligence \nCommittee. I commend to the Senate, on behalf of Senator Rubio and me, \nJudge Jordan to be confirmed for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the bill that the Senate will soon be considering to state \nwhy I oppose the bill in its current form. I am speaking of the bill \nthat we oftentimes refer to as the Transportation bill.\n  I do think this bill does some good things. I supported it coming out \nof the EPW Committee. It had very sound bipartisan support in that \ncommittee.\n  But there is a serious concern with the bill, a concern for all of \nus. Specifically, there is a provision in the bill that is what I would \ncall an earmark. However, it is often referred to by our rule as a \ncongressionally directed spending item. Let me again say, purely and \nsimply, it is an earmark. That is why, even though I supported the bill \nin committee, I did feel very strongly about that provision and I felt \ncompelled to vote against proceeding to the bill and that is why I am \nhere today, filing an amendment.\n  This provision changes the purpose of an earmark that was included in \nthe previous highway bill. Then the language goes on to do a second \nthing: It newly directs the money back to the same State where the \nearmarked project would have occurred, that being the State of Nevada. \nLet me repeat that. It takes an unspent earmark from a previous highway \nbill in Nevada and it replaces it with yet another earmark to the State \nof Nevada. I will go into further detail.\n  First, the bill identifies any unobligated balances associated with \nthis earmark. The bill reads:\n\n       . . . any unobligated balances of amounts required to be \n     allocated to a State by section such and such of the SAFETEA \n     LU. . . .\n\n  In other words, it goes to the unobligated balances, which was an \nearmark. If you go back to the previous highway bill, this section \n1307(d)(1) is an earmark in that previous bill. But it does not stop \nthere. It does not stop by rescinding that earmark. It goes on to say \nin the text of the bill we are considering that this money ``shall \ninstead be made available to such State . . .''--the State of Nevada.\n  So we have rescinded the earmark, but then we said the money goes \nback to the same State. In other words, the earmarked money is now \ndirected by law, if this were to pass, back to the State where the \nproject was to be built.\n  Two wrongs do not make a right. If several million dollars is sitting \nidly\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nby in an account and we want to rescind those funds, then that is \npretty straightforward. We direct the rescission of those funds and do \nnot earmark it to a specific State. If we are going to start the game, \nthough, of earmarking--which I believe is what this does--obviously \nthere will be a lot of other Senators who believe in earmarks who will \nsay I want my turn also. I do not happen to believe in earmarks, but \nsome of my colleagues would say: Look, if you can do this for one \nState, you can do it for my State. So if every State can direct \nspecific spending to their own State, then we are right back in the \nbusiness of earmarking.\n  I will not necessarily speak to the purposes behind the change in the \nproject, although it is pretty clear from newspaper articles out of \nNevada that this money is going to be used for a road project. I will \nleave the defense of the policy to others. What I will say is that the \nprovision without a shadow of a doubt meets the definition of an \nearmark under rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate. The bottom \nline is that the provision in the bill will direct Federal funds to a \nsingle State.\n  Rule XLIV of our standing rules, the Standing Rules of the Senate, as \nwe all know, defines what is a congressionally directed spending item. \nI will quote that rule:\n\n       . . . a provision or report language included primarily at \n     the request of a Senator providing, authorizing or \n     recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for \n     a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or \n     other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a \n     specific State--\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       locality or Congressional district, other than through a \n     statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive \n     award process.\n\n  There was a reason why that language is included in that rule and it \nis what is happening here. If you could simply direct funds to your \nState, then, as I said previously, we are back in the earmarking \nbusiness.\n  Furthermore, the bill before the Senate was written based on the \nunderstanding that there would be no earmarks. Everybody is running \naround saying there are no earmarks in the bill. Everybody has been \nvery public about saying that. That posture was well received. It was \ncommended, in fact. It was commended, in my judgment, in part because \nmany understood that a highway bill that included earmarks simply would \nnot pass. In other words, a ``no earmark'' policy was necessary to get \nthis bill done.\n  So at the moment I am very concerned that we will have damaged the \nSenate bill, our legislative process, and hurt the chances of a highway \nbill getting done. I think the highway bill makes a lot of sense for \nour country, but we have to solve this kind of problem. I cannot \nsupport the bill with an earmark for one State, the State of Nevada.\n  Even the President of the United States has weighed in on this. He \nhas taken a very strong stand. He said, ``If a bill comes to my desk \nwith an earmark inside, I will veto it.''\n  This highway bill is far too important for us to jeopardize its \npassage or to invite a veto by the President, just because the \nprovision is very hard to find and buried at page 463.\n  I think there is a way to move forward on the highway bill, at least \nas far as this is concerned. I think our State and local leaders are \nhoping we pass a highway bill. There are a lot of good things that \ncould happen with it, but this has to come out of the bill. This needs \nto change, and my hope is the Senate will agree to my amendment to do \njust that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Adalberto Jose Jordan, of \nFlorida, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally vote on the \nnomination of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit. Finally, after a 4 month \nRepublican filibuster that was broken by an 89 to 5 vote on Monday, and \nafter Republicans insisted on two additional days of delay, the Senate \nwill have a vote.\n  Judge Jordan is by any measure the kind of consensus nominee who \nshould have been confirmed after being reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee last October. Despite the strong support of his \nhome State Senators, Senator Nelson, a Democrat, and Senator Rubio, a \nRepublican, Republicans filibustered and delayed this confirmation for \nmonths. They prevented the Senate from voting on Judge Jordan's \nnomination in October, in November, in December, and in January. And it \nshould not have taken another 2 days after the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to bring the debate to a close to have this vote.\n  This superbly-qualified nominee will be the first Cuban-American on \nthe Eleventh Circuit. His record of achievement is beyond reproach. The \nonly statements about this nominee--by me, by Senator Nelson and even \nby the Republican Senators who spoke--described him as qualified and \nworthy of confirmation. The stalling, the delays, the obstruction, even \nthe votes against ending the filibuster were all about something else, \nsome collateral issue. They should not have marred this process and \ncomplicated this nomination. They should not have delayed this moment \nwhen Cuban Americans will see one of their own elevated to the second \nhighest court in the land. I appreciate the attention that Hispanics \nfor a Fair Judiciary and the Hispanic National Bar Association have \ngiven this important nomination. Their work will finally be rewarded, \nas well.\n  The junior Senator from Kentucky held up this nominee for his own \npurposes--purposes having nothing to do with the nominee. He did it in \norder to gain leverage to force a vote on an unrelated and ill-advised \namendment. You cannot amend a nomination. So now that he has forced the \nSenate into 2 days of inactivity, the Senate will finally vote.\n  As I said yesterday, the goals of Senator Paul's amendment are \nalready the law of the land. The new conditions on military aid for \nEgypt, which I wrote with Senator Graham, passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority and were signed into law just 2 months ago without \nSenator Paul's support. Those conditions require certification by the \nSecretary of State that the Egyptian military is supporting the \ntransition of civilian government and protecting fundamental freedoms \nand due process. Unlike Senator Paul's proposed amendment, these \nconditions again, already the law--do not pose a risk of backfiring on \nus and on our ally Israel.\n  Moreover, once this misguided obstruction is ended and the Senate has \nvoted to confirm Judge Jordan to fill the judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe Eleventh Circuit, the Senate will turn back to its work on the \nsurface transportation bill. As Senator Boxer said this morning, that \nbipartisan bill can save or create 2.8 million jobs. That, too, should \nbe a priority, not a pin\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\ncushion to attach ill-advised foreign policy amendments.\n  This is the kind of obstruction that is hard to explain to the \nAmerican people. A Florida lawyer and former prosecutor was quoted in \nthe Orlando Sentinel saying: ``It's a good reason why Congress' \napproval rating is 10 percent.'' He continued: ``Politics should have \nno place in the nomination and confirmation of excellent jurists like \nJudge Jordan. Shouldn't happen. We need qualified judicial nominees on \nthe bench, big time.'' It is the kind of senseless obstruction that \ncomes at a great cost to the millions of Americans living in Florida, \nGeorgia and Alabama who are affected by the judicial emergency vacancy \non the Eleventh Circuit. I am glad that they will finally have a judge \nto fill that vacancy.\n  I am certain that all Americans will be well served by Judge \nAdalberto Jordan. He has proven through his long career on the bench \nand as a prosecutor to be a public servant of tremendous quality and \nintegrity. I congratulate Judge Jordan, his family, Senator Nelson, \nSenator Rubio and the people of Florida on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised that there is nobody else who \nwishes to speak, so I ask unanimous consent to yield back any time and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I fear one of the major issues that not \nonly faces our country but faces our planet is not getting the kind of \nserious debate and discussion it needs in the Senate; that is, the \nplanetary crisis of global warming, what its impact is having now in \nour country and in other countries throughout the world and how, in \nfact, we can address this enormous crisis.\n  I understand politically some of my colleagues do not believe global \nwarming is real and they do not think there is much our country should \nor can do to address this crisis. I understand that. But with all due \nrespect, I strongly disagree with that position and believe, in terms \nof the future of our planet, the lives of our kids and our \ngrandchildren, that is a very wrongheaded position and could lead to \nenormous problems for our country and for the rest of the world.\n  But the truth is, the real debate about global warming is not whether \nother Members of the Senate disagree with me or Senator Udall, the \nissue is what the scientific community, the people who have studied \nthis issue for years, in fact, believes. As I think the Presiding \nOfficer understands, the overwhelming consensus in our country and \naround the world from the scientific community is, A, global warming is \nreal, and, B, to a very significant degree global warming is manmade.\n  That is not just my position, not just what I say or what other \nMembers of the Senate say. Far more important, it is what leading \nscientists all over the world are saying.\n  The National Academy of Sciences in this country, joined by academies \nof science in the United Kingdom, Italy, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, \nRussia, Germany, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, has said--this \nis their statement, the National Academy of Sciences-- ``. . . climate \nchange is happening even faster than previously estimated'' and the \n``need for urgent action to address climate change is now \nindisputable.''\n  It is fine for radio talk show hosts to have their view. Frankly, I \nthink it is more significant that the scientific community from all \nover the world is in agreement. Let me repeat what they say: `` . . . \nclimate change is happening even faster than previously estimated'' and \nthe ``need for urgent action to address climate change is now \nindisputable.''\n  Mr. President, 18 scientific societies, including the American \nGeophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience, said:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver.\n\n  That is not I; that is 18 scientific societies, including the \nAmerican Geophysical Union and the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science.\n  They continue:\n\n       These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines \n     of evidence, and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an \n     objective assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed \n     science.\n\n  But it is not only the scientific community. It is agencies of the \nU.S. Government that have to deal or worry about the impact of global \nwarming.\n  The Department of Defense says:\n\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n\n       Climate change is an accelerant of instability.\n\n  What they worry about is, as the planet warms, as floods occur, as \ndrought occurs, we are going to see migrations of people, we are going \nto see countries fighting over limited natural resources, whether it is \nfarmland or whether it is water. From the Department of Defense \nperspective, they say, and I repeat:\n\n       Climate change is an accelerant of instability.\n\n  That is the U.S. Department of Defense--not Bernie Sanders.\n  The CIA--our intelligence agency--says: `` . . . climate change could \nhave significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to \npoverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of \nfragile governments,'' as well as ``food and water scarcity.''\n  That is not a Senator on the floor. That is the Central Intelligence \nAgency, the business of which is to gather and assess threats to our \ncountry.\n  Interestingly enough, there are segments of the business community \nthat are also speaking out on climate change and global warming for \ntheir own reasons.\n  The insurance industry, in a report from the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners, found there is ``broad consensus among \ninsurers that climate change will have an effect on extreme weather \nevents.''\n  What we are seeing is that scientists all over the world, academic \ninstitutions all over the world, governmental agencies right here in \nthe United States of America--including the Department of Defense and \nthe CIA--and the insurance industry saying global warming is real, it \nis a real threat to our planet, and it is imperative we address it.\n  I have more to say on this issue, and some of us will be on the floor \nfor an hour, but I want to give the floor over to Senator Tom Udall \nfrom New Mexico, who has certainly been a leading advocate in the fight \nfor policies that will reverse global warming and move us in another \ndirection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, thank you so very much.\n  I first wish to ask my colleague from Vermont a little bit about some \nof the things he said that I find remarkable.\n  We are still in a very fragile recession. The economy is starting to \ngrow, but it is not strong enough, and we could slip back. So what has \nhappened is, we have these--what we call in this language--tax \nextenders. What we are talking about is jobs, isn't it? We are talking \nabout the idea that we can have a clean energy economy; that over the \nlast couple years this has been the fastest growing sector, and we have \na production tax credit for wind, we have a section in the Treasury \nDepartment's 603, and those provisions create jobs.\n\n  I just wish to ask the Senator, it seems to me, at this particular \ntime, we have the potential to grow the American economy, but we have \nto get off the dime because these things expire on February 29--in less \nthan 2 weeks.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I say to my friend, he is absolutely right. The issue we \nare talking about now is not only trying to reverse global warming and \nsave the planet, what we are talking about is creating, over a period \nof years, millions of good-paying jobs.\n  We may not know it from some media reports, but the fact is the solar \nindustry in this country is exploding. All over this country, we are \nseeing more and more installations of solar panels, we are seeing the \nproduction of solar. One of the issues I think Senator Udall is \nreferring to is whether the United States of America will be a leader \nin sustainable energy or are we going to give that whole enormous \neconomic area over to China.\n  I know the Senator and I are in agreement that we believe American \nworkers can manufacture those panels. We think American workers can \ninstall those panels.\n  We also understand it is not just solar, it is wind; that these \nindustries need some of the help that the fossil fuel industry has been \nreceiving for years. I think we will also be talking about the whole \nissue of energy efficiency and weatherization, which in my State is \nenormously important. We are creating jobs, saving consumers money, as \nwe retrofit their homes and cut back on their use of fuel.\n  So, yes, I say to the Senator, we are talking about a major jobs \nissue.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Sanders, the thing we \nshould focus on, when it comes to wind farms, is how much these wind \nfarms can be expanded in terms of jobs. The average wind farm in \nAmerica built today has 50 large wind turbines. Each turbine can \nproduce electricity to power roughly 500 homes, even accounting for the \nvariability of the winds. So the average wind farm can power about \n25,000 homes.\n  The average wind farm, then, produces many other benefits. This is \nwhat is remarkable to me: There is $20 million in construction payroll \nin a year from an average wind farm; $875,000 per year to rural local \nschool districts; and also $280,000 per year to rural county \ngovernments; $150,000 per year in ongoing direct payroll for employees; \n$1.5 million in contract labor payroll; and $300,000 to $600,000 per \nyear in royalties to land owners, farmers, and ranchers.\n  So when we talk about wind--wind power--what we are talking about is \nAmerican jobs, clean energy jobs, growing the economy, and it mystifies \nme that our friends on the Republican side and in the House are saying: \nThese things are going to expire in 2 weeks, and there is no hurry to \npush them, to put them in place, and to move it. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding, that they are saying we are going to let them expire?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Absolutely. It is incomprehensible. Here we have \ntechnologies that are incredibly successful. They are producing \nsubstantial amounts of energy, without pollution, without greenhouse \ngases. They are creating jobs. Of course, we should continue these tax \ncredits, these extenders to make sure these industries can flourish.\n  Some people may think when Senator Udall and I talk about wind and \nsolar, we are talking about some kind of fringe idea. Let's be clear; \nin the State of Texas today they are producing 10,000 megawatts of \nelectricity through wind. That is the equivalent of 10 average-sized \nnuclear powerplants. That is not insignificant. In Iowa, as I \nunderstand it, about 20 percent of the electricity in that State is \ngenerated from wind.\n  So we are in the beginning, in the first stages of a real revolution \nto transform our energy system to clean, safe energy which, in the \nprocess, can create, over a period of years, millions of good-paying \njobs.\n  So I would certainly agree with the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Sanders, one of the things \nthat I think is very instructive is that the history of the wind \nproduction tax credit has been completely bipartisan. I would like to \nlay out a little bit of that history.\n  The production tax credit began in a bipartisan energy policy in \n1992, signed by then-President George H.W. Bush. It was extended in \nDecember 1999 by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President \nClinton. It was extended again in 2002 and in 2004, this time signed \ninto law by President George W. Bush. In 2005, it was extended again as \na part of bipartisan energy legislation, the 2005 Energy Policy Act. \nThe Senator and I, I think, were both in the House at that time, and we \nvoted for that in the House. In December 2006, it was extended again. \nMost recently, it was extended in the 2009 Recovery Act, which was \nsigned by President Obama.\n  So Congress should continue this bipartisan tradition and extend the \nwind production tax credit, these other tax credits that create clean \nenergy jobs, and stay focused on the good job we have been doing that \nhas been bipartisan. That is why I do not understand the House, the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee saying: Oh, we can do these \nlater. We need to do this work today. We need to put that in place now \nso that we can grow these clean energy jobs. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Well, the Senator is absolutely right. Everybody \nunderstands that if you are in business, if you are in wind or in \nsolar, you have to be planning for the future. And if you do not \nbelieve or you are uncertain about whether these tax credits are\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\ngoing to be available, what is going to happen is you are not going to \ngo forward. We know there are examples right now of major projects that \nhave already been canceled.\n  Furthermore, we are not talking--given the context of U.S. Government \nexpenditures--about a huge amount of money, but it is money that I \nthink is very well spent, protects our environment, and creates jobs.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island has joined us. Senator Whitehouse \nhas surely been one of the strongest advocates for our environment and \nthe need to address global warming.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am glad to have a chance to join with you today. I \nappreciate very much Senator Sanders convening us on this day when we \nhave agreed, it appears, to extend the payroll tax; we have agreed, it \nappears, to extend unemployment insurance; and we have agreed, it \nappears, to extend the payments for doctors under Medicare, under the \nso-called doc fix. And the one piece that has fallen out was the tax \nextenders that support our clean energy industry.\n  Our clean energy industry has more employees than Big Oil, and there \nare well-paying jobs. It is a growing industry, and it creates American \nmanufacturing and American installation.\n  Senator Udall was talking about the economic value of these wind \nfarms. I know that in his home State, there are plenty of wind farms \nthat are built on the land. In my home State, we are working toward \nhaving wind farms that are built offshore. And the ability to construct \nthose giant turbines at Quonset Point in Rhode Island, in order to \ninstall them offshore and enjoy the power and the jobs that result, is \nsomething that is really important to us.\n  So I am glad the Senator has called us together to focus on this \nquestion of the tax extenders and also to focus on the environmental \nharm of climate change. I will turn it back to the Senator, but I wish \nto make one last point before I do, which is that there is a certain \namount of sort of snickering around Washington about climate change, \nwhich is a unique feature to Washington. If you go out in the \nscientific community, nobody is laughing. They are very anxious. They \nare worried.\n  The major scientific organizations have all signed off on public \nletters urging us to do something about this because it is so \nsignificant. We have looked out at the first dozen billion-dollar \nstorms year that we have had. Wherever you look around the world, we \nare seeing extreme weather. And the notion that when the scientists \npredicted extreme weather and now we are seeing it--if that should not \nbe cause for additional concern, that really flies in the face of both \nprudence and reality.\n  The last area where we are really getting clobbered is with our \noceans. As we pump, in human time, unprecedented amounts of carbon into \nour atmosphere, it is taken up by the oceans. It is absorbed by the \noceans. During the course of the Industrial Revolution and to now, the \noceans have absorbed enormous amounts of carbon. It is changing the \noceans. It is killing off coral reefs in the tropical areas. It is \nmaking the oceans so acidic that the little organisms that are at the \nbase of the food chain are having trouble growing to their proper size. \nIt is becoming a hostile environment. Creatures do not live well in an \nenvironment in which they are increasingly soluble.\n  These are not theories, these are measurements by scientists who go \nout and actually measure what is happening. The blindness in Washington \nto this problem is something that is not only a cause for concern now \nbut is going to be a cause for harsh judgment in history's eyes.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, may I just ask the Senator--\nand I know he may have other places to go, but he mentioned offshore \nwind on the Atlantic coast, and the study out of the University of \nDelaware indicated that off of the Atlantic coast there is the \npotential in wind to generate enough electricity to power the entire \neast coast group of cities--very large cities, as you know--from \nProvidence, to New York, to Boston. And Google is already out there \nstarting to lay the grid with some other partners. So we have huge \npotential to move forward, and basically what we are being told at this \npoint is, oh, let these things expire.\n  That is a very shortsighted position. But that study about the coast \nis an eye-opener because it tells the American people: Look, here is \nclean energy. We do not have to import oil anymore. We do not have to \nbring in energy from outside. Just off our coast, we can go out there \nand put a grid in place and generate wind energy. I know the Senator \nhas probably heard about this study.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I can, let me just jump in to ask unanimous consent \nthat Senators Whitehouse, Udall, and I be permitted to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I could ask Senator Whitehouse and Senator Udall a \nsimple question--and Senator Whitehouse raised this issue--all over the \nworld, there really is no debate within the scientific community about \nthe reality of global warming, the basic causes of global warming, the \nseverity of global warming. Yet suddenly here in this Congress it \nbecomes a major political issue. We fund the National Institutes of \nHealth. We fund scientific organizations. They do research on cancer. \nThey do research on heart disease. They do all kinds of research. I \ndon't see great political debate about what this says. And suddenly, \nwhen you have almost unanimity within the scientific community, this \nbecomes this great dividing political issue. How did it happen that \nwhere there is so much unanimity among the scientific community in this \ncountry and around the world, this has become such a hot-potato \npolitical issue?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Special interests would be my answer. We have seen it \nbefore. We saw the science mocked that tobacco was injurious to human \nhealth. We saw the science mocked that the lead in paint was injurious \nto children. And now we have seen mockery of the science that shows \nthat when you put unprecedented amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, \nit changes things.\n\n  The science is actually not new. The scientist who created the global \nwarming theory was a scientist named Tindall who published his work \naround the time of the American Civil War, and it has never been \ncontroversial. The idea that when you put enormous amounts of carbon \ninto the atmosphere, it creates a warming effect, a blanketing effect, \nwe have known this literally since the horse-and-buggy era. The \ndifference is that there are now powerful special interests that are \ninvolved.\n  To Senator Udall's points, we are at a point of choice. We can choose \nto go toward having the environmental needs of the country met and the \nenergy needs of the country met with clean, American-made, manufactured \npower that is renewable. The Senator is right about the capabilities of \noffshore wind on the east coast, but that is not the only road we can \ntake. We can continue to support multinational mega-corporations that \nhave no loyalty to any flag or nation, that traffic internationally in \noil, and that want to make sure that we stay, as President Bush said, \naddicted to oil. There is a choice, and I think those special interests \nhave a clear desire as to what choice this country should make. I \nhappen to believe it is contrary to this country's national interests, \nso that is why we are here fighting to try to steer in the other \ndirection.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Just to the point of why we aren't able to \nmove--and I agree with Senator Whitehouse, and I think Senator Sanders \nhas seen this also--when you get into energy, there are huge, powerful \nspecial interests--especially those special interests that are \nrepresenting fossil fuels--and they would love nothing better than to \njust have the status quo. What we have seen is they are relying--and \nthis is amazing to me, and the Senator has been one of the leaders on \nthis issue where Big Oil is getting subsidies today from the Federal \nGovernment, and we have tried to take those Big Oil subsidies and move \nthem over into the clean energy area. They resist that even though \nPresident Bush and the leaders of their industry say: We don't need \nthese subsidies.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I could just point out, picking up on Senator Udall's \npoint, in recent years we have seen, as everybody in America knows--not \nonly\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nare we paying outrageously high prices at the pump, but we are seeing \noil companies making huge profits. My recollection is that in the last \n10 years the oil companies have made about $1 trillion in profits. \nExxonMobil has made more money than any corporation in history. Yet, \nover the last 10 years, there have been examples, there have been cases \nin a given year where a major oil company--ExxonMobil being one--made \nhuge profits, billions in profits, and ended up paying zero in Federal \nincome taxes and, in fact, got a rebate. So you have this absurd \nsituation where hugely profitable oil companies are paying nothing in \ntaxes, and some of us think that does not make any sense at all. We \nthink they should pay their fair share and that to a significant degree \nthat money should go into sustainable energy so that we can break our \naddiction to oil.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And the results are really profound.\n  I will close with this point in this discussion. For as long \nessentially as mankind has been on this Earth, for 800,000 years--to \nput 800,000 years in scale, we have probably been engaged in \nagriculture as a species for 10,000 or 15,000 years. Before that we \nwere pure hunter-gatherers. So 800,000 years--8,000 centuries--is an \nenormous period of time in human history. It is essentially the entire \nsweep of the human species on the face of the Earth. Throughout that \nperiod, we have existed within an atmosphere that stayed within a range \nof carbon concentration. For the first time in 8,000 centuries, we have \nnow rocketed outside of that range. That ought to be a pretty \nsignificant warning to us that we are in new and untested territory in \nterms of the basic conditions of the environment that supports our \nspecies. And because the concentrations in the atmosphere have grown so \ngreatly, so has the acidity of our oceans. If you go back into \ngeological time to look at what changes such as these can potentially \nlead to, you see really massive adverse events such as catastrophic \ndie-offs of species.\n  So we are playing with potentially very big consequences. We are \nplaying outside of the boundaries that have governed our planet for \n800,000 years, and we are refusing to correct what is going on, I \nbelieve, as both of you have pointed out, because of one predominant \nreason; that is, the power of special interests to phony-up a debate in \nthis town.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Two weeks from today, the payroll tax cut \nchampioned by the President and extended by Congress in December will \nexpire.\n\n  Congress should renew this financial relief to American working \nfamilies while our economy is still recovering.\n  For a family making $50,000 a year, the payroll tax cut means about \n$1,000 a year, or about $40 in every paycheck.\n  I'm encouraged by recent progress that Congress will resolve this \nissue, but the payroll tax cut is not the only tax provision that can \ncreate jobs in New Mexico, and across the Nation.\n  The production tax credit for wind is set to expire at the end of \nthis year. The Treasury Grant Program for renewable energy tax credits \nexpired this past December.\n  One of the best things we can do to help our economy recover is \ninvest in the clean energy economy. It has created the jobs of the \nfuture while the broader economy was struggling. According to the \nBrookings Institute, the clean energy economy grew twice as fast as the \nbroader economy during the recession.\n  To maintain the growth of wind energy jobs, Congress should renew the \nproduction tax credit as part of the payroll tax cut. If we wait until \nthe end of the year, or delay until 2013, many projects will be delayed \nand thousands of jobs will be lost. The production tax credit has, by \nany measure, been extraordinarily successful. It was first used in 1992 \nand has led to the installation of wind energy capacity in America \nequivalent to 75 average coal-fired power plants, and it is rapidly \ngrowing.\n  We added the equivalent of 10 large power plants worth of wind power \nin 2011, and are on track to do even more in 2012. In New Mexico, we \nhave enough wind power either already built, or currently under \nconstruction to power 200,000 homes. New Mexico has tremendous wind \ncapacity, with 20 times more capacity in the planning stages. Those \nplans depend in large part on Congress continuing to support the \nAmerican wind industry. The tax credit has been extended seven times by \nPresidents and Congresses of both parties.\n  Wind is becoming cost-competitive with fossil fuels. A 4-year tax \ncredit extension would allow the industry to thrive long term. With 60 \npercent of wind turbines made in America, the beneficiaries of the wind \nproduction tax credit are legion, including: U.S. iron and steel \nproducers, over 400 U.S. manufacturing facilities in 43 States, 85,000 \nemployees in well-paid engineering and technical jobs, thousands of \nfarmers and ranchers who lease their land, rural school districts that \nreceive tax payments, and rural local governments.\n  The future is wide open. The Department of Energy estimates the U.S. \ncould receive 20 percent of its power from wind by 2030. Wind is not \njust in the west and midwest. The east coast can be powered by huge \noffshore wind resources in the Atlantic Ocean.\n  If the wind production tax credit is the engine for the clean energy \neconomy, the Treasury grant program is the turbo boost. Enacted as Sec. \n1603 of the Recovery Act, this program allows renewable energy tax \ncredit earners to receive the value of the tax credit as a grant.\n  This eliminates the need for complex financing arrangements and \nfinding other parties who are able to use the tax credits. Typically \nfinancial institutions will receive 10 or 15 percent of the value of \nrenewable tax credits in return for financing a project.\n  The Treasury grant program removes the middle man, and has led to the \nrapid expansion of renewable energy in the last 2 to 3 years, \nespecially with solar energy. Until it expired in December, the program \nawarded over 4,000 grants worth $1.75 billion for 22,000 solar projects \nin 47 States.\n  This innovative financing then supported over $4 billion in private \nsector investment. One report found that an extension of the program \nwould create an additional 37,000 jobs in 2012 in the solar industry \nalone. China, the EU, India, Japan, and other nations are acting \naggressively to take leadership of the clean energy economy. They want \nthe job growth and the energy security that results.\n  I am confident that our workers and entrepreneurs can compete with \nanyone.\n  But if we do counterproductive things, and pull the rug out from \nunderneath our fastest growing clean energy industries, our economy and \nour energy security will fall behind. The payroll tax extension is a \nlogical vehicle for extending other expiring tax provisions that \nbenefit the economy.\n  On the other hand, the payroll tax extension is a terrible place to \nmake unrelated policy that subverts Congressional process on behalf of \nspecial interests. The Environmental Protection Agency is, by and \nlarge, following the Nation's long-standing environmental laws and \ncourt orders when it updates standards to reduce pollution.\n  If Members are opposed to the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, \nthen they can propose bills to change those laws. Pollution does not \ncreate jobs. In fact, reducing pollution saves money for business and \nreduces health care costs for citizens. I am personally opposed to \nwholesale rollbacks of long-standing, bipartisan environmental laws.\n  But I am even more strongly and passionately opposed to backdoor \nattempts to undermine those laws on unrelated legislation.\n  Congress has voted down several resolutions of disapproval for EPA \nupdated standards.\n  While I have opposed those efforts in the past, at least that is a \nlegitimate process under the Congressional Review Act.\n  Holding much needed tax relief hostage for anti-environmental policy \nriders will not stand up to public scrutiny.\n  We must remain vigilant and keep upcoming legislation focused on tax \nrelief that will benefit working families and invest in clean energy \njobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  The material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n               Facts About an Average American Wind Farm\n\n       An average wind farm in America built today has about 50 \n     large wind turbines.\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\n       Each turbine can produce electricity to power roughly 500 \n     homes, even accounting for variability of wind.\n       So the average wind farm can power around 25,000 homes.\n       That average wind farm then produces many other benefits: \n     $20 million in construction payroll in the year of \n     construction, $875,000 per year to rural local school \n     districts, $280,000 per year to rural county governments, \n     $150,000 per year in ongoing direct payroll for employees, \n     $1.5 million per year in contract labor payroll, $300,000 to \n     $600,000 per year in royalties to landowners, farmers, and \n     ranchers.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as to the history of the wind \nproduction tax credit, the production tax credit began in the \nbipartisan Energy Policy Act of 1992, signed by President George H.W. \nBush.\n  It was extended in Dec. 1999, by a Republican Congress and signed \ninto law by President Clinton.\n  It was extended again in 2002 and 2004, this time signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  In 2005, it was extended again as part of bipartisan energy \nlegislation, the 2005 Energy Policy Act.\n  I voted for that legislation when I served in the House.\n  In December 2006, it was extended again.\n  Most recently, it was extended in the 2009 Recovery Act, which was \nsigned by President Obama.\n  Congress should continue this bipartisan tradition, and extend the \nwind production tax credit very soon.\n  We should avoid the mistakes of the past, where last minute \nextensions led to uncertainty and job losses.\n  I would like to thank the Senator for asking us to come to the floor, \nfor leading this debate. This is a debate we need to carry on until we \nget the production tax credits and other tax extenders in place and \nmove our clean energy industry forward.\n  I thank the Senator for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for the good work he is doing. What \nI would like to do is just pick up on a point Senator Whitehouse just \nraised; that is, the record of history shows us that we cannot take the \nclimate for granted. Our relatively limited experience of advancement \nover the last 10,000 years, during the time of stable climate on a \nplanet that is billions of years old, has distorted our view of the \nEarth's complex climate system.\n  A recent National Academy of Sciences report stated:\n\n       . . . it seems clear that the Earth's future will be unlike \n     the climate that ecosystems and human societies have been \n     accustomed to during the last 10,000 years. . . .\n\n  That is the point Senator Whitehouse just made, and that is according \nto the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The reason is that human activities--primarily the burning of fossil \nfuels--are increasing greenhouse gas emissions and causing global \nwarming. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, ``global \nwarming is unequivocal and primarily human induced.''\n  We have altered the climate that has sustained humanity for the last \n10,000 years. We are now at 392 parts per million of carbon dioxide, up \nfrom 280 parts per million in the 18th century. What an extraordinary \nincrease in carbon dioxide in that short period of time. And greenhouse \ngas levels are rising steadily. In fact, carbon dioxide levels are \nincreasing faster than at any time on record, according to our EPA.\n  Maybe that 392 parts per million seems like an abstract number, so \nlet me put it into context. According to UCLA researchers, the last \ntime carbon dioxide levels were consistently this high--the last time--\nwas 15 million years ago--15 million years ago. The Earth, at that \ntime, was warmer by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit than it is today. At \nthat level of warmth, there is no permanent sea ice in the Arctic and \nlittle, if any, ice on Antarctica and Greenland.\n  That explains, in part, why sea levels at that time were 75 to 120 \nfeet higher than today. If sea levels today even approached half that \nlevel, we would inundate--inundate--major coastal cities around the \nworld and create hundreds of millions of displaced refugees. And that \nis what we are talking about.\n  So let me repeat: The last time carbon dioxide levels were \nconsistently this high was 15 million years ago, at which time the \nEarth was warmer by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit than it is today.\n  There is no doubt, if we do nothing to reverse global warming, we are \ndoing more than just threatening harm to the environment. We are \njeopardizing the future of our planet and much of humanity. All too \noften we talk about global warming as if the impact will be somewhere \ndown the line--maybe in 100 years, maybe in 200 years, and isn't it too \nbad those polar bears are trying to get by on that little block of ice. \nThe reality is that global warming is impacting our planet today, and \nthe impact is devastating.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is here. He has been \nvery active on this issue, and I know he has some important points to \nbe made, so I yield the floor for Senator Franken of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Senator from Vermont and also the Presiding \nOfficer and the Senator from Rhode Island for engaging in this colloquy \nthat is so important.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport an extension of the renewable energy production tax credit. \nThis tax credit, slated to expire at the end of this year, has created \nthousands of jobs for the wind industry, has reduced our dependence on \nforeign oil, and is hugely important to Minnesota and to the Nation. \nBut because it takes a lot of time to order and manufacture new wind \nturbines, investors need to know the credit will exist in 2013 or else \nthey will not invest. That is why the credit must be extended now, \nalong with the payroll tax extension and unemployment benefits.\n  If Congress lets the renewable energy production tax credit expire, \nwe will let down the 80,000 people working on wind farms and \nmanufacturing facilities across the Nation, and we may cost this \ncountry $10 billion in lost investment. Already, because of uncertainty \nabout the fate of the production tax credit, investment in the wind \nindustry is drying up. America cannot afford to wait any longer. \nCongress must act now to extend this important measure for American \nbusiness and manufacturing and, indeed, for the future of our planet.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I received a letter from Terry and Janet \nCarlson, who run a family farm in Parkers Prairie, MN, and are \ndeveloping a wind project in their community. They write:\n\n       Our family believes in renewable energy and the benefits it \n     can provide to our local community. Besides being \n     environmentally friendly, wind energy has proved to be a \n     great economic benefit to the State of Minnesota and small \n     communities such as ours. But the 2012 expiration of the \n     production tax credit has created a high level of uncertainty \n     in the wind industry. . . . We have a significant amount of \n     time and money invested in this project and the production \n     tax credit expiration has a significant impact on our project \n     moving forward. It also has a significant impact on the \n     thousands of renewable energy related jobs in America and the \n     economic boon it would provide to our community.\n\n  Terry and Janet have good reasons to be concerned. A Navigant \nConsulting study found that if the tax production credit is not \nextended, construction of wind turbines will drop by 75 percent in \n2013. That means a lot fewer manufacturing jobs and construction jobs. \nAnd, in fact, if Congress fails to extend the production tax credit, \nthe wind industry will lose half of its jobs, dropping from 80,000 in \n2012 to 41,000 in 2013. That means 39,000 well-paying construction and \nmanufacturing jobs will evaporate if Congress fails to extend this tax \ncredit.\n  What a shame that would be. We have had this discussion. We have had \na colloquy before on global warming. As the Senator from Vermont said \nin his opening remarks, the world community knows this exists. The \nworld scientific community knows where this is going. And so China is \ndoing wind, Germany is doing wind, and Denmark is doing wind. This is \nthe future of our energy. If we stop producing wind energy, we are \ngoing to cede this to the rest of the world. If we don't act now, and \nrenew the production tax credit, we are going to lose 40,000 jobs right \nnow, but we are also going to lose the future.\n  On the other hand, this tax policy has major potential for the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\neconomy now and in the future. With a 4-year extension, the production \ntax credit will continue to support growth in the wind industry, \nboosting construction of wind farms by 25 percent, and instead of \nlosing 39,000 jobs, an extension of the wind production credit will \ncreate 15,000 additional well-paying construction and manufacturing \njobs.\n  With the help of the renewable energy production tax credit, the wind \nindustry has been a bright spot in these tough economic times. There \nare over 400 facilities across 43 States manufacturing for the wind \nenergy industry. Sixteen of these facilities are in Minnesota and \nsupport about 3,000 jobs. Currently, a majority of wind industry parts \nare produced here in America.\n\n  I think that is so important. We talk about the future of our \neconomy. We talk about all the time here, or at least should be talking \nabout all the time here, the future of our economy. Think about that. \nOver half of wind energy parts are now produced here in America, \nwhereas in 2005, a quarter of components were made in this country. \nThat is what we have to continue to do. That is the story we want to \nhear.\n  Instead of exporting manufacturing jobs to other countries, the wind \nindustry has been bringing well-paying, high-tech jobs back to America, \nwhere the technology was first invented, and that is thanks to the \nrenewable energy tax credit. If we don't extend this tax credit, we \nwill fail these facilities and the people whose jobs are at stake. As \nuncertainty about the tax credit deepens, we have already seen that \norders to wind manufacturing facilities are slowing down and companies \nare making layoffs.\n  This is our fault, here in Congress, and it is unacceptable. The \nlonger we wait, the worse the layoffs and shutdowns will become. In \nfact, if we don't extend the tax credit this month, it will be too late \nfor the wind industry to build any turbines in 2013. Wind turbines are \nbig, and wind farms need to plan and order parts a year in advance. If \nthe wind farms can't depend on the tax credit of 2013, they can't make \nplans to build for the next year, which means they can't make orders to \n400 manufacturing facilities across the country for parts.\n  Because of the uncertainty of the tax credit in 2013, production now \nin 2012 has already come to a halt. That is why we need to extend this \ntax credit now, immediately, in the payroll tax package.\n  For the past several months, we have been celebrating reports that \nthe unemployment rate is improving. This is fantastic news. But we \ncan't rest on our laurels yet. We must be sure to enact smart policies \nthat promote businesses and job growth in the parts of the economy that \nneed it most and which are the future. The renewable energy tax credit \ndoes just that. It will promote growth in manufacturing and \nconstruction--industries that deserve our help the most.\n  America has tremendous wind resources, most of which are still \nuntapped. Take Minnesota, for example. We are ranked fifth in the \ncountry for the most installed wind capacity. Yet our wind resources \ncould still provide 25 times more energy. This is a huge opportunity \nfor this country--an opportunity that we can't afford to dismiss.\n  Wind blows all over this Nation. It blows in red States and in blue \nStates alike. It is an abundant, cheap, clean energy resource that is \nproving to be a boon to our economy. We cannot stop developing it now. \nI urge my colleagues to extend the renewable energy production tax \ncredit immediately, at the same time we extend the payroll tax cut and \nunemployment benefits.\n  I want to thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership, and I want \nto thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Rhode Island, \nand so many others, who are leading this fight. This is smart on an \neconomic basis, but we are facing a crisis that scientists around the \nworld agree on.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont. I have said what I wanted to say \nabout the wind production tax credit and the other renewable energy tax \ncredits. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The point that he makes is indisputable; that is, if we are serious \nabout creating decent-paying, meaningful jobs in this country, why in \nGod's name are we not extending 1603 for solar and wind and the \nrenewable energy tax credit? This will enable us to create good-paying \njobs, make sure sustainable energy is an important part of our economy, \nand allow this country to play a leadership role in reversing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and combating global warming.\n  I think there are some people who say: Well, maybe global warming \nmight be real, but we don't have to worry about it today. Its impact \nwill not be seen for decades or centuries to come. I would suggest that \nis not quite correct. We are seeing the impact of global warming \nclimate change right now. Let me give an example.\n  According to studies, in my own State of Vermont in northern New \nEngland, if we fail to reverse global warming we will see continued \ntemperature increases. Vermont's climate, by 2080, is projected to be \nsimilar to Georgia's climate today. Mr. President, 2080, in the great \nscheme of things, is not all that far away. To think that Vermont, \nnorthern New England, will have a climate similar to Georgia's today is \nrather extraordinary if that takes place by the year 2080. Clearly, if \nthat trend takes place, it would be devastating in many respects for \nVermont, including our winter tourism and our sugar maple producers, \namong other aspects of our economy.\n  Lake Champlain, our beautiful lake which borders New York State and \nVermont, which used to freeze for 9 out of every 10 years in the early \n20th century, froze over just three times in the 1990s and has not \nfully frozen over since 2007. So in my small State, the State of \nVermont, northern New England, we are seeing the impact of climate \nchange today. The idea that by the year 2080 Vermont's climate will be \nsimilar to the State of Georgia's climate today is just unthinkable and \nextraordinary and tells us the impact that global warming is having.\n  According to NASA, 2010 tied 2005 for the warmest year since records \nbegan in 1880. Nine of the ten warmest years on record have occurred \nsince the year 2000. The last decade was the warmest on record.\n  We have seen temperature records being recorded all over the planet \nin the year 2010. During that year, Pakistan set a record for recording \nthe highest temperature ever in Asia, hitting 129 degrees Fahrenheit. \nIraq set its own record for high temperatures at over 125 degrees. \nSudan reached a record 121 degrees. Los Angeles, right here in our \ncountry, had a record 113-degree day. Houston, TX, set a record for its \nhighest monthly average temperature.\n  In the United States, according to a New York Times article, two \nrecord-high temperatures are now set for every one record low. The \nNational Climatic Data Center shows that 26,500 record-high \ntemperatures were recorded in weather stations across the United States \nin the summer of 2011. Texas set the record for the warmest summer of \nany State since instrument records began. Oklahoma set a record for its \nwarmest summer, exceeding the record set during the Dust Bowl era in \nthe 1930s.\n  But we are not just looking at hot temperatures and hot days. What \nare the impacts of those kinds of weather changes? What does it mean to \npeople's lives? Scientists used to say they could not tie a particular \nevent to climate change. That is no longer true. Our understanding of \nclimate and extreme weather has advanced.\n  NASA's James Hansen and his colleagues can say that some of the \nextreme heat waves we have seen, such as those in Russia and Texas and \nOklahoma, over the past several years were caused by global warming \nbecause their likelihood would be negligible if not for global warming.\n  Let me give some other examples of what global warming is doing in \nterms of heat waves and its horrendous impact on the lives of people.\n  Some of us remember Europe in 2003. During that period in Europe, \n2003, a heat wave caused temperatures to reach or exceed 100 degrees \nFahrenheit in the United Kingdom and France and led to high \ntemperatures throughout Europe for weeks which killed 70,000 people, \naccording to the World Health Organization. Many older people, people \nwith respiratory problems, people\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nwho were fragile in health died during that period. In the heat wave in \nEurope in 2003, 70,000 people died.\n  In Russia in 2010, a week-long heat wave sent temperatures soaring \nabove 100 degrees Fahrenheit in areas where the average temperature \nthat time of year is 67 degrees. Mr. President, 56,000 people died \nduring that period as a result of that heat wave, and wildfires created \na smoke plume nearly 2,000 miles wide, which was visible from space.\n  So this is not some kind of abstract issue: Oh, my goodness; isn't it \ntoo bad it is really hot today. What we are talking about are prolonged \nheat waves that kill substantial numbers of people.\n  In India in 2010, they recorded temperatures of over 100 degrees that \nkilled hundreds of people; Chile in 2011, a heat wave, drought, and \nwildfire destroyed 57,000 acres of forest and land and forced 500 \npeople to evacuate; Australia in 2012, the start of 2012 was the \nhottest start of any year for Australia in the century, according to \nABC News, with temperatures exceeding 104 degrees and electricity cut \noff in some areas to prevent the igniting of fires.\n\n  Prolonged and more severe drought is likely to increase as global \nwarming continues, according to the National Center for Atmospheric \nResearch in Colorado. This means increased risk of crop failure, \nwildfires, and water scarcity. A recent study published in Scientific \nAmerican found that climate change has cut production of cereal crops--\nwheat, rice, corn, soybeans--causing these crops to be nearly 19 \npercent more expensive than if global warming was not occurring.\n  I could go on and on about this issue. But the main point I want to \nmake is the following, and let me summarize it here. According to \nvirtually the entire scientific community in the United States of \nAmerica and around the world, according to virtually every agency of \nthe United States Government, global warming is real, and it is \nsignificantly caused by human activity. People are mistaken if they \nbelieve the impact of global warming will just be in decades to come. \nWe are seeing very negative impacts today. The scientific community \ntells us if we do not begin to reverse greenhouse gas emissions, those \nproblems in America and around the world will only get worse.\n  If there is a silver lining in all of that, it is that right now we \nknow how to cut greenhouse gas emissions. We know how to move to energy \nefficiency, mass transportation, and automobiles that get 50, 60, 100 \nmiles per gallon. We know how to weatherize our homes so we can cut \nsignificantly the use of fuel. What we also know is that in the middle \nof this recession, if we move in that direction--energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy--we can create over a period of years millions of \ngood-paying jobs.\n  Let me conclude by saying: we now have the opportunity to be in a \nwin-win-win situation. We can save consumers money, we can \nsignificantly reduce greenhouse gases and protect our planet, and we \ncan create substantial numbers of jobs that we desperately need in the \nmidst of this terrible recession.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S679-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S679-S682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SYNTHETIC DRUG USE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the fall of 2010 I came to this \nChamber to speak about my growing concern of synthetic drug use in this \ncountry.\n  Specifically, I raised concerns about a popular new drug known as K2, \nor Spice, and I learned about this myself for the first time because a \nconstituent of mine by the name of David Rozga committed suicide. David \nkilled himself shortly after smoking a package of the drug he and some \nfriends bought at a local shopping mall.\n  At the time, David's death in June 2010 was one of the first \nassociated with what was a new and very dangerous drug craze. Nearly 2 \nyears after David's death, the use of synthetic drugs like K2 has \nexploded and is becoming a major problem across the country.\n  In 2009 the American Association of Poison Centers reported only 13 \ncalls concerning synthetic drug use. One year later, in 2010, over \n1,300 calls were made to poison centers about synthetic drugs. So I \nhave gone from 2009 to 2010, and now 2011. We have gone from 13 to \n1,300 to last year, 12,000 calls to poison centers regarding synthetic \ndrugs.\n  The Monitoring the Future Survey, a survey of high school youth, \nasked students for the first time last year if they ever tried \nsynthetic drugs. Roughly one in nine high school seniors responded they \nused synthetic drugs last year.\n  These numbers are quite obviously an astonishing increase in just 2 \nyears and they illustrate, of course, how rapidly the use of these \ndrugs has come on the scene. These drugs are having a terrible effect \non those who use them. Emergency room doctors across the country are \nreporting increasing uses of synthetic drugs in the number of users \ncoming to the hospital.\n  My staff heard from one such doctor from upstate New York about what \nshe has seen. Dr. Sandra Schneider, from Rochester, NY, reported that \nusers in her ER experienced psychotic episodes, rapid heart rate, very \nhigh blood pressure, and seizures. In some cases, users--many of whom \nwere in their teens and twenties--suffered heart attacks and strokes \nand died as a result. Other cases involved users who tried to kill \nthemselves, harm others, or got into a car accident while high on these \nsynthetic drugs.\n  How do we get from practically no use to where we are now? The people \nwho manufacture and sell these drugs have circumvented the laws to \neasily sell synthetic drugs online, at gas stations, in novelty stores \nat the local shopping malls, and in tobacco stores and other shops. \nMany of the drugs are manufactured overseas, in countries such as \nChina, and then imported into the United States. They spray chemical \ncompounds, that have not been tested on humans and were not intended \nfor human consumption, on dried leaves. They package and market these \ndrugs to appear as legitimate products such as incense, bath salts, \nplant food, and snow remover. They slap a label on these packages \nstating that the product is not for human consumption to get around FDA \nregulations.\n  Over 30 States have passed laws to ban various synthetic drug \ncompounds. The Drug Enforcement Administration has also acted to stop \nthese drugs. Although the DEA has used its emergency scheduling powers \nto control seven chemical compounds, there are too many on the market \nnow for DEA to go through the long and laborious process to schedule \neach and every one. The makers of these drugs know this as well and \nhave altered their chemical formulas--some as little as a molecule--to \nget around existing State and Federal laws.\n  This is exactly the case in my home State of Iowa. Iowa passed a law \nlast year that banned many chemical compounds. However, the law only \nlisted a specific set of chemical compounds and the drugmakers are now \naltering their formulas.\n  Recently, two Iowa youths have become victims of the new drugs. One \nis a Polk County teenager who got into a high-speed crash smoking a \nproduct called 100 Percent Pure Evil.\n  This teen had two other passengers in her car. After smoking this \nproduct the driver became agitated and stated she wanted to kill \nherself. She started driving her car into several trees. When \nparamedics arrived at the scene they reported that everyone was badly \nhurt and the driver was vomiting blood. Thankfully all passengers \nsurvived the crash.\n  Another teen in central Iowa experienced a near-death experience \nafter smoking the same product. This teen purchased the product--\nremember the name, 100 Percent Pure Evil--purchased it at a local store \nand started convulsing and vomiting shortly after smoking the drug. \nOnce a paramedic got this boy into the hospital he fell into a coma. \nHe, however, awoke from the coma the next day but had failed to \nrecognize his mother or grandmother at the hospital. Thankfully this \nboy has since recovered his memory. Now he suffers occasional anxiety \nattacks.\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n  When the boy's mother told the police about the product and where he \ngot it, she reported that the police told her there was nothing they \ncould do about it because it was not known what was in the product and \nit may be legal. This product is still being reviewed to see if any \ncompounds fall under Iowa's law.\n  Nearly a year ago I introduced this legislation we named after the \nperson who died 2 years ago, David Rozga. I introduced this bill with \nSenator Feinstein. It bans the chemicals that comprise K2/Spice. We \ndesigned the legislation to capture a wide variety of compounds so it \nwould not be so easy to circumvent this law by altering the molecule. \nIn fact, the Iowa Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy is crafting \nnew legislation based on the legislation I introduced last year that \ncaptures more substances. My legislation was unanimously passed out of \nthe Judiciary Committee 8 months ago. It is currently being prevented \nfrom consideration by the full Senate by one Senator. The House of \nRepresentatives passed its version of the Synthetic Drug Control Act \noverwhelmingly last December, with over 70 percent of the \nRepresentatives supporting scheduling these drugs.\n  Many of the opponents of this legislation stated on the House floor \nthat by scheduling these compounds we are preventing scientific \nresearch. This is far from true. Any scheduled substance, even current \nSchedule I drugs such as cocaine and heroin, can be researched. Any \nscientist can apply to be registered by the DEA to research any drug. \nJust because we are removing the drugs from the store shelves does not \nmean we cannot study them.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is now time for the Senate to take action. \nWe cannot let the will of one Senator obstruct the will of many. I \nbelieve if our legislation received a vote and a fair debate in this \nbody, it would pass overwhelmingly. So I urge my colleagues to support \nour efforts to get these drugs off the store shelves and off the \nstreets, and I urge the Senate leadership to allow a debate and a vote \non the issue. The American people, people such as the Rozga family and \nothers who have been victims of these drugs, want to see this poison \nremoved from their communities.\n  I appreciate working together with the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from New York on this bill and similar bills as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley of Iowa. I thank him for his remarks. I \nthink you can tell this is a very important issue but also one that is \nbipartisan. As he pointed out with the vote on the House side, this was \na bipartisan issue over there. It was bipartisan on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We simply need to allow for a debate and a vote in a timely \nmanner on these bills.\n  I also know Senator Chuck Schumer from New York will be joining us, \nanother senior member of the committee. We are all three on the \nJudiciary Committee, with Senator Grassley being the ranking Republican \non the committee. So we have much support for this bill.\n  Today I want to take a few minutes to add to the comments of Senator \nGrassley about the growing threat to people of all ages, but \nparticularly to our young people, of the dangerous synthetic drugs that \nare becoming, sadly, more and more common in our communities.\n  There have been reports from States around the country of people \nacting violently while under the influence of these drugs, leading to \ndeaths or injuries to themselves or to others. While taking these \ndrugs, people can experience elevated heart rates and blood pressure, \nhallucinations, seizures, and extreme agitation. They are very \ndangerous.\n\n  These synthetic drugs have exploded as an issue in recent years. \nUntil 2006 I was the county attorney for Hennepin County, which is \nMinnesota's largest county. It actually is about a fourth of our State \nin terms of the population. During that time two words I never heard \nwere ``synthetic drugs.'' We were focused on crack, we were focused on \nmethamphetamine, we were focused on laws to contain that, but synthetic \ndrugs were not something we talked about. It is an example of how \nquickly this drug has come on the scene. Poison control centers and \nemergency rooms from across the United States are reporting dramatic \nincreases in the number of calls and visits relating to synthetic \ndrugs. In 2011, poison control centers across America received more \nthan 13,000 calls about synthetic drugs. Think about that. Do you know \nwhat the number was in 2010, a year before? It was 3,200; it was 3,200 \nin 2010, 13,000 in 2011. In Minnesota there was a total of 392 calls to \npoison control relating to synthetic drugs in 2011, compared to 111 in \n2010, so you are seeing a four-times increase in our State and across \nthe country in terms of the rise of this drug.\n  A recent report by the National Institutes of Health shows that one \nin nine high school seniors admitted to using synthetic marijuana \nduring this past year, so it is clearly a rapidly growing problem.\n  This all hit home in my State with the tragic death of 19-year-old \nTrevor Robinson in Blaine, MN, who overdosed on a synthetic \nhallucinogen known as 2C-E. Last year another young man shot himself in \nour State under the influence of synthetic drugs. I can only imagine \nthe pain and anguish their friends and families must feel. It is \nanguishing. This is a life-and-death issue. It is not something where \nwe can put our head in the sand and pretend it is not happening. This \nis a new type of drug, it is a dangerous drug.\n  We have begun to take action. We have to take action on both the \nState and Federal level and we are making progress on a few fronts. I \nintroduced a bill which would add 2C-E, the drug that killed the young \nman in my State, and similar drugs to a list of banned substances so \nthey will be treated in the same manner as other banned drugs that they \nmimic, such as heroin.\n  I am also cosponsor of the bill Senator Grassley referenced and also \nSenator Schumer has another bill to ban other types of synthetic drugs. \nBasically one bans the bath salts, one is focused on synthetic \nmarijuana, and my bill is on the synthetic hallucinogens. All three of \nthese bills passed the Judiciary Committee in July and one has already \npassed the House with a very strong vote.\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Grassley also mentioned, a hold has been \nplaced on all three of the Senate bills by one Senator. That is \nextremely unfortunate. These drugs can kill, and if we do not take \naction they are going to become more and more prevalent and put more \nand more people at risk. We cannot wait around and let these important \nbills languish in procedural gridlock, especially because of one \nSenator.\n  We are going to keep fighting here in the Senate until those laws get \npassed. We have seen in Minnesota, with the tragic story of Trevor \nRobinson, what these drugs can do and I for one do not want to see it \nhappen again, not in my State, not anywhere in the country. I \nunderstand the Senator who is holding these bills has genuine and \nphilosophical opposition and he deserves to be heard on his objections. \nMy suggestion is that we come to an agreement so we can have a period \nof debate on these bills, a simple period of debate. This should not be \na week-long debate. We can take the floor and speak to this issue and \nhe can speak as long as he likes. We are not asking him to change his \nposition. We want him to be heard but we simply want to have a period \nof debate and then a vote. That is what the Senate should be about.\n  Luckily, the Drug Enforcement Administration is taking its own action \nand has temporarily banned some synthetic drugs, but most of the \nsubstances in these bills have not been banned, including all of the \nsubstances in my bill. On the State level, roughly 40 States have \nbanned some synthetic drugs, including Minnesota, where a major law \nregarding synthetic drugs took effect in July. But that means that some \nStates have not banned any of these drugs yet and some have banned only \ncertain types, so people can go to other States to buy them legally or \nbuy them on the Internet. That is one of the reasons we need this \nFederal law.\n  Also, local law enforcement needs a strong ally in the Federal \nauthorities as they try to turn the tide against synthetic drugs. \nSadly, many of these instances I have seen in our State with\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nsynthetic drugs involve more rural communities--towns that may not have \nthe ability to call in a bunch of lab technicians and experts to be \nable to testify about what type of synthetic drug it is. That is why, \nfor the sake of that law community, it is important we get it on that \nFederal list and we also make it very clear it is banned. Passing a \nFederal law will help create a partnership and will send a strong \nmessage that we need to eradicate these substances.\n\n  I do think we have made progress by raising awareness of this issue, \nwhich will lead to better education efforts, more vigilance by parents, \nand more attention by law enforcement. Now that the DEA has become more \nfamiliar with these substances, it will be better equipped to combat \nthe problem. But the fact remains that the most important thing we can \ndo on the Federal level is to pass these three bills that have already \nbeen approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. These bills won't \nsolve the problem overnight, but they are the first step we need to \ntake, and we need to do it now. Before we lose more kids, before these \ndrugs spread any further, let's pass these bills. As I mentioned, it is \nestimated that one in nine high school seniors has tried synthetic \nmarijuana. I don't want to wake up a year from now and read that it has \nincreased to one in seven or one in five. Let's have a debate. Let's \nhear what the objections are, and then let's pass these bills. I really \nthink we can save lives. While there is still time to catch up, we \nshould be doing everything we can to address these problems.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican \nSenator from Iowa on the Judiciary Committee, who has already spoken, \nand Senator Chuck Schumer from New York, who is a senior member of the \nJudiciary Committee. We are doing this as a team. We think it is very \nimportant that you, Mr. President, and the rest of the Senate have the \nopportunity to vote on these bills and have the opportunity to debate \nthem. We hope we can achieve this goal procedurally so we can move \nforward in the way we are supposed to.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues, \nSenator Klobuchar and Senator Grassley, to discuss an epidemic \novertaking our country: synthetic drugs. I wish to compliment both of \nmy colleagues. Each of us has been working on this issue in different \nways, and we combined our three approaches into one piece of \nlegislation that will go a long way toward helping to keep our kids \naway from drugs they should not have.\n  Synthetic drugs are an epidemic overtaking our country. They are also \nknown as bath salts or, in the case of manmade marijuana, spice or \nincense. They are given innocent names, but they are deadly. Synthetic \ndrugs are not sold on street corners by slingers who keep stashes \nhidden in alleys. Instead, these drugs can be found in local corner \nstores across the country. They are as easy to buy as a lollipop or a \ncarton of milk, but they are much more dangerous.\n  No wonder emergency rooms and poison control centers have seen an \nenormous rise in patients who have taken these drugs and must seek \nhelp. The numbers are nothing short of eye-popping. Poison control \ncenters reported 13 calls concerning these products in 2009, over 1,000 \ncalls in 2010, and over 6,500 in 2011--from 13 calls to over 6,500 \ncalls in 2 years. For every call they get, there are many people taking \nthese drugs with no call at all. One survey, in fact, indicates that \none in nine high school seniors used synthetic drugs in the past year. \nThat is a frightening, astounding, and devastating number.\n  The Senate has before it a rare opportunity to do something simple \nand right that will actually go a very long way to fixing this crisis. \nWe have three bills--Senator Klobuchar's, my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Grassley's, my colleague from Iowa, and mine--that would place \nthe chemical components that make up these substances directly on \nschedule I of the Controlled Substances Act without waiting for the DEA \nto go through its yearlong listing process. Our communities desperately \nneed us to make these drug compounds illegal once and for all. The DEA \nwants us to go ahead and make them illegal, and so does the FDA. There \nis no legitimate or commercial use for these compounds.\n  Our bills passed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously and with \nno opposition. The House passed its version of our bills with little \nopposition. All we have to do now is put them on the floor and have a \nvote or simply pass them unanimously. But one of my colleagues has put \na hold on these bills--just one. That is fine. I am in favor of \nprotecting my colleague's rights, as they are my rights and Senator \nKlobuchar's and Senator Grassley's rights. But one Senator should not \nbe able to prevent a vote on something that 99 percent of Americans \nwant that directly affects their health and safety and the health and \nsafety of their children. So I have a suggestion. Why can't we at least \nput these bills on the floor, and our colleague can air his opposition \nand see if he can win people over to his point of view? This really \nshould not take more than an hour or two of our business.\n  Law enforcement and health professionals are begging for this bill. I \nknow for a fact that parents and families in my State are begging for \nthis to become law. A lot of us have worked hard on this issue because \nit is of critical importance to our communities and States.\n  Before I go any further, I again want to compliment and commend my \ncolleagues, Senators Klobuchar and Grassley, as well as Senator \nFeinstein, who is not here with us this afternoon, for their excellent \nleadership on banning these so-called designer drugs.\n  On Monday I was in Rochester, NY, to discuss Senator Grassley's \nsynthetic marijuana bill with local law enforcement and emergency room \ndoctors. I heard horrific stories of patients who smoked synthetic \nmarijuana and ended up crazed in the emergency room. Everyone I met \nwith urged me to help ban these substances as soon as possible.\n  My own bill, the Combating Dangerous Synthetic Stimulants Act, bans \ntwo more of these drugs, mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone--\nfortunately, it is regularly known as MDPV--and they are commonly sold \nas bath salts. By calling them bath salts, manufacturers are trying to \ndeliberately mislead people into thinking they are an everyday product. \nIt is despicable when young kids--14, 15, 16 years old--try bath salts \nand they think it is harmless. These dangerous drugs are sold in \nconvenience stores and smoke shops for as little as $14 to $40. And \nwhat are their names? Tranquility, Zoom, White Lightning, and Hurricane \nCharlie. These so-called bath salts or plant foods are nothing more \nthan deadly narcotics, and they are being sold cheaply to all comers \nwith no questions asked at store counters around the country. How is it \npossible that such deadly drugs are legal? Because by marketing them as \nbath salts, which aren't for human consumption, they aren't regulated. \nThese bath salts have much the same effects, according to users, as \ncocaine or ecstasy, but they are preferred because they are cheaper and \nmore readily accessible. In fact, according to court papers obtained by \nthe Staten Island Advance, one of our fine local papers in New York, a \nseller in Brooklyn boasted to a Federal agent that the bath salts would \ndeliver a better high than cocaine.\n\n  This ease of access does not, however, translate into their safe use. \nA recent New York Times article reported that an individual high on \nbath salts had climbed a roadside flagpole and jumped into traffic, \nbroken into a monastery and stabbed a priest, and scratched herself to \npieces because something was under her skin.\n  One of these drugs, Cloud 9, is so easily accessible it is sold on \namazon.com. A person can go on amazon.com and buy this horrible stuff. \nHow much? Sixteen dollars, plus shipping. It is accessible to anybody. \nCan my colleagues guess what item most customers buy\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nwith this specific bath salt? Is it relaxing candles or lotion? Is it \nsoap? No. The item customers most buy with this bath salt is Click N \nSmoke all In One Vaporizer With Wind Proof Torch Lighter. That is the \nname of the product. One does not need much of an imagination to \nbelieve that the purchasers of Cloud 9 are smoking these drugs and not \nadding them to a relaxing bath.\n  These drugs are the worst kind. Not only do they cause people to \nperform horrible actions, but they also give the impression that they \nare legal, that they are innocuous. Make no mistake that these drugs \ncan and will cause harm to their users. At least 30 States, including \nmy home State of New York, have recognized these drugs as harmful. They \nhave banned bath salts at the State level. But only the DEA--the Drug \nEnforcement Agency--and the resources that are behind it can keep these \ndrugs from coming into our country, from crossing State lines, and from \nmorphing time and again to evade State bans. That is why we need these \nbills.\n  The DEA temporarily banned two of these substances in November. \nHowever, the clock is now ticking until this temporary ban ends. FDA \nand HHS must complete a complicated checklist in the remaining 7 months \nto prevent these drugs from returning to the corner store.\n  We must provide the DEA with a permanent ban before the time runs \nout. This will provide them with the necessary tools to address these \nlegal drugs on a national stage. The DEA has the ability to spearhead \nmulti-State and international investigations to prevent the manufacture \nand sale of bath salts.\n  These drugs are deadly and dangerous. Yet they are easier to buy than \ncigarettes in many States. Parents should not worry that each time \ntheir child goes into a convenience store or gas station, he or she can \nbuy a deadly drug.\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support. We cannot wait for another \nparent to lose a child because of the inaction of the Senate. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass the legislation. Once \nagain, I implore my colleague--the single Senator who is holding up \nthis bill--I hope he will not agree to set aside his differences, which \ncome from a deep Libertarian ideological perspective that is different \nthan most Americans have, but agree not to block them but to debate \nthem and let them come up for a vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S682-S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. As the Presiding Officer knows, this week the President \nsent his budget to Congress. This happens every year. The budget is a \ndocument that determines what the spending will be and what the \nrevenues will be not just for the next fiscal year but for a 10-year \nperiod. So it is a document about what the direction of our country \nought to be. It is a vision for the country, if you will.\n  It is being sent to the Congress at a time when we face extraordinary \nfiscal challenges. We have a record debt of over $15 trillion. We have \ndeficits that have been over $1 trillion a year for the last several \nyears, and it looks as though this year, once again, it will be well \nover $1 trillion.\n  In comparison to previous years, we have a debt that is now as large \nas our entire economy, which is larger than at any time since World War \nII. In fact, as a country, we are spending more money at the Federal \nlevel than we ever have before--as a percent of GDP, more than we ever \nhave since World War II. So these are times when we have a true fiscal \ncrisis at our doorstep and we need to handle it.\n  We are borrowing over 35 cents of every $1 we spend at the Federal \nlevel. In that context, I have to say I am very disappointed in the \nbudget proposal that was sent to us because it is simply not up to the \nchallenges we face. It taxes too much, it borrows too much, and it \nspends too much. Unfortunately, it adds another $11 trillion to the \nnational debt over this 10-year period--again, a debt that already tops \n100 percent of our country's economy. It does nothing to change the \nfact that Social Security and Medicare are in trouble--very important \nprograms, of course, but by not addressing them in this budget document \nit means what everybody knows, which is that unless we do something \nthat will head toward solvency, this will continue to be the case.\n  Remarkably, I thought, the President proposes another $350 billion in \na so-called stimulus bill within this budget and pays for it either in \nred ink, with more borrowing, or by raising taxes. It actually raises \ntaxes by nearly $2 trillion over this 10-year period. This is despite \nthe fact the Congressional Budget Office has told us that by raising \ntaxes, we are going to hurt the economy. In fact, it would result in \nhigher unemployment next year than this year.\n  We all know the long-term driver of these deficits is entitlement \nspending. These important programs, Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid, along with interest on the debt, are called the mandatory \nspending part of the budget. That is now a bigger and bigger part of \nthe budget and the fastest growing part of the budget. It is 64 percent \nof the budget this year.\n\n  Under what the President has proposed, for the next 10 years, that \nmandatory spending--which means it is not subject to annual \nappropriations by Congress; again, important programs but not on a \nsustainable path--this mandatory spending will grow from 64 percent of \nthe budget--where it is today, which has grown and grown over the \nyears--to 78 percent of the budget in 10 years, under the budget \nproposal the President has put forward.\n  Republicans, Democrats, Independents alike, we know this is not \nsustainable. It is not sustainable and, unfortunately, it is going to \nhurt these programs in a way that is going to make it very difficult \nfor our seniors and others who rely on them.\n  Overall, the President's promise of deficit reduction also does not \nlook like it works. The budget claims $5.3 trillion in deficit \nreduction over the next decade. However, if we look at it, that $5.3 \ntrillion does not come from spending cuts. Looking at a budget table, \ntable 3--and I ask folks at home to take a look at this--99.9 percent \nof that $5.3 trillion in so-called deficit reduction does not come from \nspending cuts, it comes from tax increases--almost $2 trillion--a \nsavings that is considered to be a gimmick of saying we are not going \nto spend as much in Iraq and Afghanistan. Everybody knows we are not \ngoing to spend as much there. Yet they take credit for that. Already \nenacted spending caps--remember, the discretionary spending caps were \nput in place, the so-called sequestration or across-the-board cuts, \nthey take credit for those which have already been enacted and then, \nfinally, the net interest savings from all those policies, which is \nabout $800 billion, they say.\n  So again, almost all that so-called deficit reduction over the next \ndecade comes not from spending cuts but, in fact, from either gimmicks, \ntax increases or things Congress has already done. That leaves very \nlittle--about $4 billion out of the $5.3 trillion--that is truly \nspending reductions.\n  By the way, on top of that, in the so-called baseline that the \nPresident bases his numbers off of--in other words, we have to \ndetermine what would the spending otherwise be--in that baseline, there \nis another $479 billion in new spending on Pell grants, the Medicare \ndoc fix, and so on.\n  So the spending savings completely vanish when we put all that \ntogether. That is not the kind of budget we need right now.\n  Last year, the President submitted a budget that I thought was a good \npolitical document, also, but did not address our budget problems, and \nwe took it to the floor of this Senate for a vote. In the Senate, last \nyear, the President's budget was voted on by Republicans and Democrats, \nand it lost by a vote of 97 to 0.\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\n  I do not know how this budget would do if it came to the floor, but I \nam not sure it would fare much better because, frankly, when we look at \nthis objectively, it is hard to say it addresses the very real problems \nwe face. These are problems that relate to our spending and relate to \nthe fact that we have these big deficits and debt, but also it relates \nto what is going on at kitchen tables all over America, which is people \nare having a harder time finding work, keeping jobs, making ends meet.\n  The economy is tough in my own State of Ohio. We not only have high \nunemployment, but we have record numbers of weeks where people have \nbeen on unemployment--approximately 40 weeks now. We have a lot of \npeople who have given up looking for work altogether. Unless we get \nthis budget deficit and debt under control and add more predictability \nand certainty to our economy and to what is going to happen with these \nhuge deficits and debt that seem to be taking us toward what is \nhappening in Greece, Italy or Spain--unless we do that, we are not \ngoing to be able to turn this economy around and give people the kind \nof confidence they are looking for to be able to make investments and \nmove our country forward.\n  There are some other folks who are with me in the Chamber today. I \nwould like to ask them if they would not mind talking about their \nbudget perspective, what they see in this budget, the concerns they \nmight have, and the ideas we have to try to improve our fiscal \nsituation, therefore, our economy.\n  I see the ranking member of the Budget Committee is here.\n  I say to Senator Sessions, I know he wants to speak briefly on this \nissue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Portman for his comments \nand for his leadership on the Budget Committee. We have three fabulous \nnew members on the Budget Committee in Senator Toomey, Senator Portman, \nand Senator Ron Johnson, who are with us and will share their \nperspectives as new members on the Budget Committee.\n  At a time of fiscal crisis, as Senator Portman has described, it is \nvery important the leadership of America speak honestly to the American \npeople about the challenges we face and how we plan to go about fixing \nthem. That is right. That is fair. That is just. It is wrong, it is \nunfair, and unjust to spin plans, to misrepresent the impact of \npolicies in a way that confuses the American people and our colleagues \nin Washington about what is going on.\n  So our colleagues who are here understand the numbers. They are going \nto make some very good points. I will just say, as a member of the \ncommittee and the ranking Republican, I am disappointed the budget does \nvirtually nothing to change the debt trajectory we are on from the \nagreement we had last year and, in the course of it it raises taxes \nconsiderably and raises spending considerably, although the Budget \nDirector was so reluctant yesterday to acknowledge it raises spending. \nBut it does raise spending in any fair and objective analysis of the \nsituation we are in today with the current trajectory in the Budget \nControl Act we agreed to last year.\n  So we are at a crisis, and we need to have leadership that looks the \nAmerican people in the eye and tells them of the crisis we are facing, \nthe difficult challenges, and lays out a plan on how we can fix it. We \ncan fix it. If we put ourselves on a sound path, we will have more \ngrowth and prosperity than a lot of people predict.\n  I thank Senator Portman for the opportunity to share these few \nmoments and for the contribution he and our other colleagues are making \nto this important national debate.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership on \nthe Budget Committee.\n  I see we have also been joined by one of our new Members, a freshman \nMember, who comes from the business side of things. He ran a \nmanufacturing company, so he has an interesting perspective on Federal \nbudgeting. I love to ask folks who are in business: Could you see doing \nbusiness where you were borrowing 35 cents of every $1 you spent? The \nanswer is: I wouldn't stay in business very long.\n  With that, I would like to hear from Senator Johnson of Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I thank Senator Portman. \nAgain, I so value his experience. Being the head of OMB himself, he \nunderstands these numbers.\n  What I have been trying to do over the last couple days is, I have \nbeen trying to figure out where is this $4 trillion worth of deficit \nreduction.\n  I have a chart on the debt in the Chamber. I have shown this chart in \nthe past. I like this--I do not like it, but I like this depiction of \nthe debt. It goes back to 1987, when our Federal debt was $2.3 \ntrillion. It took us 200 years to incur that much debt, and we just \nentered an agreement--I did not vote for it, but we entered an \nagreement to increase the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion, and we will \nblow through that in about 2 years.\n  But if we take a look at the debt President Obama in his latest \nbudget is projecting 10 years into the future, it is $25.9 trillion. In \nlast year's budget, it was about $26.3 trillion. Again, I am trying to \ndo the math. If we reduce the deficit by $4 trillion, one would think \nthat final debt figure would also be reduced, and it simply is not.\n  I realize the President is talking about a balanced approach. But you \nknow as well as I do we have a spending problem, and that is what the \nnext chart is trying to portray.\n  If we take a look at 10-year spending, in the 1990s, our Federal \nGovernment spent $16 trillion in total. In the last decade, we spent \n$28 trillion. In President Obama's budget for last year, he was \nprojecting spending over 10 years of $46 trillion. In his new budget--\njust 1 year further into the future--he is projecting $47 trillion over \n10 years.\n  Again, I do not see where there is $4 trillion worth of deficit \nreduction. I am an accountant. I am going to continue to look through \nthe budget. I am afraid I am not going to truly come up with it.\n  I think what is very disappointing about President Obama's budget is \nthat he simply is not grappling with what we all realize. I think \neverybody in Washington realizes what is driving our debts and deficit \nlong term is Social Security and Medicare spending.\n  Just a quick little chart in terms of where we are in terms of Social \nSecurity. In 2010, we went cash negative, which means the amount of the \npayroll is not covering the benefits--by $51 billion in 2010, $46 \nbillion last year. By the year 2035, we will accumulate $6 trillion in \ndeficit spending in Social Security alone, and the President's budget \nis silent on Social Security. The President's budget is silent on \nMedicare.\n  He has had 4 years. Why doesn't he propose something? The only thing \nhe is proposing is a tax on millionaires. He is asking Congress to hop \non board and let's pass corporate tax reform. Why doesn't he propose \nit? There is actually a growing consensus about progrowth tax reform.\n  I want to agree with this President on something to enact something. \nBut he needs to lead, and he is not leading on these issues.\n  I want to finish my little part by talking about those millionaires \non whom President Obama wants to raise taxes.\n  I have been doing an awful lot of telephone townhall meetings. Last \nweek, we had a very interesting call. After a couple of my constituents \nfrom Wisconsin asked me why I would not support a millionaires' tax, we \nhad a call from an elderly woman, and I could tell she was afraid. She \nwas scared. She said: Senator Johnson, I am so concerned about what is \ngoing to happen to our taxes. My husband and I have been building a \nbusiness all our lives. All our assets are wrapped up in that business, \nand now my husband has been sick for 2 years. He has not been able to \nwork in the business. I have been trying to make a go of it, and now we \nare going to have to sell the business. In maybe 1 year, when we sell \nthis business, I might report one million dollars' worth of income, and \nI am so concerned: Am I going to be paying that 15-percent tax on my \nretirement fund, which is my business, or am I going to be paying a 30-\npercent tax?\n  The fact is, that is whom this President wants to punish--people such \nas that woman in Wisconsin who has her entire retirement wrapped up in \nher business, and she is going to sell it. That is on whom President \nObama wants to double the tax.\n  Again, I think that puts a face on the type of people President Obama \nwants to punish. I think that is a tragedy. I\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nwould like to see the President lead on the debt and deficit issue far \nbetter than he has.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson for his \nperspective, and it is very helpful.\n  We are now going to hear from another colleague who also is a new \nMember of the Senate but has a lot of experience in what makes the \neconomy work and has been promoting progrowth tax reform and progrowth \nregulatory relief and other things to actually move the economy to \ngenerate more revenue in the right way, which is through growth, Pat \nToomey from Pennsylvania.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Portman for organizing \nthis colloquy and Senator Johnson for his contribution.\n  Let me start by making this point: It seems to me the two top \npriorities the budget--and most of what we do--ought to have are, No. \n1, policies that will help encourage strong economic growth, a recovery \nthat we need and the job creation that would come with it--that is No. \n1--and No. 2, putting our Federal Government on a sustainable path \nbecause we are not on a sustainable fiscal path now, and if we do not \nget on a sustainable path soon, we are inviting a crisis. We are \ninviting a disaster.\n  It is my view that the President's budget fails badly on both fronts. \nOn the economic front, there are a number of areas. First and foremost \nis a budget that proposes a growing budget deficit. The President who \npromised us in his first term he would cut the deficit in half, in \nfact, is proposing in fiscal year 2012--this year--a deficit that is \nbigger than last year and almost as big as the alltime record high--\nnowhere near cutting these deficits in half. Huge deficits themselves \nhave a chilling effect on economic growth because they discourage \ninvestment.\n  Everybody knows when we are racking up massive amounts of debt, \nunprecedented amounts of debt--as we are doing right now--there is a \nhuge threat that the result will be either dramatic inflation or much \nhigher taxes or both. Given that threat, businesses and entrepreneurs, \nunderstandably, are reluctant to take a risk, to make an investment, to \ngrow a business, to hire workers. So that is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2 that I would like to make is a little bit more technical \nand very specific; that is, the President's idea that we ought to tax \ndividend income, which is to say investment in business, at ordinary \nincome rates instead of at the current 15-percent rate. I just want to \nillustrate why I think that is a particularly bad idea and why it will \nhurt our economy and weaken our ability to create jobs.\n  This little chart demonstrates what this means is, what the President \nis proposing is effectively a 63-percent tax on investment in a \nbusiness. The reason I say that is as follows: If you can imagine, \nlet's say you have saved some money and you want to invest in a \nbusiness so that business can grow and hire workers. How will these \ntaxes be paid?\n  Right now, we have just about the highest corporate income tax rate \nin the world. So if you make an investment in a business and that \nbusiness makes a profit, the first thing that company has to do is pay \n$35 of every $100 it makes. Let's assume the company makes $100. At the \n35-percent top income tax rate that the company pays, $35 is taken, \ngoes to the government. So the aftertax income for that business is \n$65. That is what the owners of the business get, right? Not quite.\n  If the dividend is then paid to the owners of the business, the \nPresident wants that to be taxed now at the ordinary income tax rate. \nBy the way, he wants that rate to go from the current rate of 35 \npercent up to 43.4 percent. A top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 \npercent, plus the 3.8 percent from the health care bill that was \npassed, brings the top marginal income tax rate to 43 percent.\n  I know this gets a little bit confusing, but at the end of the day, \nit is not that complicated. The $65 that is remaining after the \ncorporation pays its income tax--if that gets paid to the investor--\nthat now, under the President's plan, would be subject to a 43-percent \nfurther tax.\n  That is another $28 that gets taken from that initial $100 of income, \nleaving the investor with $37 out of the $100 this business makes. So \nthe President's plan is, if you want to invest in a business to help \ngrow this economy and create jobs, the business--your activity--will be \nsubject to having almost two-thirds of the income taken and you are \nleft with about one-third.\n  What is the net effect? It is a huge disincentive to invest, to grow \na business, to take a risk. Most of the rest of the world does not have \ntax rates this high, does not have a corporate tax rate this high, and \ntherefore it is a further incentive for capital to move elsewhere.\n  I think we ought to pursue policies that encourage maximum economic \ngrowth, not policies that absolutely discourage savings and investment \nand the growth that comes with it.\n  If Senator Portman tells me I have a couple of other minutes, I will \nmake one more point; that is, to switch to the sustainable fiscal \nprofile which we are not on now.\n  The President, to his credit, has put his finger on precisely what is \nthe long-term problem we face. He has described it as the mandatory \nhealth care spending, the entitlement programs, as a general matter. He \nis exactly right. When we look at his budget, it is very revealing.\n  If we take just the following categories--Medicare, Social Security, \nMedicaid, and interest on our debt, just those items--and look at what \nthe President has proposed for those items over the next 10 years, it \nis an average annual increase of almost 8 percent--7.8 percent to be \nprecise. But he is only proposing that the economy is going to be able \nto grow by about 5 percent.\n  Frankly, that is optimistic. So what happens if we have huge \ngovernment programs growing faster than the economy each and every year \nfor as far as the eye can see? That is the definition of unsustainable \nbecause these programs consume ever more of the budget and ever more of \nthe economy until something has to collapse.\n  This is why I am so disappointed the President has not so much as \nsuggested an idea for how we might reform the long-term, totally \nunsustainable path they are on. Most of us--Republicans in this body \nand in the other body--believe we need to make some changes for future \nretirees. We are not talking about changing the rules for people who \nare currently retired or about to retire but people my age and younger \nand my kids. When are we going to acknowledge that we have to fix this \nso these programs can survive for the next generation?\n  If we refuse, if we continue to go on this path, we are going to face \nthe kind of financial crisis they are facing in Europe. We have a \nlimited window of opportunity to solve this. It is not too late for us \nto avoid the fate of our friends on the other side of the Atlantic. But \nI would suggest we do not have time to lose.\n  I think the President has missed the big opportunity to provide some \nleadership. I hope we will make up for that in this body.\n  With that, I would be happy to yield back to my colleague from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Toomey. I appreciate his \nfocusing on the progrowth elements because, as I said at the outset, a \nbudget is an opportunity to set the Nation on a 10-year course, both on \nthe spending side--how much should the government spend--but also on \nthe revenue side. That means we are getting into how to grow the \neconomy because the right tax reform will generate more growth. That \ngrowth will generate more revenue in the right way.\n  Unfortunately, if we look at the proposal the President has made, it \ndoes nothing to help improve our economic growth. In fact, when the \ndividend tax was moved down to 15 percent, it was done so because, as \nSenator Toomey has rightfully pointed out, it is a double tax. In other \nwords, it has already been taxed once at the company level. So when we \nget a dividend paid, we should not have to pay a high tax on it again.\n  In fact, because of that double taxation, as he has indicated, there \nwill be a tax--total tax of over 60 percent. By the way, in the \nPresident's budget, the dividend tax was increased from 15 percent to \n39.6 percent for some taxpayers. Then, as Senator Toomey has said, we \ncan add the surcharge that comes from the health care bill and get it \nup into the forties for the individual.\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n  Most people did not expect that. It is an example where this budget \nactually went further in terms of trying to, again, tax people more and \ntherefore have less growth than anyone expected. Most people thought it \nwould go from 15 percent to 20 percent or 25 percent, but not all of \nthe way to--almost tripling the tax on dividends.\n\n  So it is an example where, in this budget, there was an opportunity \nto lay out a pro-growth path that included tax reform. Instead, we are \nbuilding on our current antiquated, inefficient tax system and just \nlopping more taxes on top, including taxes on capital gains and on \ndividends that will make it more difficult for us to have the kind of \ninvestment we need to get this economy moving again.\n  The President, when he ran for election in 2008, pledged to reform \nentitlements. Senator Toomey talked about the fact that he has \ncontinued to talk about that, the need for it. I certainly agree with \nthat, as do, by the way, most of my colleagues in the Senate, Democrat \nand Republican alike.\n  The budget, of course, does nothing to help. In fact, it increases \nthe cost significantly on entitlements, as Senator Toomey has said, an \n8-percent increase on average for these important programs. But that \nputs them on an unsustainable footing when the economy will not be \ngrowing nearly that fast.\n  Instead of doing something to reform these programs, making them work \nbetter, the President is just continuing to pile on more entitlements. \nBut in 2008 the President also said he was going to cut the deficit in \nhalf. At that time the deficit that first year of his administration \nwas $1.4 trillion. He proposed to cut it in half over the 4-year term. \nSo now we are in 2012, the final of his 4 years--fiscal year--and their \nestimate for the deficit this year--from the Office of Management and \nBudget, from the Congressional Budget Office--is that we will be over \n$1.3 trillion.\n  So it does not sound like he has cut the deficit in half. Some will \nsay, well, it is less as a percent of our economy. That is true. Our \neconomy has grown some. But it is still not close to cutting it in \nhalf. A lot of things happen during a Presidential term. But I would \nhope that the President, in putting forward a budget, would have put \nforward a serious effort to reduce the deficit significantly, to get \nthis economy back on track and prepare for, again, this unsustainable \ngrowth in entitlements by truly reforming the programs to make them \nwork better and to make them sustainable over time.\n  We still have the opportunity to do that in the Senate. It is an \nelection year, but we still have 8 or 9 months until the election. We \nshould get busy working together as Republicans and Democrats, not \nfollow the President's budget because, unfortunately, it does not \nprovide the guidance we need. But we need to follow what all of us know \nin our hearts has to be done, which is grow the economy through pro-\ngrowth, sensible approaches such as tax reform, regulatory relief, and \nusing more of our own natural resources in this country. We can help \ngrow the economy on the one hand and, therefore, create revenue.\n  Then, second, we ought to do everything we can to reform these \nprograms to make them sustainable, to reduce annually appropriated \nspending in ways that are responsible--not just to our kids and \ngrandkids, as important as that is, but to today's economy to ensure \nthat we can, indeed, have a strong recovery that all of us hope for and \nbegin to bring people back to the workforce, create jobs, get this \neconomy moving again, and give people that dignity and self-respect \nthat comes from work.\n  I am glad to have had the opportunity to talk about this budget.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S685-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S685-S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his leadership. I am \nhere today to appeal to this body. I think the Presiding Officer, I \nknow myself, and a whole host of folks in this body have been concerned \nabout where the country is going. I know many of us have talked about \nways of reforming our Medicare system at some point, which I realize \nmay not happen this year, and our Medicaid system, and to move our \ncountry to a place where it works fiscally for all Americans. We have \ntalked about all kinds of things. Shoot, I think there have been over \n50 or 60 Senators involved in trying to reach consensus on those \nissues.\n  Today, we are debating a highway bill. I know we have had a lot of \ngreat work that has taken place in EPW, a lot of great work in the \nCommerce Committee, in the Banking Committee, and in the Finance \nCommittee. What we have done in this bill--and I so appreciate our \nleadership allowing us to look at this bill in this way--is to move to \none portion of the bill and then adding other portions on to the bill. \nSo I thank the leadership of the Senate for letting us look at the bill \nin this way.\n  I know there are provisions in the Finance component that are being \nworked out now before the Finance piece comes to the floor, and again I \nappreciate the people working on that. But it was my understanding--and \nI think I am right--that the major components of that Finance work were \nnot supposed to change, yet here we are and what we are getting ready \nto do with this highway bill is pretty unbelievable.\n  All of us want to see infrastructure in this country built. I know \nthe Senator from Maryland is a strong proponent of that and has lobbied \nheavily for that. I was the mayor of a city at a time when it seemed we \nhad nothing but orange barrels, so I thought it was very important we \nhad proper infrastructure.\n  But with all of the consensus that has developed in the Senate around \ntrying to solve our big issues, here is what we are doing. And many \npeople on the other side of the aisle--my friends--can remember the \ndebate during health care. One of the things that many people on my \nside of the aisle argued was a problem with the health care bill was \nthat we were going to use 6 years worth of cost and 10 years worth of \nrevenue. That was one of the things that actually got a lot of people's \nattention and concerned people on both sides of the aisle. What we are \ndoing with this bill is even more egregious. What we are doing with \nthis highway bill is we have 2 years' worth of cost and 10 years of \nrevenue.\n  Again, I know all of us want to see a highway bill put in place. I \nthink most of us want to see a long-term highway bill put in place. But \nlet me explain what is happening. The Senator from Maryland and I, \nevery year or so, have to deal with something called SGR. It is the \nsustainability growth rate for Medicare. We put a formula in place back \nin 1997, but we haven't owned up to that. So what we do every year and \na half or so is we kick the can further down the road and we create \nwhat is called a financial cliff at the end of it. Every time we deal \nwith that, it gets more and more expensive.\n  I understand people here in the Senate don't want to support \nphysicians across their States, so we keep kicking the can down the \nroad and not finding a way for a long-term solution that all of us know \nneeds to be in place. I personally understand how people are concerned \nwith how we reform Medicare. It affects a lot of seniors in our States, \nand we want to make sure we do that in the right way.\n  What I don't understand is why on this highway bill, which has a \ntrust set up--and by the way, it doesn't have the same type of \nconstituency. I shouldn't be talking politics, but it doesn't. We deal \nwith all of our Governors back home. But why on this highway bill are \nwe creating exactly the same problem for our highway program that we \nhave with SGR? What we are effectively doing, if we pass this bill in \nthe way the Finance Committee has come up with paying for it, is we \nhave created exactly the problem we have with SGR. I cannot imagine why \nanyone in this body wants to see us take one problem and transfer it to \nsomething else that so many of our Governors and people across our \ncountry depend upon.\n  So here we are, in a situation where we all know our fiscal situation \nis not\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nsustainable, we know we have to make changes--and I realize it is very \nunlikely those changes are going to happen this year--and yet we would \ngo ahead and do what I think is unbelievably irresponsible, which is \nthat we would go ahead and pass this highway bill where we are going to \nspend all the money in 2 years and pay for it over 10. So I am here to \nappeal to people on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. It is a bipartisan bill. This isn't one \nof those things where one side of the aisle is trying to pass something \nover the objections of the other side of the aisle. But I want to \nappeal to the conscience of the people in this body, to the moral high \nground that sometimes this body can exhibit in representing the \nAmerican people, that we not do the same kind of thing we have done \nwith SGR--the doc fix and Medicare--to the highway bill. We ought to \nspend the amount of money we have coming in. If we don't think that is \nenough money to pay for it annually, we ought to change the way the \nrevenue structure is coming into the program.\n\n  There is no way in the world households in Maryland or Tennessee or \nany other place would possibly consider doing this. We know fiscally \nthis doesn't work. Financially, it doesn't work. So I am hopeful enough \npeople in this body will put aside expediency, put aside making \neverybody feel good back home in the short term, and not create a \ncrisis.\n  By the way, at the end of 2013, if we pass this bill as it is laid \nout now by the Finance Committee--even with the tweak they are looking \nat on IRAs--what we are looking at doing is putting in place a $10 \nbillion cliff.\n  Again, I think it is unbelievably irresponsible that we would \ntransfer the same woes we have in our entitlement programs to the \nhighway program. We ought to either spend the amount of money that is \ncoming in annually and reduce the amount of outflows or we ought to do \nsomething different with the gas tax or some other revenue stream. But \nwe should not put our heads in the sand and say, even though we know \nthis doesn't work, it is an election year and we want to get a highway \nbill behind us. We know it is going to be bad news for our country down \nthe road, but it is good news for us today. To me, that is \nirresponsible. So I am appealing to both sides of the aisle. I am \nappealing to all those people who have been to numerous meetings trying \nto figure out a bipartisan way--not as Republicans or Democrats, but in \na bipartisan way--we can deal with our country's financial problems in \nan appropriate way, a pragmatic way, that doesn't jerk the rug out but \ngets us where we need to go over the next 10 years. I am appealing to \nall those people who act very sincerely in these meetings and speak \nwith passion about where our country is going. I am appealing to their \ngoodwill. I am appealing to their conscience. I am suggesting that we \ntake the moral high ground and not let a bill pass like this--a bill \nthat uses the same budget gimmickry we have used for so many years and \nthat has put us in the place we are now in.\n  I hope, in a bipartisan way, we will say, no, stop. Let's do this in \nthe appropriate way that reflects the trust the American people have \nplaced in us to handle their finances, their tax money, and this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was going to ask a number of consent \nrequests which I thought were important to present to the Senate, \nimportant issues that have not been resolved. I decided not to do that.\n  We have made some progress in working toward an end of the issues \nthat are preventing us from moving forward on this bill. I hope we can \ncontinue to do that in the next 24 hours. There is certainly enough \nimportance in this legislation to do just that. We are talking about \nmore than 2 million jobs with this legislation, so I hope my friends, \nthe Republicans, will figure out a way to help us move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to follow on to the comments made \nby the majority leader about the importance of the bill we are trying \ndesperately to move forward here today and we tried to move forward \nyesterday. We had a good vote when we came back here on Monday night. \nEighty-five of us said, Let's go do this highway bill. This is a key \nand important matter for the country.\n  In the 1950s, it was President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican \nPresident, who said, We need an interstate highway system. We cannot \nmove people, we cannot move commerce, we cannot be a great power. We \nhave a great military, but we don't have a good road system. He moved \nforward not only with that but with the very first aid to schools at \nthat time; because before he made the point that we needed to have a \nFederal program to help our schools, it was strictly a State matter. So \nwe owe President Eisenhower a lot. And I will tell you, the way we are \nacting around here, if he were watching, he would be shocked. The first \namendment to a highway bill is birth control. The second amendment the \nRepublicans want after birth control is to talk about Egypt. It goes on \nand on, controversial drilling off our coast, and all of this list they \ncame up with.\n  It is very clear we have a bipartisan bill. It will make sure that we \nbuild our roads, we fix our roads, we fix our freeways, we make sure \nour bridges are safe. Right now, we have a horrible situation with tens \nof thousands of bridges that are unsafe. Do we need to have another \ntragedy before we pass this highway bill?\n  Every committee has done its work, including the Finance Committee, \nto come up with the funds to fill the Highway Trust Fund so we can keep \ngoing at current levels plus inflation, and we have leveraged one \nprogram called TIFIA which leverages 30 times. So by putting $1 billion \ninto the TIFIA Program--and you know about it because you are a proud \nmember of the EPW Committee--by putting $1 billion into the TIFIA \nProgram, it means $30 billion out there, because the States and the \nlocalities will apply for this funding, they will match this funding, \nthe private sector will match it, and we will create up to 1 million \nmore jobs in addition to the 1.8 million we are protecting with the \nrest of the programs.\n  We are talking about a real shot in the arm to our economy. I am \nproud that Senator Inhofe--who is the mirror opposite of me in most \nissues. We do not agree on most issues. We do agree on this, the need \nto have a class-A infrastructure. We agree on that. We think it is \ncritical. Yet here we sit, minute after minute, hour after hour, day \nafter day, because Republican Senators do not want us to move forward \non this bill. You have to ask why. Why? We are willing to take these \namendments. We are willing to work on several of them. We cannot do 100 \nunrelated amendments. Come to us with a list that makes sense. But do \nnot tell the people in your State you are working to get a highway bill \ndone because I am here to put in the Record that the fact is, you are \nnot helping. You are hurting us. You are hurting the hundreds of \nthousands of construction workers who need these good-paying jobs. You \nare hurting the tens of thousands of businesses that need to get back \nto work making the cement, laying the pavement, fixing the bridges, \nbuilding the houses.\n  It is very distressing. When I go home and people say: What is \nhappening, well, they have to have a vote on birth control. It is hard \nto find the words except to say: What are you thinking when we have a \nbill that is so important?\n  My Republican friends stand here, minute after minute and hour after \nhour--they are not here now--all day criticizing President Obama, who \nhas turned this economy around--no thanks to them. When he took over, \n800,000 jobs a month--bleeding. There was a contraction in economic \ngrowth. It was way down in the final quarter of the Bush years. There \nwere huge deficits he inherited from Bush. He's turned it around. He \nsaid we need to save the auto industry, and we did. A lot of our \nfriends on the other side said: Oh, don't do it. They were wrong. The \nPresident was right. We are recovering. Month after month we are adding \njobs, after loss after loss of jobs. We have turned it around.\n  But I will tell you that this bill is, as the chamber of commerce and \nthe AFL CIO agree, the No. 1 jobs bill we can do. There is not much we \ndo\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\naround here that can have an impact on 2.8 million jobs. I cannot think \nof anything that tops that. They are mostly private sector jobs. There \nare some jobs in the public sector in the transit areas, but they are \nmostly private sector, private business jobs.\n  So anyone who tells you they are for jobs and anyone who tells you \nthey are for economic recovery, the first thing you should say is, Are \nyou helping Senators Boxer and Inhofe in a bipartisan way to move the \nhighway bill, because that is 2.8 million jobs. If they give you an \nanswer like: Oh, sure, but we have to have a few important amendments \nfirst, you ask them what those amendments are. If they are honest with \nyou, they will tell you birth control, a woman's right to choose, \nhealth care, offshore oil drilling.\n  They have one they want to offer that would hurt our people's health. \nIt would allow dangerous arsenic and lead and other toxins to go into \nthe air from boilers. They want to repeal a protective rule we have \nthat will clean up the pollution from boilers, even though the biggest \nboiler manufacturers support the rule. Go figure. The last thing I hear \npeople in my State tell me is, oh, I want more arsenic in my air and, \noh, I would love to have more lead. I need more mercury.\n  Please. This is the 21st century. We have made so much progress on \nthe environment. We are making progress on health care. We are making \nprogress on infrastructure. Don't stop it all. Step back, let this bill \ngo forward.\n  Senator Reid has set up a vote, a first test vote after the vote to \nproceed. I know some people have some problems with a couple of the \ntitles, and we are working on fixing that, but I hope we will get 60 \nvotes to proceed. If we do not, we are going to try again. Believe me, \nwe are going to try and try again because, as one Senator, I am not \ngoing to agree to do anything else until will we get this bill done, \nperiod. One thousand organizations are at work trying to push this bill \nforward, organizations from business, to labor, to government. We have \nthe general contractors, the cement makers, the AFL CIO and a number of \nunions, the chamber of commerce, the granite people, we have Portland \nCement, and we have a group that represents America, AAA.\n  We have to do this bill. I will not, as one Senator, give up my right \nand go to anything else. That is how strongly I feel about it, and I do \nnot believe I am being selfish. I think I am representing the people of \nthis country who want to see a jobs bill pass, who want to see a \nbipartisan bill pass, who want to make sure our States do not suddenly \nstart laying people off at a time when we are finally turning this \neconomy around.\n  I guess I am laying down a marker here as one Senator from one State, \nalbeit the largest State in the Union, 38 million people strong, with a \nhigh unemployment rate, traffic congestion. We take 40 percent of the \ngoods through California that are being imported into our country. It \ngoes on our roads, all throughout America. Do you think we need better \nroads? Oh, yes, we do. Do you know what happens when those trucks sit \nand stall on the 10 freeway? It is ugly, it is dirty, it is wasting \nmoney, it is wasting time, it is hurting people's lungs, and it cannot \nstand.\n  I lay down the marker today. I ask my friends to please come to the \ntable. I am ready, willing, and able, as the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We will meet with you. We will \nlisten to you. If you want to have a certain amendment offered and we \ncan help you get it done and it makes sense, it is relevant, we will \nhelp.\n  But other than that, let me be clear, there are a few things we do \naround here that are bread and butter, basic. The highway bill that got \nstarted under Dwight Eisenhower is basic. You should hear what Ronald \nReagan said about the importance of a highway bill, the importance of a \ntransit bill. You should hear it. It is on the radio. People are taking \nout ads to talk about it. Bill Clinton is eloquent on the point. This \nis a bipartisan issue, and it will be voted on in this Senate. It will \nbe voted on because I cannot in good faith as the chairman of this \ncommittee just give in and say: OK, we are done. We tried for 4 days, \nit did not happen.\n  But I hope everyone watching in America--if we have anyone watching--\nwill understand that it is 3:20 on a workday. This Chamber is empty \nbecause people are playing games and maybe they don't want this economy \nto go forward. Maybe they don't want to see President Obama succeed. \nMaybe they don't care about jobs, for all their talk, because that is \nthe only thing I can say.\n  When you have a bill on the floor that came out of a committee \nunanimously--it came out of two committees unanimously: Senator Inhofe \nand I agreed; Senators Johnson and Shelby agreed--and then you have the \nFinance Committee reaching out to the Republicans--they worked \ntogether, and they had a tremendous vote, which I think was 17 to 6 \nwith one voting present, for their title, and that is about 90 percent \nof this bill--and then you see nothing here going on because people \nwant to offer amendments about birth control, it is beyond me.\n\n  I hope, as you see this floor quiet today, if it bothers you the way \nit bothers me, you will call the Capitol and leave a message for the \nleaders on both sides of the aisle and say: For the good of the people, \nput aside your differences and get this job done.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. This is not a Democratic bill. It is not a \nRepublican bill. It is a bipartisan bill. Surely if the committees \ncould set aside unbelievable differences, then we can do the same and \nget to work on this.\n  I am embarrassed--embarrassed for the people of this country. They \nare out there working and there is an empty Chamber here when we have \nthe most important bill we could possibly have on the floor.\n  I am going to fight for this bill. I am going to fight hard. I am \ngoing to make the case. I am going to fight for the 2.8 million jobs it \ncould produce. I am going to fight for the thousands of businesses that \nneed this lift. I am going to fight for the people who need to have \nsafe roads and safe routes to school so they do not have to worry. I am \ngoing to do it in the name of the people who never made it because they \nwere on some unsafe road. Senator Inhofe talks about a mother and a \nchild who went under a bridge in Oklahoma, and a big sheet of concrete \nfell down and she is gone. She died. I am going to do it in the name of \nall these things because this bill is about motherhood and apple pie.\n  There is no partisanship to this--none. Republicans use the roads and \nDemocrats use the roads. Independents use the roads. We all use the \nroads. We want our children safe. We want our families safe. We want \nour roads usable. We do not want to be caught in congestion. Every part \nof the transportation system is addressed by the four committees that \nhave come together on this bill.\n  As I leave the floor--and I do not see anybody else--I hope people \nwill watch. In 5 or 10 minutes, if nobody is here, pick up your phone \nand call the leaders of Congress and tell them to get to work on the \nTransportation bill and don't offer ridiculously unrelated amendments. \nWe do not have to do that. Come together and sit down together and make \na path forward because right now there is no path forward. I do not see \nit. I do not see it. It is one of those things where people just say: I \ndon't care; we are not going to this bill.\n  Everyone in America is going to know this is happening because I am \ngoing to tell everyone in America it is happening. I will not be \nlistened to the first few times, but maybe by the 20th time somebody \nwill notice what is happening here. We are in morning business, meaning \nwe are just yakking, we are not doing any real work. But I will be back \nin a little while to give a report on the progress we are making--or \nlack of same.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I come to the floor today frustrated, as \nmany of us are, that once again we are not able to address legislation \nin the way the Senate is designed to address\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nit, which is to debate, to discuss, to offer amendments, and to vote. \nOnce again the majority leader has decided he didn't like some of the \nproposed amendments and, therefore, is trying to shut off all \nopportunity to provide amendments. We are allowed to come down and give \nour little speeches, but there is no debate, there is no back and \nforth, there is no record of where we stand on certain issues except \nfor final passage. I think the American people want more than that. \nThat is not why they sent us here.\n  This is my second time in the Senate, with a 12-year gap in between \nmy terms, and a lot of people ask me what has changed since my first \ntime here. I say one thing that has dramatically changed--and which \ndidn't happen my first time in the Senate--is that we used to be able \nto come to the floor and essentially offer any amendment at any time to \nany bill. That is the difference between Senate procedure and the rules \nin the House of Representatives. We don't have a Rules Committee that \ndictates which amendments can be offered and which ones can't. This is \nsupposed to be a body where we have an open discussion, where any \nMember can offer any amendment to any bill at any time. So in my first \n10 years, that is what we did. It made for long nights, it made for \nlong days, but we were performing the function our Founding Fathers \ndesigned for this body to fulfill.\n  Somehow it worked out. We went on record. Our yea was yea, and our \nnay was nay, and it was all there for the public to see. The amendments \nthat were offered, the debate that took place, and the vote that was \nconducted were all there. Then we went home and explained why we voted \nyes or why we voted no. But the public had full transparency.\n  Today, and in this period of time--and I have just been here a year \nand a month in my second stint in the Senate--it is very seldom we have \nthat opportunity.\n  Once again, on the highway bill, which affects every American in \nevery State, we have finally gotten to the real thing. Our side has put \nup some amendments, and the majority has looked at them and said: No, \nwe don't want our Members to have to vote on those, so we will use a \nprocedure called ``filling the tree.''\n  Now, that doesn't mean anything to Americans--filling the tree. What \nam I talking about? There is a procedure in the Senate where we can \nonly offer so many amendments to a particular bill before we are \nprecluded from offering another. The majority leader of the Senate--\nwhether Republican or Democrat--has the opportunity, if he or she wants \nto take it, to gain the floor and procedurally put us in a position \nwhere no amendments can be offered and then move to talking about it \nand to immediate debate.\n  That is not the way we should proceed. I was prepared to give this \nhighway bill a real chance. I have some real problems with the bill \nthat is before us. The House is passing legislation that has many \nthings in it I like--some things I don't like--and we were all looking \nfor an opportunity to try to address those particular concerns.\n  I have a particular concern with the bill that is brought before the \nSenate because this bill, for starters, goes into the general fund and \nbeyond the sales tax for gasoline purchases fund.\n  Everybody thinks when they pull up to the pump and fill their car \nwith gas, they know there is a Federal tax attached to the price we \npay, but they know it goes into a tax fund specially designed to \nprovide for construction and provide for return to the States so they \ncan build the roads and repair the bridges and do things associated \nwith transportation. That is why we pay that gas tax. That is supposed \nto be apportioned in a rational way back to the States so they can do \nwhat is needed for their State to provide the kind of transportation \ntheir State wants.\n  This bill not only uses all the money that is paid into that fund but \nadds an additional $12 billion of spending that is from the general \nfund. The pay-fors aren't legitimate. So, once again, we are in a \nsituation where we are borrowing money, going into debt, increasing \ndeficit spending and increasing the debt load we have in order to \nenhance the money we are going to send out to the States.\n  Many of us have said based on what we have seen and what has happened \nhere in years that has driven us into a deficit which cannot be \nsustained and a debt which may never be repaid, we are simply not going \nto support legislation that spends more than we take in without being \npaid for. We can't keep doing this. Now we are in a situation where we \nhave a bill before us that is needed because we need these funds to \ngive to the States to build the roads and repair the bridges, but we \nare dipping into the general fund for an additional $12 billion.\n  Secondly, there is an inequitable treatment to States. I bring this \nchart to show how this affects various States. If we take what a State \nhas paid into the fund and look at what a State receives back, we will \nsee there is an inequity present. Part of the general fund money that \nis going into this might try to make up for some of that. But if we \nstay with the principle upon which highway funding has always been \nfunded; that is, a State gets returned its proportionate share of what \nthe taxpayers pay when they pull up to the pump in that State and fill \ntheir car with gas, there are some States that fall within a real deep \ndeficit.\n  It starts with the State of Texas. Texas loses $1,113,000,000 that is \npaid in but doesn't come back to them under the formula. My home State \nof Indiana is third on the list. We lose $275 million because what we \npay into the fund is not returned to us. These are all of the donor \nStates. Donor States are those that pay in more than they receive back. \nThey are pretty big States and have a real stake in this and would have \nhad a real stake in this amendment. These States would have had an \nopportunity to vote for or against this amendment had I been allowed to \noffer it.\n  The States of Texas, Georgia $283 million, New Jersey, Florida, \nCalifornia, Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, and on it goes. Members \ncan take a look at this chart. This is the amount of money they lose \nbecause they are not getting their fair share back and they are the \ndonor States. The money that is lost is sent to other States that are \nthe donee States. So our taxpayers in Indiana are paying the equivalent \nof $283 million to other States.\n  We have been a State that has managed our fiscal situation very well \nand we have been very careful. We have this old-fashioned belief that \nwe shouldn't spend more money than we take in, and we live by that \nprinciple in Indiana. We have been careful in how we have managed our \nmoney and how we have used the money that is sent to us that we paid \ninto the gas tax fund. Yet we are penalized because we have managed our \nfinances well, and Hoosier taxpayers end up sending money to States \nthat haven't done as well.\n  The second problem is, this bill falls short because though we are no \nlonger doing earmarks, it includes earmarks from over the past several \nyears, and the total of those earmarks goes into the total average of \nspending for that particular State, and the formula then is based on \nthe fact that the big earmarkers end up getting more money, while \nStates such as Indiana that have not pursued those earmarks lose out \nbecause the average is based on the accumulative amount that is paid \ninto the fund, including earmarks. Once again, a State that has been \ncareful in terms of managing and spending its money ends up being \npenalized because we haven't pursued earmarks, which, fortunately, are \nno longer part of our method of doing business.\n  Indiana pays approximately 2.71 percent of the total Federal gas tax, \nand we would like to get 2.71 of that back. If we do get that back, it \nwill have a significant effect. We have a second chart that talks about \nwhat is paid into the highway trust fund just for a few States that we \nlisted, the apportionment under the bill that is before us and the \namount that is below the fair share and I have read some of those. \nAgain, Texas, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, and Florida being the top \nfive States that are penalized for this.\n  I also had amendments I was going to add that would give States \ngreater flexibility in terms of how they use the money they receive. We \nhave all heard the stories about money being diverted to things that a \nState doesn't want because there is a formula attached to the \nlegislation that says you have to\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\nspend X percent of money on certain projects, such as bike paths and \nwalking paths and other so-called enhancements. I am not against that. \nI use those. I jog on bike paths and appreciate some of those \nenhancements. But that ought to be a State decision in terms of how it \nallocates its money and not a Federal decision because a one-size-fits-\nall dictated by a particular piece of legislation simply does not take \ninto account the individual needs of a particular State. Some States \nmay want to say: Look, our roads are in such shape and our bridges need \nrepaired. At least for this year or the next 2 years, we are going to \ndivert the money into strictly construction and repair projects. Others \nmight say: Well, we are in a little bit better shape this year and we \ncan use some of this. That ought to be for the States to decide and not \na piece of legislation coming out of this body.\n  Finally, another amendment I would have liked to offer, if not for \nthe majority leader's refusal for an open-amendment process, is one \nthat would have limited the scope of eligible transportation \nenhancement projects. We hear these reports every day about crumbling \nroads and unsafe bridges. Yet what we are doing in this bill is \nlimiting how a State determines where it puts its funds. I think we \nought to narrow that option, if not take it away.\n  To wrap up, let me just say I think it is very unfortunate that we \nhave resorted to a system where if the other side--and I would say this \nto my leader if my party was in the majority. This is not how the \nSenate is supposed to operate. Someone from the other side who has an \namendment we don't like, they ought to have the opportunity to offer \nthat amendment and they ought to have the opportunity to debate that \namendment and to require a vote on that amendment. Then we can vote yes \nor we can vote no and the public can judge us accordingly. But to \nsimply shut it all down and not give anybody that opportunity I think \nis not the kind of procedure we want.\n  Finally, let me simply say this bill brought before us is a flawed \nbill. Without the process of amending it or the opportunity to amend, \nto fix what we think is wrong with it, puts us in a position where it \nis impossible to say we can vote for something such as this.\n  For the reasons I have articulated and for other reasons that will \ncome out as we make these speeches on the floor but don't have a chance \nto offer amendments, I simply cannot support this bill as it is.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Res. 377\n\n       Whereas John Herschel Glenn, Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, \n     in Cambridge, Ohio to parents John and Clara Glenn;\n       Whereas John Glenn grew up in New Concord, Ohio with his \n     childhood sweetheart and future wife, Annie Castor, 150 miles \n     east of Dayton, Ohio, the birthplace of the Wright brothers, \n     who first took humankind into flight;\n       Whereas John Glenn enlisted in the Naval Aviation Cadet \n     program shortly after the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, Hawaii, and was commissioned as an officer in the \n     United States Marine Corps in 1943;\n       Whereas John Glenn received many honors for his military \n     service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross on 6 \n     occasions, the Air Medal with 18 Clusters, the Asiatic-\n     Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the \n     World War II Victory Medal, the China Service Medal, the \n     National Defense Service Medal, and the Korean Service Medal;\n       Whereas, with the onset of the Cold War, the United States \n     and the free world feared the intentions of the Soviet Union \n     in space;\n       Whereas President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``NASA'') to find the most talented, patriotic, \n     and selfless test pilots to participate in Project Mercury, \n     the first human spaceflight program in the United States;\n       Whereas John Glenn and fellow candidates for NASA's \n     Astronaut Corps underwent pressure suit, acceleration, \n     vibration, heat, loud noise, psychiatric, personality, \n     motivation, and aptitude tests at the Aeromedical Laboratory \n     at the Wright Air Development Center in Dayton, Ohio;\n       Whereas John Glenn, Malcolm S. Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, \n     Jr., Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, Walter M. Shirra, Jr., Alan \n     B. Shepard, Jr., and Donald K. Slayton were selected from \n     among hundreds of other patriotic candidates to be named the \n     original ``Mercury Seven'' astronauts;\n       Whereas Project Mercury was charged with the unprecedented \n     responsibility of competing with the strides that the Soviet \n     Union was making in space exploration;\n       Whereas the United States public viewed John Glenn and the \n     Mercury Seven astronauts as men on the front line of the war \n     not only for space supremacy but also, in many minds, for the \n     survival of the United States;\n       Whereas John Glenn accurately captured the significance of \n     the time when he later wrote that ``the world was at the door \n     of a new age, and we were the people who had been chosen to \n     take the first steps across the threshold'';\n       Whereas the Project Mercury astronauts trained for their \n     manned space flight missions in the Multi-Axis Space Training \n     Inertial Facility at NASA's Research Center in Cleveland, \n     Ohio;\n       Whereas Alan Shepard was chosen to pilot the first manned \n     Project Mercury mission on Freedom 7 on May 5, 1961, which \n     proved that the United States was capable of successfully \n     launching a person into suborbital flight;\n       Whereas Virgil Grissom was chosen to pilot the second \n     manned Project Mercury mission on Liberty Bell 7 and became \n     the second United States astronaut to achieve suborbital \n     flight on July 21, 1961;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union had successfully launched the \n     spacecrafts Lunar 2 and Lunar 3 in 1959 before successfully \n     launching and returning to Earth Major Yuri Gagarin, who \n     completed a 108-minute single orbit around the Earth in 1961;\n       Whereas John Glenn was selected from among the Project \n     Mercury astronauts to command the first United States capsule \n     to orbit the Earth;\n       Whereas John Glenn, with the help of his children Dave and \n     Lyn, named the first United States space capsule to orbit the \n     Earth  Friendship 7, re-emphasizing the peaceful intentions \n     of the United States space exploration program;\n       Whereas John Glenn trained vigorously, working through 70 \n     simulated missions and reacting to nearly 200 simulated \n     system failures, to prepare to orbit the Earth and \n     successfully complete the first manned orbital mission for \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the work that John Glenn conducted on the cockpit \n     layout, instrument panel design, and spacecraft controls in \n     the Mercury spacecraft enhanced the design of Friendship 7 \n     and the ability of an astronaut to control Friendship 7, \n     which proved useful during the mission;\n       Whereas, at 9:47 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 20, \n     1962, the Atlas 109D rocket boosters ignited and John Glenn \n     and Friendship 7 commenced liftoff at NASA's Space Center in \n     Cape Canaveral, Florida;\n       Whereas John Glenn, aboard Friendship 7, became the first \n     United States astronaut to orbit the Earth, orbiting 3 times \n     and observing 3 sunrises, 3 sunsets, and the wonder of the \n     universe in only 4 hours and 56 minutes;\n       Whereas, when John Glenn learned that the heat shield on \n     Friendship 7 had possibly become loose in orbit, compromising \n     the successful completion of the space mission, Glenn bravely \n     managed the reentry procedures and proved that a person can \n     safely and successfully complete a NASA mission;\n       Whereas John Glenn successfully completed reentry into \n     Earth, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean at 2:43 p.m. \n     Eastern Standard Time, east of Grand Turk Island at 21 \n     degrees, 25 minutes North latitude and 68 degrees, 36 minutes \n     West longitude, and was recovered by the USS Noa;\n       Whereas, in the context of the Cold War, the success of the \n     Friendship 7 flight restored the standing of the United \n     States as the leading country in the race to space against \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the completion of the inaugural orbit of the Earth \n     by John Glenn validated\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\n     NASA's manned space flight mission and secured the future \n     missions of NASA's manned space capsules;\n       Whereas the people of the United States heralded John Glenn \n     as the personification of heroism and dignity in an age of \n     uncertainty and fear;\n       Whereas the press later described John Glenn as a man who \n     embodied the noblest human qualities;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy echoed the belief held by \n     John Glenn that the United States space program was not just \n     a scientific journey but also a source of inspiration and \n     pride, saying, ``our leadership in science and industry, our \n     hopes for peace and security . . . require us to solve these \n     mysteries and to solve them for the good of all men'';\n       Whereas John Glenn is a patriot and space pioneer who \n     encouraged the people of the United States to rightfully view \n     NASA as an embodiment of the persistent quest of the people \n     of the United States to expand their knowledge and explore \n     frontiers;\n       Whereas, in retirement, John and Annie Glenn continued \n     their public service by establishing the John Glenn School of \n     Public Affairs at The Ohio State University, living up to the \n     words of John Glenn, who said, ``If there is one thing I've \n     learned in my years on this planet, it's that the happiest \n     and most fulfilled people I've known are those who devoted \n     themselves to something bigger and more profound than merely \n     their own self-interest.''; and\n       Whereas, although 50 years have passed, the historic orbit \n     of John Glenn around the Earth aboard Friendship 7 remains a \n     source of pride and honor for the people of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the 50th anniversary of the landmark mission of \n     John Herschel Glenn, Jr., in piloting the first manned \n     orbital mission for the United States;\n       (2) recognizes the profound importance of the achievement \n     of John Glenn as a catalyst for space exploration and \n     scientific advancement in the United States; and\n       (3) honors the thousands of dedicated men and women of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration who worked on \n     Project Mercury and ensured the success of the Friendship 7 \n     Mercury mission.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Portman and \nmyself, I am proud to have submitted this bipartisan resolution--joined \nby 18 Senators, 10 of whom served with John Glenn in the Senate.\n  Fifty-years ago next week, on the morning of February 20, 1962, John \nHerschel Glenn, Jr. of Ohio became the first American to orbit the \nEarth.\n  I was 9 years old. Like other families around Ohio, I watched him on \ntelevision at home in Mansfield with my parents and two brothers.\n  The broadcast also showed John Glenn, Sr. and Clara Glenn, John's \nparents, watching anxiously.\n  Across the country, others were listening on transistor radios. In \nNew York City, the subway system broadcast the liftoff and flight \nprogress over loud speakers.\n  In Grand Central Station, CBS News set up a large 12 foot by 16 foot \nscreen over the main ticket window--by the time of lift-off 10,000 \npeople had packed the terminal.\n  Like millions of Americans, they watched Walter Cronkite set the \nscene. Our Nation was in the midst of the Cold War--worried about \nRussian nuclear aggression, worried about the race into space.\n  Cronkite would later say that:\n\n       It was a time when the intricacies of science were \n     complicated by deep American doubts and anxieties over where \n     we stood in the race with Russian science.\n       With the arms race in a dead heat, space had become the \n     scoreboard of Cold War competition.\n\n  That's why a few years earlier, President Eisenhower launched Project \nMercury as the first human spaceflight program in the United States--to \nput our country on the playing field.\n  Hundreds of our Nation's bravest and patriotic aviators signed up--\nonly seven were selected as the original Mercury 7: John Glenn, Jr. of \nOhio; M. Scott Carpenter of Colorado; L. Gordon Cooper, Jr. of \nOklahoma; Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom of Indiana; Walter M. Schirra, Jr. \nof New Jersey; Alan B. Shepard, Jr. of New Hampshire; and Donald K. \n``Deke'' Slayton of Wisconsin.\n  Glenn later wrote of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, ``The world \nwas at the door of a new age, and we were the people who had been \nchosen to take the first steps across the threshold.''\n  And when President Kennedy took office, he continued our Nation's \npursuit into space--and race against the Russians.\n  He said, ``Our leadership in science and industry, our hopes for \npeace and security . . . require us to solve these mysteries and to \nsolve them for the good of all men.''\n  Alan Shepard piloted the Freedom 7 in May 1961 and Gus Grissom \npiloted Liberty Bell 7 in July 1961 to prove that Americans could \nlaunch humans into suborbital flight.\n  But then the Russians successfully launched Yuri Gagarin into orbit \naround the Earth.\n  America's response was left to a decorated Marine aviator born in \nCambridge, Ohio who grew up a few miles away in New Concord.\n  On the morning of February 20, 1962, the eyes of the world were on \nJohn Glenn, who was tasked with piloting our space program's most \ndangerous flight at the time.\n  He would command Friendship 7--named by Glenn and his children, Dave \nand Lyn, to emphasize our Nation's intentions in space.\n  But over weeks and months, his mission was scrubbed ten times.\n  The reasons were varied--from inclement weather to technical \nproblems. Tensions remained high throughout.\n  Any miscues or failure would undermine national security--along with \nnational pride and the country's psyche.\n  Finally, at 9:47 a.m. on February 20, 1962, with 70 degree Fahrenheit \nweather at NASA's Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Friendship 7 \nwas blasted off into space.\n  As the rocket ascended, people cheered. Others cried and prayed--the \nhopes of an entire nation rested on the shoulders of a single man in a \nspace capsule hurling into an unknown place.\n  Everything was going as planned--from launch to orbital entry--and \nonce successfully in space, John Glenn became the first American to \norbit the Earth.\n  He would observe three sunrises, three sunsets, and the wonder of the \nuniverse in 4 hours and 56 minutes.\n  But during the flight, problems occurred. The spacecraft's automatic \ncontrol system malfunctioned, causing Glenn to manually control the \ncapsule.\n  And he was prepared to do so--benefitting from NASA's vigorous \ntraining that included 70 simulated missions and malfunction response \ntraining for nearly 200 simulated system failures.\n  His model of calmness, which I have seen many times over the years in \nall kinds of situations, would become standard operating procedure for \nfuture NASA manned space missions.\n  And despite having to deal with the malfunctions, Glenn still carried \nout critical parts of the mission.\n  He took photographs of the Earth, observed weather on the Earth's \nsurface, and gave constant feedback to flight controllers about his \nphysical responses to the zero-gravity environment.\n  But earlier in the flight, Glenn saw an indicator light that \nFriendship 7's heat shield had loosened--threatening his re-entry into \nEarth.\n  With its world-class scientists and engineers leading the way--and \nconfident in its flight planning--NASA decided to keep the retrorocket \npack attached to secure the heat shield.\n  As planned, Friendship 7 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere--with \nGlenn describing the ``fire-ball'' re-entry as one of the most \nexhilarating parts of the flight.\n  It is the streak of light that people on Earth could see in the sky.\n  And in descent, the capsule successfully parachuted and splashed down \nin the Atlantic Ocean, east of the Grand Turk Island, at 2:43 p.m., \nEastern Standard Time. The USS Noa retrieved Friendship 7 and brought \nGlenn aboard--validating our Nation's pursuit of discovery and ensuring \nits place in the space race against the Russians. And just as \nimportant--the flight of Friendship 7 and the courage of John Glenn \ninspired generations of new scientists, engineers, and aviators. It \nlaunched a new era of science, aerospace, and defense industries, and \nit showed that our advancements in science--in exploring the unknown--\nare not only a national security imperative, they are an economic \nimperative, too--reaffirming that we have what it takes to out-compete \nand out-innovate any nation in the world.\n  After his flight, Glenn received a hero's welcome--decorated with \nawards and accolades--and honored in ticker-tape parades and magazine \nprofiles. Throughout it all, he remained humbled by his patriotism and \nhis small\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\ntown Ohio roots--as a son whose father was a plumber, and whose mother \nwas a schoolteacher. And he remained grounded by his love for his wife, \nhis childhood sweetheart, Annie.\n  Much has been written about John and Annie. Both are just as in love \nwith each other now in their 90s as they were as children when they \nmet--as John says, in a playpen in New Concord.\n  He says of Annie, ``that she was part of my life from the time of my \nfirst memory.''\n  It is fitting that in celebrating the 50th anniversary of John \nGlenn's historic orbit of Earth, we honor his family--Annie and their \nchildren, Dave and Lyn who gave public blessing and private prayers and \nsupport during his service to our Nation.\n  I was fortunate to sit with Lyn and Dave and Annie in the Rotunda \nwhen John Glenn, with three other astronauts, received the \nCongressional Gold Medal for his flight aboard Friendship 7.\n  We also honor the thousands of dedicated and patriotic men and women \nof NASA's Project Mercury Program.\n  It took a huge team of people as dedicated as John Glenn, and perhaps \nas courageous, who ensured the safety and security of their astronauts \nand preserved the pride of a grateful Nation. John will be in Florida \non this weekend to meet with those who were part of that operation--the \nengineers, the scientists, the technicians--thanking them again for \nsending him up and bringing him down safely. Their service has inspired \ngenerations of future NASA technicians and mission control \nspecialists--from Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, to NASA Glenn in \nCleveland, to NASA centers around the country.\n  At one of the first press conferences of the Mercury 7 astronauts, \nGlenn said:\n\n       This whole project . . . stands with us now like the Wright \n     Brothers--Ohioans also--stood at Kitty Hawk . . . I think we \n     stand on the verge of something as big and expansive as that \n     was 50 years ago.\n\n  It is that spirit of discovery, that conviction, duty, and faith that \nJohn Glenn embodies and that his flight aboard Friendship 7 symbolizes. \nIt is my honor to submit this bipartisan resolution celebrating such an \nimportant national and scientific achievement.\n  It is also my honor to be accompanied on the floor today by Nicole \nSmith, who is a fellow from NASA Glenn, an aeronautical engineer, who \nhas done things as varied as having trained cosmonauts to the work she \nhas done in our office, guiding the success of NASA Glenn, one of the \nbest NASA centers in the country.\n  I am also joined on the floor by Laura Lynch, who has been with my \noffice for 3 years--a Clevelander--who is actually leaving our office \nfor bigger and better things in a couple of weeks. She has been part of \nthis too.\n  In my last personal moment with this resolution, I remember 40-some \nyears ago--44 years ago, I believe--when John Glenn was not Senator \nGlenn but still Colonel Glenn. I received my Eagle Scout award in \nMansfield earlier in the year, and COL John Glenn came to a dinner with \na number of other Eagle Scouts in Mansfield. I have a picture in my \noffice in the Senate Hart Building of me standing there in my Boy Scout \nuniform with my Eagle Scout pin with John Glenn, and next to that is a \npicture of John Glenn and me some 38 years later before he walked me \ndown the center aisle to be sworn in to the Senate with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island in January of 2007.\n\n  John Glenn is special to our Nation. He is special to my wife Connie \nand me because of our love for John and Annie and our respect for Dave \nand Lyn, their children. He has honored our country in so many ways, it \nis my honor to submit this resolution and I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S692-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S692-S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALASKA RURAL ROADS SYSTEM\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are dealing with the Transportation \nbill, and let me say I hope we truly deal with the Transportation bill \neventually because there has been a great deal of work on this measure \nby the chairman and the ranking members of the relevant committees, and \nI thank them for the hard work they have put into this. I support their \nefforts to give States long-term security for moving forward with \nFederal highway aid and transit programs. I support the efforts to give \nStates that long-term security for planning purposes, improve the \nproject approval process, and reduce duplicative and excessive \nprograms. However, I do have very serious concerns with certain aspects \nof the legislation proposed. Most particularly, and the reason I have \ncome to the floor this evening, is to discuss what this legislation \ndoes to the Indian Reservation Roads Program. This is the program known \nas IRR.\n  IRR is a jointly administered program between the Federal Highway \nAdministration and the Bureau of Indian Affairs that addresses the \ntransportation needs of our tribes by providing funds for the planning, \nthe design, the construction, and the maintenance activities.\n  The Indian Reservation Roads are public roads. They provide access to \nand within Indian reservations, Indian trust land, restricted Indian \nland, and Alaskan Native villages. There are approximately 29,000 miles \nthat are under jurisdiction of the BIA and the tribes, and another \n73,000 miles are under State and local ownership. IRR funds can be used \nfor any type of title 23 transportation project that provides access to \nor within Federal or Indian lands and may be used as the State and \nlocal matching share for a portion of Federal aid highway funds. The \nIRR inventory is a comprehensive database of all transportation \nfacilities that are eligible for IRR Program funding by tribe, \nreservation, BIA agency, region, congressional district, the State, and \nthe county.\n  I think it is important to understand how we came to the position of \nwhere we are today with MAP 21. For years, Alaska received very little \nassistance from the IRR Program because we only have one reservation, a \nvery small reservation down in southeastern Alaska, Metlakatla and, \ntherefore, little to no BIA-owned roads. The BIA maintains a national \ndatabase of roads, the IRR inventory, which is used to allocate IRR \nfunds and determine locations where IRR funds can be used. State and \ncounty-owned roads comprise the majority of the road miles within the \nIRR system. A few decades ago, there were very few villages in Alaska \nthat were putting any inventory into the system. TEA 21 gave the \ncommittee criteria in establishing the funding formula based on the \nneeds of Indian tribes for transportation assistance, cost of road \nconstruction, geographic isolation, and difficulty in maintaining all-\nweather access to employment, commerce, health, safety, and education \nresources. With the passage of TEA 21, a rulemaking committee was \nestablished, the IRR Program Coordinating Committee, which helped to \ndevelop the funding formula which was published in 2004. The \ncoordinating committee was made up of 12 primary members from Indian \ntribes, one from each region. There were 12 alternates and two \nnonvoting Federal representatives. Decisions that were made by the \ncommittee were reached by consensus. It was not a majority decision \nprocess.\n  The funding formula, which is known as the relative need distribution \nformula, adopted in the IRR Program final rule, reflects Congress's \nintent that the funding distribution method balance the interests of \nall tribes and enable all tribes to participate in the IRR Program. I \nshould note that 40 percent of all federally recognized tribes in the \nNation reside in the State of Alaska--40 percent. I think that is \nsomething many of my colleagues are not aware of. That balancing of \ninterests called for avoiding substantial allocations from the larger \ntribes while still addressing the central problem that historically \nleft the smaller tribes out of the program. The prior formula \ndistributed funds based on an inventory limited to roads built and \nowned by the BIA. But the new formula broadened tribal participation by \nallowing the inclusion of State, county, and municipally owned IRR-\neligible facilities in the inventory so the actual IRR transportation \nneeds could be counted for funding purposes.\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n  In 2003, Loretta Bullard, who is with a regional nonprofit \nrepresenting the Bering Straits region of northwestern Alaska, \ntestified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee saying that the \nBIA had never surveyed any villages to identify the roads that were \neligible for support. So there just wasn't a complete inventory at that \ntime because there had never been a survey up in Alaska. That was back \nin 2003. As a result of the 2004 rulemaking, which took 5 years, by the \nway, Alaska increased its inventory. Alaska benefited from a \ncompetitive grant program that was established under the rulemaking for \nsmaller tribes called the High Priority Project Program. This \nlegislation we are dealing with now seeks to undo all the gains Alaska \nmade through TEA 21, through the 2004 rulemaking, and through SAFETEA \nLU. It is all unraveled with this legislation. Alaska is unfairly \nharmed by MAP 21, more than any other region in the country. Alaska \nloses $16 million a year under MAP 21 and tribes throughout the State \nwill be effectively shut out of the program. This is not acceptable. \nThe current negotiated regulation, which was developed, again, by \nconsensus from tribes throughout the entire country, is focused on \nneed. The new formula which we see reflected in this legislation was \nwritten behind closed doors by a handful of people with no government-\nto-government tribal consultation. Its focus is on the population and \nthe urban areas. It disregards the trust responsibility that is owed to \nthe 566 federally recognized tribes in our Nation, 229 of which reside \nin the State of Alaska--again, nearly half of all the recognized tribes \nin the Nation.\n  I think every time I come to the floor and talk about something, I \nhave to put up the map of Alaska so we are all reminded how big it is. \nThis is the proportional size when we superimpose Alaska over the rest \nof the lower 48. The red on this map is our road system. All these \nareas in white where we don't see anything, there are no roads there. \nClearly our roads are pretty limited--our road system is centralized in \nthe middle of the state, with a few scattered roads in other areas.\n  What is behind this kind of great shadow of Alaska? The States that \nare covered up behind it are North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, \nKansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Illinois. \nThey are all kind of tucked under this great expanse. Just imagine if \none is from Missouri, it would be like saying we have no roads in the \nstate. That is what we are talking about. My map shows all the roads in \nAlaska, not the IRR roads. These are our State roads and our Federal \nhighways. This is everything. So when we are talking about the IRR \npiece, it is even more minuscule in terms of comparison to what the \nLower 48 has.\n  We have approximately 16,000 miles of road in Alaska, and 5,600 miles \nof those are unpaved. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind, we have \n570,000 square miles of land to cover in my home state. When you put in \nperspective, that's not a lot of roads we are talking about--16,000 \nmiles of road for 570,000 square miles of state.\n  I would like to highlight some of the things we have been able to do \nin the State of Alaska as a result of the IRR Program. The Indian \nReservation Roads Program funds the construction and maintenance of \nroads and bridges within Alaska Native villages. In many cases, these \nare not roads you and I would think of as typical roads.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes \nfrom my colleague, if that is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, most of our roads, when we are talking \nabout the IRR roads, are not necessarily roads that are going to carry \na vehicle. These are roads that will carry pedestrians, a four-wheeler, \na snow machine. These are the ways that Alaska's Native people access \nour subsistence resources, haul their subsistence food home. These are \nthe roads that form the link to the village airport, which is the only \nway out during the wintertime. If there are no roads, you have to be \nflying to all of these locations.\n  This is a picture of the village of Kwigillingok, which lies on the \nwestern shore of Kuskokwim Bay, 388 miles west of Anchorage. In this \nvillage, the primary mode of transportation is by foot, ATV, and snow \nmachine in the wintertime. But you look at this picture, it is all \nnice, green--it looks beautiful. But it is tundra. It is wet and \nmarshy. If you get down there in your rubber boots, you are going to be \nup to your knees in brush and water. You cannot walk through this and \nwould not want to put a vehicle on it.\n  So what you see here is a real technological breakthrough in how to \nbuild rural roads in places where dirt and gravel either just do not \nexist out there or just do not work. This was built using IRR funds \nfrom the Native village of Kwigillingok, funding from the State of \nAlaska, and funding from the Denali Commission. This is construction of \na geo-tech grid track. It looks like grading. It is like a plastic \ngrading that overlays the ground and provides access over the tundra.\n  IRR funding and the Denali Commission funding were leveraged with \nother funding sources, and it provided jobs within the community.\n  The next picture we have is a boardwalk, a board road that was built \nin Nunam Iqua, which is on the south fork of the Yukon River, about 500 \nmiles northwest of Anchorage. Again, this project was made possible by \nleveraging funds from the Denali Commission, the State of Alaska, and \nNunam Iqua's tribal shares from the IRR Program.\n  It is just a boardwalk, but you look at this picture, and you can see \nit is kind of rippled and wavy. Well, that is what happens when you put \nboards on top of wet, marshy tundra, but at least you can walk on it. \nAt least you can access it by your four-wheeler without doing damage to \nthe area and it connects your schools and health clinics to the homes. \nThis project created jobs within the community and a safe road system \nfor the residents to access public facilities.\n  This picture is from one of my visits down in the Y-K Delta. You can \nsee, this is their road system. It provides a connection to homes and \nto community facilities. This is the means of transportation here. You \ngo out on the tundra there and, again, you sink.\n  I took Secretary Paige, the Secretary of Education, out there to one \nof our smaller villages, Tuntutuliak, and we got out and got on the \nboardwalk, and he said: When does it dry out here?\n  I said: Sir, this is as dry as it gets.\n  He said: Where do the children play?\n  I said: Well, this is it.\n  In the Lower 48 children play on the sidewalks and quiet neighborhood \nstreets, in rural Alaska children play on the boardwalks.\n  We also have some challenging conditions in other parts of our State.\n  In southeastern Alaska, we do not have to worry about the tundra, but \nwe do have some challenging conditions. The Craig Tribal Association \ndown in Craig has been working on the reconstruction of the Port Saint \nNicholas Road for the past 4 years. The road has several bridges that \nare being replaced concurrent with the road construction.\n  Again, ``the Denali Commission has been a committed, critical \npartner,'' in the words of the tribe. In this picture, you can see Dog \nSalmon Creek Bridge prior to the construction. This was a dilapidated, \nrotting, wooden bridge. Then, in the next picture, you can see what \n$1.7 million from the Denali Commission and from IRR does--a modest \ninvestment that really comes together. You have a paved road and a \nsolid bridge that is going to last for decades.\n  But these projects could not be built under the reduced funding \nlevels for small tribes that we have proposed in MAP 21. Tribal \ntransportation funding in the bill is directed toward populated areas, \nand roads that are more established receive greater amounts of funding.\n  So again, when you take into account an area such as Alaska, where we \nhave many miles but few people, and a formula that is designed to work \nagainst us, how do we ever make headway, how do we ever connect these \ncommunities, how do we ever allow for a transportation system to \nprogress and be developed?\n  I have submitted an amendment I hope we will have an opportunity to \nbring up. It restores current law and current regulations with respect \nto the funding formula that was developed, again, after years of \nnegotiation in a very open and transparent process.\n  Just yesterday, at the Intertribal Transportation Association meeting \nin\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nMinnesota, we had tribes from the Rocky Mountain region, the Great \nPlains region, the Midwest region, and the Navajo Nation who all agreed \nthat MAP 21 sets a dangerous precedent to allow Congress to overturn \nthe tribal rulemaking process, as it is a threat to tribal sovereignty, \nand we are hearing more and more concerns every day about the \nopposition coming from those who feel they have been circumvented by \nCongress in this act.\n  In the past couple days, I have received letters from tribes from \nCalifornia, as well as Alaska. I have a letter from the Susanville \nIndian Rancheria, one from the Ramona Band of Cahuilla, who wrote: \nUnder MAP 21, smaller urban tribes with paved roads garner a \nsignificant increase in funding while tribes such as the Ramona Band \nwhich are rural and have poor roads, arguably those with the most need \nand no other access to transportation funding, will see significant \ndecreases.\n  What I am trying to do is restore some parity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters from not only the Alaskan \ntribes but from the Californian tribes I just mentioned be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Susanville Indian Rancheria,\n\n                                Susanville, CA, February 13, 2012.\n     Re Murkowski Amendment to MAP 21's Tribal Transportation \n         Program.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I write to you today on behalf of the \n     Susanville Indian Rancheria to encourage you to co-sponsor \n     and support the attached amendment to S. 1813, the Moving \n     Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (``MAP 21'') \n     legislation proposed by Alaska Senator Murkowski. The \n     amendment would remove the population based Tribal \n     Transportation finding formula and replace it with the \n     funding presently in SAFETEA LU.\n       Based on the data provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     (``BIA''), Tribes throughout Indian Country (California, \n     Alaska, New Mexico, Michigan, Minnesota, Utah, the Dakotas, \n     and Wisconsin) would lose millions in program funds under the \n     MAP 21 funding formula.\n       Under the proposed legislation, the current Indian \n     Reservation Roads Program (IRR) would be discarded and \n     replaced with what is called the Tribal Transportation \n     Program (TPP). The current IRR program is how federal \n     transportation funding is filtered to tribes. The TTP was \n     created to address what is argued to be the flawed IRR \n     program.\n       The great majority of Tribes strongly oppose MAP 21, \n     including 189 Alaska Tribes, the Navajo Nation, and the \n     majority of Tribes in California New Mexico, Michigan, \n     Minnesota, Utah, the Dakotas, and Wisconsin.\n       Unlike the original IRR formula distribution that was \n     ultimately finalized by negotiated rule making with tribes, \n     no tribes were consulted in the creation of the TTP. The new \n     TTP under MAP 21 was created without any tribal consultation, \n     and the program is based on population and not road needs. \n     This sort of formula would never be used by states in their \n     determination of road funding.\n       Tribes recognize that the current IRR formula has \n     imperfections; however, the TTP does nothing more than \n     exacerbate the issue and creates even greater problems than \n     before.\n       Under MAP 21, small urban tribes with paved roads garner a \n     significant increase in funding--while rural tribes with poor \n     roads, arguably those with the most need and no other access \n     to transportation funding, will see significant decreases. \n     While funding for California tribes would be increased by a \n     minimal $192,000 for 110 tribes, the California tribes with \n     the greatest needs and poorest roads would suffer significant \n     funding decreases.\n       The proposed solutions within MAP 21 do not adequately \n     address the problems inherent within Indian Country \n     transportation funding. The solution is not for Congress to \n     impose a flawed funding formula on Tribes and overturn the \n     SAFETEA LU funding formula that was agreed upon by all Tribes \n     in negotiated rulemaking. While federal agencies may believe \n     they are smarter than Tribes and know better how to resolve \n     the funding formula imperfections, we disagree and believe \n     the consensus among Tribes achieved in the negotiated \n     rulemaking that approved the funding formula under SAFETEA LU \n     must prevail is tribal consultation is to have real meaning.\n       The same proposed amendment herein included was added to \n     H.R. 7 in amendments offered by House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee Congressman Don Young during that \n     committee's markup of H.R. 7 on February 2, 2012.\n       Please support this fair and common sense amendment to MAP \n     21 and let us know how we may assist you to increase support \n     for this in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mr. Stacy Dixon,\n     Tribal Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Ramona Band of Cahuilla,\n\n\n                                           A Sovereign Nation,\n\n                                      Anza, CA, February 13, 2012.\n     Re: Submission of Request to Support Amendment to MAP 21\n\n     Senator Lisa Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the Ramona Band of \n     Cahuilla, a federally recognized Tribe located in California, \n     Chairman Joseph Hamilton submitted requests to Senator Boxer \n     and Senator Feinstein requesting their support for your \n     proposed amendment to MAP 21.\n       Attached is a copy of the request letters to each Senator. \n     As you can see, the requests were also forwarded to the \n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Additionally, the Ramona \n     Band will forward copies of the requests and a letter stating \n     the Tribe's support for the proposed amendment to \n     Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack, our Representative in the \n     House.\n       The Ramona Band supports your proposed amendment as a fair \n     and common sense approach to address a critical issue in MAP \n     21 that would negatively impact numerous Tribes and hinder us \n     in our collective efforts to provide for the health and \n     safety of our communities.\n       Place feel free to contact the Ramona Band if you have any \n     question or wish to discuss this issue.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  John Gomez, Jr.,\n     Project Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Ramona Band of Cahuilla,\n\n\n                                           A Sovereign Nation,\n\n                                      Anza, CA, February 13, 2012.\n     Re: Murkowski Amendment to MAP 21's Tribal Transportation \n         Program\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the Ramona Band of \n     Cahuilla, a federally recognized Indian Tribe located in \n     Riverside County, California, I write to you today to \n     encourage you to co-sponsor and support the attached \n     amendment to S. 1813, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \n     Century (``MAP 21'').\n       The attached amendment, as proposed by Alaska Senator \n     Murkowski, would remove the population based Tribal \n     Transportation funding formula found in MAP 21 and replace it \n     with the funding formula presently found in SAFETEA LU. The \n     amendment mirrors that which was added to H.R. 7 by \n     Congressman Don Young in the House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee markup of H.R. 7 on February 2, \n     2012.\n       Under MAP 21, the current Indian Reservation Roads Program \n     (IRR) would be discarded and replaced with what is called the \n     Tribal Transportation Program (TTP). The current IRR program \n     is how federal transportation funding is filtered to tribes. \n     The TTP was created to address what is argued to be the \n     flawed IRR program.\n       Unlike the original IRR formula distribution that was \n     ultimately finalized by negotiated rulemaking with tribes, no \n     tribes were consulted in the creation of the TTP. The new TTP \n     under MAP 21 was created without any tribal consultation, and \n     the program is based on population and not road needs. This \n     sort of formula would never be used by states in their \n     determination of road funding.\n       Under MAP 21, small urban tribes with paved roads garner a \n     significant increase in funding--while tribes such as the \n     Ramona Band which are rural and have poor roads--arguably \n     those with the most need and no other access to \n     transportation funding--will see significant decreases.\n       Based on a comparison of the funding formulas, funding for \n     California tribes would be increased by a total of $192,000 \n     for the 110 tribes under the MAP 21 formula. However, the \n     Ramona Band's funding would be reduced by nearly $70,000.00 \n     (more than 70% of our current funding). California tribes \n     with the greatest needs and poorest roads would suffer \n     significant and disproportionate funding decreases which \n     would cripple their ability to address necessary planning \n     maintenance, and construction projects of their outdated and/\n     or damaged roads. While the current formula is not perfect, \n     it properly considers the needs of tribes and tribal \n     communities, the conditions of their current inventories, and \n     their desire to provide adequate, safe, and secure routes, \n     Changes to the current IRR funding formula, such as those \n     proposed in MAP 21, would greatly damage small, rural tribes \n     and have long-term negative impacts on their communities and \n     roads systems.\n       Furthermore, the proposed solutions within MAP 21 do not \n     adequately address the problems inherent within Indian \n     Country transportation funding. The solution is not for \n     Congress to impose a flawed funding formula on Tribes and \n     overturn the SAFETEA LU funding formula that was agreed upon \n     by all Tribes in negotiated rulemaking.

Proposed legislation, ``MAP \n     21'', takes a step backwards and decreases funding for tribes \n     significantly, basically uprooting their transportation \n     programs.\n       Under Section 1116, Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation \n     Programs, these are a few of the programs to be affected \n     should the MAP 21 legislation be passed: Indian Reservation \n     Roads Bridge Program (IRRBP), Tribal Scenic Byways, Indian \n     Reservation Road High Priority Project Program (IRRHPP), \n     Tribal Transit Program, Tribal Safety Programs.\n       The National Bridge and Tunnel Inventory Identified within \n     MAP 21 have already been completed as a result of SAFETEA LU. \n     Having separate inventory developed with another set of \n     standards will be time consuming and costly to tax payers. \n     Currently an AASHTO standard is being used to assure that \n     everything is designed and built properly.\n       National Facility Inventory identified in MAP 21 has \n     already been established per SAFETEA LU and the Final Rule \n     2004, 25CFR, PART 170 Indian Reservation Roads Program.\n       Returning prior to October 1, 2004 would take away the \n     ability of Alaskan Tribes, established by SAFETEA LU, to \n     participate in the Transportation Program at 100% and would \n     NOT capture the transportation needs within Alaska; \n     therefore, we strongly oppose this legislation.\n       The Funding Formula identified in MAP 21 will not work \n     because it only calculates population and lane miles. Here in \n     Alaska, tribes would not be able to sustain building roads at \n     the local level because our populations would not generate \n     enough funding to create a local match for projects. We need \n     to keep the current formula Or the relative need distribution \n     formula (RNDF) that is currently in the regulations of 25 \n     CFR, PART 170.\n       The proposed legislation goes away from the Average Daily \n     Traffic (ADT), Cost to Construct (CTC), and Vehicles Miles \n     Traveled (VMT) of the equation in which is valuable in \n     developing design standards when planning, designing, and \n     constructing roadways.\n       Since SAFETEA LU, many Alaskan communities have built very \n     successful tribal transportation programs and have had, do \n     have and will continue to have great projects if MAP 21 does \n     NOT pass. This Proposed legislation is a huge threat to our \n     transportation programs, specifically Alaska.\n       WCA/ANTTC just finished our first IRR Program project this \n     past summer. IRR HPP Funding was an integral part of the \n     funding that was put together to finance the project. Under \n     MAP 21 IRR HPP is gone. We are sure there are other \n     components of MAP 21 that will hurt Alaska and Alaska Tribal \n     Governments in this proposed legislation. Attached are \n     pictures of before the project began and after the project \n     was finished. Quite a contrast in what was there before and \n     what is here now. WCA encourages you to come up with a longer \n     term solution to the overall picture within the \n     Transportation and Infrastructure picture throughout our \n     great country and not support MAP 21.\n           Thank-You,\n                                                  Dawn Hutchinson,\n     WCA President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Association of Village Council\n\n\n                                   Presidents, Administration,\n\n                                     Bethel, AK, December 8, 2011.\n     Re: EPW MAP 21\n\n     Inter-Tribal Transportation Association,\n     c/o John Healy, President,\n     Harlem, MT.\n       Dear President Healy and ITA Members: The Association of \n     Village Council Presidents (AVCP) is a Native Non-profit \n     organization comprised of 56 federally-recognized Indian \n     Tribes in southwest Alaska. On behalf of AVCP's member \n     Tribes, we wish to convey concern over certain provisions of \n     Section 1116 of the proposed MAP 21 bill.\n       As background, the AVCP Tribes are not connected by any \n     road system and are scattered over an area approximately the \n     size of Oregon. The Tribes transportation needs are \n     significant and framed against the backdrop of significant \n     challenges, including short building seasons, shipping costs \n     that reach 40% of total project budgets, building in remote \n     locations without any road infrastructure, and no access to \n     very basic human needs, such as health care and education. A \n     large portion of the AVCP region has no roads at all, and \n     that fact is critical to understanding its member Tribes' \n     transportation plans. It wasn't until approximately 10 years \n     ago that, by statute, Alaska Tribes were allowed to \n     participate in the Indian Reservation Roads program. Since \n     that time, they have been vigorously developing \n     transportation programs on the premise of meeting very basic \n     but essential needs. The struggles over having to choose \n     between purchasing food or purchasing gasoline and figuring \n     out how to get to the nearest health facility for basic \n     health care were beginning to be resolved through road \n     building. Having a better understanding of the underlying \n     realities facing Alaska Native Tribes will lead to a better \n     understanding of their unique challenges and a fair and \n     equitable solution to any proposed legislation.\n       With respect to our objections to MAP 21, our concerns \n     include the following. The Bill sets a dangerous precedent by \n     tearing apart formulas that were developed during an \n     extensive negotiated rule-making process, opening the door to \n     disassembling other Tribal programs, such as Housing and the \n     reauthorization for NAHASDA. The Bill further eliminates \n     entirely the High Priority Program, which has provided an \n     enormous amount of support for Alaska Tribes, who have just \n     begun developing their infrastructure.\n       The Bill further eliminates the Population Adjustment \n     Factor. Because the average population number, at least in \n     the AVCP region, for our Tribes is 200, only those Tribes \n     with large population numbers will benefit.\n       The Bill also changes the ability for Alaska Tribes to \n     participate in a meaningful way by altering the distribution \n     formula. Alaska Tribes were only recently allowed to \n     participate in the IRR Program, which means that only a scant \n     number of roads prior to 2004 were entered into the system. \n     This proposal would essentially obliterate Alaska Tribes' \n     existing programs. Moreover, as a large portion of the roads \n     in Alaska are not paved, Alaska Tribes would further suffer \n     from the lane mile formula, counting unimproved roads as one \n     lane mile and paved roads as 2-lane miles. The proposed \n     funding formula contained in MAP 21 would result in an 85% \n     reduction to our Tribes' programs. Alaska Tribes together own \n     44 million acres of land with little to no roads within them. \n     The inventory they have built up in efforts to building an \n     infrastructure to improve the health and safety of their \n     members will disappear, funneling those funds to Tribes with \n     a decades-long road systems and larger populations.\n       The Bill is inequitable, and we urge the ITA to take a \n     serious look at the unfair consequences it places on Alaska \n     Tribes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Myron P. Naneng, Sr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Klawock Cooperative\n\n\n                                           Association, Tribe,\n\n                                    Klawock, AK, December 5, 2011.\n     Re: MAP 21 ``Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century \n         Act''\n\n     Hon. Senator Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The Klawock Cooperative Association \n     (KCA) has reviewed the Senate Minority Environmental Public \n     Works proposed legislation Map 21, ``Moving Ahead for \n     Progress in the 21st Century Act'' and shares the following \n     concerns.\n       Previous legislation, ``SAFETEA LU'', provided the \n     opportunity for Alaska and Federally Recognized Tribes to \n     participate in the transportation program at 100%. Proposed \n     legislation, ``MAP 21'', takes a step backwards and decreases \n     funding for tribes significantly, basically uprooting their \n     transportation programs.\n       Under Section 1116, Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation \n     Programs, these are a few of the programs to be affected \n     should the Map 21 legislation be passed: Indian Reservation \n     Roads Bridge Program (IRRBP), Tribal Scenic Byways, Indian \n     Reservation Road High Priority Project Program (IRRHPP), \n     Tribal Transit Program, Tribal Safety Programs.\n       The National Bridge and Tunnel Inventory Identified within \n     MAP 21 have already been completed as a result of SAFETEA LU. \n     Having separate inventory developed with another set of \n     standards will be time consuming and costly to tax payers. \n     Currently an AASHTO standard is being used to assure that \n     everything is designed and built properly.\n       National Facility Inventory identified in MAP 21 has \n     already been established per SAFETEA LU and the Final Rule \n     2004, 25 CFR, PART 170 Indian Reservation Roads Program. \n     Returning prior to October 1, 2004 would take away the \n     ability of Alaskan Tribes, established by SAFETEA LU, to \n     participate in the Transportation Program at 100% and would \n     NOT capture the transportation needs within Alaska; \n     therefore, we strongly oppose this legislation.\n       The Funding Formula identified in MAP 21 will not work \n     because it only calculates population and lane miles. Here in \n     Alaska, tribes would not be able to sustain building roads at \n     the local level because our populations would not generate \n     enough funding to create a local match for projects. We need \n     to keep the current formula or the relative\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n     need distribution formula (RNDF) that is currently in the \n     regulations of 25 CFR, PART 170. The proposed legislation \n     goes away from the Average Daily Traffic (ADT), Cost to \n     Construct (CTC), and Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT) of the \n     equation which is valuable in developing design standards \n     when planning, designing, and constructing roadways.\n       Since SAFETEA LU, many Alaskan communities have built very \n     successful tribal transportation programs and have had, do \n     have and will continue to have great projects if MAP 21 does \n     NOT pass. This Proposed legislation is a huge threat to our \n     transportation programs, specifically Alaska, therefore; we \n     encourage you to vote against it and come up with a long term \n     solution to the overall picture within the Transportation and \n     Infrastructure in our great state.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           A. Webster Demmert III,\n                                                 Tribal President.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have other concerns with this \nTransportation bill. I have mentioned the Denali Commission several \ntimes today. I have joined my colleague, Senator Begich, in filing an \namendment to this bill that would restore the Denali Commission's \ntransportation program--an incredibly important program to our State. I \nhave also raised concerns about a provision within the banking title \nthat relates to our Alaska Railroad.\n  These are concerns that, while they might not register fully with all \nof our colleagues here in the Senate, to Alaska they are critical. Our \ntransportation needs are different. Some might say they are unique. But \nwe have risen to the challenge with limited funding and smart people \ntrying to do good things to connect us in ways that make sense.\n  Through the work of the Denali Commission, our IRR funding, and our \nAlaska Railroad, we have been engaged in building up the transportation \ninfrastructure of the Last Frontier. In order to continue the progress \nthat we've made thus far, I ask for your support and consideration to \naddress the problems I've outlined with this legislation.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Oregon for giving me some \nadditional time this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I too wish to address transportation \ninfrastructure. I enjoyed the presentation of my colleague from Alaska. \nHer State certainly has some unique challenges in terms of creating a \nway for goods and people to move around the State effectively. I look \nforward to hearing the details of her amendment when we get to the \nTransportation bill.\n  Meanwhile, we are sitting here in this Chamber--both of us--unable to \npresent our amendments before this body because we are not yet on the \nTransportation bill. Why would that be?\n  Well, apparently, there are Members of this body who have decided to \nobstruct the normal ability to assemble the bill that comes from four \ncommittees on this floor in order to do nongermane amendments that have \nnothing to do with transportation and to hold this entire body hostage, \nto hold hostage those on the left side of the aisle and to hold hostage \nthose on the right side of the aisle, to hold transportation hostage, \nto hold, if you will, jobs across America hostage. This hostage-taking \nis just not right. It is just not right that when we should be building \ninfrastructure in America, which is right in the short term for jobs \nand in the long term for our economy, we are instead sitting here \ntalking about the amendments we would like to offer to make the \ntransportation system work better, to improve upon the bill as it came \nout of committee.\n  Now, just to refresh the memories of my colleagues, this \nTransportation bill has gone through four committees successfully. It \nhas gone through Commerce. It has gone through Finance. It has gone \nthrough Banking. It has gone through Environment and Public Works. In \nthe course of that, in two of these committees, the bill was unanimous. \nAnd in the other two committees, it was not unanimous, but it was \nbipartisan. So we have had this bill come to the floor with the support \nof 85 Senators in the four committees. Yet we cannot get the \nconversation on the floor started. This is enormously frustrating to \neveryone across America.\n  I found it interesting to see this letter from 2 days ago. I thought \nI would just read it to you. It has a list of about 20 organizations \nthat are appealing for the commonsense deliberation of transportation \ninfrastructure. It is dated February 13, 2012.\n  It says:\n\n       To Members of the United States Senate:\n       The time is now to pass S. 1813, [the] Moving Ahead for \n     Progress in the 21st Century [bill], the bipartisan highway \n     bill crafted by the Environment and Public Works Committee. \n     Last Thursday, eighty-five Senators voted to invoke cloture \n     on the motion to proceed to S. 1813, clearly demonstrating \n     bipartisan support for passing the highway and transit bill. \n     While we are encouraged by this show of support, the \n     undersigned organizations are concerned that progress may be \n     impeded if non-germane amendments are offered as part of the \n     deliberations on this bill.\n       The organizations that we represent may hold diverse views \n     on social, energy, and fiscal issues, but we are united in \n     our desire to see immediate action on the Senate's bipartisan \n     highway and transit reauthorization measures.\n\n  This does come from a broad array of organizations. It comes from the \nAAA, the American Automobile Association. It comes from the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transit Officials. It comes from the \nAmerican Bus Association. It comes from the American Concrete Pavement \nAssociation. It comes from the American Council of Engineering \nCompanies. It comes from the American Highway Users Alliance. It comes \nfrom the American Moving & Storage Association, from the American \nPublic Transportation Association, from the Road and Transportation \nBuilders Association, from the American Society of Civil Engineers, \nfrom the American Traffic Safety Services Association, from the \nAmerican Trucking Associations, from the Associated General Contractors \nof America, the Associated Equipment Distributors, the Associated \nEquipment Manufacturers, the Association of Metropolitan Planning \nOrganizations, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, the Governors \nHighway Safety Association, the Intelligent Transportation Society of \nAmerica, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Motor & \nEquipment Manufacturers Association, the National Asphalt Pavement \nAssociation, the National Association of Development Organizations, the \nNational Construction Alliance II, the National Stone, Sand & Gravel \nAssociation, the Portland Cement Association, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  That is an extraordinary array of groups that are saying: Enough with \nthe posturing on social issues. Let's get to work building the \ninfrastructure of America.\n  Now, one of the amendments a colleague wants us to spend our time on \nis an amendment that says: If you are the owner of a business, anything \nyou consider to be a health care perspective, you can impose on your \nemployees. There is some interesting humor on this on late-night \ntelevision.\n  I believe it was Jon Stewart's show, ``The Daily Show,'' in which he \nsaid: You know, in my business, I happen to think that humor is the \nbest medicine. So I am going to impose a health care bill or a health \ncare policy on all the folks who work for me that says, if you get \nsick, you have to go to a comedian for therapy or you have to read a \njoke book or something like that.\n  I mean, this is not a serious amendment, and it is not about highway \ninfrastructure.\n  While we sit here doing nothing in this Chamber, China is spending 10 \npercent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure. I had a chance \nto go to China 14 years ago and then once again last year. In the \nintervening timespan, they went from a couple ring roads and virtually \nno connecting roads between major cities to an enormous highway system, \nan enormous expansion of the infrastructure in major cities, light rail \nsystems, high-speed trains. It was enormously strange to get on a train \nin Beijing and go at 200 miles per hour to Tianjin. I cannot get on a \ntrain here in DC and go 200 miles per hour anywhere. There are vast \ninfrastructure projects across that nation in cities we have never even \nheard of because they are spending 10 percent of their gross domestic \nproduct building the infrastructure that will be the foundation of a \nfuture thriving economy.\n  Europe is spending 5 percent--half of what China is spending but \nstill substantial. What are we spending here in America? And when I ask \nthis question in townhalls, normally folks say 1 percent or maybe they \nventure 5 percent.\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nBut depending on how you count it, the answer is 2 percent. So it is a \nfraction of what Europe is spending and one-fifth of what China is \nspending. Thus, we are barely able to repair the infrastructure we \nhave, let alone build the infrastructure for the economy of tomorrow.\n  Now here we are, spending our time awaiting the opportunity to have \nthe highway and transit bill here on the floor of the Senate so that we \ncan direct resources to build that infrastructure. But instead of \ndebating, we wait.\n  So I say to my colleagues across the aisle, who somehow have lost \nsight of the fact that infrastructure is essential for building \nAmerica, who have lost sight of the fact that the construction industry \nis flat on its back and ready to go to work, who have lost sight of the \nfact that right now with low interest rates and an unemployed \nconstruction business this is the best time to be investing in \ninfrastructure, the most cost-effective time to be investing in \ninfrastructure, I say to my colleagues who have lost sight of the fact \nthat there is a responsibility to spend a dollar wisely, in \nconstruction and infrastructure, now is the time when you get the \nbiggest bang for the buck, now is the time when it is wise.\n  This is not just about the infrastructure that makes our economy work \nbetter, it is about creating jobs. Maybe some folks in this Chamber \nsay: Well, we want to play politics with jobs. We do not want people to \ngo back to work. We want America to be broken so we can promote our \nPresidential candidate over someone else's Presidential candidate.\n  I say that is irresponsible. It is absolutely irresponsible to be \nplaying these political games with the livelihood of working Americans.\n  The bill that came out of the House or the bill that was proposed in \nthe House was a 35-percent reduction in highway spending, \ninfrastructure spending. What would that mean for my State back home? \nWell, it would mean projects all over the State that address critical \nchokepoints in transit and transportation will not get addressed.\n  I have a 36-county tour. Every year I go and listen to folks in every \none of my 36 counties, and I talk, and I have a special meeting with \nthe county and city officials beforehand. Inevitably, they say: Here \nare our infrastructure challenges. Please go back and fight to do \nsomething so that we have the resources to tackle these challenges and \nmake our economy stronger.\n  So I am here on the floor awaiting the embargo imposed by my \ncolleagues who are not so concerned about infrastructure, who \napparently have not talked to their city and county officials who are \ndesperate to take on these chokepoints in their local economy. So I say \nto them: Stand aside. If you cannot get on board with making America \nwork, stand aside so the rest of us can put America to work.\n  In Oregon, this is also 7,000 living-wage jobs--the difference \nbetween the vision the House had on the other side of this building and \nthe vision the Senate had. The Senate vision is not, quite frankly, \nthat ambitious. The Senate vision simply says that we are going to \nmaintain the fiscal 2011 support for the transportation process, for \nthe transportation infrastructure. It is not building beyond that. It \nshould be, but it is not. So it is a modest vision. But compare it to \nthe vision on the other side of the Capitol and the other side of the \naisle which says: Let's not only not spend 2 percent, let's cut the \nentire budget by one-third--let's put 7,000 people out of work in \nOregon who are not only building a foundation for their families, they \nare building the foundation for the future economy. I know that in \nevery State there are similar portions of workers who want to be at \nwork, getting up with a mission in their life to go out and do \nsomething useful for their society, to build something useful, and to \nhave a paycheck to put the foundation under their family.\n  The time has long passed for us to be fully debating this bill. I \nurge my colleagues to come and do the work the American citizens expect \nof us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S697-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING INDIANA UNIVERSITY CHEERLEADERS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I come to \nthe floor concerning the passing of Frank Cushing, one of the true \npublic servants that the Congress has known. Frank served as a \nlegislative aide to Senator Jim McClure of Idaho prior to joining the \nAppropriations Committee staff as director of the Subcommittee on \nInterior and Related Agencies in 1981. In 1984 he became the staff \ndirector of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, a post he \nheld until 1991. Although he left briefly for the private sector, \npublic service remained an integral part of his commitment to the \nCongress and this Nation. His expertise, command of the appropriations, \nauthorizing, and budget processes, and his exceptional talent and \nability to work with others was missed, and he returned to the Congress \nas staff director of the House Appropriations Committee under \nCongressman Lewis.\n  It takes exceptional abilities to be a good staff director, \nespecially with the strong personalities that come with the experts who \nserve on the staff of our committees. Frank had the ability to work \nacross the aisle and with other committees as few have ever done. His \nknowledge of the appropriations process and budgeting provided a unique \ndepth to the consideration of authorizing legislation. He was able to \nchallenge the staff, improve the work product, and set a high standard \nfor quality and substance that we still strive to maintain. Much of the \nwork of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is bipartisan and \noften nonpartisan, reflecting regional interests and concerns, and \nFrank understood how those interests and concerns could fit within the \noverall policies that we tried to set for our energy, public lands, and \nresource goals.\n  During his tenure on the committee, Frank in many ways was \nresponsible for the close working relationship between Senator McClure \nand Senator Johnston as they switched from their roles as chairman and \nranking member. Frank was extraordinarily helpful when Senator McClure \nwas chairman in resolving the budgetary issues that threatened to hold \nup the Compacts of Free Association that, when finally enacted, led to \nthe termination of the Trusteeship of the Pacific Islands the last of \nthe U.N. Trusteeships. When Senator Johnston announced at the beginning \nof one Congress that he thought the committee should consider and \nreport legislation dealing with Puerto Rico as well as national energy \npolicy, Frank was in large measure responsible for negotiating and \nconstructing the framework and process that enabled the committee to \nsuccessfully report both measures with bipartisan support, although I \nshould mention that there were also bipartisan concerns as well.\n  Those are details, however, and do not convey what a warm and \ngenerous person Frank was. They do not convey the respect and \nadmiration that those who worked with him had for his ability to \nnegotiate without rancor and without being disagreeable. They do not \ntell of his concern for his staff and their problems or his interest in \ntheir\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nwelfare and future or how the friendships that developed during his \ntenure continued and grew and deepened over the years since he left.\n  There is one other aspect of Frank's service to the Senate as staff \ndirector of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that should be \nmentioned. If Frank always put public service and the willingness to \nrespond to calls to return to public service above the lures of the \nprivate sector, there was one passion that surmounted everything else \nand that was his love for his family. Frank met his wife Amy while he \nserved on the Energy Committee, and anyone who ever met Frank \nunderstood that Amy and his children, from his first marriage and with \nAmy, were the center of his life.\n  Our hearts and thoughts in these times go out to Amy and Frank's \nchildren and to all their family and to those who were close to him. \nHis presence remains with the institutions he served; and his humor, \ncompassion, and commitment will continue to be a marker for not just \nour committee, but for public service generally. His family and \nmultitude of friends lost a good and faithful man, but they all remain \nthe richer for having known him for the many years, both in and out of \ngovernment, that they shared with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S698-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING THOS. MOSER CABINETMAKERS\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in his famous essay titled \n``Courage,'' Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that he most admired those ``who \ncan organize their wishes and thoughts in stone and wood and steel and \nbrass.'' In our time, when so much is mass produced and temporary, we \nhave a special regard for the craftsmen and women who turn the \nmaterials provided by nature into objects of beautiful form and lasting \nfunction.\n  I rise today to congratulate the craftsmen and women of Thos. Moser \nCabinetmakers of Auburn, ME, as they celebrate the 40th anniversary of \nthis remarkable company. With skill and creativity, they transform \nblack cherry, maple, ash, and walnut into fine furniture that is \nrecognized worldwide as the pinnacle of the woodworkers' art.\n  This story of success driven by the pursuit of excellence began in \n1972, when Tom Moser left the secure life of a college professor to \nfollow his dream to revive the craftsmanship of woodworkers of the \npast. With his wife Mary, they set up shop in an old Grange Hall in New \nGloucester, ME.\n  They met the challenges faced by all entrepreneurs with \ndetermination. Soon, their sons joined them in the growing business. \nToday, 70 skilled men and women work in their modern woodshop in Auburn \nand another 50 in other aspects of the operation, including showrooms \nin major American cities, from New York and Washington, DC, to Los \nAngeles and San Francisco.\n  When Tom and Mary Moser founded this company, they did more than \nrevive quality woodworking--they were pioneers in Maine's thriving \ncreative economy. From cutting-edge technology to the arts, these \nvisionaries are moving our State forward, building new industries and \nnew opportunities.\n  This segment of the creative economy truly defines Maine. The \nresurgence of furniture making, cabinetry, pottery, and textiles bring \nthe past alive and remind us of the special quality of something made \nby hand in Maine. The talented designers and woodworkers of Thos. Moser \nCabinetmakers create objects that bring pleasure today and will be \ntreasured heirlooms for generations to come. I congratulate the Moser \nfamily and all their employees for 40 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S698-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING PORTLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nPortland Community College in Portland, OR on its 50 years of \ndelivering high-quality education. Portland Community College has \nconsistently demonstrated its devotion to an accessible education for \neveryone, serving more than 1.3 million college-age residents in a \nfive-county area in Northwest Oregon.\n  Simply put, the education offered at Portland Community College \ncreates a pathway to the middle-class for so many Oregonians. Students \nof all ages and backgrounds rely upon this college to improve skills \nfor either career or personal reasons, explore opportunities, complete \na high school degree or GED, work towards a bachelor's degree, or \ncomplete a certificate or technical degree. Portland Community \nCollege's mission has always been to create a foundation of long term \nvitality by supporting a broad range of needs in northwest Oregon.\n  Fifty years of commitment to accessible life long learning \nopportunities has produced more than 1.3 million educated members of \nthe Oregon community and our Nation--members who, thanks to PCC, are \nprepared to attain the American dream. To Preston Pulliams, the \ndistrict president of Portland Community College, and to the faculty \nand students of PCC, congratulations on a half century of academic \nexcellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S698-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S698-S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE ALASKA SPORTS HALL OF FAME\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nAlaska Sports Hall of Fame. Since the body's inception in 2006 and its \nfirst class of inductees in 2007, the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame has \neducated Alaskans and visitors, honored and preserved memories in \nAlaskan sports, and promoted a healthy youth population by providing \nactivities that will inspire children to strive for success in their \nown lives. The Hall's mission is to teach, honor, and inspire.\n  Beyond that core mission, the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame has done \nmuch to promote the accomplishments of the world-class athletes in the \ngreat state of Alaska. The 23 Hall of Fame inductees through 2012 have \nstacked up tremendous accomplishments, but there is, perhaps above all \nelse, a single thread that binds the inductees together: a love and \nrespect for Alaska.\n  Dr. Bradford Washburn, without ever actually living in-State, was \ncertainly an honorary Alaskan. He traversed the North Country in more \nthan 70 trips and strapped himself into the open door of a low-flying \nplane for aerial photographic work of the great State of Alaska. The \nlegendary ``Huslia Hustler,'' George Attla, was a ten-time Fur Rondy \nsled dog champion and motivated crowds that included a strong rivalry \nwith Roland ``Doc'' Lombard. Carlos Boozer, born in Juneau, played for \nthe Crimson Bears at Juneau-Douglas High School, compiling a 95 12 \ncareer record and winning back-to-back Class 4A State titles in 1997 \nand 1998, before moving on to be an NBA All-Star. Reggie Joule, the \ngreatest practitioner of the blanket toss in the long history of the \nWorld Eskimo-Indian Olympics, captured more than 30 medals in the 2-\nfoot high kick, greased pole walk, arm pull, and other events, earning \nthe title ``Mr. Olympics.''\n  The Alaska Sports Hall of Fame depicts an understanding that goes \nbeyond the basic tenets of its own stated mission. It is a way to honor \nthe Alaskan way of life and to depict Alaskan exceptionalism. Mark \nSchlereth, 2008 Alaska Sports Hall of Fame inductee and 3-time Super \nBowl Champion, described the Alaskan bond as special and a true source \nof pride.\n  After the sweat, the injuries, the memories, the failures and \naccomplishments, the true value of sport goes far beyond the statues \nand medals. Sport brings friends and family together it can make \nteammates of complete strangers. It provides youth with positive role \nmodels, promotes healthy lifestyles, and teaches life skills.\n  The Alaska Sports Hall of Fame reminds us of the positive attributes \nof sport, but equally important is highlighting and respecting the \nAlaskan way of life. Events such as the Iditarod, the Great Alaska \nShootout, and the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics showcase the great State \nof Alaska and who we are as a people.\n  There is so much to celebrate and commemorate in Alaska. The Alaska \nSports Hall of Fame provides an opportunity to demonstrate excellence \nin athletic endeavors by exceptional Alaskans.\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S699-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2105.

A bill to enhance punishment for identity theft and other \nviolations of data privacy and security; read the first time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Cyber \nCrime Protection Security Act, a bill to strengthen our Nation's \ncybercrime laws. Developing a comprehensive strategy for cybersecurity \nis one of the most pressing challenges facing our Nation today, and an \nissue that the Senate will tackle in the coming weeks. A legislative \nresponse to the growing threat of cyber crime must be a part of that \nconversation.\n  Protecting American consumers and businesses from cyber crime and \nother threats in cyberspace has long been a priority of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. In September, the Committee favorably reported \nlegislation which included a provision essentially identical to this \nbill as a part of the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act. Since \nthen, I have worked closely with Senator Grassley to advance cyber \ncrime legislation that will have strong bipartisan support.\n  Cyber crime impacts all of us, regardless of political party or \nideology. Recently, several Republican Senators stated the following in \nan opinion piece about the Senate's cybersecurity legislation: ``In \naddition, our nation's criminal laws must be updated to account for the \ngrowing number of cybercrimes. We support legislation to clarify and \nexpand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act--including increasing existing \npenalties, defining new offenses and clarifying the scope of current \ncriminal conduct. These changes will ensure that our criminal laws keep \npace with the ever-evolving threats posed by cybercriminals.'' I could \nnot agree more. I hope that all Senators will support this bill and I \nurge the Senate to quickly pass this important legislation.\n  We simply cannot afford to ignore the growing threat of cyber crime. \nA study released by Symantec Corp estimates that the cost of cybercrime \nglobally is $114 billion a year. During the past year, we have \nwitnessed major data breaches at Sony, Epsilon, RSA, the International \nMonetary Fund, and Lockheed Martin, just to name a few. In addition, \nour Government computer networks have not been spared, as evidenced by \nthe hacking incidents involving the websites of the Senate and Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  The Cyber Crime Protection Security Act takes several important steps \nto combat cyber crime. First, the bill updates the Federal RICO statute \nto add violations of the Computer Fraud and\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nAbuse Act to the definition of racketeering activity, so that the \nGovernment can better prosecute organized criminal activity involving \ncomputer fraud. Second, the bill streamlines and enhances the penalty \nstructure under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. To address cyber \ncrime involving the trafficking of consumers' passwords, the bill also \nexpands the scope of the offense for trafficking in passwords under \ntitle 18, United States Code, section 1030(a)(6) to include passwords \nused to access a protected Government or non-government computer, and \nto include any other means of unauthorized access to a Government \ncomputer.\n  In addition, the bill clarifies that both conspiracy and attempt to \ncommit a computer hacking offense are subject to the same penalties as \ncompleted, substantive offenses, and the bill adds new forfeiture tools \nto help the Government recover the proceeds of illegal activity.\n  This legislation also strengthens the legal tools available to law \nenforcement to protect our nation's critical infrastructure, by adding \na new criminal offense that would make it a felony to damage a computer \nthat manages or controls national defense, national security, \ntransportation, public health and safety, or other critical \ninfrastructure systems or information. Lastly, the bill clarifies that \nrelatively innocuous conduct, such as violating a terms of use \nagreement, should not be prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse \nAct.\n  The bill is strongly supported by the Department of Justice, which is \non the front lines of the battle against cybercrime. In fact, the \ncriminal law updates in this bill were a part of the cybersecurity \nproposal that President Obama delivered to Congress last May. We must \ngive the dedicated prosecutors and investigators in our Government the \ntools that they need to address criminal activity in cyberspace.\n  To build a secure future for our Nation and its citizens in \ncyberspace, Congress must work together, across party lines and \nideology, to address the dangers of cybercrime and other cyber threats. \nIt is in that cooperative spirit that I urge all Senators to support \nthis important cybercrime legislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to empower the Food and Drug Administration to ensure \na clear and effective pathway that will encourage innovative products \nto benefit patients and improve public health; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nTransforming the Regulatory Environment to Accelerate Access to \nTreatments, TREAT, Act.\n  This bill empowers the Food and Drug Administration to ensure \nconsistent processes and a clear and effective pathway that will \nencourage the development of innovative treatments to benefit patients, \nparticularly subpopulations and those with rare diseases, and improve \nthe public health.\n  Without question, the FDA plays a critical role in helping to ensure \nthat new medicines are safe and effective. At the same time, by \npromoting investment in and development of innovative treatments for \nunmet medical needs, the FDA can positively influence our national \nstrategy to identify and treat serious and life-threatening diseases \nand improve the quality of life for millions of Americans.\n  In order for FDA to accomplish this goal, however, Congress needs to \ngive the agency the tools necessary to transcend existing barriers, \nreform its processes, and provide greater clarity, consistency, and \ntransparency to industry.\n  The bill accomplishes this in three ways.\n  First, it provides the FDA with the authorities and tools that are \nreflective of the agency's responsibilities and that are necessary to \nensure maximum operational excellence by updating FDA's mission \nstatement and creating a management review board.\n  Second, it advances regulatory science and innovation within FDA to \nensure that evaluations of innovative treatments, therapies, and \ndiagnostics are conducted by those who have the best available \nknowledge. To do this, the bill creates a chief innovation officer and \nchief medical policy officers, and expands participation on advisory \ncommittees by those experts most familiar with the disease being \nconsidered.\n  Finally, the bill promotes the utilization of modern scientific tools \nand methodologies to ensure patients have timely access to innovative \nproducts by creating a clinical informatics coordinator, providing more \ninformation to drug sponsors when an application has not been approved, \nand enhancing and codifying the accelerated approval process.\n  In the nearly 2 decades since the accelerated approval mechanism was \nestablished by FDA to more expeditiously approve treatments, advances \nin medical sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, and \nbioinformatics, have provided scientists with an unprecedented \nunderstanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and pathogenesis \nof disease.\n  A new generation of modern, targeted, personalized medicines is \ncurrently under development to treat serious and life-threatening \ndiseases. Some apply drug development strategies based on biomarkers or \npharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial enrichment \ntechniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such as adaptive clinical \ntrials that can be altered based on observed patient outcomes in the \ninterim.\n  In order to ensure these scientific advances are translated into \ntreatments that benefit patients, Congress should allow FDA to \nimplement a more effective process for the expedited development and \nreview of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet medical \nneeds for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n  FDA is already doing this, to some extent. However, application of \nthe accelerated approval process has been somewhat limited, largely to \nHIV and oncology drugs, and inconsistently applied to other disease \ntargets. For example, a 2011 report by the National Organization for \nRare Disorders compared the approval process for 135 non-cancer orphan \ntherapies approved by FDA from 1983 through June 2010. The report found \nthat 45 went through the conventional approval process; 32 were \napproved with some sort of administrative flexibility; and 58 were \napproved on a case-by-case flexibility process. This report illustrates \nthat while FDA does have the authority to approve these treatments with \nsome flexibility, there does not appear to be uniformity or consistency \nin employing this flexibility.\n  The TREAT Act allows FDA to tap into modern scientific advances by \nusing a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern \nscientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle, when \nappropriate, to approve treatments for patients. Employing these modern \nscientific tools may result in fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical \ntrials for the intended patient population or targeted subpopulation \nwithout compromising or altering FDA's existing high standards for the \napproval of drugs.\n  It is the patients suffering from these serious and life-threatening \ndiseases that benefit from expedited access to safe and effective \ninnovative therapies. For the 30 million Americans living with rare \ndiseases, new advances in science and medicine cannot come fast enough. \nThat is why I am proud that this bill has the support of the National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and Friends of Cancer Research. \nThe TREAT Act provides FDA with the tools needed to modernize its \nprocesses and encourage the development of innovative products to \nbenefit patients, particularly subpopulations and those with rare \ndiseases.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nbill.\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S703-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 376--COMMEMORATING THE 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n SIGNING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND RECOGNIZING THE \n   CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE SONS OF THE AMERICAN \n     REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN \n                               REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. WICKER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Slayton were selected from \n     among hundreds of other patriotic candidates to be named the \n     original ``Mercury Seven'' astronauts;\n       Whereas Project Mercury was charged with the unprecedented \n     responsibility of competing with the strides that the Soviet \n     Union was making in space exploration;\n       Whereas the United States public viewed John Glenn and the \n     Mercury Seven astronauts as men on the front line of the war \n     not only for space supremacy but also, in many minds, for the \n     survival of the United States;\n       Whereas John Glenn accurately captured the significance of \n     the time when he later wrote that ``the world was at the door \n     of a new age, and we were the people who had been chosen to \n     take the first steps across the threshold'';\n       Whereas the Project Mercury astronauts trained for their \n     manned space flight missions in the Multi-Axis Space Training \n     Inertial Facility at NASA's Research Center in Cleveland, \n     Ohio;\n       Whereas Alan Shepard was chosen to pilot the first manned \n     Project Mercury mission on Freedom 7 on May 5, 1961, which \n     proved that the United States was capable of successfully \n     launching a person into suborbital flight;\n       Whereas Virgil Grissom was chosen to pilot the second \n     manned Project Mercury mission on Liberty Bell 7 and became \n     the second United States astronaut to achieve suborbital \n     flight on July 21, 1961;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union had successfully launched the \n     spacecrafts Lunar 2 and Lunar 3 in 1959 before successfully \n     launching and returning to Earth Major Yuri Gagarin, who \n     completed a 108-minute single orbit around the Earth in 1961;\n       Whereas John Glenn was selected from among the Project \n     Mercury astronauts to command the first United States capsule \n     to orbit the Earth;\n       Whereas John Glenn, with the help of his children Dave and \n     Lyn, named the first United States space capsule to orbit the \n     Earth  Friendship 7, re-emphasizing the peaceful intentions \n     of the United States space exploration program;\n       Whereas John Glenn trained vigorously, working through 70 \n     simulated missions and reacting to nearly 200 simulated \n     system failures, to prepare to orbit the Earth and \n     successfully complete the first manned orbital mission for \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the work that John Glenn conducted on the cockpit \n     layout, instrument panel design, and spacecraft controls in \n     the Mercury spacecraft enhanced the design of Friendship 7 \n     and the ability of an astronaut to control Friendship 7, \n     which proved useful during the mission;\n       Whereas, at 9:47 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 20, \n     1962, the Atlas 109D rocket boosters ignited and John Glenn \n     and Friendship 7 commenced liftoff at NASA's Space Center in \n     Cape Canaveral, Florida;\n       Whereas John Glenn, aboard Friendship 7, became the first \n     United States astronaut to orbit the Earth, orbiting 3 times \n     and observing 3 sunrises, 3 sunsets, and the wonder of the \n     universe in only 4 hours and 56 minutes;\n       Whereas, when John Glenn learned that the heat shield on \n     Friendship 7 had possibly become loose in orbit, compromising \n     the successful completion of the space mission, Glenn bravely \n     managed the reentry procedures and proved that a person can \n     safely and successfully complete a NASA mission;\n       Whereas John Glenn successfully completed reentry into \n     Earth, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean at 2:43 p.m. \n     Eastern Standard Time, east of Grand Turk Island at 21 \n     degrees, 25 minutes North latitude and 68 degrees, 36 minutes \n     West longitude, and was recovered by the USS Noa;\n       Whereas, in the context of the Cold War, the success of the \n     Friendship 7 flight restored the standing of the United \n     States as the leading country in the race to space against \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the completion of the inaugural orbit of the Earth \n     by John Glenn validated NASA's manned space flight mission \n     and secured the future missions of NASA's manned space \n     capsules;\n       Whereas the people of the United States heralded John Glenn \n     as the personification of heroism and dignity in an age of \n     uncertainty and fear;\n       Whereas the press later described John Glenn as a man who \n     embodied the noblest human qualities;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy echoed the belief held by \n     John Glenn that the United States space program was not\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n     just a scientific journey but also a source of inspiration \n     and pride, saying, ``our leadership in science and industry, \n     our hopes for peace and security . . . require us to solve \n     these mysteries and to solve them for the good of all men'';\n       Whereas John Glenn is a patriot and space pioneer who \n     encouraged the people of the United States to rightfully view \n     NASA as an embodiment of the persistent quest of the people \n     of the United States to expand their knowledge and explore \n     frontiers;\n       Whereas, in retirement, John and Annie Glenn continued \n     their public service by establishing the John Glenn School of \n     Public Affairs at The Ohio State University, living up to the \n     words of John Glenn, who said, ``If there is one thing I've \n     learned in my years on this planet, it's that the happiest \n     and most fulfilled people I've known are those who devoted \n     themselves to something bigger and more profound than merely \n     their own self-interest.''; and\n       Whereas, although 50 years have passed, the historic orbit \n     of John Glenn around the Earth aboard Friendship 7 remains a \n     source of pride and honor for the people of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the 50th anniversary of the landmark mission of \n     John Herschel Glenn, Jr., in piloting the first manned \n     orbital mission for the United States;\n       (2) recognizes the profound importance of the achievement \n     of John Glenn as a catalyst for space exploration and \n     scientific advancement in the United States; and\n       (3) honors the thousands of dedicated men and women of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration who worked on \n     Project Mercury and ensured the success of the Friendship 7 \n     Mercury mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S704-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 378--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CHILDREN \nSHOULD HAVE A SAFE, LOVING, NURTURING, AND PERMANENT FAMILY AND THAT IT \n IS THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES THAT FAMILY REUNIFICATION, KINSHIP \n  CARE, OR DOMESTIC AND INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION PROMOTES PERMANENCY AND \n STABILITY TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN LONG-TERM INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND \n              LONG-TERM, CONTINUALLY DISRUPTED FOSTER CARE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Grassley, \nMrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Levin, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 378\n\n       Whereas the family is the basic unit of society and \n     contributes to the emotional, financial, and material support \n     essential for the healthy growth and development of children;\n       Whereas children without a family or connections to \n     siblings and relatives or a permanent relationship with a \n     caring adult are at risk of being homeless, growing up in \n     substandard institutional care, and are vulnerable to sexual \n     and labor exploitation and abuse;\n       Whereas research has shown that children who are abandoned, \n     abused, or severely neglected can face significant risks that \n     are costly to society, including lower individual lifetime \n     earnings, poorer educational achievement, and higher \n     consumption of health services, which in turn could lead to a \n     greater risk of criminal activity and greater risk of \n     incarceration;\n       Whereas there is scientific evidence that children deprived \n     of a family, including connections with siblings, often \n     experience trauma, which can have a detrimental impact on the \n     development of a child;\n       Whereas some estimates show that there are approximately 18 \n     million children in the world who have lost both parents and \n     at least 2 million children in the world who are in \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children in the \n     United States foster-care system and 107,000 of them are \n     awaiting adoption;\n       Whereas within the current foster-care system, many \n     children are overmedicated, housed in inadequate group homes, \n     denied the ability to engage in age-appropriate activities, \n     such as afterschool activities, and often denied access to \n     their siblings or placement with a relative guardian due to \n     insufficient efforts to locate family members;\n       Whereas thousands of children who ``age out'' of the \n     foster-care system in the United States every year lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family, \n     connections with siblings and relatives, or a permanent \n     relationship with a caring adult and struggle to secure \n     affordable housing, health insurance, higher education, and \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas current governmental efforts to assist these highly \n     vulnerable children in the United States and around the world \n     do not include an effective strategy for securing a \n     protective family, connections with siblings and relatives, \n     or a permanent relationship with a caring adult for every \n     child; and\n       Whereas while there have been several bipartisan laws \n     enacted in the past several years that have made progress on \n     a number of needed child-welfare reforms, much remains to be \n     done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, \n     nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special \n     needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) affirms that all children in the world, including those \n     with special needs, deserve a safe, loving, nurturing, and \n     permanent family, connections with siblings and relatives, or \n     a permanent relationship with a caring adult;\n       (B) acknowledges that the United States Government can and \n     should do more by working with the private sector, nonprofit \n     organizations, and faith-based communities to implement cost \n     effective strategies that connect children living outside of \n     family care with a permanent, supportive family, or \n     connections with siblings and relatives, or a permanent \n     relationship with a caring adult;\n       (C) encourages States, counties, cities, and to the extent \n     appropriate, other governments to invest resources in family \n     preservation, reunification services, services to help older \n     youth transition out of care with a connection to siblings, \n     relatives or a caring adult, kinship adoption, domestic \n     adoption, and intercountry adoption and post adoption \n     strategies to ensure that more children in the United States \n     are provided with safe, loving, and permanent family \n     placements or a permanent relationship with a caring adult; \n     and\n       (D) recognizes the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Department of State for recent efforts to \n     develop a strategy for meeting the unique needs of children \n     living outside of family care;\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that children should have \n     a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family; and\n       (3) it is the policy of the United States that family \n     reunification, kinship care, or domestic and intercountry \n     adoption promotes permanency and stability to a greater \n     degree than long-term institutionalization and long-term, \n     continually disrupted foster care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S704-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S704-S705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1618.

The Attorney \n     General may file its lawsuit to enforce this title in the \n     appropriate Federal or State court. A State shall not be \n     immune under the 11th Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States from any such action in a Federal or State \n     court of competent jurisdiction.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of \n     property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the \n     Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that \n     private property shall not be taken ``for public use, without \n     just compensation''.\n       (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not \n     traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating \n     properties for State and local governments. In addition, \n     farmland and forest land owners need to have long-term \n     certainty regarding their property rights in order to make \n     the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.\n       (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building \n     blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues \n     to be one of the most important economic sectors of our \n     economy.\n       (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \n     City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to \n     the property rights of all private property owners, including \n     rural land owners.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic \n     development is a threat to agricultural and other property in \n     rural America and that the Congress should protect the \n     property rights of Americans, including those who reside in \n     rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this \n     country and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take \n     farmland and other rural property for economic development \n     threatens liberty, rural economies, and the economy of the \n     United States. The taking of farmland and rural property will \n     have a direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation \n     projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take \n     rural private property for private commercial uses will force \n     increasing numbers of activities from private property onto \n     this Nation's public lands, including its National forests, \n     National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can \n     overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the \n     enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. Americans should \n     not have to fear the government's taking their homes, farms, \n     or businesses to give to other persons.

Res. 378\n\n       Whereas the family is the basic unit of society and \n     contributes to the emotional, financial, and material support \n     essential for the healthy growth and development of children;\n       Whereas children without a family or connections to \n     siblings and relatives or a permanent relationship with a \n     caring adult are at risk of being homeless, growing up in \n     substandard institutional care, and are vulnerable to sexual \n     and labor exploitation and abuse;\n       Whereas research has shown that children who are abandoned, \n     abused, or severely neglected can face significant risks that \n     are costly to society, including lower individual lifetime \n     earnings, poorer educational achievement, and higher \n     consumption of health services, which in turn could lead to a \n     greater risk of criminal activity and greater risk of \n     incarceration;\n       Whereas there is scientific evidence that children deprived \n     of a family, including connections with siblings, often \n     experience trauma, which can have a detrimental impact on the \n     development of a child;\n       Whereas some estimates show that there are approximately 18 \n     million children in the world who have lost both parents and \n     at least 2 million children in the world who are in \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children in the \n     United States foster-care system and 107,000 of them are \n     awaiting adoption;\n       Whereas within the current foster-care system, many \n     children are overmedicated, housed in inadequate group homes, \n     denied the ability to engage in age-appropriate activities, \n     such as afterschool activities, and often denied access to \n     their siblings or placement with a relative guardian due to \n     insufficient efforts to locate family members;\n       Whereas thousands of children who ``age out'' of the \n     foster-care system in the United States every year lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family, \n     connections with siblings and relatives, or a permanent \n     relationship with a caring adult and struggle to secure \n     affordable housing, health insurance, higher education, and \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas current governmental efforts to assist these highly \n     vulnerable children in the United States and around the world \n     do not include an effective strategy for securing a \n     protective family, connections with siblings and relatives, \n     or a permanent relationship with a caring adult for every \n     child; and\n       Whereas while there have been several bipartisan laws \n     enacted in the past several years that have made progress on \n     a number of needed child-welfare reforms, much remains to be \n     done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, \n     nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special \n     needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) affirms that all children in the world, including those \n     with special needs, deserve a safe, loving, nurturing, and \n     permanent family, connections with siblings and relatives, or \n     a permanent relationship with a caring adult;\n       (B) acknowledges that the United States Government can and \n     should do more by working with the private sector, nonprofit \n     organizations, and faith-based communities to implement cost \n     effective strategies that connect children living outside of \n     family care with a permanent, supportive family, or \n     connections with siblings and relatives, or a permanent \n     relationship with a caring adult;\n       (C) encourages States, counties, cities, and to the extent \n     appropriate, other governments to invest resources in family \n     preservation, reunification services, services to help older \n     youth transition out of care with a connection to siblings, \n     relatives or a caring adult, kinship adoption, domestic \n     adoption, and intercountry adoption and post adoption \n     strategies to ensure that more children in the United States \n     are provided with safe, loving, and permanent family \n     placements or a permanent relationship with a caring adult; \n     and\n       (D) recognizes the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Department of State for recent efforts to \n     develop a strategy for meeting the unique needs of children \n     living outside of family care;\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that children should have \n     a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family; and\n       (3) it is the policy of the United States that family \n     reunification, kinship care, or domestic and intercountry \n     adoption promotes permanency and stability to a greater \n     degree than long-term institutionalization and long-term, \n     continually disrupted foster care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/15/senate-section/article/S803-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEASURE READ THE 1ST TIME--S. 2111\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
