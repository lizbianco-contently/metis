Mr. President, this afternoon the families of Newtown, CT, \nare burying two 6-year-old boys--Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto. Noah \nturned 6 last month. Even though he was only 6, Jack was a New York \nGiants fan.\n  In the days to come, many of their classmates will also be laid to \nrest--the victims of a tragedy too terrible to comprehend. Twenty \nlittle girls and boys, twenty tiny daughters and sons, sisters and \nbrothers, friends and playmates, twenty children who will never grow up \nto learn to drive, go on a first date or graduate from high school, \ntwenty 6- and 7-year-olds who will never have the chance to fall in \nlove, get married or have children of their own: Noah and Jack, \nCharlotte, Daniel, Olivia, Josephine, Ana, Dylan, Madeline, Catherine, \nChase, Avielle, Jesse, Grace, Emilie, Caroline, Jessica, Benjamin, \nAllison, and James.\n  No words of condolence could possibly ease the pain of families who \nlost cherished little children, but I hope it is some small comfort \nthat the entire Nation mourns with them. My heart and warm wishes go \nout to all those affected by Friday's massacre. My thoughts are with \nthe students and faculty of Sandy Hook who witnessed such unspeakable \nviolence.\n  Newtown and the Nation have seen great evil. We have also seen \nincredible bravery.\n  In her final act on Earth, 27-year-old Victoria Soto hid the children \nof her first grade class in closets and cabinets and then sacrificed \nherself to save them.\n  Dawn Hochsprung, the principal, forcibly--as the word goes--attacked \nthe assailant, and he killed her.\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\n  Mary Sherlach, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino, and Anne Marie Murphy \nalso died trying to safeguard the children in their care.\n  These six educators devoted their lives to teaching Newtown's \nchildren how to read, how to add and subtract, and how to be good boys \nand girls. They gave their lives to keep these children safe. They are \na source of hope in a hopeless situation.\n  I commend the teachers of Sandy Hook Elementary who didn't hesitate \nwhen they saw danger coming. Some barricaded their students inside \nclassrooms or hid them in closets, preventing an even greater loss of \nlife.\n  I thank the first responders who rushed into the school, despite the \ndanger and horrors around them, knowing they had a job to do.\n  It is hard to comprehend this type of tragedy, let alone recover from \nit. But in the words of Helen Keller: ``Although the world is full of \nsuffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.''\n  As the families of Newtown mourn, all America mourns with them, and \nwe will stand with them as they overcome this suffering and begin the \nhealing process.\n  Part of the healing process will require Congress to examine what can \nbe done to prevent more tragedies such as the ones in Newtown, CT; \nAurora, CO; Oak Creek, WI; and Portland, OR. These are fairly recent.\n  As President Obama said last night, no one law can erase evil. No \npolicy can prevent a determined madman from committing a senseless act \nof violence. But we need to accept the reality that we are not doing \nenough to protect our citizens.\n  In the coming days and weeks, we will engage in a meaningful \nconversation and thoughtful debate about how to change laws and culture \nthat allows this violence to continue to grow. We have no greater \nresponsibility than keeping safe our most vulnerable and our most \nprecious resource--our children. Every idea should be on the table as \nwe discuss how best to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8050-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE SANDY\n\n  Mr. REID.

I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in moving quickly \nto send aid to those affected by Sandy as they continue to recover and \nrebuild.\n  The Senate must move swiftly to approve the supplemental disaster act \nand act to give the intelligence community the tools it needs to keep \nour Nation safe before the Christmas holiday. In short, before we leave \nfor Christmas, we are going to have to finish our work on Sandy and \nFISA. They are both extremely important and they have to be completed. \nSo everyone should understand we have that to do. We will see if \nanything changes, but it appears we are going to be coming back the day \nafter Christmas to complete work on the fiscal cliff and a few other \nleftover items.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8050-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to start by extending my deepest \nsympathies to the families of the victims of Friday's massacre and to \nthe whole community and to thank the first responders and all those who \nare helping in the aftermath of this darkest of tragedies.\n  Three days after the horrors of Newtown, we are all still reeling \nfrom what happened. Anytime there is a shooting such as this, we are \ncrushed with sorrow. But there is no escaping the fact that the \nmassacre at Sandy Hook Elementary stands out for its awfulness. The \nmurder of so many little children and the adults who tried to save them \ndoesn't just break our hearts, it shatters them.\n  The last few days have been searing for all of us, and the days ahead \nwill be too. Over the weekend, we began to see the faces of the \nchildren and to hear their stories.\n  One parent, Robbie Parker, stood in front of the cameras on Saturday \nand shared with the Nation an impromptu eulogy of his 6-year-old \ndaughter Emilie. It was a remarkable moment. Emilie was bright and \ncreative and very loving, he said, and we marveled at his courage. Now \nthe funerals--10 of them this week in 1 church alone.\n  It has been said many times that no words are adequate to lift the \nagony of a parent such as Robbie Parker. What happened in Newtown on \nFriday is something for which no parent of a young child could ever \nprepare. But I think President Obama spoke for all of us in the very \nmoving meditation he offered last night on the singularity of parental \nlove.\n  There is literally nothing we wouldn't do for our kids and that is \none of the things that makes this massacre so terrible and which makes \nthe stories of courage we have heard so inspiring; the young teacher \nwho stood between the gunman and her students and lost her life in the \nprocess; the principal and the school psychologist who sprang into \naction and gave their lives too. As the President said, these luminous \nacts of self-sacrificing love are the moments that will define this \ntragedy in the years ahead because the heroism and the courage we never \nfail to see in the midst of tragedies such as this become the starting \npoints of something better and more lasting than the vagaries of this \nlife. They give us the hope we need in the face of so much evil and \nsorrow.\n  We stand with the people of Newtown today and in the days ahead. We \ncan do nothing to lessen their anguish, but we can let them know we \nmourn with them, that we share a tiny part of the burden in our own \nhearts, and that we will lift the victims and their families and the \nentire community in prayer.\n  The Scripture says that while ``now we only know in part, in the life \nto come we shall know, even as we are known.''\n  Scripture also says that in that day \n``. . . every tear will be wiped away, because there will be no more \ndeath, or sorrow, or crying, or pain, for the former things will have \npassed away.''\n  May the people of Newtown and all Americans be consoled by this \ncertain hope. May their burdens be lightened by the loving care of \ntheir neighbors and friends and even strangers in the days and weeks \nahead. May this terrible tragedy prompt all of us to cherish the lives \nwe have been given, our family members and friends and all who surround \nus in our daily tasks.\n  This is no lasting city, we know. May we pass through it with a \nlittle more gratitude and with a firmer determination to live the kind \nof lives we have been called to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8050-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart at the \nsenseless tragedy in Newtown, CT, that took place this Friday. We are \nall shaken\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\nfrom that day, and we ask ourselves: Why? How could this happen in \nAmerica? We grope for answers and I hope we will find them.\n  Today I join, first with every American, in expressing our deep and \nabiding grief as a Nation and our deepest, most heartfelt condolences \nto the families of the victims. I am the father of two. As a father of \ntwo, this strikes painfully close to my heart, and painfully close to \nthe heart of every parent. There is no greater sorrow, no deeper pain \nthan the enormous grief these families are suffering for those 20 \ninnocent children, 6 teachers, and school employees and their families; \nand no parent--no parent--should ever have to bear the unspeakable pain \nof losing a child, especially to this type of tragedy.\n  All too often I have come to this floor having to say those same \nwords--one tragedy after another, time and time again, having to stand \nhere and say that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of \nanother tragedy involving gun violence, semiautomatic weapons, high-\ncapacity clips, and the families of those victims who have lost loved \nones to senseless, sick gun violence.\n  But this time we are talking about children--elementary \nschoolchildren--the youngest, most innocent among us taken away. Enough \nis enough.\n  Matthew 18 says:\n\n       At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying ``Who is \n     the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?'' And calling to him a \n     child, he put him in the midst of them and said, ``Truly, I \n     say to you, unless you turn and become like the children, you \n     will never enter the kingdom of heaven . . . ''\n\n  The children have entered the kingdom of heaven today. I hope we \nhonor them and their memory in what we do now to end the violence. Let \nNewton finally be the turning point when we are all willing to come \ntogether and do what is right. As we pray for the victims, let us \ncommit ourselves as a Nation to a long overdue debate about violence \nand guns and how we deal with those who suffer mental illnesses in our \nsociety, and let us finally pass commonsense gun laws. No more \npolitics; no more excuses. We cannot allow this sort of senseless \nviolence to continue. We need a national debate about the role of \nfirearms in our society, we need to address mental health issues, and \nwe need to act immediately.\n  This shooter had hundreds of rounds of ammunition--reportedly enough \nto kill everyone in the school--and had it not been for the brave first \nresponders, there could have been even more tragic killings on Friday. \nThese high-capacity clips must be outlawed. I don't believe there is \nany reason why a law-abiding citizen would need the capability to shoot \nmultiple rounds like a street sweeper.\n  Words cannot express my sadness that another shooter used a weapon \nthat has no legitimate purpose, from my perspective, in a civilized \nsociety, using high-capacity 30-round clips that defy any reasonable \nuse. And there are even greater capacity clips than this.\n  I don't understand why the same type of weapon used by the DC sniper \nis still readily available, and I don't understand how we can see the \nsame high-capacity clips used over and over by maniacal murderers \nduring these strategies and not act.\n  After Tucson, Aurora, and now Newtown, we need to finally do \nsomething about these dangerous clips. We need to make sure nobody with \na criminal record or mental illness can purchase a firearm, and that \nmeans we need a comprehensive, mandatory background check system. It is \nno use that my State of New Jersey has some of the toughest laws but \nthen over a third of the guns that come into our State and commit an \nact are from outside our State.\n  I have cosponsored legislation to outlaw high-capacity clips, improve \nour background checks, and I have supported and helped pass the \noriginal assault weapons ban, and I will support an assault weapons ban \nthis next year as I have in the past.\n  This doesn't need to be a political debate. This is about keeping \nlittle children safe in their first-grade classroom. I am for \nreasonable use of guns, but first and foremost I am for protecting our \nchildren, our teachers, our families. That is our No. 1 responsibility. \nIf we can't do that, shame on us.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his comments.\n  The Presiding Officer and I and others have discussed how we felt \nthis weekend. I can't think of anything that has more emotionally \nroiled the Nation. There have been few such events in my lifetime. All \nof us feel the senseless killings last Friday in Newtown, CT, made no \nsense--just hit everybody. If we feel so deeply, we can't begin to \nimagine how the families must feel--the families, the parents of the \nchildren, the siblings or spouses of the adults killed. We pick up the \npaper, turn on the radio, listen to the television, and there is one \nmore wrenching story after another.\n  In my family, and I know in families from coast to coast, parents \ncalled their children. Brothers called sisters. Neighbors reached out \nto neighbors. We huddled with two of our three children, soon to be \nwith a third one in Vermont, hugged our grandchildren. Over the weekend \nand again today, in discussions in churches, synagogues, houses of \nworship, on the sidewalk, in the grocery line, at the worksite and in \nour offices, we have all struggled for words to describe our feelings \nof shock and our feelings of immeasurable sadness.\n  I think we can all agree no matter what our political background, no \nmatter what part of the country we come from, that last night President \nObama gave voice--our voice, 325 million Americans gave voice to let \nthese stricken families know how deeply we wanted to help relieve their \nsuffering as we share their grief. It was a time when the President can \nand should and did speak for the whole Nation.\n  But there are so many questions about this unspeakable tragedy that \nhave yet to be answered. The President has pointed out it is unlikely \nany single step or package of steps or this move or that move can erase \nthe chance of such a tragedy happening again. We know it could have \neven been worse if the brave first responders hadn't rushed into the \nschool even though they knew they might be facing death themselves. We \nknow that sometimes things are beyond our understanding. We know \nsituations vary widely from State to State and community to community. \nBut whether it is in the State of Connecticut or, God forbid, in the \nState of the Presiding Officer or my State, we all share the \nresponsibility of searching for an answer not just for the people of \nConnecticut but for people throughout the United States, and some can \nhonestly say the people throughout the world who look to the United \nStates as a bastion of freedom, of democracy.\n  I think Congress can and should be part of this national discussion \nin the search for answers. We will come back into a new session in a \nfew weeks. The Judiciary Committee will be holding a hearing very early \nin the next congressional session to help in the search for \nunderstanding and answers. I know all of us will take part in that no \nmatter what our feelings might be.\n  There are other committees also that have different types of \njurisdiction and will have to take part in this national discussion. It \nisn't a matter of just guns--which is a significant part of this, of \ncourse--it is the matter of mental illness; it is a matter of how we \nrun our educational facilities. All of these things should be talked \nabout. If there are practical and sensible and workable answers to \nprevent such unspeakable tragedy, we should make the effort to find \nthem and then we should have the courage, each and every one of us, to \nvote for those steps.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8051-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, I have introduced \nan emergency supplemental and disaster aid bill. This is to respond to \nthe devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy.\n  The eyes, ears, and hopes of tens of millions of our fellow Americans \nwho were in this storm's path are now trained upon the U.S. Senate. And \nwith us in this effort, as well, is the good will of the entire Nation.\n  I say that because in my almost 38 years here, I have been on this \nfloor time and time again--different Presidents, sometimes in the \nmajority, sometimes in the minority--where there has been devastation \nin different parts of this country, and in every single instance--every \nsingle instance--the Senate has come together to provide relief to \nthose hit by hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, earthquakes, or anything \nelse.\n  Superstorm Sandy was remarkable, and I use that in the broadest sense \nof the word. It hit the east coast 7 weeks ago. What it did is it \nswelled to become the largest Atlantic hurricane in history. It was \nhundreds of miles wide, much wider than my own State of Vermont. Its \nreach was greater than even that of Hurricane Katrina along the gulf \ncoast.\n  Sandy claimed the lives of more than 120 of our fellow Americans. It \ndestroyed more than 340,000 homes and 200,000 businesses. More than 8.5 \nmillion families were without power in 15 States and the District of \nColumbia.\n  The scale of the damage is almost hard to fathom. I remember seeing \nthe damage caused by Irene last year, including the devastation from \nwhich my home State of Vermont is still recovering. Because of my \ninvolvement in that, I am acutely aware of the need for a rapid and \nunified response from Federal, State, and local authorities to meet the \nneeds of so many of our fellow American citizens.\n  As of last week, the Homeland Security Subcommittee reports that the \nFederal Government has already provided over $2.7 billion in relief \nthrough FEMA, the Small Business Administration, the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health \nand Human Services, and other agencies. As of today, 12 States have \nactive major disaster or emergency declarations as a result of Sandy, \nand there is no question it is going to cost billions to rebuild these \ndevastated communities.\n  Anybody who has seen them knows they are devastated. It is a word \nthat we sometimes use too easily but appropriate when you have a whole \ndowntown, block after block, homes that people have lived in sometimes \nfor generations--it was their parents' home or their grandparents' \nhome--and now it is kindling wood.\n  The Obama administration has requested money for recovery and \nrepairs--just as every administration in the past has, Republican and \nDemocratic alike--they have requested $60.4 billion for recovery and \nrepairs, and the amendment we consider today meets that request. But we \nhave not simply rubberstamped the request. The Appropriations \nCommittee, working with the Senators from all the States that have been \nhit so hard, has made numerous changes to ensure that the dollars put \ninto this response are used as effectively and efficiently as can be.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I know the budget \nconstraints we are facing, and the Appropriations Committee has done \nits best to allocate the funds in such a way that States will have the \nflexibility required to respond to the individual needs of their \ncitizens, while at the same time reducing the possibility for waste, \nfraud, or abuse.\n  Senator Landrieu, who is on the floor, is the chair of the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee. Well, this is a Senator who is no stranger to \ntackling the incredible challenges of responding to and recovering from \nnatural disasters of this scale. I know she is going to speak in a \nshort while. We all know Louisiana is still rebuilding from the \ncatastrophes of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and Senator Landrieu--both \nas an individual Senator and from her position as chair--has worked \ntirelessly ever since to help her State and others recovering from \nstorms and other calamities. I know how hard she works because she \nstepped in to help Vermont when we were in a similar situation last \nyear. It ia an example, I might say, of how even States that are not \nhurt help those that are. It has always been our tradition in the \nSenate. In this supplemental, she has worked to incorporate that \nexperience into vital emergency funding for FEMA and other disaster \nrelief programs.\n  Since the supplemental we reconsider today contains funding that will \nhelp millions of Americans recover from this terrible storm, I want to \nhighlight a few specifics.\n  We include $10.8 billion in emergency relief for public \ntransportation systems. This is not a rural area. It is not like rural \nVermont. We understand that public transportation, especially in this \narea, is necessary for millions of Americans--millions--to function day \nby day. It is especially vital around New York City. The subway and bus \nsystems in New York and New Jersey allow people to get to work and \nstudents to go to school. The resources in this supplemental will help \npay for the repair and restoration of some of the most heavily used \npublic transportation systems in the country. Just as importantly, it \nis going to help fund projects to help public transportation prepare \nfor and resist future storms. Because as much as we like to think there \nwill be no future storms, every one of us knows there will be future \nstorms.\n  The supplemental recommends $812 million for the Small Business \nAdministration. Every one of us knows small businesses are essential to \nthe American economy. They are responsible for employing about half of \nall workers in America. So this amount will help fund the SBA's \ndisaster loan program, helping small local businesses in recovering \nfrom physical damage to their storefront operations, as well as in \nrecovering from economic losses suffered when they had to close their \ndoors during Hurricane Sandy.\n  We have seen the devastation to iconic neighborhoods and places such \nas the Jersey shore or Staten Island or Long Island--neighborhoods that \nwere destroyed by the storm or by the fires that followed. So many of \nthe businesses destroyed in these communities are mom-and-pop \noperations--small businesses like the one my mother and father ran--and \nthey simply cannot afford to reopen without Federal disaster \nassistance. They need the loans, but, more importantly, they need the \nloans\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nnow--not 6 months from now. I point out especially, a number of these \nare shops that make their living during the summer beach season. They \nwant to be able to open by Memorial Day. I can tell you, as one who has \nseen how long it takes to reopen after a disaster like this, Memorial \nDay is tomorrow for these people. They need the loans today.\n  We have recommended $500 million for the Administration for Children \nand Families Social Services Block Grant to be used primarily for \nchildcare services, for reopening damaged childcare facilities, but \nalso--and we have to understand how important this is--for mental \nhealth services for both children and adults who have gone through this \ndisaster and probably have seen members of their family lose their \nlives.\n  Another $100 million will pay for repairs to Head Start facilities \naffected by Hurricane Sandy. These provide essential education and \nhealth services to low-income, prekindergarten children. And we all \nknow that interruptions in programs such as these are detrimental to \nthe development of the children but also the families they serve. So we \ncannot wait to rebuild these centers, and we cannot wait to provide \nessential health care services to those who have lost so much. If you \nhave a health need, we cannot say: Well, we will get back to you in a \nfew months. Your health need is today.\n  I have heard two arguments against moving to the emergency \nsupplemental as quickly as possible. I have found them surprising. The \nfirst is that the cost of this bill should be offset with cuts to other \nprograms. This is the same argument we heard last year when we needed \nemergency funding to respond to Hurricane Irene. Well, it made no sense \na year ago. It makes no sense today. It will make no sense tomorrow. \nThe suggestion that we should cut funding from base budgets of \ndepartments and agencies that are carrying out the essential functions \nof our government in order to pay for an unanticipated natural \ndisaster--that is absurd. Mandating offsets means cutting funding from \nlaw enforcement to pay for replacing a vital roadway destroyed by \nSandy. It means cutting funding for education through Head Start in \norder to provide clean drinking water to those who have been left with \nnothing in the wake of Sandy. The point is obvious: These are \nemergencies. That is why they are called emergencies. We do not do \noffsets to pay for emergencies.\n  I think of what Chairman Inouye has said. He has said it so many \ntimes, whether with Republican or Democratic administrations: ``It has \nlong been the tradition of the Congress to approve disaster assistance \nwithout need for offset.''\n  And then he continued:\n\n       Others will likely come to the Senate floor to challenge \n     that remark . . . However, in the case of disaster \n     assistance, I challenge my colleagues to review all \n     Appropriations bills for the past decade and find a single \n     instance where the Committee paid for disasters by rescinding \n     funds from other programs.\n\n  Then Chairman Inouye concluded with the obvious:\n\n       No one would find an example, because quite simply there \n     aren't any.\n\n  Well, he is right. The President requested and the committee is \nrecommending $60.4 billion to respond to this storm. The total budget \nauthority for nondefense spending is about $500 billion a year. Using \nthe logic that all emergency spending should be offset would cut the \ndiscretionary spending needs--if we see seven more disasters, well then \nI guess we eliminate every single agency, department, and program \nexcept the Pentagon. Come on. Is that what this country is about? Some \nmay think that is a good idea--eliminate all government. We would not \nhave any road to drive on to go state our beliefs. The rest of America \ndisagrees.\n  I have also heard discussion of taking a downpayment approach to the \nsupplemental--do a little and come back next year. Well, that sounds \nfamiliar. I remember hearing a lot of it last year. Talk to the person \nwhose house has been destroyed. It is a week before the Christmas \nseason. It is getting cold. Tell them that we Senators--it is true, we \nall live in comfortable homes. We work in a place that has not been \ntouched--think you should wait and come back later next year.\n  I would defy any Member of this body to say that directly to one of \nthe firefighters who saw their home destroyed or the senior citizen who \nsaw their home destroyed or the person who has worked all their life to \nbuild up their business and saw it destroyed. No. They want to recover \nnow, not when a Congress that has not been known to move very rapidly \nof late gets around to doing something for them.\n  After all, we are asking homeowners to rebuild, saying go back and \nprovide their own place to live. We are asking businesses to reinvest \nso they can hire people who are out of work. They need the assurance \nthat we are going to do our part. You cannot just say: Put your money \nup now, and maybe, just maybe when we start talking about all of these \nthings that have no bearing on what you are facing, we might come \nthrough 6 months from now and we might not.\n  Come on. That is not how we want to encourage rebuilding. Homeowners \nand businesses in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and \nelsewhere need to know that the funding will be there to complete the \nrebuilding of public infrastructure. Only the Federal Government has \nthe resources to make this happen.\n  The President's request is comprehensive. And we know the needs to \nrecover from Superstorm Sandy. Now, we stood up, Democrats and \nRepublicans together, to respond to disasters in the past. We have to \ndo the same now.\n  When Irene--then a tropical storm--hit Vermont last year, no one \ncould have anticipated the devastation we saw: roads washed away, \nbridges collapsed, communities cut off because all entrances and exits \nfor the community were destroyed, bridges that had been there from the \ntime I was born--I remember them as a child, had always been there, \nwere there when my parents were living there, were there when my \ngrandparents were living there--gone in a matter of minutes. Vermonters \nknow that when one of us is hurting, all of us are hurting. Vermont \nappreciated the assistance from other States near and far and from the \nFederal Government.\n  New Jersey, New York, and other States hit by this superstorm are now \ndepending on us. So let's do what is right. There is no need for delay. \nChristmas is coming. Thousands of families have lost everything. Their \nhope, their future is in our hands. They need our help. They deserve \nour help. We are Americans. We come together to help. So let's do it.\n  I will speak further, but I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew York. He and I have discussed this. He has seen more. As bad as \nIrene was in Vermont, the number of businesses and homes destroyed \npales in comparison to what he has seen in his State and the \nneighboring States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank our chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and ranking Democrat on the Appropriations \nCommittee for his leadership, his caring, his concern, and his \nexpertise. The people of New York are very grateful to the Senator from \nVermont for his concern and caring. We thank him for that very much.\n  Today we begin debate on one of the most momentous proposals to \neffect New York's future that we have ever debated, a proposal equal in \nmagnitude and importance to the debate about aid to New York after the \nhorrible attacks on our city on 9/11. I must say the debate is off to a \ngood start. Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have shown \ntremendous concern. Leader Reid has agreed to allow amendments so that \nthose in this Chamber, particularly those on the other side, can make \nmodifications. Leader McConnell and the Republican minority have not \ninsisted on a motion to proceed. So we are beginning this bill in very \nauspicious way, in a way that people think the Senate should work, not \none side blocking amendments and not the other side blocking the bill. \nI hope it can lead to an equally auspicious result.\n  I rise today to discuss the greatest natural disaster in the history \nof my State and the importance of passing\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nthe President's request--the President's full request for supplemental \ndisaster aid.\n  As you know, Mr. President, Superstorm Sandy was a catastrophic shock \nto the coastline of the Northeastern United States. In the blink of an \neye, the Atlantic Ocean turned from our greatest natural resource into \na nightmarish monster, swallowing whole communities in its path. The \nbeating heart for many parts of the Nation's economy, New York City, \nwas paralyzed for days, and parts are paralyzed to this moment. Whole \nneighborhoods, from Long Bench, NY, to Long Beach Island, NJ, were \nripped from their foundations and washed away. I saw whole communities \nwhere almost every house suffered severe damage, where the water came \nin, because of the geography, from the north and south and sometimes \nfrom the north, the south, and the west. I saw the devastation. It was \nincredible. You know that when God's hand strikes, those who are \naffected are usually severely hurt--a tornado, a forest fire, a flood, \na hurricane.\n  What was incredible about this disaster was not the depth of it--we \nhave always seen the depth of tragedies from natural disasters with our \nconstituents--but it was the combination of the depth and the breadth. \nIt was not just one small area in which a tornado, say, lighted down \nand then left; it was a huge swath of territory, all flooded by a \nperfect storm, a huge nor'easter that combined with a tropical storm, a \nfull Moon, and a high tide.\n  Experts had said the East River, the Hudson River, Great South Bay \nwould never rise--never--more than 11 feet above its previous record, \nand in place after place that record was exceeded, unfortunately, with \nterrible, tragic consequences to that occurrence.\n  The tragic storm was an unfortunate wake-up call for New York and the \nrest of the country that we need to do much more at the Federal level, \nthe State level, and the local level to prepare, protect, and fortify \nour vulnerable infrastructure from future storm surge activity. Our \nregion suffered, according to mainstream estimates, nearly $100 billion \nworth of damage. That is just the damage that has been measured up to \nnow. We are going to see future damage that has not yet been uncovered, \nestimated, or even found.\n  Governors Cuomo and Christie requested about $80 billion of recovery \nand mitigation funds. President Obama called for approximately $60 \nbillion. He scrubbed the proposals of our Governors. OMB was very \ncareful. They spent about a week looking over the proposals and tried \nto narrow it down to the most essential and most immediate needs. Our \ndelegation--Democrats and Republicans from the New York-New Jersey \narea--believes that $60 billion is a fair starting point.\n  The damage numbers are mind-blowing. Here are a few examples. This is \nfrom New York alone. New Jersey received almost as much damage as New \nYork. Transportation: $7.3 billion. Our subway system, which is an \namazing system--it brings 3\\1/2\\ million people on and off Manhattan \nevery day--the subway and railroad system was devastated. Much of it \nwas built over 100 years ago. There was no thought of such floods, and \nthe system was unprotected. Housing: $9.6 billion. Mr. President, \n305,000 homes, according to the Governor's estimate, have already \napplied for insurance in New York alone.\n  My good colleague from Louisiana is here. She has been invaluable in \nguiding us, helping us, and being at our side. She has been through \nthis. She knows better than any other Member of this Chamber, I \ndaresay, what this kind of disaster can do, but more importantly for \nus, she knows how to deal with these problems because she has been \nthrough it. She is recommending to us to keep the places where the \nFederal response worked and modify the responses in places where the \nFederal response did not. That has been invaluable. I take off my hat. \nI speak on behalf of all of us in the northeast area to the Senator, \nthe chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Anyway, in Katrina about 270,000 homes received that type of damage, \nso we have many more homes damaged, gone, flooded.\n  This is a picture, by the way, of the 86th Street subway, way up in \nManhattan, far away from the points of New York Harbor. But there was \nso much flooding--look at it. Remember, this water is saltwater. It \ncorrodes every signal, every light. If it were freshwater, the damage \nfrom this storm would have been a lot less. There it is, 86th Street.\n  I mentioned that homes were destroyed. Here are two examples. This is \na house on Staten Island. Whole communities like Midland Beach were \ntotally upended. Water was 6, 7, 8, 10 feet high. It did not just go in \n1 street but 10 streets, the powers of the ocean were such. Home after \nhome looked like this. It is incredible. I have held these homeowners \nin my arms--children, women, grown men who were distraught about the \nfuture. Who can blame them?\n  Here is another. In some places, because the saltwater created fire \nin the electrical systems of the houses, whole communities were knocked \nout. In Breezy Point, 101 homes burned to the ground amidst the rain \nand the wind because the water systems--when the electricity failed, \nthe firefighters could not pump, and the fires spread from house to \nhouse to house.\n  There is a shrine here. It is a statue of the Virgin Mary. It is the \nonly thing left in this whole area. Now people come and place flowers \nand pray and meditate by that statue.\n  Incidentally, one of the homes that was destroyed was that of our \nCongress Member, Congressman Turner of Brooklyn and Queens, Republican \nof Brooklyn and Queens, whose home was destroyed out in Breezy Point.\n  Utilities were $1.5 billion. Many of our utilities were outdated, no \nquestion. They had no way to communicate. But even if they weren't, \nbecause their power lines are above ground, not below, they suffered \nhuge damage, as did people.\n  Four major hospitals are still closed--thousands of beds. They range \nfrom Long Beach Hospital, a hospital that serves a local community that \nis right on the waterfront, to NYU, New York University Hospital, which \nis one of the great research and teaching facilities in America. It \nalone lost over $1 billion of equipment.\n  They were told by the companies that make their machinery--the radio \ncoaxial tomography, the MRIs--to put them in the basement because these \nmachines have to be carefully calibrated given the sea level and the \nslight slant of the floor. They were all washed away, $1 billion of \nmachinery, not to mention decades of research.\n  I visited--I think they call it the vivarium. It is where the animals \nare that they have done genetic experiments on. The white mice that \nthey test for generation after generation were wiped out.\n  Government and schools were $2 billion. Government buildings were \ndestroyed. I think we have over 40 schools in New York City that were \ndestroyed, mostly by the water. Roads, bridges, you name it--the \ndevastation is everywhere. It is wide, and it is deep.\n  So with this kind of devastation, even a large area such as New York \ncannot handle it on its own. Fortunately, we have had a wisdom here in \nthis government for close to a century; that is, when nature strikes, \nwhen the hand of God comes down on Earth and creates the kind of damage \nthat man can't comprehend, no locality can handle it on its own, then \nthe Federal Government steps in, which means the country as a whole \nsteps in. When there were hurricanes in Louisiana and Mississippi, the \nwhole country stepped in. We said: We know this is too much for you to \nhandle alone. When there were forest fires out west, the whole country \nstepped in, saying: We know you can't handle this kind of devastation \non your own. When there was flooding in the Missouri and Mississippi \nvalleys, the Federal Government came in.\n  We in New York--hundreds of millions--over the decades, probably \nbillions of our tax dollars went to help these regions, and I never \nheard any complaints about it. We are one Nation. When one part of our \nNation suffers, we all suffer, particularly in these days of an \ninterrelated economy. New York buys billions of dollars of products \nfrom New Jersey and the rest of the country, and so people did it.\n  Now, of course, the devastation has hit us, and we know our \ncolleagues will stand by us as we have stood by them. We know they will \ngive a careful look\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nto our proposal, but they will not deliberately put barriers in the way \nbecause they don't want to treat New York differently. They don't want \nto treat New Jersey differently than they treated the others.\n  We have heard three questions about this package, and the questions \nare these:\n  First, should we have offsets to the monies that are proposed here?\n  Now, we have not done that in the long history of disasters, for a \ngood reason. You will never get the disaster money if you have to pit \nan existing Federal program against disaster money. We have always said \nthat disaster is treated separately, and we would hope that would \ncontinue. It would not be fair or right to do this now. I would say to \nmy colleagues, if we begin a pattern of offsetting now--there was some \nattempt to do it with Irene, but in a bipartisan way we rejected that \nin this body. If your whole area is hit next and you have to sit there \nand wait while Congress fights over offsets, what are you going to do? \nIt would be an awful precedent to start that.\n  Second, we have heard: Why--what is this mitigation?\n  Some people have used the word ``stimulus'' to be equal to \n``mitigation.'' The two words are totally different. As I understand \nstimulus, in the stimulus bill there was a percentage of programs that \nwere put in that had nothing do with the stimulus, and that was \nprobably a mistake. I don't think it was a large percentage of the \nstimulus, but it sure stuck in people's minds.\n  Any proposal that has nothing to do with a storm, a natural disaster, \nshouldn't be in this proposal. We agree to that. We believe OMB has \nscrubbed it, so there is no stimulus-type money here. There is \nmitigation money. What does mitigation mean? Mitigation means, quite \nfrankly, that you rebuild but you rebuild in such a way that if, God \nforbid, there is another storm, you don't suffer the same damage. You \ndon't put all those machines in the basement of NYU again; you move \nthem up to the third floor even if it costs a little more. You don't \nsimply rebuild the South Street subway station the exact same way; you \nput in either steel doors or those air bag-type things so that if, God \nforbid, another flood comes, the station won't be flooded and we won't \nhave to spend the money all over again. Mitigation means that if the \ndunes are wiped out across the Rockaways and Long Beach, you build them \nup. You probably build them up a little higher so the damage--God \nforbid another storm comes--won't be as great and the expense won't be \nas great. We have always done mitigation. It has always been part of \nour bill.\n  I am glad to see my good friend from Mississippi here, who has been \nof such help and encouragement to us. All of us in New York and New \nJersey so appreciate his wise, quiet, kind, and intelligent counsel.\n  I remember there was a proposal on the floor after Katrina. There was \na railroad that was very close to the shore. Yes, it would have cost \nmore money to rebuild the railroad a distance inland. I don't remember \nhow much. I think it was about a mile inland, and it cost about $700 \nmillion more to do. Senator Cochran and Senator Lott made the argument \non the floor, and it made sense to me, and I voted for it. I think all \nof us in the Northeast did. So mitigation makes sense.\n  The third argument we have heard, which is probably the one gaining \nthe most weight now, is let's just spend a year of this money now, and \nwe will see what happens later.\n  That would be nice, but there are three things wrong with that. \nFirst, sort of esoteric--it is the way we budget. We have outlays, and \nwe have budget authority. While the outlays may not be great for this \nyear because not all the money will be spent, we have always had budget \nauthority that recognizes that things take more than a year to build. \nTo cut back on the budget authority, not the outlays, would be against \nthe way we budget around here and a new double standard, I would think, \nthat would tie us up in knots in the future.\n  The second argument: How can you build a year at a time when many of \nthese projects take more than a year to design, plan, and construct?\n  We have to redo the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel--the largest underwater \ntunnel in the world, certainly in the country. Are we going to say: We \nwill give you enough money to build a quarter of it today, and then \ncome back next year and see if we should build a second quarter. No \nbusiness would work that way. No government should work that way. Most \nof these projects need to begin now but may take more than a year. To \nsay we are only giving money for the year doesn't make much sense. That \nis the second argument against this 1-year policy.\n  Third is the way FEMA and many of these agencies work. They don't \nreimburse you ahead of time. You don't submit a proposal and say: My \nhouse has $80,000 worth of damage. Send me the money, FEMA, and then I \nwill hire a contractor and pay for it.\n  No, no. What FEMA tells the government, individuals, small \nbusinesses--it says: You go contract it. We will approve that that is \nactually the money that was needed due to the storm, and then we will \npay you.\n  So if we don't have the money there now, how can we expect businesses \nand homeowners and governments to outlay billions of dollars that are \nneeded and hope that maybe next year, we might allocate some money? It \nwill at best dramatically slow down the growth or the rebuilding we \ndesperately need, and it could halt it in its tracks.\n  There has been a CBO study that says that only a small amount of the \nmoney will be paid for now. But the CBO study, like many things CBO \ndoes--we all know this--was based on very narrow assumptions that don't \napply. Let me give an example. There is $17 billion of CDBG money \nrequested. That is where most of the help is. Senator Cochran and \nSenator Landrieu learned this when they had their problems. It goes for \nthe housing and some of the other things, and it gives a little \nflexibility to the governments that they need--not a wide berth but a \nlittle more flexibility.\n  CBO said that only $75 million of it would be spent this year. Well, \nthat was based on an old program that existed during Katrina. It was \nbased on the fact that many of those who were hurt in the area, \nparticularly in New Orleans, fled, and it took them months and months \nto even come back, let alone begin building homes. It was based not on \nthe new legislation that has been proposed--which allows building to \noccur quickly and more easily based on some of the recommendations of \nmy colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu--but on the old stuff.\n  CBO said we will only spend, I believe it is $1.8 billion on \ntransportation this year. The MTA has already bonded for $4.6 billion \nin repairs they need to make over the next 2 years.\n  It makes no sense, and I think there is a chart here--it says ``point \nto chart,'' but there is none, so I would point to the atmosphere. It \njust didn't match up to what the MTA's needs were. When I told the MTA \nwhat the CBO said, they said, ``What planet are they on?'' The FTA is \nnow going to be the spend-out program. That was a recommendation made \nby the folks from the Gulf States after Katrina.\n  The FTA said it is much better to have a transit agency deal with \nrebuilding transit than to have FEMA do it; payout would be much \nquicker. But CBO based its estimates on the old FEMA model because they \ndon't work on new models. We have learned that in the health care and \nother debates.\n  So the CBO study is wrong. It is just wrong. Those are the three \narguments made against it, and none of them really hold up.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you can find stuff that is not disaster \nrelated in here, that is a legitimate argument, and we will work with \nyou and scour the package more. But on offsets, on mitigation, and on \nthis idea, let's just give the money needed for 1 year and wait and see \nwhat happens in the second year. You just can't rebuild an area if you \ndo those things, most of which are counterintuitive.\n  There are a few more points I wish to make. New York has to do \nseveral things at once. We have to simultaneously rebuild, but we also \nhave to protect against future storms, and to rebuild now makes sense \nand to protect makes sense. We can either invest in protections now or \nwe will pay later. That is vital to know.\n  Second, I would make the point that within about 2 weeks after \nKatrina,\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\nCongress passed $61 billion in aid. This idea we are moving much too \nquickly is belied by what happened there.\n  Third, on the issue of mitigation, the Stafford Act says there is a \nneed and an ability to do mitigation. And in fact, it has shown that $1 \ninvested in mitigation saves $4 down the road. So we have lots of \nthings here that are brought up legitimately but don't make sense.\n  In conclusion--and after this I want to say a brief word about what \nhappened at Sandy Hook, so close to my area--I hope we can come \ntogether in a bipartisan way and pass this legislation. I appreciate so \nmuch that we are off to a good start--no blocking the motion to proceed \nand allowance of amendments--and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve this serious problem.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  I will be very brief, Mr. President, but I wanted to say a few words \nabout Sandy Hook.\n  I rise this afternoon to join our Nation in grieving for the 28 lives \nthat were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut on \nFriday. Words are not sufficient to describe the horror we feel as a \nNation as the days go by and the events of last week gradually sink in. \nI see the pictures in the newspapers of these beautiful young children \nand, like others, I don't know what to do. There is a lump in the \nthroat, and I wish I could make it go away. I wish this man who did the \nshooting didn't exist or didn't do what he did. It is horrible.\n  I read about the parents of the 300 or 400 children in the school who \nwere brought to a firehouse, and as they found their child had \nsurvived, the names of the parents were called out so they could \nreunite with their kids. As the numbers grew less and less and less, \nimagine being in the group that remained. Horrible, just horrible.\n  Today the conversation turns to what do we do about this and what do \nwe do about gun violence. I believe we need a new way forward on guns \nthat breaks through the gridlock that has paralyzed us on this issue. \nWe cannot have each side just yelling at each other and accomplishing \nnothing. We cannot be gridlocked on this issue as we are on others. \nBoth sides need to recognize something. Those of us who are pro gun \ncontrol have to realize there are large parts of the country where guns \nare a way of life.\n  I know a little bit. When I was a kid, I got instructions on how to \nshoot a .22 rifle from an NRA-trained supervisor at my camp--summer \ncamp--and I wasn't a bad shot. I won a couple of those merit badges for \nmarksmanship and sharpshooter. A few years ago, I had the opportunity \nto visit with our colleague Ben Nelson. He took me out pheasant \nhunting. I enjoyed the experience. So we have to acknowledge that guns \nare a way of life and that the second amendment has a rightful place in \nthe Constitution. We cannot interpret the first, third, fourth, fifth, \nand sixth amendments as broadly as possible and then say the second \namendment should be seen through a pinhole of militias, that it only \naffects militias. That is only fair. But then our colleagues on the \nother side must acknowledge that, yes, there is a second amendment \nright--and by the way, the Heller decision now makes that the law of \nthe land, so I hope our folks who are pro gun realize no one is going \nto take their guns away. Before the Heller decision there was a view \nevery bit of gun control is a way to eventually confiscate the hunting \nrifle your Uncle Tommy gave you when you were 12 years old. But there \nis a Heller decision and that is a bulwark against it.\n  I think those of us on the gun control side should accept it, that it \nis only fair, only right the second amendment to the Constitution is \nthere just as the others are and deserves respect and not an endless \neffort to chip away at it. But then our colleagues on the pro gun side \nshould admit another thing, and that is that no amendment is absolute. \nAs important as it is, as constitutional, as enshrined as it is, no \namendment is absolute.\n  Take the first amendment. We can't falsely scream fire in a crowded \ntheater. That creates such danger. That is an impingement on someone's \nfirst amendment rights. We have anti-child pornography laws. We should \nhave them, but that too is a limitation on the first amendment. Even \nlibel laws, in a pure first amendment world, you could say and defame \nanything about anybody you wanted. We say no. That is a limitation on \nthe first amendment. Well, just as there can be limitations on the \nfirst amendment, and yet the essence of the first amendment is \npreserved, the same should be true of the second amendment.\n  I was the author of the Brady law. I don't think it has interfered \nwith a legitimate owner's right to have a gun in all the years it has \nbeen around, while at the same time it has saved tens of thousands of \nlives. There are some on the extreme side of the right who say: Oh, no, \nget rid of the Brady law. They believe the second amendment should be \nabsolute. But they are wrong.\n  I would argue that other changes--making it harder for mentally ill \npeople to get guns or saying assault weapons are weapons of war and \ndon't belong on our streets but belong on the battlefield--do not \ninterfere with the enjoyment I experienced when I went hunting with Ben \nNelson, nor with the right of a small shopowner in a bad neighborhood \nwho feels he needs a gun or she needs a gun to protect themselves.\n  We can come together. There can be a way of moving forward in the \nmiddle, with the left admitting the second amendment is important and \nas much a part of the Constitution as the others, and with the right \nadmitting that limitations on that amendment--as there are limitations \non the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth--do not interfere with \nthe fundamental right and, in fact, that no amendment can be absolute.\n  I believe you can be both pro gun and pro gun safety just as you can \nbe in favor of free speech but also against child pornography.\n  We need to start this conversation now, without delay. We owe it to \nourselves as a Nation but in particular to our children.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today for the people of New \nJersey whose lives have been turned upside down by Superstorm Sandy. I \nrise for families and small businesses still trying to recover, for \nhomeowners in Little Ferry, shopkeepers in Moonachie, and for every \nfamily who lost property, possessions, and homes in Union Beach and \nSeaside Heights, and all along the Jersey shore.\n  I rise, for example, for this resident in Pleasantville who, you can \nsee from this photograph, pretty much lost everything. This is the side \nof his house, totally ripped out. It looks like a dollhouse. But he was \noptimistic and hopeful for the future despite his challenges. This \nSandy relief package is for him. By the way, he is a veteran.\n  I rise today for the 40 New Jerseyans who lost their lives in this \npowerful, devastating, and destructive storm.\n  As we come to the floor in the face of that tragic loss of life, I \nknow all of my colleagues join me in offering our thoughts and prayers \nto the loved ones of the victims of Superstorm Sandy. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join me in casting a vote that tells those families \nthey are not alone, that we are all in this together; a vote that says \nwe are ready as a Nation to help families and businesses and \ncommunities recover when there is disaster.\n  I join with Senators Lautenberg, Gillibrand, and Schumer, and every \nSenator from the affected States, to thank the President for the \nrequest of $60 billion in aid to help our States begin the rebuilding \nprocess. This package is certainly a very good start.\n  The damage we saw after Hurricane or Superstorm Sandy is difficult to \ndescribe, in part because this was not only a powerful storm but it was \nan incredibly massive storm. We felt the greatest impact in New Jersey \nand New York, but as you can see from this NASA photo, the storm \nobscures almost all of the Northeast in this satellite photo.\n  The numbers are staggering across the region. We lost 40 people in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nstorm. Based on preliminary estimates, over 300,000 homes in New Jersey \nwere severely damaged, over 20,000 homes were absolutely destroyed or \nmade uninhabitable. But we fear the numbers will be even much higher as \nreporting continues. The preliminary damage estimate provided by the \nState of New Jersey is now up to $36.9 billion in damage, and everyone \nexpects that number will rise.\n  These are numbers. They may be a way to quantify the damage, but they \nfail to paint a picture of what we have seen throughout the State: the \nlevel of destruction, the faces of many thousands of displaced people \nwho find themselves homeless and basically nothing left from their \nhomes--their possessions, their keepsakes, their memories, all gone. \nEntire neighborhoods, where several generations of families lived in \nclose-knit communities, gone, thousands of decades-old small businesses \nruined, their owners unsure if they will have the ability or the means \nto rebuild. We are getting more damage numbers, but the human toll is \ntruly incalculable.\n  The sheer scope of the damage is also difficult to fathom, but to get \na better sense of that, we have compiled some pictures that I hope to \nshow our colleagues. Let me thank the Star-Ledger, New Jersey's largest \nnewspaper, for helping me compile these images from their photo gallery \nto tell the story of the devastation Sandy caused to our great State.\n  This is the Mantoloking Bridge which crossed Barnegat Bay and \nconnected Brick with Mantoloking before the storm, and here it is after \nthe storm. As you can see in this picture, the storm surge ripped a \ngash right through Mantoloking. These homes were largely all destroyed. \nAs a matter of fact, the nature of the New Jersey coastline has now \nchanged and there are inlets where there were none before, and it has \ntotally rewritten the geography of the New Jersey shoreline.\n  The relief package we are debating today will help us repair, yes, \nthis bridge, as well as some of the surrounding homes that were clearly \nlost and part of the highway that will need to be rebuilt, and it will \nhelp us defend this community from the fear of this happening again, of \npart of the community totally being ripped out.\n  While much of the damage was on the Jersey shore, northern New Jersey \ncommunities such as Little Ferry, as seen on this photo, and Moonachie \nsaw extensive river flooding when a berm failed. I was actually by this \nlocation and saw FEMA emergency management teams, as well as local \npolice and firefighters, getting people out of their homes in rafts in \norder to be able to get to dry land. Private property damage to both \ntowns has been estimated to exceed $15 million. This bill will help \nthese people rebuild and provide the State the resources it needs to \nbuild the berm back stronger.\n  In Sayerville, this is the third time in 3 years they have \nexperienced severe flooding. In this picture, Mei Zhu surveys the \ndamage inside her home. And that look of absolute fear and terror of \nwhat is before them is a look I have seen far too many times on the \nfaces of New Jerseyans.\n  The foundations of some homes were ripped away, causing fear of \nphysical collapse. Other homes were condemned and residents were told \nto leave. According to construction officials, in this borough alone a \nlist of 39 homes with collapsed foundations and 246 other homes were \nseverely damaged.\n  After these repeated floods, many are now asking for their homes to \nbe bought out, but an additional $55 million is needed to allow these \nresidents to move on. This bill has the resources needed to allow the \nState to fund these buyouts and allow Sayerville to deal with its new \nrealities.\n  Here now are two pictures of Union Beach, NJ, a working-class town \nthat could not afford the local $30 million to $40 million match for an \nArmy Corps beach engineering project.\n  In this photo, you can see the storm devastated entire neighborhoods. \nRebuilding defenses only to the standard that existed before the storm \nwill give us more of the same in the next storm. If we don't do things \ndifferently, we shouldn't expect a different result.\n  In this next photo, you can see houses that were crushed by the \nstorm's surge. Yes, we can help these homeowners rebuild, but if we \ndon't rebuild smarter, better, and with stronger coastal protections, \nwe will be back here again after the next storm paying the same price \nboth in terms of human suffering and Federal funds.\n  I appreciate that colleagues came to see the devastation, the many \nadministration officials, and the Vice President. We saw the difference \nbetween an Army Corps-engineered beach and one that is not. Where there \nwas an Army Corps-engineered beach, you had very little destruction. \nWhere you did not, you had massive destruction. The storm proves what \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, academic studies, and local communities \nhave been telling us for years: Beach engineering works. It protects \nlives, it protects property, and it saves us money in the long run from \nrepetitive loss.\n  This next image is what you can see by helicopter all up and down the \nJersey shore. This is one part, Ortley Beach, where many homes were \ndestroyed and totally encased in sand. Many communities going back \nblocks and blocks off the beach will be found in very similar sets of \ncircumstances.\n  Just to give you a sense of the magnitude, this is one community. \nMultiply that by a whole host of communities along the Jersey shore \ngoing back literally blocks and blocks of this picture.\n  In a different context, hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans have \nhad their commutes disrupted because of the storm. Every single New \nJersey Transit rail line was affected. Most service has been restored, \nbut even today the Port Authority's PATH terminal at Hoboken, which \nbrings thousands of riders back and forth between New York and New \nJersey and the major financial markets of this Nation, is inoperable \nand it still won't be back on line for some time, affecting the \ncommutes, the lives, and pocketbooks of 30,000 passengers who use that \nstation every weekday. This closure has hurt many local small \nbusinesses and is forcing some workers to take a 6:30 a.m. bus every \nmorning instead of an 8 a.m. train. Others are taking ferries, of \ncourse far more costly than their PATH ride, meaning that their \npersonal budgets are hit dramatically each and every week that they are \ngoing to work. Superstorm Sandy caused an estimated $7 billion in \ndamage to transit systems across the region, disrupting not only \npeople's commutes but taking time from them to spend with their \nfamilies and money out of their pockets.\n  Here is a picture from a security camera showing the rushing \ncorrosive seawater into the station of Hoboken, NJ. The saltwater has \nbeen pumped out and the silt that had accumulated has been dug out, but \nelectrical equipment will need to be replaced and rebuilt before we see \nthe tens of thousands of riders who rely on this station traveling \nagain.\n  Other than the destruction wrought by the storm surge itself, \narguably the biggest impact of the storm was the loss of power. At the \noutage peak, approximately two-thirds of the entire State was without \npower. Ten days after the storm, 10 percent of the State was still \nwithout power. Without power, these customers did not have heat, \ndespite temperatures in the low 40s. Of the 40 New Jersey deaths, about \nhalf were directly related to the loss of power, including oxygen \nmachines shutting off, people falling in the dark, carbon monoxide \npoisoning from generators, and hypothermia. Fully restoring power was a \nHerculean task, requiring utility crews from as far away as Oklahoma \nand Quebec to help local line workers.\n  At this moment our defenses are so low. It is like your immune \nsystem; when your immune system is depleted and at its lowest, you are \nmost susceptible to getting ill. Up and down the New Jersey shoreline, \nwe are totally defenseless. All we need is a northeaster--God forbid--\nand we will be in critical shape, unless we get this money to rebuild.\n  The Jersey shore was the epicenter of the destruction caused by \nSuperstorm Sandy, as the storm made landfall near Atlantic City. From \nSandy Hook to Cape May, tens of millions of people visit the shore \nevery year. It generates $38 billion in revenue to thousands of \nbusinesses annually. Here you can see the tremendous damage at the \niconic Casino Pier at Seaside Heights. This photo shows more than just \na mangled roller coaster; it symbolizes the destruction of an entire \ncommunity--the\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\nsmall businesses that rely on this and other attractions and fuel this \nshore community.\n  New Jersey small businesses have suffered a combined $8.3 billion in \ndamages, according to preliminary analyses. Here in Seaside Heights, \nmany shore businesses were devastated. Here in Bay Head, a salon has \nits flood-damaged furniture piled out front awaiting removal. When we \nwent to Long Beach Island with about four of our Senate colleagues, \nthey saw block after block of businesses totally closed. This isn't \nabout seasonal businesses. These are businesses that actually would be \nopen but for Superstorm Sandy.\n  Here is a business owner cleaning up after flooding at Elsy Auto \nRepair in Newark. It gives you a sense of the breadth and scope of the \nshore, Newark and all types of communities affected.\n  I wanted to walk through these photos to give my colleagues and \nfellow Americans a sense of the damage we have seen throughout my home \nState. But what I have shown you still does not do justice to the full \nimpact of the storm or the devastation people went through. Every part \nof New Jersey was affected by the storm and we need your help to \nrecover.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are those voices saying the cost to help \nfamilies rebuild and recover is too much, that it should be reduced; \nthat in this emergency, unlike many other similar emergencies in the \npast, we should do something smaller and wait to do the rest later.\n  Those who make such arguments could not, respectfully, be more wrong. \nWe cannot rebuild half a PATH station, a little now and more sometime \nin the future; we cannot permanently repair half the Mantoloking \nBridge; half a bridge is not a bridge at all. We cannot hire a \ncontractor to rebuild half a house or restore half of a community. We \nneed the money in place to rebuild entire projects and entire areas to \nensure that families and businesses devastated by the storm can \nrecover.\n  Right now there are tens of thousands of small business owners trying \nto decide--their life is on hold--whether I will have some assistance \nby the government that will help me reopen or I will pack it in. They \nneed to see a full Federal commitment right now to know they have the \nresources and the customers they need to make it. Half a loaf or a \nwait-and-see commitment is simply not good enough.\n  I do not want our small businesses to pack and move on. I do not want \nmultigenerational businesses to end because of a superstorm. I know \nGovernor Christie doesn't want them to move on either. We want them to \nrecover and stay in New Jersey. Disaster reimbursement from FEMA and \nagencies such as the Department of Transportation only flows when a \nproject is completed. That makes the spending seem slow but actually \nthe rebuilding happens much more quickly. Local communities are able to \nbudget and contract for a project, knowing the money will be there at \nthe end. If we wait, if we do not put up the money, then some of the \nrebuilding will also wait and a piecemeal recovery is a stalled \nrecovery and, in all likelihood, a failed recovery.\n  The need is clear for passage of the Sandy relief package for my \nState and for the entire region devastated by the storm and the ruin it \nleft in its wake. We have just gone through an election at the heart of \nwhich we debated the role of government in our lives. I submit we need \nto focus on what government does to help build the spirit of community \nwe have seen in action in the aftermath of this devastating storm. \nAmericans across the country were riveted by the stories of the \nimmediate aftermath of the storm: the pictures of entire communities \nunderwater, homes moved blocks down the road, homes and train cars \nblocking Federal highways, hospitals closed, gas lines miles long, \npeople waiting hours for fuel to run generators to keep their homes \nheated and families warm, weeks of fuel rationing and no transit or \nAmtrak service for the entire region for people to get to work or visit \ntheir families.\n  Without a doubt, these were trying times for New Jersey. But now, \njust because those scenes are no longer showing in living rooms across \nthe country, does not mean the pain is not there. It does not mean the \nrecovery is over. Thousands of families are still displaced from their \nhomes and will be for months to come.\n  We face this at the beginning of a winter. Many of these superstorms \nand hurricanes come in tropical times. We are in the midst of winter. \nThe bite is even worse. Transit lines are still out. Community \ninfrastructure still has to be rebuilt. Now is not the time for the \nFederal Government to walk away. It is more crucial now than ever for \nthe Federal Government to help devastated communities rebuild, to help \nfamilies get the assistance they need to repair their homes and put \ntheir lives back together. I, for one, will not rest until the \nrebuilding is done.\n  Whether in the Senate or before in my role in the House of \nRepresentatives, I have never said no to disaster funding--whether that \nwas a result of Hurricane Katrina, for the people of Louisiana, \nAlabama, Mississippi; whether there was flooding along the Mississippi; \nin another context, whether it was tornado disasters in the Midwest; \nwhether it was crop destruction for our farm States, I have not said no \nbecause I believe that is the essence of why we call this country the \nUnited States of America.\n  The only difference is the location and extent of the destruction. \nNow it is time for my fellow Americans to stand with New Jersey. We \nhave been battered, but we are not broken. We are stronger and more \nunited in our efforts to work to recover, rebuild, and recommit \nourselves to uniting around common concerns and shared values rather \nthan being divided by our differences. This is the lesson we learn and \ntogether we will rebuild and the Garden State will bloom once again.\n  I look forward to my colleagues supporting us in this effort as I \nhave supported our fellow Americans, their people in their State and \ntheir challenges. This is one in which we need them to join hand in \nhand with us and to remember that but for the grace of God there go I.\n  This will happen someplace, sometime in another part of the Nation, \nand I will be proud at that time to once again say, yes; this is the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on October 29, one of the largest \nAtlantic hurricanes on record slammed into the Jersey shore. At the \nsame time, a winter storm system hit New Jersey from the west, creating \na superstorm that did unprecedented damage to my State.\n  When the sun came up the next day, parts of New Jersey looked like a \nwar zone.\n  Reports indicate that more than 30 people in New Jersey were killed, \nand at least 100 in the U.S. lost their lives as a result of this \nstorm.\n  Across New Jersey, 350,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed.\n  Imagine how all of those families felt. Imagine having to evacuate, \nand coming home to find nothing there. The place where you raised your \nchildren and created so many memories--gone.\n  Across our State, 75 percent of small businesses were affected; big \nparts of our transportation system were shut down; and our electrical \ngrid was crippled. There were approximately 2,400,000 power outages in \nNew Jersey, affecting roughly two-thirds of all power customers in the \nState.\n  In response to this devastation, I was proud to see New Jersey \nGovernor Chris Christie and President Obama put aside their political \ndifferences and join together to help people in a desperate situation. \nThis bipartisan leadership made the whole country proud.\n  We have an opportunity with the bill we are considering this week to \nshow that kind of leadership here in the Senate.\n  The Superstorm Sandy supplemental appropriations bill will help New \nJerseyans recover from this storm and rebuild our State so we are \nstronger for the next storm.\n  The bill extends $60,000,000,000 of aid to New Jersey and the region.\n  That's about $20,000,000,000 less than New Jersey and New York \nestimated the States would need--and those State estimates took weeks \nto compile and were done with help from third party analysts.\n  Simply put, the bill before us is a reasonable down payment on the \nbasics of our recovery and rebuilding effort.\n  Where private insurance wasn't enough, this bill will help residents \nand small businesses pick up the pieces and begin to restore their \nlives.\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n  It helps fund the repair of our devastated transportation network, \nour damaged electrical grid, and other public infrastructure.\n  And the bill provides for proven Federal programs that will help \nreduce flood risk along New Jersey's shore and protect the investment \nwe are making in rebuilding coastal communities.\n  The situation in New Jersey is still desperate.\n  Tens of thousands of New Jerseyans face unemployment because of the \nstorm.\n  And 7 weeks after Sandy, more than 40,000 people in New Jersey are \nstill out of their homes. Their suffering will only increase as we \nenter the coldest months of the year.\n  And the Hoboken PATH station remains closed as well, causing local \nbusinesses to shut their doors.\n  How long are we going to make people wait for relief?\n  When other States have suffered overwhelming disasters, Congress has \nhelped them rebuild and restore. That is what we do as Americans--we \nhelp each other in times of need.\n  We saw the worst of Mother Nature in Superstorm Sandy. But we saw the \nbest of the American people. Neighbors helped neighbors, and leaders \nput politics aside.\n  Now it is our turn in the Senate to join together across party lines \nand help rebuild New Jersey, New York, and the other States that were \ndevastated by Superstorm Sandy.\n  Let's pass the Sandy supplemental appropriations bill this week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, to talk about the \naspects of my bill, the parts of my bill that are in the supplemental. \nBut before I do, I want to join with other Americans in extending my \ndeepest condolences to the families in Connecticut, those 26 families \nwho faced a tragedy of such enormity that it is impossible for the mind \nto comprehend and the heart to endure--the murder of 20 sweet, innocent \nchildren and 6 teachers who died protecting their children.\n  When we look at the photos of the children, we see in many of them \nthe faces of our own families. We can only imagine the agony they are \nfacing right now. I wish to extend my heartfelt support to them and \nalso to all those who responded to the tragedy: those on the scene, the \nschool principal who literally put herself in the line of fire to \nprotect her students and tried to alert them through the intercom \nsystem; to teachers in the classrooms and a teacher's assistant who \nliterally shielded them with their own bodies and their own know-how. \nThen there were the police and other law enforcement who went into the \nschool, not knowing what danger and horror they would face or how they \ncould rescue the children. There were the ambulance drivers who raced \nto the scene, paramedics, and even grief counselors needed counseling \nat one point.\n  In this situation, the families bear this incredible grief, but we \nall do too. Whether for those people on the scene, for those who have \nthe permanent wounds of the bullet or those in Connecticut or those \nfamilies who will bear the permanent impact of this tragedy, we lift \nour hearts in prayer for these victims and we lift our voices to end \nviolence in America. We must look at ending violence in our country. We \nneed to be able to look at the issues around gun control and ammo \ncontrol, but that is only one aspect of it. We also have to look at \nissues related to mental illness because for those who suffer mental \nillness--whether it is those who have the illness themselves or their \nfamilies who try to cope with it--they are often alone and helpless.\n  That is not by way of explanation or excuse for what happened in \nConnecticut or Colorado--what happens now all too frequently in our \nsociety. But there is a pattern, particularly of young men over the age \nof 18 and below 30 who seem to fall between the cracks, missing the \nhelp they need to be able to deal with those demons inside themselves. \nWe need to be able to focus on that.\n  I agree with the President who said last night:\n\n       No single law--no set of laws can eliminate evil from the \n     world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our \n     society. But that can't be an excuse for inaction. Surely, we \n     can do better than this.\n\n  We must do more to protect our children and our communities, not only \nwith words, prayers and vigils but actually with the deeds here.\n  So know I will join with my colleagues to reinstate the assault \nweapons ban. I plan to work with Senator Feinstein to introduce a bill \nthat will deal with military-style weapons and high-capacity bullet \nclips. Weapons of war have no place on our streets, in our schools or \nin our homes.\n  For those who cry: Oh, it is regulation--we regulate food for our \nsafety. We regulate cars for our safety. We need to now look at \nregulating guns. But know that, as I also said, we must also look at \nthe issue of mental illness, particularly in young adults.\n  Our colleague Senator Lieberman is proposing a commission on \nviolence. I am often skeptical of commissions, but I believe if Joe \nLieberman headed up that commission and we looked at it, it would come \nout with an action plan. If there was a pledge to support the \nrecommendations of that commission, I would also be able to support it.\n  We need to look at guns, mental health, and those things that glorify \nviolence in our society or glorify that somehow or another guns are a \nsolution to every problem we have.\n  Today, the funerals in Newtown begin. Our mourning will go on for a \nlong time, but our work as well must continue over the days and the \nweeks ahead. I intend to work with my colleagues to change the law and \nchange the culture of violence.\n  I also rise to speak on my commerce and justice bill. I want to focus \non my national responsibilities as the chairperson of the \nAppropriations Committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science. I also wish \nto point out that Maryland was hard hit too, especially the communities \nin the lower shore and in particular the community of Crisfield. I will \nspeak more about Maryland and what we faced during Hurricane Sandy \ntomorrow.\n  It was ironic that when the hurricane hit, we faced hurricane winds \nin one part of our State and a blizzard and nor'easter in another part \nof our State. So we had State troopers on snowmobiles trying to go in \nto rescue vulnerable populations in Garrett County. We also had our \nState troopers and guards on rafts and on swiftboats going in to rescue \nvulnerable populations being hit by the flooding waters and the \nhorrific hurricane winds. Although we were not hit in Maryland the way \nNew York and New Jersey were, we face damages too.\n  Up and down the Atlantic coast, there was tremendous damage. I am \nhere to talk about the CJS portion of this urgent supplemental. It \nprovides $513 million to repair, replace, restore, and rebuild our \ncommunities and our critical assets. In our case, the CJS bill is about \nrestoring critical assets for Federal law enforcement, our weather \nprediction and weather facilities, NOAA, and what was damaged in our \nfisheries program. Even NASA's spaceport Wallops facility was damaged \nby Hurricane Sandy.\n  When a storm such as Sandy hits, it devastates everything in its \npath, including Federal facilities, such as the offices and equipment \nof our law enforcement agencies. Our Federal law enforcement agencies--\nthe FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms--were also hit. We need to make sure we maintain \nsupport for these law enforcement agencies, and therefore we have in \nthis appropriation $15 million for the Department of Justice to repair \nthese facilities by replacing equipment and operational tools damaged \nby Hurricane Sandy.\n  This will also help FBI facilities in New York and New Jersey that \nwere hit. The New York field office, resident agencies, and even labs \nand case record storage facilities were damaged. They are all important \nin dealing with fighting crime, whether it is terrorism, organized \ncrime, or financial fraud. Sewage and mud destroyed the New York\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\nfield office mobile command center, specialized laboratory trucks, and \nevidence response team vehicles.\n  This appropriation also has $1 million to restore the tools the Drug \nEnforcement Agency needs to go after drug traffickers. Radio \ncommunications and the antennas to stay connected were damaged. The New \nYork division's information technology system needs all the help it can \nget to be able to replace those 15 vehicles used for important kinds of \nforensic detection and wiretap that were lost to flooding or crushed by \nfalling trees.\n  Also included in the appropriations is the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms, which will get $25 million. Flooding swept \nthrough the ATF offices in Brooklyn and Manhattan. It damaged \ncommunication, security systems, and other tools Federal agents need to \ndetect crime, fight crime, identify the perpetrators of crime, and \ngather the evidence.\n  We have $10 million in here for the Bureau of Federal Prisons. Ten \nFederal prisons were affected by Hurricane Sandy, located in four \nStates: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We need \nthese repairs to meet safety and security requirements to make sure the \ninmates are kept secure and the prisons are fit for duty. They will \nneed $10 million to be able to do that.\n  Let's talk about the science side. Our Federal science facilities \nalong our coast were also damaged. Repairs are needed in Federal \nlaboratories, research facilities, and monitoring equipment.\n  NOAA needs $15 million for ocean and coastal equipment damaged by \nHurricane Sandy. For example, 45 tide stations and data buoys were \ndamaged. What does that mean? It is absolutely crucial for these buoys \nto give us the navigational information for safe navigation into and \nout of affected ports. The Presiding Officer knows, as the Senator who \nrepresents Washington State, how important access to a port is and how \nimportant the NOAA facilities are to help our ship captains and our \nport pilots have accurate and reliable data. They were damaged up and \ndown the coast. They will need $63 million to repair and improve \nweather forecasting equipment and capabilities. Nine NOAA weather radio \nsites were damaged, including broken transmitters and antennas. Repairs \nare needed so they can be able to give us the right weather forecast \neven during a storm, to be able to give us the right information to \nprotect our communities. For every mile we can be accurate, we will \nsave $1 million in evacuation costs by the State, local, and private \nsector. Every dollar we spend that can provide accurate forecasting \nsaves lives and saves money. In addition, even the NOAA hurricane \nhunter planes were damaged. We have three of them. Only one plane was \nable to work during the 2012 hurricane season. Two other planes \ndesperately need repairs, and we are going to do it.\n  Also, we need to repair NASA facilities that were damaged along the \ncoast. Beaches were washed away near the NASA launch pad at Wallop's \nIsland. The launch pad sits steps from the beach, and workers had to \nstop testing the rocket that will be used to take cargo to the space \nstation. After Hurricane Sandy, they said they had not seen this much \ndamage in over 6 years. This is a very important facility. There were \nother NASA facilities that were damaged because of the impact and their \ncloseness to the beach.\n  We also need cleanup. Entire coastal communities were washed away. \nThe magnitude was amazing. Right now we have debris from storm damage \nthat can be dangerous to fishing vessels, public health and safety, and \nto marine life. This funding is important for the communities hit by \nHurricane Sandy and also for the west coast communities that are still \nstruggling with debris. I understand in Oregon, Washington State, and \nin California they are still dealing with debris from the Japanese \ntsunami. I know the Senator from Washington State as well as Senator \nMurray have spoken to me about it.\n  We need to clean up what was washed up. It is important not only for \nthe safety of our beaches but also so that ships have clear navigation. \nWe are also going to be looking at coastal habitat.\n  Due to the hurricane, not only were people displaced but fisheries \nwere destroyed as well. I am not equating the two, but for many of us \nwho are coastal Senators, we know that the fisheries are an important \npart of our identity, an important part of the economy, and an \nimportant part of jobs in our communities. We call them watermen in \nMaryland. Our colleagues from New England call them lobstermen or \nfishermen. I know the Presiding Officer calls them fishermen. Whatever \nname we use, those men and women who work and harvest the sea depend on \ntheir fisheries.\n  There were several fisheries which were damaged because the storm \ncreated such an aquatic and habitat upheaval. Assistance is needed for \nour fishermen and our fishing communities which depend on this for \ntheir livelihoods to get help. We will be focusing in this bill on New \nEngland groundfish; Mississippi's--which was hit by another hurricane--\noysters and blue crabs; as well as Alaska and its salmon. Those who \nwere affected at the salmon fisheries will benefit from this bill as \nwill New York and New Jersey.\n  At the same time we will provide assistance to legal aid for mobile \nresources and disaster coordinators. There is a tremendous demand for \ntheir services to help people sort out many of the aspects of this. \nThey help them with their benefits and their insurance. They need help \njust sorting things out when they don't have the documents they need.\n  We are going to have lawyers on the ground to work with the \ncommunity. Legal aid will be doing this, and they will be also \ncoordinate pro bono orders.\n  We see this bill not just as spending on these items, we see this as \nhelping the communities get back on their feet and ensuring they have \nvital Federal services in law enforcement and the safety and protection \nof their community. We need to maintain the safety of our Federal \nprisons and make sure there is safety and access to our ports in order \nthat safe navigation will be provided.\n  For every dollar we spend, we are going to be creating jobs. It is \ngoing to take jobs and human beings to replace and replenish our \nbeaches. This is important. It is a jobs bill. When we talk about going \nin and stabilizing our prisons or helping with the New York field \noffice, and so on, these are going to be jobs in construction, in \noffice space restoration, and mold mitigation.\n  Item after item will help provide an opportunity that even men and \nwomen whose jobs were displaced because of this storm will have the \nopportunity to be able to participate in these Federal contracts to \nrebuild the very communities that they are from. I know we hope that \nhappens.\n  After all of this, we are going to have safer beaches and safer \nnavigation. We are also going to continue the excellent work that has \nbeen done by NOAA and weather forecasts. They gave us plenty of warning \nso that we were able to save as many lives as we could, but \nunfortunately we could not save those homes and we could not save those \nlivelihoods.\n  This supplemental helps people get back in their homes, get those \ncommunities back, and hopefully we will restore those livelihoods. I \nlook forward to ensuring that my aspect of the bill moves in an \nexpeditious, speedy, and smooth way.\n  I thank the the ranking member, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. She \nworked with me on a bipartisan basis to put together my part of the \nsupplemental. This will probably be the last bill she will help move. I \nappreciate her help.\n  I hope my colleagues, as they look at the overall aspects of this \nbill, will move it. Tomorrow I will be talking more about the FEMA and \nHUD aspects, particularly as they affect Maryland. I hope that as the \nlameduck moves along, we move in a bipartisan way to get our people \nback into their homes, back to work, and get back the faith that the \nFederal Government is on their side and responds to them.\n  The Senator and I thank President Obama for his leadership and giving \nus the right framework. We have it all lined up here, and we are ready \nto go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as I was coming to work today, I drove \npast St. Peter's grade school which is on the House side of the Hill, \nand there was a\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\ngroup of students--little kids--who were being escorted by their \nteacher down the sidewalk. As they walked along I couldn't help but \nflash back to that image all America remembers from last Friday--the \nchildren at the Sandy Hook school in Newtown, CT, filing out, heading \nfor safety at the firehouse.\n  I don't know that I can look at the faces of these children as their \nnames have been reported and not think of my own kids when they were \nthat age, and especially of my own grandchildren now, who are just a \nlittle over a year old. But I saw in the eyes of those children what \nall of us see: innocence, happiness, an interest in the future, and the \ngreatest dreams in the world.\n  Well, in one brutal, depraved moment, those dreams ended when that \ngunman forced his way into Sandy Hook school and shot those poor \ninnocent children. At that moment, some people stepped forward who \nreally became heroes of the day: Four teachers, including Rachel \nDavino, Anne Marie Murphy, Lauren Rousseau, and Victoria Soto, and the \nschool psychologist, Mary Sherlach, and Dawn Hochsprung, the beloved \nschool principal who apparently walked right into the face of this \ngunman to try to stop him from harming any of the children in the \nschool. These school employees lost their lives because they were \ntrying to stop the gunman or shield their students from him.\n  We would like to think all of us called into a moment such as that \nwould rise to the standard of courage they showed. I hope we would. \nThey did, and in so doing reminded us that even those who just go to \nwork every single day can be called on to show bravery. These teachers \ndid, the school psychologist and the principal, and we owe them a great \ndebt of gratitude, as I am sure the families of all of the students in \nthe school feel.\n  We pray for all the children were lost on Friday, for the six school \nemployees, and for all their families and loved ones. We also pray for \nthe first victim that morning, the shooter's own mother, Nancy Lanza. \nAnd we thank the first responders who responded so bravely in the face \nof such horror.\n  We reflect now on our responsibility. I thought about it over the \nweekend, and I wrote an article for the Chicago Tribune this morning \nand here is what it said:\n  What will it take? What will it take for a majority of Americans to \nspeak out for sensible firearms policy in our nation? It will take more \nthan a Congresswoman being shot point-blank in the face as she gathers \nfor a town meeting in Arizona. It will take more than a deranged gunman \nwith a 100-round magazine spraying bullets into a crowded movie theater \nin Aurora, CO. It will take more than the kids who die playing with \nguns carelessly stored. It will take more than killings on the \nuniversity campuses in my home State of Illinois and in Texas and \nAlabama and Virginia; and it will take more than the shootings on the \nstreets of Chicago, my hometown of East St. Louis, and so many other \ncities across the country. Sadly, it will take more than 27 victims, \nincluding 20 children, at Sandy Hook grade school.\n  What it will take is for a majority of Americans and a majority of \nthoughtful gun owners and hunters to agree that there must be \nreasonable limits on gun ownership and weapons. The U.S. Supreme Court \nacknowledged that our second amendment rights are not absolute. So can \nwe come together and agree that Americans have the right to own and use \nfirearms for sport and self-defense, but with certain limits?\n  We must institute reasonable, commonsense limits, such as barring \nthose with a history of mental instability, those with a history of \nviolent crime or who are adjudged dangerous and subject to restraining \norders, and those whose names have already been placed on a terrorist \nwatch list from owning guns. Those ``straw purchasers'' who are \nliterally fencing for drug gangs and other criminal thugs, and the gun \ndealers who look the other way when they come to buy those weapons? We \nhave to deal with them realistically and firmly.\n  There are certain classes of weapons that are strictly military. They \nhave no useful purpose in sport, hunting, or self-defense. They should \nnot be legally sold in America. The gun used at Sandy Hook grade school \nin Newtown, CT, was just such a gun, an AR-15, originally an M-16, \ndeveloped for military purposes. Then, with clips attached that held \ncountless numbers of bullets, he turned it on those little babies, \nthese infants, and killed them with that assault weapon. Magazine clips \nwith more than 10 rounds should be prohibited from civilian use.\n  No one should be allowed to purchase more than two firearms--maybe \nonly one firearm per month. And those who own firearms that are within \nthe reach of children should have protective locks on their weapons.\n  What holds us back are political organizations that are well-funded \nand organized and determined to resist even the most reasonable \nlimitations. There is a close political parallel between the gridlock \nin Washington on dealing with our economy and national debt and the \neerie silence in Congress as the list of horrific gun crimes grows by \nthe day.\n  I am encouraged by several of my colleagues who have spoken out \ntoday. Traditionally they have been on the side of those who have \nopposed any type of limitation on firearms, but they believe, after \nNewtown, CT, we have to reopen that conversation in a good-faith effort \nto find common ground.\n  But too many of my colleagues just shrug their shoulders when gun \nissues come to the floor for a vote. They have made Grover Norquest-\nlike pledges and feel dutybound to vote ``right'' on every scorecard \nissue.\n  My wife and I grew up in families of hunters. We know the rite of \npassage when a father can take his son or daughter out hunting for the \nfirst time. I know the fun of watching the Sun come up from a duck \nblind and hearing a seasoned hunter calling them in over the water. The \nhunters I know are good people who love their sport and hate those who \nmisuse firearms, terrorize, and kill. We need for these hunters to join \nwith many Americans, some of whom have never owned a gun or used a gun, \nto establish a reasonable standard for gun use and ownership in this \ngreat Nation.\n  I was thinking over the weekend how much we have focused on texting \nand driving, and I looked up the numbers. Last year it is estimated \nthat 6,000 Americans died because they foolishly were texting while \nthey were driving. We now have a national campaign to stop texting and \ndriving, and we should: 6,000 American lives lost. Last year we lost \n30,000 American lives to gun deaths, to put it in perspective. It is \ntime for us to view safety and ownership of guns as seriously as we do \nwhen it comes to the safety of operation of automobiles. Until we do--\nuntil we come together as a Nation and come forward with reasonable \nlimits on guns that can be sold, magazines and cartridges that can be \nsold, even the body armor which I can't even understand the purpose for \nin this country--until we do that, the number of victims of gun \ntragedies will continue to grow and the silence of the funerals that \nfollow will be matched by the silence of those in Congress who have the \npower to change it.\n  It is time for us to step forward in memory of these poor children in \nNewtown, CT, their grieving families, these heroic teachers, and so \nmany others who reminded us last Friday that we are all part of the \nsame American family.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves \nthe floor, I commend him for his statements, first on his nominee for \nthe Illinois judgeship that has been delayed for far too long, through \nno fault of the Senator from Illinois.\n  This weekend was a very difficult and trying weekend for our families \nand so many other families, although nothing compared to the families \nin Newtown, of course. I pretty much stayed off the phone and spent \ntime with children and grandchildren. I made an exception for a couple \nof phone calls with the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois. I \ntold him that when we come back in in a couple of weeks for the new \nCongress, I will work with him to make sure the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has full and thorough hearings on the subjects he has just \nspoken about, as he stated here so eloquently and as he did in his \ntelevision interviews this weekend.\n  The President was absolutely right when he said there is a number of\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\nissues. Obviously the issue of guns is one of them. Mental health is \nanother. There are several issues. Several committees will look at \nthese issues, and should. But I think the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas a very particular role to play, and I pledge to the Senator from \nIllinois he will have my complete cooperation in that regard. He was \none of the rare phone calls I made this weekend, as well as to a couple \nnational law enforcement officials.\n  I thought I had seen some of the most horrific crime scenes in my \ncareer, but they don't even begin to compare to what the first \nresponders and others, including school officials and parents, saw in \nthat elementary school. The memory is fresh for us, but can we imagine \nthe memories for the families of both the adults and the children who \ndied? It is a memory that will never, ever fade. I think we ought to \nshow our responsibility and step forward to find out what can be done \nnot as Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, but as \nAmericans. I believe it can be done.\n  I see the time of 5 o'clock has nearly arrived, but I also see the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland on the floor. He wishes to speak on \nthe supplemental. I ask unanimous consent Senator Cardin be permitted \nto speak on the supplemental and that if he goes past the time of 5 \no'clock he be allowed to continue using my time on the judicial \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first let me thank Chairman Leahy for \nthose words in his exchange with Senator Durbin. I wish to offer my \ndeepest condolences on behalf of all of the people of Maryland to the \n20 students who lost their lives, and the 6 adults, at the hands of a \nsingle shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT.\n  It is heart-breaking to listen to the stories of innocent lives cut \ncruelly short. The pain and grief of the families and friends of these \nstudents and teachers is unimaginable.\n  I want to echo some of the comments Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy \nmade. We know the teachers and the aides put their lives on the line in \norder to try to save the children, as well as the unbelievable task of \nthe first responders coming to the scene and not knowing what they \nwould find. We send our prayers to all.\n  This is a tragedy beyond words. I think President Obama said it best \nlast night that our hearts are broken. But as Senator Durbin has said--\nand I say to Senator Leahy, I particularly want to thank the Senator--\nwe need to take action. Congress needs to come together and take action \nto protect the safety of our children. We must do better. There have \nbeen too many episodes in which children's lives--and others--have been \nlost that we must figure out ways to prevent these types of tragedies.\n  This conversation must include a discussion about the culture of \nviolence that permeates our culture today, including the glorification \nof violence to our children and young adults. We see too much of this \nviolence, and it has to have an impact on young children. We need to \nknow how we can responsibly deal with this circumstance.\n  It must include a discussion of the mental health services provided \nto Americans, including our students. Many of us have talked about this \nin the past. We have to be more aggressive in dealing with the mental \nhealth needs of all the people in our community.\n  As Chairman Leahy pointed out, we must discuss the issue about the \nready access of individuals to weapons. I know there are different \nviews in this Congress. I must tell you, I do not understand why we \nneed to allow access to military-style assault weapons and ammunition.\n  I strongly support Senator Feinstein's efforts to reinstate the \nexpired 1994 ban on assault weapons, including a ban on ammunition \nmagazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\n  Senator Durbin has raised a very valid point: We regulate \nautomobiles. We regulate consumer products. We regulate a lot, as we \nshould, for public safety, and we should regulate firearms for public \nsafety reasons.\n  There is no need for assault weapons to be held by the public. In my \nview, there is no legitimate reason for a civilian to possess a \nmilitary-style weapon or to have large capacity ammunition clips. \nCongress should also examine whether we can strengthen our background \ncheck system for gun buyers, along with criminal penalties for those \nwho illegally purchase or transfer guns.\n  We need to take a look at safety locks for children. We need to look \nat those who make multiple purchases. We need to look at the gun show \npurchases. I think we should examine all those to see whether we can \nmake our communities safer, without infringing upon the legitimate \nright of individuals to possess guns, sportsmen to be able to use guns \nfor hunting. I think all that, obviously, will be protected. But we can \ndo a much better job of protecting public safety.\n  We have talked about this before, and we need to act. We need to act \nin a comprehensive way to make our society safer. I pledge to the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee--I have had the honor of serving on \nthat committee for 4 years. He is an extremely fair leader who believes \nin letting all sides be heard, and I very much appreciate his \ncommitment in so many different areas that have dealt with public \nsafety. We have great confidence in his leadership on that committee, \nand other committees of the Senate need to act as it relates to the \nsafety of our children.\n  (Mr. BEGICH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I know we have pending the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to act on this as quickly as \nwe can. Sandy was a devastating storm. Eight million people were \nwithout power. There were over 100 deaths, including 7 in the State of \nMaryland.\n  Maryland was hit hard, not as hard as New Jersey or New York--and our \nprayers go out to all the communities that have been affected--but \nMaryland was hit pretty hard. We had sustained winds for hour after \nhour after hour after hour. We had rainfall records--9 inches. We had \nstorm surges with 7 foot waves. We had flooding of the Eastern Shore of \nMaryland. We had a storm in the western part of our State that dropped \n30 inches of wet snow.\n  So we suffered from the flooding on the Eastern Shore and the storms \nin western Maryland. In many of the communities, people who live below \nthe poverty line are elderly. Senator Mikulski was just on the floor \nand talked about the circumstances in the city of Crisfield. In that \ncity, 32 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Mr. \nPresident, 585 homes were severely damaged, 71 sustained major damage. \nThe watermen, which is one of the major industries for that community, \nfound that they were literally unable to work, and they are still \nunclear as to what is going to happen to their crops.\n  We have a serious problem. I will give you just two examples of \npeople who have lived through this storm.\n  In Crisfield, Mary lived in an apartment with Cody, her trained \nmedical dog. Mary suffers from epileptic seizures, and Cody serves as \nher lifeline when these seizures occur.\n  Mary has no family in the area. She cannot work due to her \ndisability. Her only source of income is a small Social Security check.\n  When Hurricane Sandy hit Crisfield, the water rose rapidly in her \napartment. Mary was forced to grab Cody--and nothing else--jump out the \nwindow and swim to safety. She lost all her belongings, including all \nher records, which might be helpful for her to be able to get the \nbenefits she is entitled to.\n  She is now in temporary housing at a local motel, paying $60 a night, \nwhich she cannot afford, until she can qualify for the assistance. In \nan area that has a high number of low-income elderly persons, Federal \nassistance is needed to help deserving senior citizens severely \nimpacted by this storm.\n  Then there is Diane, who also lives in Crisfield with her family in \nher childhood home. According to Diane, she has weathered many storms \nover the years but never in her lifetime has she ever seen the water \nrise so high and so quickly, inundating the first floor of her home and \ncreating huge whitecaps around her neighborhood. Diane decided to ride \nout the storm in her home, fearing the possibility of drowning if she \nleft.\n  The family lost all their possessions. With housing vouchers, they \nare now\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\nliving in temporary housing. A church group gutted her home, but she \nstill needs building materials in order to be able to rebuild her home. \nShe does not have the resources to do that. She needs Federal \nassistance in order to get her life back in order.\n  They are just two stories, and I could give you numerous others in \nthe State of Maryland. In the western part of our State, in Garrett \nCounty--Garrett County is a community of 30,000--15,000 homes were \nwithout power. That is just about every home. Trees fell everywhere. \nThis is a remote Appalachian community, where people were isolated \nbecause of the storm. They need help. They need partners.\n  I wish to congratulate Governor O'Malley and our State leaders and \nour county leaders. FEMA did a great job. I want to thank the Red Cross \nand other private sector groups.\n  But now it is time for the Federal Government to act as a true \npartner.\n  I thank President Obama for the disaster declaration for our State, \nincluding individual relief for the County of Somerset. This \nlegislation strengthens the Federal partnership. It provides the \nresources so we can help people such as Mary and Diane who have been \ndevastated by the storm. It will provide the resources necessary so \nthey can put their lives back together. I particularly note the $17 \nbillion in CDBG funds. Those are flexible funds that will help people \nsuch as Mary and Diane so they can get their lives back together.\n  I also wish to point out how important the mitigation funds are that \nare in the supplemental appropriations bill. That will allow us to \nbuild to prevent this type of damage in the future. For those who may \nquestion the feasibility of this type of investment, let me point to \none in Maryland: Assateague Island. We widened and put more beach down \non Assateague Island. It was kind of pricey, many people thought, but \nit acted as a buffer for Sandy coming in and causing more damage in \nOcean City. Literally millions of dollars were saved because of \nAssateague Island acting as a bumper to the storm. Mitigation is \nimportant, and we should invest in mitigation.\n  The next step should be the passage of the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I have heard many of my colleagues come to the \nfloor who represent States that are directly affected. I have listened \nas my colleagues around the Nation have talked about disasters in their \ncommunities, and we have always come together as a nation. I know we \nare in the last days of this legislative session. I just urge my \ncolleagues to let us move this bill forward now. Let's get it done so \nthe Federal Government can be there to help the communities that have \nbeen affected by this storm. It is the right thing to do, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8063-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8063-S8067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n NOMINATIONS OF FERNANDO M. OLGUIN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n   FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND THOMAS M. DURKIN TO BE \n   UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Fernando M. \nOlguin, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California and Thomas M. Durkin, of Illinois, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, originally we were planning to vote at 5:30 \np.m. The distinguished ranking member has no objection. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be divided between now and 5:30 p.m. in the \nnormal fashion and the votes be at 5:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so Senators will know, it is my \nunderstanding that the first vote, on the confirmation of Fernando \nOlguin, of California, will be a voice vote, and the second one for Mr. \nDurkin will be a rollcall vote, which is what I understand from the \nSenator from Iowa, which, of course, is perfectly acceptable to the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is finally being allowed \nto vote to confirm two consensus judicial nominees who should have been \nvoted on months ago. Both Judge Fernando Olguin and Thomas Durkin were \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee before the August recess. Both \nwill finally fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Central District \nof California and the Northern District of Illinois that were \nneedlessly held vacant since this summer by partisan delay tactics. \nTheir service to the American people has been unnecessarily delayed by \nover four months.\n  In the Central District of California, there are over 12,000 cases \npending before its judges, and in the Northern District of Illinois \nthere are close to 11,000 cases pending before its judges. Every single \njudge in each district has approximately 450 or more cases pending on \ntheir dockets. This enormous backlog of cases exists in many of our \nFederal courts in this country and it means that the American people \nare not able to receive speedy justice.\n  More than twice the number of judicial vacancies exists compared to \nthe vacancies left at the end of President Bush's first term. The \nSenate should be voting on all 16 of the judicial nominees reported to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee. I have also been urging \nRepublicans to expedite consideration of the four judicial nominees who \nparticipated in hearings last Wednesday. That would lead to 20 more \nconfirmations before the Senate adjourns later this month.\n  Historically, the Senate has confirmed hundreds of judicial nominees \nwithin 14 days of their Judiciary Committee hearings, including more \nthan 600 confirmed since World War II within just one week of their \nhearings. In contrast, obstruction by Senate Republicans has caused \nPresident Obama's district court nominees to wait an average of 103 \ndays for a Senate vote after being reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nwhich Committee consideration has itself often been delayed 30 days or \nmore after their hearings. This destructive practice of delaying for no \ngood reason should be abandoned.\n  Republican filibusters and pocket filibusters are also preventing \nvotes on circuit court nominees who should be confirmed by consensus \nbefore the Senate adjourns for the year. For example, one of the \nnominations Senate Republicans are holding up is that of Judge Robert \nBacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, who they filibustered \nearlier this year. Senator Coburn, one of his home state Senators, \nsaid: ``He has no opposition in the Senate. . . . There's no reason why \nhe shouldn't be confirmed.'' That also applies to Richard Taranto, who \nwas reported more than eight months ago to a vacancy on the Federal \nCircuit. That applies to William Kayatta of Maine, who was reported \nnearly eight months ago and has the support of his two home state \nRepublican Senators.\n  After today's votes, there will still be nine judicial nominees \nstalled on the Senate Executive Calendar who were reported before the \nAugust recess, and who should have been confirmed months ago. Most are \nconsensus nominees. All have the support of both their home state \nSenators, including their home state Republican Senators. The Senate \nshould be voting to confirm all these nominees before the Senate \nadjourns for the year.\n  When George W. Bush was President, Senate Democrats cooperated in \nmoving judicial nominees quickly through the Committee and to a \nconfirmation vote at the end of the year. I did so whether I was \nChairman or the ranking member. By way of example, in 2008 we confirmed \nfive of President Bush's nominees just three days after their hearing. \nWe have often been able to do this at the end of a Congress, and this \nyear should be no exception especially given the high level of judicial \nvacancies plaguing our Federal courts.\n  Judge Fernando Olguin is nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia, where he has\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nbeen serving as a Magistrate Judge for over a decade. He was the first \nLatino-American to serve as a Magistrate Judge in that District. Prior \nto that, Judge Olguin was in private practice for several years and \nalso served as a Trial Attorney at the Civil Rights Division of the \nU.S. Department of Justice. He earned his law degree from the \nUniversity of California at Berkley. After law school, he clerked for \nthe Honorable C.A. Muecke of the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Arizona. His nomination has the support of both his home state \nSenators. Judge Olguin was approved by the Judiciary Committee nearly \nfive months ago by voice vote.\n  Thomas Durkin is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. \nCurrently a partner at the Chicago office of Mayer Brown LLP, he also \nserved as a Federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois for \n13 years. During his time as a Federal prosecutor, he rose to become \nthe Chief of the Criminal Receiving and Appellate Division as well as \nthe Chief of the Special Prosecutions Division. From 1991 to 1993, he \nserved as the First Assistant United States Attorney of that District. \nUpon graduation from law school, he served as a law clerk for the \nHonorable Stanley J. Roszkowski of the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Illinois. The ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously gave him its highest possible rating of \n``Well Qualified.'' His nomination has the bipartisan support of his \nhome state Senators. He was approved by the Judiciary Committee more \nthan four months ago by voice vote.\n  The Senate should finally confirm these two nominees today and \nproceed to vote on all the other judicial nominees stalled on the \nSenate Executive Calendar. We can fill 10 more judicial emergency \nvacancies before adjourning this year. We can help our Federal courts \nuphold their constitutional responsibility to provide speedy justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would it be appropriate if I ask for a \nrollcall vote on Judge Durkin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will not use my entire time. If \nanybody else wants to speak, there will be time between now and 5:30 to \nspeak. I think both these nominees will be approved overwhelmingly; \nobviously, the one with the voice vote probably will be, and I think \nthe other one will be as well.\n  Today, the Senate turns to the confirmation of these two U.S. \ndistrict judges.\n\n\n                      Newtown, Connecticut Tragedy\n\n  Before I address that issue, I express my condolences to the victims \nand families in Newtown, CT. As a nation, we join to express our grief \nand to offer support and comfort to this community. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with the families who have suffered from this senseless \nact.\n  From time to time I have given my colleagues an update regarding the \nfacts of judicial confirmations. Despite our steady progress on \nconfirmations, we continue to hear complaints from bar associations, \ninterest groups, editorial boards, and even some fellow Senators. Of \ncourse, these are the same groups that remained silent or at the time \ncheered on the efforts to block judicial nominees of the previous \nPresident. Multiple filibusters, failure to hold hearings, pocket \nfilibusters of one sort or another, and other tactics of delay and \nobstruction were routinely used against President Bush's nominees. By \nthe end of his Presidency, President Bush had 53 nominees who were not \nconfirmed. That is nearly one out of every seven who were blocked. \nSomehow that history seems to have faded.\n  Today we continue to confirm this President's nominees, even in a \nlameduck Presidential election year. As I have stated before, the \nSenate rarely confirms judicial nominees during lameduck sessions in a \nPresidential election year. It did so in a very limited fashion in \n1944, 1980, and the year 2004.\n  The last time a President was reelected--President Bush in 2004--only \nthree judicial nominees were confirmed following the election.\n  That year, following President Bush's reelection, 23 judicial \nnominations that were pending either on the Senate executive calendar \nor in the Judiciary Committee were returned to the President when the \nCongress adjourned in December. Today President Obama will have 10 \nconfirmations in this lameduck session, and obviously a lameduck \nsession in a Presidential election year.\n  This is a new record. No other President can claim that success. So \nfor those who say this President is being treated differently, I must \nagree. President Obama will have the most postelection judicial \nconfirmations of any President.\n  This year has been a productive year for judicial confirmations. We \nhave already confirmed 39 district judges and 5 circuit judges. Today's \nvote meets or exceeds the confirmations for Presidential election years \nin recent memory. During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the \nSenate confirmed a total of 28 judges, 24 district and 4 circuit. This \nPresidential election year we have exceeded those numbers. We have \nconfirmed 5 circuit nominees, and these confirmations will bring the \ndistrict confirmations to 41. That is a total of 46 judges this year \nversus 28 in the last Presidential election year. In fact, going back \nto 1984, there has been only one Presidential election year in which \nmore district judges were confirmed.\n  Let me emphasize that point. In only one of the past Presidential \nelections have more district nominees been confirmed. During this \nCongress, the 112th, we have confirmed 106 judges. That is the third \nhighest total for any Congress going back to 1989 or, in other words, \nthe past 12 Congresses. In total, the Senate has confirmed 168 district \nand circuit nominees during this President's first term. So I think by \nany objective measure one would have to conclude we are treating this \nPresident and his nominees quite fairly.\n  I stated at the beginning of my remarks, I expect these nominees to \nbe fairly noncontroversial or totally noncontroversial. I intend to \nsupport them.\n  Today we vote on the nomination of Fernando M. Olguin, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of California and Thomas \nM. Durkin, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Illinois.\n  After graduating from University of California Berkeley School of Law \nin 1989, Judge Olguin clerked for the Honorable C.A. Muecke, U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge for the District of Arizona. In 1991, Judge Olguin \nbegan working as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the \nUnited States Department of Justice. There he prosecuted violations of \nthe Fair Housing Act and the Public Accommodations Act.\n  From 1995 to 2001, Judge Olguin was a partner at Traber, Voorhees & \nOlguin, where he litigated housing and employment cases on behalf of \nunderprivileged clients. Since 2001 he has served as a United States \nMagistrate Judge for the Central District of California.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a rating of Substantial Majority Qualified, Minority \nNot Qualified.\n  Mr. Durkin received his B.S. with honors from University of Illinois \nat Champaign-Urbana in 1975 and his J.D. with honors from DePaul \nUniversity College of Law in 1978. Upon graduation, he clerked for \nStanley J. Roszkowski, United States District Court Judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois. After his clerkship, Mr. Durkin joined \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois. \nThere, he handled a variety of cases, including bank robbery, postal \ntheft, narcotics, immigration cases, firearms cases, commodities, \nsecurities and tax fraud, and political corruption. Mr. Durkin also \nheld a number of supervisory roles in the office, including Deputy \nChief of Special Prosecutions, Chief of the Criminal Receiving and \nAppellate Division, Chief of the Special\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\nProsecutions Division, and First Assistant United States Attorney.\n  In 1993, Mr. Durkin joined Mayer Brown and focused on white collar \ncriminal defense, internal investigations, patent litigation, \nsecurities litigation, civil rights litigation, consumer class action \nlitigation, and product liability litigation. According to his \nquestionnaire, Mr. Durkin has exclusively been a litigator and has \nfrequently been in court his entire career. He estimates that he has \ntried approximately 95 cases to verdict.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a Unanimous Well Qualified rating.\n  I support these nominees and congratulate them on their votes for \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending on the Senate calendar today for \nconsideration is the nomination of Tom Durkin to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District Court of Illinois.\n  Tom Durkin is a consensus bipartisan nominee. Senator Kirk and I \nstrongly support his nomination. We believe he has all of the necessary \nattributes to be an effective Federal judge. Our view was shared by \nbipartisan screening committees in Illinois. Senator Kirk's committee, \nand my own committee, recommended Tom Durkin.\n  It is no secret that he has the qualifications, independence, and \nintegrity to serve in a distinguished manner on the bench. The \nnonpartisan American Bar Association has awarded Mr. Durkin its highest \nrating of unanimously well-qualified.\n  Throughout his career Tom Durkin has demonstrated strong leadership \nin his community and a solid commitment to public service.\n  A native of Chicago, Tom received his bachelor's degree with honors \nfrom the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and received his \nJ.D. with honors from DePaul University College of Law. After \ngraduating from law school, he served for 2 years as law clerk to the \nHonorable Stanley J. Roszkowski, a personal friend of mine, and an \nexcellent judge for the District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois.\n  Following his clerkship, Mr. Durkin joined the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the Northern District of Illinois where he worked for 13 years and \nserved in numerous leadership positions, including first assistant U.S. \nattorney. He joined the law firm of Mayer Brown as a partner in 1993 \nwhere he works to this day. His practice concentrates on complex \ncommercial litigation and criminal defense. He has received numerous \nawards, including listings in ``The Best Lawyers in America'' and \n``Illinois Super Lawyers.''\n  Mr. Durkin also has an impressive record of community service. He \nserved for 9 years on the board of Legal Assistance Foundation in \nChicago, and for nearly a decade he was the chair of Mayer Brown's pro \nbono committee. He has also taught as an adjunct professor of law at \nDePaul and at the John Marshall Law School.\n  Tom Durkin was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous \nvote on August 2, 4\\1/2\\ months ago. I am relieved we are finally \nmoving ahead with his confirmation. This vacancy, incidentally, has \nbeen declared a judicial emergency, and I am glad it is now going to be \nfilled.\n  In closing, I wish to note that he comes from an extraordinary \nfamily, well known throughout Chicago, and especially in legal circles. \nThere is only one black sheep in the family; it is Tom's brother, Jim, \na Republican State representative who ran against me for the Senate in \n2002 the famous Durkin-Durbin race in Illinois. But we ended that race \nfriends. I have great respect for Jim and Tom Durkin and for their \nwhole family.\n  I wish Tom Durkin the very best and commend his nomination to my \ncolleagues. I believe he will be an excellent Federal court judge and I \nam glad he and several other Federal district court nominees are going \nto be confirmed this week.\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I offer my strong support for Thomas \nDurkin to fill one of the four vacancies on the U.S. District Court in \nthe Northern District of Illinois.\n  Because of his outstanding experience and record of public service, I \nsubmitted Thomas Durkin's candidacy to the White House in July 2011, \nfollowing the recommendation of my nonpartisan Judicial Review \nCommission. Senator Durbin had previously forwarded Mr. Durkin's name \nto President Obama in 2009, based on the recommendation of his \nscreening committee.\n  The judgeship for which Mr. Durkin has been nominated is considered a \n``judicial emergency'' by the Judicial Conference of the United States. \nConfirmation of this qualified nominee will ease the backlog of cases \nand allow the dispensation of justice in a fair and timely manner.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this bipartisan nomination and confirm Mr. Durkin to the \nFederal bench.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Fernando Olguin, whom I recommended to President \nObama to be a U.S. District Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia after he earned a strong recommendation from my bipartisan \njudicial selection committee.\n  Born and raised in the greater Los Angeles community of Azusa, Judge \nOlguin lives in the Los Angeles area today.\n  He is a graduate of Harvard University and the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley School of Law.\n  After serving for 2 years as a law clerk to a Federal district court \njudge in Arizona, Judge Olguin joined the U.S. Department of Justice \nthrough the Attorney General's Honors Program.\n  From 1991 through 1994, Judge Olguin served as a trial attorney in \nthe Civil Rights Division in Washington, DC, enforcing numerous Federal \nstatutes, including the Fair Housing Act and the Public Accommodations \nAct.\n  He then joined the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nor MALDEF, serving as its national education program director from 1994 \nto 1995 in Washington, DC.\n  Judge Olguin then came back to California, becoming a partner at the \nlaw firm Traber, Voorhees, and Olguin, where he practiced civil \nlitigation from 1995 to 2001.\n  He was appointed to serve as a magistrate judge in 2001, where he has \nbuilt a stellar record. In his 11 years on the bench, he has managed a \ndocket of hundreds of cases at a time and issued hundreds of published \nopinions, as well as nearly 2,000 decisions and orders.\n  In 2011, he had the best record of any magistrate judge on the court \nat working with litigants to settle their disputes. This is very \nimportant in a busy district like the Central District, whose judges \ncarry the seventh-highest civil caseload in the Nation.\n  Judge Olguin is well respected in the L.A. community, and he is \nsupported by the law enforcement community including L.A.P.D. Chief \nCharlie Beck, L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca, and the Los Angeles Police \nProtective League.\n  Chief Beck says Judge Olguin's record ``has been characterized by \nfairness, thoroughness, sound judgment, and evenness of temperament.''\n  In short, Judge Olguin is well-qualified, seasoned, and fair. I am \nvery proud to support him, and I urge my colleagues to support him as \nwell.\n  I also want to urge the confirmations of other judicial nominees from \nmy home State, many of which have been pending on the executive \ncalendar for months.\n  Including Judge Olguin, four of the 13 District Court nominees on the \nexecutive calendar are from California. The other nominees are: \nSuperior Court Judge Jon Tigar and Bill Orrick, nominees to the \nNorthern District recommended by Senator Boxer; and Superior Court \nJudge Troy Nunley, a nominee to the Eastern District whom I recommended \nto the President.\n  All three were approved by bipartisan votes in the Judiciary \nCommittee, two of them by voice vote.\n  Each of these districts is in a judicial emergency according to the \nJudicial Conference of the United States.\n  The Northern District's caseload is over 20 percent above the \nnational average. It now takes over 50 percent longer for a case to go \nto trial than it did a year ago in the Northern District, which hears \nsome of our country's most complex technology cases.\n  The Eastern District is the most overworked district in the Nation by \nfar. With over 1,100 weighted filings per\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\njudgeship, its caseload is over twice the national average.\n  With this extreme crisis, I especially urge my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to allow Judge Troy Nunley to be confirmed this \nyear.\n  Judge Nunley essentially was a career prosecutor and State Department \nof Justice lawyer before joining the State bench over 10 years ago. He \nis highly qualified and experienced. He also earned unanimous support \nin the Judiciary Committee, so he is uncontroversial.\n  I am very pleased we recently confirmed Jesus Bernal to the Central \nDistrict, and I urge my colleagues to support Judge Olguin as well.\n  My State--more than any other--urgently needs us to take prompt \naction on judicial nominees. I am pleased with the progress we have \nmade in the lameduck, and I very much hope the three other California \nnominees who remain on the calendar will be confirmed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to offer my support for the \nconfirmation of Magistrate Judge Fernando M. Olguin to the U.S. \ndistrict court for the Central District of California.\n  Judge Olguin was recommended to the President by my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, and will be a great addition to California's Central \nDistrict.\n  Judge Olguin will bring to the bench his broad experience as a \nskilled lawyer and a Federal magistrate. A graduate of Harvard \nUniversity and the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, \nJudge Olguin worked from 1995 to 2001 as a partner for the law firm of \nTraber, Voorhees, and Olguin. In 2001, he received an appointment to \nbecome a magistrate judge in the Central District of California, where \nhe has served with great distinction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Olguin nomination.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Passing of Senator Inouye\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise with a real heavy heart. Our friend, \nDan Inouye, just died.\n  I have never known anyone like Dan Inouye. No one else has. The \nkindness he has shown me during my time here in the Senate is something \nI will cherish always. He was a man who has lived and breathed the \nSenate. If there were ever a patriot, Dan Inouye was that patriot.\n  A week ago last Friday he and I spent some time together in his \noffice, just the two of us alone. We spent an hour together, and we \nended the meeting with both of us saying: You know, we need to do this \nagain. Well, I won't be able to do that again. He won't be able to do \nthat again.\n  He was a wonderful Senator, brave soldier, a recipient of the Medal \nof Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Bronze Star, and Purple \nHeart. He left an arm in Italy. He said to me at that last meeting \ntogether, when I asked him: Dan, did anything else happen to you, other \nthan your arm? He said: Yeah, I got shot in the gut--that is what he \nsaid--and the leg a couple of times.\n  We will all miss him, and that is a gross understatement. I wish I \nwere capable of saying more, but that is all I can say. I have talked \nto his wife Irene. She is there, with his son. We have known for a few \nhours this wasn't working out well for Senator Inouye. But he was \ncertainly one of the giants of the Senate.\n  I remember what he said when his son asked why he fought the way he \ndid after having been declared an enemy alien. He said he did it for \nthe children. That was Senator Inouye. His commitment to our Nation \nwill never be surpassed. His service in the Senate will be with the \ngreats of this body.\n  Now I should ask my friend if he wishes to speak upon this issue. It \nwould be my hope the two votes that are scheduled could both be done--\nthese judges--by voice vote. I don't think it is appropriate to record \na vote at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two judges be \napproved by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we all, at a subsequent time--I just \ntalked to his wife and walked out here--will have some more formal \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I too am going to address the \nremarkable life of Senator Inouye at a later time, but I did want to \nmake some observations here for a few moments at the time of his \npassing.\n  Senator Inouye was a man who, as we all know, rarely called attention \nto himself but who lived a remarkable American life filled with the \ndignity and grace of the true hero he was.\n  He was only 17 when he heard the sirens over Honolulu and saw the \ngreat planes flying overhead. At the time he dreamed of being a \nsurgeon. A few years later a medic would be taking care of him after \nhis heroic action in the Italian mountains, for which he would one day \nreceive our Nation's most prestigious award for military valor.\n  Dan Inouye's dream of being a surgeon was not realized but there were \nother things in store. Instead, he became a member of one of the most \ndecorated U.S. military units in American history and one of our \nNation's longest serving and finest Senators.\n  An iconic political figure of his beloved Hawaii, and the only \noriginal member of the congressional delegation still serving in \nCongress, he was a man who had every reason to call attention to \nhimself but who never did.\n  He was the kind of man, in short, that America has always been \ngrateful to have, especially in our darkest hours--men who lead by \nexample and who expect nothing in return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't mention, and I should have, but I \nreally have been waiting the last hour or so to make sure it was okay \nwith his wife that I come and say something, so I haven't had time to \ndo much other than feel bad about Senator Inouye.\n  As I indicated, I talked to Irene. I wasn't able to talk to Ken, but \nI did talk to Irene. I want to make sure everyone understands the depth \nof my feelings--and I know I am speaking for the entire Senate. Dan \nInouye believed in me, even more than I believed in myself. Many, many \nyears ago--a couple of decades ago--he said: You know, you're going to \ndo great things in the Senate, and he always talked about my leading \nthe Senate. And he always came and said: You did the right thing. He \nwould always tell you that you would do the right thing.\n  The chapter of Dan Inouye in the Senate is something that is \nremarkable, not only his military record but what he did with the \ndefense aspects of our country, the security aspects of our country. \nAnd there was no one more bipartisan than Senator Inouye.\n  He has a brother who lives in Las Vegas, and a wonderful person he \nis, but he was as close to Ted Stevens as he was to any person could be \nto a brother.

Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nInternational Human Rights Day. Sixty-four years ago this past Monday, \non December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration enunciates a \ndoctrine that serves as a foundation for human rights initiatives \ninternationally and as an enduring guide for human rights advocates \naround the globe.\n  On this annual celebration of International Human Rights Day, human \nrights defenders, champions of democracy, promoters of civil rights, \nand advocates of free speech across the globe can also be encouraged by \nCongress's recent passage of landmark human rights legislation. Last \nweek, the Senate passed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability \nAct, which the House passed in September in conjunction with approving \npermanent normal trade relations for Russia.\n  The Magnitsky Act was inspired by the tragic case of Sergei \nMagnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian lawyer who uncovered massive \ncorruption in Russia and then was arrested for his whistleblowing. \nMagnitsky died in 2009 after suffering torturous conditions in pretrial \ndetention. Those implicated in the corruption Magnitsky exposed and \nthose responsible for his torture and death have not been brought to \njustice, and some have even been decorated and promoted. The Magnitsky \nAct goes beyond the specific violators in this case to prohibit all \ngross violators of human rights in Russia from traveling to the United \nStates and from using our financial system.\n  President Obama is now poised to reaffirm our Nation's commitment to \nuniversal human rights by signing the Magnitsky Act into law. With the \nstroke of a pen, the President will set a new global standard that \nother nations are sure to follow. The act sets a precedent that can be \napplied to human rights abusers around the world, and I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues in the next Congress to apply the Magnitsky \nsanctions globally. Human rights violators from Kinshasa to Beijing are \nnow on notice that the United States stands in solidarity with those \nwhose rights are trampled and will deny the legitimizing privileges of \ntravelling to our country and accessing our financial system to those \nwho violate fundamental freedoms.\n  The United States remains the global leader in promoting and \nprotecting human rights, but we need to do more. We need to ensure that \nwomen across the world have the liberty to determine the course and \nscope of their own lives and futures and that they have the tools to \nachieve their full potential. The horrific and cowardly attempt by \nassassins to silence the brave leadership of 15-year-old Malala \nYousufzai must not be left unchallenged. We must take up her cause--the \neducation of girls and women--and support both that goal and its \nadvocates, and we must redouble our efforts to protect the rights of \nethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities, from the Christians in \nEgypt to the Roma population in Europe.\n  As the legendary Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel has said, ``Wherever men \nand women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political \nviews, that place must--at that moment--become the center of the \nuniverse.'' This International Human Rights Day, the U.S. Congress \nsends a strong message to human rights defenders around the world that \nwe stand in solidarity with them as they dare to stand up to injustice \nand oppression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8067-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CHOBANI YOGURT\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, my colleague, Senator Mike Crapo, joins \nme in recognizing the opening this month of the Chobani Yogurt \nproduction facility in Twin Falls, ID.\n  This facility, Chobani's first in Idaho, will be capable of producing \n4.2 million cases of yogurt per week at full capacity. All of the milk \nused to produce the yogurt will come from Idaho dairy farms and at the \npeak of production will use millions of pounds of milk a day.\n  The 950,000-square-foot production facility was constructed by more \nthan 1,000 workers and will employ between 400 and 500 people next \nyear. More than 300 new jobs have already been created in Twin Falls. \nIt was built at a cost of $450 million and is now the largest yogurt \nplant in the world.\n  From its founding in 2005, the Chobani company started with 5 \nemployees and now has more than 1,800 employees worldwide, with more \nthan 1,600 in the United States. Their founder and CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, \nis an American success story, having immigrated to the United States \nfrom Turkey in 1994.\n  Like many businesses in Idaho, Chobani will be involved in local \ncharitable work. Chobani's biggest impact, however, will be in \nproviding well-paying jobs and economic growth through manufacturing a \ndelicious and healthy product available throughout the country.\n  Chobani recognized the many benefits to locating in Idaho--among them \nthe quality milk produced by our Idaho dairy families, a commonsense \nregulatory environment and hard-working Idahoans who will make the \nfacility a great success.\n  Senator Crapo and I also recognize the many entities that worked with \nChobani to make their opening a reality. Elected officials from Twin \nFalls County and the City of Twin Falls worked tirelessly on the \nproject, as did the Southern Idaho Economic Development Organization. \nThe Twin Falls Chamber of Commerce and the Twin Falls Urban Renewal \nDistrict also played a major role in the effort. The State of Idaho and \nits Department of Commerce helped in the process, and the end result is \nnot only the direct jobs at Chobani, but also a multiplier effect of \nmore than 3,000 additional jobs in the State.\n  Today, we congratulate Chobani on the opening of their new plant and \nsalute all of the partners and community leaders on a job well done. We \nwelcome Chobani to the great State of Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8067-5", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8067-S8068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING CARMEN WARSCHAW\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Carmen Harvey Warschaw, the great California \nphilanthropist and political leader who died at age 95 on election day, \na week after she had made sure to vote by mail. Carmen was a trusted \nmentor, adviser, and dear friend to me, and I will miss her.\n  Carmen Harvey was born in Los Angeles in 1917. Her parents had \nimmigrated to America from Lithuania, and her father founded the Harvey \nAluminum Company. Carmen grew up in La Canada, graduated from the \nUniversity of Southern California, and married Louis Warschaw, her high \nschool sweetheart.\n  From an early age, both Carmen and Lou were active in the California \nDemocratic Party. Throughout the\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nyears, Carmen worked tirelessly to elect Democrats at the local, State, \nand national level. She attended every Democratic National Convention \nfrom 1948 to 2008, many as a delegate. In the mid sixties she served as \nthe party's Southern California chairwoman, was a member of the \nDemocratic National Committee, the first woman to chair the California \nFair Employment Practices Commission, and a board member of \nCalifornia's coastal and fair housing commissions.\n  Carmen's passion for politics was equaled by her compassion and \nphilanthropy. She was an active member of many organizations, including \nthe Los Angeles Music Center, the Truman Library Institute, the Jewish \nFederation of Greater Los Angeles, and the Women's Guild and Helping \nHand of Los Angeles.\n  Carmen long served as a member of the board of directors at Cedars-\nSinai, where she endowed medical and research chairs and founded the \nPROs, which funds the Louis Warschaw Prostate Cancer Center. Two years \nago, at age 93, Carmen joined me on a tour of the Cedars-Sinai \nEmergency Room and Operating Room; I remember joking that she was the \nonly person I knew who could get me to put on scrubs.\n  Carmen was also very generous to her alma mater, USC, where she and \nLou helped to establish the Casden Institute for the Study of the \nJewish Role in American Life and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of \nPolitics at USC. In 2003, Carmen endowed a chair in practical politics \nat the Unruh Institute so that students could learn about the nuts and \nbolts of politics as part of their political science education.\n  This world and Carmen's beloved State of California are much better \nplaces thanks to her passion, compassion, and commitment. On behalf of \nthe people of California, I send my deepest gratitude and condolences \nto her daughters, Hope and Susan; her sons-in-law, John Law and Carl \nRobertson; her grandchildren, Jack Law-Warschaw, Cara Robertson, and \nChip Robertson; and her great-grandchildren and many friends. We will \nall miss this dynamic force of nature and extraordinary woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8068-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PETER N.

As a member of the ``Mighty Five,'' a group of veterans living \nin Las Vegas, Pvt.

I am grateful for his service to defend \ndemocracy around the world and will continue to do everything within my \npower to ensure that Filipino veterans are honored for their \nsacrifices.\n  Pvt. Romeo Barreras fought bravely for our country and yet was not \nable to qualify for the military benefits he earned and deserved. That \nis why I introduced the Filipino Veterans Fairness Act, to establish a \nprocess for Filipinos who have fought alongside the U.S. military \nduring World War II to work with military historians to determine \neligibility for military benefits. We have a responsibility to ensure \nthat individuals who served honorably alongside U.S. troops are \nrecognized for their contributions to our Nation.\n  I am humbled to have known Pvt.

CALLIES\n\n Madam JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to LTC Kevin K. Callies, upon his retirement from the South \nDakota Air National Guard. Lieutenant Colonel Callies has served as the \nfinancial manager for the 114th Fighter Wing in Sioux Falls, SD, since \n2003. His career with the South Dakota Air National Guard has spanned a \nperiod of over 30 years.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Callies began his career in the South Dakota Air \nNational Guard in 1977 as a traditional guardsman in personnel. In \n1978, he transitioned to finance, where he would spend most of his \ncareer. In 1988, while working full time, he earned a bachelor of \nscience in business administration from National College, now known as \nNational American University. After almost 17 years of enlisted \nservice, he received his commission through the Academy of Military \nScience in 1993.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Callies excelled in the field of finance, with \npositions in civilian pay, military pay, accounting, and budget. His \nsuperior knowledge of financial management has earned him numerous \nawards locally and nationally. In both 1997 and 2004, Lieutenant \nColonel Callies's unit, the 114th Fighter Wing, was named Air National \nGuard Financial Management and Comptroller Office of the year. As one \nof the best financial managers in the Air National Guard, the National \nGuard Bureau and the Pentagon have sought out his expertise.\n  He served as a member of the Resource Protection Team, RPT, and held \nthe position of commander from 1993 to 2002. While on the RPT he dealt \nwith security issues related to the September 11 attacks, visits by the \nPresident, and forest fires. In 2002, Lieutenant Colonel Callies \naccepted a position as logistics manager, where he was in charge of all \nthe activation activities, expeditionary combat support, and deployment \nfunctions of the 114th Fighter Wing during their deployment to Turkey \nto support Operation Northern Watch. After serving as logistics \nmanager, he returned to finance and in 2010 was deployed to Haiti to \nassist with a Joint Command financial management mission with the U.S. \nArmy.\n  It is an honor for me to share Lieutenant Colonel Callies's \naccomplishments with my colleagues and publicly commend him for his \nhard work and the many years of dedicated service he has given the \nSouth Dakota Air National Guard and our Nation. I wish Kevin a happy \nand healthy retirement with his wife Joyce and their four \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8068-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8068-S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GENERAL TARBET\n\n Mr. LEE. Madam President, today I wish to honor one of Utah's \nfinest, MG Brian Tarbet, the Adjutant General of the Utah National \nGuard. After 12 years of leadership with the Utah National Guard and 39 \nyears of highly decorated service in the United States Military, \nGeneral Tarbet is retiring, closing a transformative chapter in Utah's \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\n  General Tarbet's military career began in the U.S. Army Reserve in \n1973, where he served on active duty until 1975 and then joined the \nArmy National Guard in 1976. From 1976 he served in the 142nd Military \nIntelligence Battalion and was then appointed Commander of the 300th \nMilitary Intelligence Linguist Brigade in 1993. He led the 97th Troop \nCommand in 1996 and from September of 2001 he directed the \nmobilization, deployment and redeployment of virtually all units of the \nUtah Army and Air National Guard in support of the Global War on \nTerrorism. The Utah National Guard has units that specialize in \nintelligence, special forces and aviation which have been particularly \nimportant to the War on Terrorism, and in 2003-2004, 80 percent of \nUtah's reserve units were mobilized or on alert, which was among the \nhighest in the National Guard. The Guard also provided assistance in \nthe gulf coast in 2005 to the victims of hurricanes Rita and Katrina \nand to the U.S.-Mexico border in support of Customs and Border \nprotection operations.\n  General Tarbet's awards and achievements include the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement \nMedal, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, National Defense \nService Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Military \nOutstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the \nArmy Service Ribbon, the Army Reserve Components Overseas Training \nRibbon, Utah Medal of Merit, Utah Joint Commendation Medal, Utah \nAchievement Ribbon, Utah Joint Staff Service Ribbon, Utah State \nPartnership Program Service Ribbon, Utah Service Ribbon, Utah Emergency \nService Ribbon, and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games Service Ribbon.\n  In 2002, just months after the September 11th terrorist attacks, Salt \nLake City was slated to host the Winter Olympic games. Security was a \ntremendous concern with talk of cancelling the games altogether. With \nthe entire nation on high alert, General Tarbet commanded 4,500 \nNational Guardsmen from 25 States in the security operation. The games \nwere a tremendous success, and the security was lauded for its \neffectiveness and unobtrusiveness. The games served as a triumphant \nAmerican moment at a time when the nation needed it most.\n  The good will of the Utah National Guard extends far beyond the \nborders of our own State, and guided the men and women of the Guard to \nplaces where their service was needed most. Winston Churchill said, \n``The price of greatness is responsibility.'' General Tarbet has seen \nmore than his fair share of difficult tasks and responsibilities and \nhas performed each admirably. I believe every soldier who has had the \nopportunity to serve under his charge would agree that he has been a \nleader of unprecedented character. The greatest commendation came from \none of Tarbet's own soldiers, who said, ``Major General Tarbet is loved \nby his soldiers. He has served us with impeccable integrity, courage \nand common sense during a very tumultuous and unprecedented time.'' \nSharon and I thank Major General Tarbet for his service and wish him \nand his wife Mary all the best as they enter the next chapter of their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8069-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING WARREN E.

Britcher, a veteran of World War II and former manager of the \nSenate restaurant, passed away at the age of 91.\n  Warren Britcher was born and raised in Springfield, OH. He proudly \nserved in World War II as a T4 sergeant in the U.S. Army, eventually \nmanaging the kitchen of Fort McClellan, one of the largest Army \ninstallations during World War II. After serving in the Army, Warren \nwent to work for Canteen Food Service, where he held various managerial \nassignments. In August of 1950, Warren came to Washington, DC, to serve \nas manager of the Senate restaurant, where he oversaw the inaugural \nluncheon of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Afterward, he became \nthe operations manager for Yankee Stadium Foods and Concessions before \nopening his own restaurant and catering establishment, Swiss Town \nHouse, in my hometown, Union City, NJ. He left his restaurant in 1977 \nto pursue a new position at Yonkers Raceway and later supervised the \nUSS Intrepid Air and Space Museum food service. Prior to his retirement \nto Florida, he created Britcher Concession Corporation.\n  Warren was the devoted husband of the late Dorothy Mae Lighthiser \nBritcher and the father of Sherrie Ahrens, Drew Britcher, and the late \nWarren Britcher, Jr. He was the proud grandfather to four \ngrandchildren, Douglas, Craig, Sean, and Caitlin Anne, and had four \ngreat grandchildren. He will be laid to rest at Ferncliff Cemetery in \nhis hometown of Springfield, OH.\n  Warren's service to our Nation and his contributions to the food \nservice industry will not be forgotten. My sympathies go out to \nWarren's two surviving children, Sherrie and Drew, and his \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8069-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8069-S8070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOSS OF DR. MARSHALL LONDON\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today to take note of the \ndeath of a remarkable resident from my State of Vermont, Dr. Marshall \nLondon. Dr. London was one of the most prominent citizens in \nBurlington, VT. A deeply beloved physician, he was also a lifelong \nprogressive and a liberal.\n  A native of Vermont, he attended the University of Vermont, where in \n1948 he served as the campus organizer for the Progressive Party \nnominee for President, Henry Wallace. He served as a flight surgeon in \nthe US Air Force from 1961-1963. In the late 1960s, Marshall London and \nhis family volunteered in support of Caesar Chavez's United Farm \nworkers. He provided medical services to migrant workers in Delano, CA.\n  In 1970 he returned to his native Burlington with his wife and \nchildren. A lifelong supporter of universal health care, Dr. London was \ncommitted to serving the underserved and the elderly. Not only did he \nmake house calls, but in addition to his medical bag he regularly \ncarried plumbing and electrical tools to make home repairs for his \npatients. In the early 1990s, Dr. London, as President of the Jewish \nCommunity Council of Burlington, worked to resettle emigres from the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  He never severed his ties to the UVM Medical School, where he \ncontinued to serve as a mentor and teacher at the Fletcher Allen \nHospital, even after he retired in 1997.\n  In a time when corporate values have spread beyond business to such \nareas as education and health care, Marshall London serves an enduring \nexample that there are other values which can guide human life. He was \na caring physician, one who always charted his course by paying \nattention to those most in need, and always depending on an exemplary \nsocial conscience. He was dedicated to his family. And he did not \nrestrict his life to work. Dr. London was an alto saxophone player in \nthe Vermont Catamount Band and Burlington City Band. He was also an \navid tennis player and skier. Like so many Vermonters--and he was a \nfifth-generation Vermonter--he was also a loyal Red Sox fan.\n  Dr. Marshall will be missed, though the example of his life and \nvalues will endure.\n  I ask that Dr. London's obituary be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n                   [From the Burlington Free Press, \n                             Dec. 13, 2012]\n\n                           Marshall G. London\n\n       Burlington.--Marshall G. London, a fifth generation \n     Burlingtonian, beloved family man and dedicated local \n     physician who made house calls an integral part of his \n     practice, died at home on Dec. 12, 2012. He was 83.\n       The grandson of a founding member of Burlington's first \n     synagogue, Ahavath Gerim, Marshall was a featured participant \n     in the recent Vermont Public Television documentary ``Little \n     Jerusalem.''\n       He took pride in his local roots and Jewish heritage, and \n     had an enduring passion for Jewish history, and a strong \n     commitment to Israel.\n       He was born and raised in Burlington's Old North End. He \n     graduated in 1951 from the University of Vermont, where he \n     was president of the Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity. Always \n     staunchly liberal in his politics, Marshall was a campus \n     organizer of the 1948 presidential campaign for Progressive \n     Party candidate Henry Wallace.\n       He and Susanne (Sue) Abrams were married in 1953 and had \n     six children.\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\n       Marshall began his medical career with an internship at the \n     Mary Fletcher Hospital, followed by a residency at Mount Zion \n     Hospital in San Francisco, Calif. Subsequently, he served as \n     a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force in South Carolina. \n     From 1961 to 1963, he completed a rheumatology fellowship at \n     the Manchester Royal Infirmary in England, which included \n     clinic visits across Europe. With children in tow, the \n     London's camped in their VW bus from Lapland to Italy.\n       After returning to Burlington from England, they moved to \n     California, where Marshall joined a private practice in Los \n     Gatos. During this time, he volunteered in support of Cesar \n     Chavez's United Farm Workers, providing medical service to \n     migrant workers in Delano, Calif. In 1970, Marshall and his \n     family again returned to Burlington, where he opened a \n     private practice on Orchard Terrace.\n       A lifelong advocate of universal healthcare, he was \n     committed to providing for the underserved and the elderly, \n     and he volunteered as a mentor and teacher at the medical \n     school for many years. He made house calls equipped with his \n     medical bag, and sometimes with plumbing or electrical tools \n     to assist with all manner of repairs.\n       He retired in 1997, but continued, even in recent months, \n     attending Grand Rounds at the hospital and visiting former \n     patients in their homes.\n       An alto saxophone player in the Vermont Catamount Band and \n     Burlington City Band, he was also an avid tennis player, \n     skier, and loyal Red Sox fan.\n       He and Sue traveled frequently, visiting Israel and often \n     tent-camping in Newfoundland and Labrador. They made many \n     friends in their travels, and their 19th-century home bustles \n     year-round with family and friends old and new.\n       Like his parents and grandparents before him, Marshall was \n     a devoted member of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue for many years. \n     He later joined Chabad of Vermont, where, closer to the \n     traditional roots of his grandfathers, he found new spiritual \n     and intellectual inspiration.\n       He is survived by his wife, Susanne; children, Rebecca and \n     Aaron Goldberg of Burlington, Saul and Georgette London of \n     Highland Park, N.J., Sara London and Dean Albarelli of \n     Northampton, Mass., Naomi London of Burlington, Daniel and \n     Andrea London of Evanston, Ill., and Rachel London and Matt \n     Bohner of Brooklyn, N.Y.; foster daughter, Linda and Jim \n     Nyema-Davies of Greensboro, N.C.; grandchildren and great-\n     grandchildren, Dinah and Joshua; Jesse and Emily; Tamar and \n     Isaac; Ilana and Jonny, and children, Maya, Nitzan and Yoav; \n     Tova and Shmuel and daughters, Bracha and Tehila; Amalia and \n     David, and son, Ruby; Ziva and Daniel, and son, Avromy; Jack, \n     Matan, Yonah, Liora, Cooper and Cali.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8070-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8070-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8070-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2013 BUDGET AND FINANCIAL PLAN, \n RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON DECEMBER 14, 2012--PM 63\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by \nsection 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and \nGovernmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting \nthe District of Columbia's fiscal year (FY) 2013 Budget and Financial \nPlan.

A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce S. 3685, The \nDepartment of the Interior Tribal Self-Governance Act of 2012. I am \nproud to introduce this bill and I am thankful for the cosponsorship of \nmy friend and colleague, the Vice Chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Barrasso. The Department of the Interior Tribal \nSelf-Governance Act of 2012 is an important next step in our Federal \npolicy of recognizing and supporting tribal self-governance.\n  Our country's Native peoples have always had the right to govern \nthemselves. When the earliest explorers arrived in the New World, they \nrecognized the sovereignty of the Native peoples they met. Soon after, \nEuropean colonial nations began entering into treaties with Indian \ntribes as they expanded into the American continent. It is clear, from \nthe terms of the Constitution, our Founding Fathers understood the \nsovereign authority of tribes, and their capacity to be self-governing. \nFrom our earliest days as a Nation, we entered into treaties with the \nIndian tribes, just as we did with a diversity of foreign nations, \ngoverning issues such as trade, peace, and other relations.\n  With our westward expansion, and as public sentiment and Federal \npolicy objectives turned to Manifest Destiny during the 19th century, \nFederal policies toward our Country's first peoples changed, and the \nmovement to remove and assimilate the Native peoples began. The United \nStates, recognizing the sovereignty of tribes, again relied on treaties \nto facilitate the acquisition of native lands, and promised in exchange \nto provide for Indian health, education, welfare, and housing.\n  This change in Federal policy devastated Native peoples. It turned \nout that the Federal Government was not a very effective administrator \nof programs aimed at fulfilling our country's trust responsibility to \nits native peoples.\n  By the late 1960's and early 1970's Federal Indian policy shifted \nagain to one that began to reaffirm the inherent right of Native \npeoples to govern themselves and fully support them in doing so. This \npolicy became formalized by the enactment of the Indian Self-\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act in 1975, which enabled \ntribes to contract with certain Federal agencies to provide federal \nprograms to their tribal members and communities.\n  Subsequent legislation allowed tribes greater flexibility in \ndesigning and operating Indian 410 programs for tribes who have a \ndemonstrated capacity. Currently, about 60 percent of tribes carry out \nself-governance compacts with either the Department of the Interior or \nthe Indian Health Service, or both.\n  Federal reaffirmation and support of tribal sovereignty through self-\ngovernance programs has enabled tribes to generate revenues through \ntheir own business enterprises, establish their own courts and law \nenforcement systems, and remake school curricula to better meet the \nneeds of Native students. Importantly, tribes have done this without \nforced assimilation to mainstream American traditions and norms. This \nFederal focus on self-determination and self-governance has proven to \nbe the only Federal policy that has worked for Native communities. \nStudies show that self-determination policies have enabled Indian \ntribes to build strong economies, reverse decades of language loss, and \ntailor programs and services to better meet the needs of their people.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure that our policy of self-governance \nadvances to meet the needs of native peoples. As Chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, it has come to my attention that several relatively \nminor technical changes are needed to the underlying law to ensure the \ngoals of our federal policy are realized. For instance, I understand \nthat the administration of programs under both the Department of the \nInterior and the Indian Health Service can be unnecessarily cumbersome \nfor tribes due to different requirements for each. At the Committee's \nhearing on the topic of Self-Determination and Self-Governance held in \nSeptember, witnesses from the Administration and Native governments \nalike lauded the positive effects Self-Determination Era policies are \nhaving on Native communities and stressed the importance of amending \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to ensure \ntribes can manage these programs efficiently. S. 3685 will streamline \nprocesses and make it simpler for tribes to manage programs to benefit \ntheir members. It has been developed after months of tribal \nconsultation and has been a bi-partisan effort. In crafting this bill, \nwe have been careful to ensure that none of its provisions will affect \ncurrent law relating to contracting or compacting of non-BIA programs \nunder the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, or \ncongressionally approved water settlements.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with me in support of this \nimportant legislative initiative.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend, Senator \nAkaka, in sponsoring the Department of the Interior Tribal Self-\nGovernance Act of 2012.\n  Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act in 1975 to set forth a new dynamic in the Federal-tribal \nrelationship. Since then, we have seen many benefits for Indian \ncommunities as a result of the Federal Indian policy of self-\ndetermination in general and the Indian Self-Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act in particular. Indian self-determination is \none of the most successful, if not the most successful, Federal Indian \npolicies in the history of our country's relations with Indian Country.\n  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act was \namended over 20 years ago to include the Self-Governance program. Self-\nGovernance became a permanent program in the Department of the Interior \nin 1994, and it has been a resounding success. Now, as of 2012, \nhundreds of Indian tribes are participating in the Self-Governance \nprogram in one way or another.\n  It comes as no surprise to me, that the Indian tribes can administer \nthese programs on behalf of their own people far better than the \nFederal government could ever hope to administer them.\n  Nevertheless, after some 18 years, the time has come for the self-\ngovernance program to be reviewed and improved. This bill is intended \nto provide ``key improvements to the way self-governance works in the \nDepartment of the Interior, improvements that have been studied, \nevaluated, discussed, and negotiated by the tribes and by the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  During the course of this Congress, some issues did arise relating to \nthe\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nself-governance program in Interior agencies other than the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, in particular the Bureau of Reclamation. Indian tribal \nleaders and Senate staff have worked for many months to resolve those \nissues, and their efforts in that regard are incorporated into this \nbill. I believe the bill goes a long way in dealing with those issues, \nand the program will be better off as a result of these efforts.\n  I want to thank Senator Akaka, the Chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee and with whom I have worked this past Congress as Vice \nChairman, for his leadership on this bill which I support and on \nadvancing initiatives that will improve the lives of Indian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8073-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 619--TO ELECT PATRICK J.

In calculating a community's revenues while \n     determining cancellation, the Administrator shall exclude \n     revenues for special districts and any other revenues that \n     are required by law to be disbursed to other units of local \n     government or used for specific purposes more limited than \n     the scope allowed by the General Fund. In calculating a \n     community's expenses, the Administrator shall include \n     disaster-related capital expenses for which the community has \n     not been reimbursed by Federal or insurance proceeds, debt \n     service expenses, and accrued but unpaid uncompensated \n     absences (vacation and sick pay). In calculating the \n     operating deficit of the local government, the Administrator \n     shall also consider all interfund transfers.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 246, S. 1792.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1792) to clarify the authority of the United \n     States Marshal Service to assist other Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement agencies in the investigation of cases \n     involving sex offenders and missing children.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \nbeing allowed to take up the Investigative Assistance for Violent \nCrimes Act and the Strengthening Investigations of Sex Offenders and \nMissing Children Act. These two legislative proposals will enhance \nfederal law enforcement officers' ability to investigate and solve \ncrimes. I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership and \nperseverance in working to pass these important clarifications to \nexisting federal law enforcement authorities.\n  The Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2011 clarifies \nthe authority of the FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies to \nassist state and local law enforcement upon request with investigations \nof mass killings and other instances of public violence. This important \nlegislation will help to ensure that State and local law enforcement \nagencies receive the assistance they need in times of crisis. I am \ndisappointed that this Senate bill, which was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee on November 17, 2011, with overwhelming support, \nand the companion House bill, which was passed by the House by a vote \nof 358 to 9, were held up for more than a year. I hope that there is \nstill time this session for the House to take action so that the bill \ncan be sent to the President and he can sign it into law without \nfurther delay.\n  When tragedy strikes, as with the shootings in Tucson, AZ, in 2011, \nin Aurora, CO, in 2012, and this past Friday in Newtown, CT, there \nshould be no doubt that Federal law enforcement can assist state and \nlocal police officers. The Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes \nAct will ensure that all hands can be on deck when law enforcement \nassistance is needed most.\n  The Strengthening Investigations of Sex Offenders and Missing \nChildren Act will reconcile an inconsistency in the United States \nMarshals Service's statutory authority to improve the ability of U.S. \nMarshals to investigate cases involving missing children and certain \nsex offenders. The United States Marshals Service is a key partner in \nthe investigation and prosecution of missing and exploited children, \nand we must ensure that there is no question as to the marshals' \nauthority to assist in these cases.\n  I regret that there are still Republican Senators holding up passage \nof other legislation to provide Federal assistance to state and local \nlaw enforcement that they need. Among the measures being stalled are \nthe Justice for All Reauthorization Act, the National Blue Alert Act, \nLocal Courthouse Safety Act, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nAct, and the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Award Grant Program \nReauthorization.\n  At least one Republican Senator has gone so far as to contend that it \nis unconstitutional for the Federal Government to provide assistance \nand support to State and local law enforcement. I disagree. I believe \nsuch support is essential to State and local law enforcement as they \nwork hard to protect communities in difficult times when resources from \nState and local governments are being squeezed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1792, \nthe Strengthening Investigations of Sex Offenders and Missing Children \nAct of 2011. This legislation, which is cosponsored by Senators \nSessions, Feinstein, Schumer, Klobuchar, and Blumenthal, as well as \nChairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee, would clarify the authority \nof the U.S. Marshals to help track down sex offenders and missing \nchildren. It is a simple and common sense of piece of legislation. I \nurge my fellow Senators to support it, with the hope that our \ncolleagues in the House will soon send it to the President's desk to be \nsigned into law.\n  As my colleagues know, time is of the essence when children go \nmissing. Of those children who are abducted and subsequently murdered, \n74% are killed within 3 hours of being abducted. The U.S. Marshals \nService has extensive experience with and sophisticated tools for \nquickly identifying and tracking down fugitives and missing \nindividuals. Notably, the U.S. Marshals Service has substantial \nresources for finding the fugitive sex offenders who too often are \ninvolved in child abductions.\n  As a result, state and local law enforcement and the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children often call on the marshals to assist \nin the event that a child goes missing. This bill would make it clear \nthat, upon request, the U.S. Marshals are allowed to assist in \ninvestigating these cases, even if an arrest warrant has not yet \nissued. The bill also clarifies the Marshals Service's authority to \nassist other law enforcement agencies, upon request, in investigating \nsex offender cases.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for working with me on this important \nlegislation, and my fellow Judiciary Committee members Senators \nFeinstein, Schumer, Klobuchar, and Blumenthal for supporting the bill. \nI also would like to thank Chairman Leahy for cosponsoring the bill and \nfor his leadership, both generally with respect to all his work to keep \nour children safe from predators and specifically for moving this piece \nof legislation through Committee.\n  I am confident that every member of the Senate will understand the \nclear and simple principle behind this legislation and the important \nthreat to our children that it addresses. The bill was reported by a \nvoice vote of the Judiciary Committee, I am aware of no concerns or \nopposition, and I would urge my colleagues to ensure its prompt passage \nby the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to this matter be placed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1792) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nCalendar No. 233, S. 1793.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1793) to amend title 28, United States Code, to \n     clarify the statutory authority for the longstanding practice \n     of the Department of Justice of providing investigatory \n     assistance on request of State and local authorities with \n     respect to certain serious violent crimes, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1793, the \nInvestigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, which I \nintroduced.\n  This commonsense bill clarifies that--upon the request of appropriate \nState and local law enforcement officials--select Federal law \nenforcement agencies may use their unique capabilities to help \ninvestigate and respond to mass killings and other violent crimes.\n  The measure will provide important clarity to Federal law enforcement \nofficers who are called on by State and local counterparts to assist in \nresponse to a mass shooting or other violent crime at a college campus, \nshopping mall, office building, or other public place. Currently, the \nFBI and select other Federal agencies often provide requested \nassistance to State and local law enforcement in these types of cases. \nThe absence of an explicit authorizing statute, however, has created \nconcern that agents responding to these violent crimes could be held \nliable even though their only goal was to protect the public.\n  This bill makes sure that the FBI, other law enforcement components \nat the Justice Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the \nSecret Service can provide State and local law enforcement officers \nwith assistance when so requested. In so doing, it will help State and \nlaw enforcement protect victims and solve these terrible crimes.\n  The bill does not expand the jurisdiction of Federal law enforcement \nagencies. Assistance from a Federal agency must be requested by the \nState or local authority and agreed to by Federal authorities. And the \nbill does not impose new criminal penalties or regulations.\n  The House passed a companion measure, H.R. 207, last year by a vote \nof 358 to 9. The Senate bill was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee last November, and I thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership \nin moving this legislation through Committee. Since then, I have worked \nwith Chairman Leahy, Senator Grassley, Chairman Smith of the House \nJudiciary Committee, and Representative Gowdy to improve the bill, and \nwe have reached an agreement that is reflected in a substitute \namendment.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this measure, \nso we can ensure that our dedicated law enforcement officials can \nrespond to and solve these tragic crimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nWhitehouse substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements related to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3341) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.R. 6223.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6223) to amend section 1059(e) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 to clarify \n     that a period of employment abroad by the Chief of Mission or \n     United States Armed Forces as a translator, interpreter, or \n     in a security-related position in an executive or managerial \n     capacity is to be counted as a period of residence and \n     physical presence in the United States for purposes of \n     qualifying for naturalization, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in the 111th Congress, I worked closely \nwith Senator Lugar on two pieces of legislation to improve our \nimmigration laws in small but meaningful ways. My bill, the Refugee \nOpportunity Act, would provide refugees and asylees more opportunity to \nbecome self-sustaining, productive members of their new American \ncommunities. Senator Lugar's bill, which I was proud to support, would \nhave permitted lawful permanent residents to return, without penalty to \ntheir citizenship process, to\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\ntheir country of nationality to assist in post-conflict or disaster \nreconstruction efforts. Both of these bills, the Refugee Opportunity \nAct and the Return of Talent Act, were approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in March of 2010. Unfortunately, undefined Republican \nobjections stalled the progress for both of these bipartisan bills.\n  The Refugee Opportunity Act would provide relief from the continuous \npresence requirement in the immigration law for certain refugees and \nasylees. Specifically, the legislation would waive the requirement for \nrefugees or asylees who worked overseas, if such presence outside the \nUnited States was in the service of the United States Government, \nwithin the refugee or asylee's home country, and within the protection \nof the United States Government. For refugees and asylees, in order to \nadjust from that status to lawful permanent resident status, 1 year of \ncontinuous presence in the United States is required after arrival. The \npurpose of the Refugee Opportunity Act was to permit refugees and \nasylees in the United States, who often arrive after years of \npersecution or displacement, to take employment opportunities overseas \nin service of their new government without penalty to their immigration \nprocess. The policy goal was to provide encouragement for refugees and \nasylees to take a step forward on the path to independence and self-\nsufficiency while assisting the international efforts of their adopted \ncountry.\n  The legislation that Senator Toomey has introduced, and for which he \nhas sought consent in the Senate, would provide this same relief from \nthe continuous presence requirement in the immigration law for \nrecipients of the Special Immigrant Visa. These visas are available to \nIraqi and Afghan interpreters or translators who had served the United \nStates armed forces overseas. The bill we pass today would remove \nbarriers for Special Immigrant Visa holders who, after receipt of such \na visa, wish to work again for the United States abroad. Like the \nRefugee Opportunity Act, this bill would waive the applicable presence \nrequirement that the immigrant must satisfy before adjusting his or her \nstatus while he or she was outside the United States. In fact, the \ngoals of H.R. 6223 are identical to the bill I introduced over 2 years \nago with Senator Lugar--to encourage new arrivals to America to work on \nbehalf of the United States in furthering the goals of our government \nabroad and to remove barriers to such employment and participation.\n  Although I am glad that the goals of the Refugee Opportunity Act and \nthe ideal that we do right to encourage new Americans to serve their \nadopted government are being promoted in the legislation Senator Toomey \nhas sought to pass, I regret that the same cooperation and courtesy we \ngive him today was withheld by some of Senator Toomey's fellow \nRepublican Senators when Senator Lugar and I asked for consent on our \nlegislation to achieve these same goals.\n  Mr. REID. I now ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6223) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/17/senate-section/article/S8088-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8088-S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMENDING THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader. Today, the Senate lost, \nAmerica, and especially his beloved citizens of Hawaii lost a unique, \nbrave, wonderful legislator, a man who brought to this institution the \nmost unique credentials I would argue probably of anyone who has ever \nserved in this pretty diverse body.\n  Dan Inouye was born of Japanese parents who came to Hawaii, as many \nJapanese did in that period of time at the turn of the century, to work \nin the pineapple fields and agriculture, which was a fundamental of the \neconomy for the State of Hawaii. Their conditions were not good. They \nworked hard. But they raised their families with pride, with dignity \nand honor, and were proud to call themselves Americans.\n  Dan Inouye was as proud as any. As we know, one of the most shameful \nchapters of American history took place during World War II when an \nincredible act of injustice took place. The United States of America \ndecided to intern Japanese Americans who lived in California. They were \nput into internment camps because they happened to be Japanese \nAmericans, not because they had done anything wrong, not that they did \nnot love America, but because they happened to be Japanese Americans. \nBy the way, some of those internment camps were in my home State of \nArizona. Conditions were not terrible, but they were not good. People \nwere incarcerated because they happened to be ethnic Japanese.\n  In Hawaii, there was a group of young Japanese Americans who decided \nthat they wanted to serve their country and they wanted to serve in \nuniform. One of the most well-known and famous and most highly \ndecorated units of the entire World War II was the battalion in which \nDan Inouye served. They were in many of the most gruesome and difficult \nblood lettings of the entire conflict as the American forces fought \ntheir way up through Italy against a very well trained, very well \nequipped, professional German opposition. Dan Inouye was a proud member \nof this battalion. In fierce combat, Dan Inouye was gravely wounded on \nthe battlefield. He was brought home. He, as we all know, lost his arm \nas a result of one of the wounds he sustained.\n  Interestingly and coincidentally, he went to a veterans hospital in \nChicago where a person in the same ward, was a American Army second \nlieutenant who had also been wounded seriously in Italy, one Bob Dole--\n2LT Bob Dole of Kansas. And there began a friendship that lasted to \nthis day, both gravely wounded, both dedicated more than ever to serve \ntheir country. Both served with distinction. The friendship, the bonds \nof friendship that were forged in that hospital between Bob Dole and \nDan Inouye were unique and enduring.\n  So Dan Inouye returned to his beloved Hawaii. The story goes--and I \ndo not know if it is true or not--the story goes that a Dan Inouye went \ndown to join the veterans organization, and when he applied for \nmembership, he was told that the only members they took in that \norganization were Caucasian.\n  Dan Inouye decided that he wanted to continue to serve his country \nand the State of Hawaii. He was the first Senator from the State of \nHawaii and has served longer than any Senator in this institution. He \nwas loved by all of us. I did not always agree with Dan. Occasionally, \nwe had differences about how we use appropriations bills. No one--no \none ever, ever accused Dan Inouye of partnership or unfairness.\n  He loved Native Americans, and he loved his Hawaiians. One of the \nmore rewarding periods of my time here in the Senate was being on the \nIndian Affairs Committee under his chairmanship. Very important pieces \nof legislation came out of that committee. It was a great honor for me \nto have the privilege to serve with Dan Inouye. He loved Native \nAmericans. He knew that Native Americans had been wronged in our \nhistory. He knew that solemn treaties must be honored by our government \neven if those treaties sometimes meant that there would be significant \nexpenditures of America's tax dollars.\n  Have no doubt that our treatment of Native Americans and the \ntreatment of Native Hawaiians is not the most glorious chapter in \nAmerican history when we look back at what happened to the proud Native \nAmericans, the Native Hawaiians as their civilization collided with the \ncivilization that came to the United States of America from around the \nworld.\n  Dan Inouye fought for the things he believed in and the principles \nthat he held dear. He held nothing more dear than the glory of being \nable to serve people who needed to be served.\n  Dan Inouye will be missed. There will not be another like him. There \nwill not be another Senator literally deprived of his rights. There \nwill not be another Senator who will serve in length and with the \ndedication that Dan Inouye served this Senate and his beloved Hawaii. \nSo we will all miss Dan Inouye. I hope from time to time, with the \nbitter partisanship that exists here sometimes in the Senate, maybe we \ncould use Dan Inouye's record as an example of bipartisan, of \nfriendship, of a willingness to reach across the aisle and work with \nthe other side; it characterized Dan Inouye's record here in the \nSenate.\n  For some reason, when I heard and thought about Dan's passing today, \nI was reminded of another person who died and is buried on the island \nof Samoa, and his poem is inscribed on his gravestone as an epitaph. I \nthink it applies to our dear and beloved friend who passed today. It \nwas by Robert Lewis Stevenson. I quote:\n\n     Under the wide and starry sky,\n     Dig the grave and let me lie.\n     Glad did I live and gladly die,\n     And I laid me down with a will.\n\n     This be the verse you 'grave for me:\n     Here he lies where he longed to be;\n     Home is the sailor, home from the sea,\n     And the hunter home from the hill.\n\n  I see my dear and beloved friend, the other Senator from Hawaii, Dan \nAkaka, on the floor.\n  I thank you, Danny, and God bless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, it is very difficult for me to rise \ntoday--\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nwith a heavy heart--to bid aloha to my good friend, colleague, and \nbrother Dan Inouye. It is hard for me to believe that the terrible news \nI just received is true. Senator Inouye was a true patriot and an \nAmerican hero in every sense, and he is at this time in Hawaii the \ngreatest leader.\n  He served his country as a soldier, receiving the highest honor our \nNation can bestow. When we think of how he began to serve his Nation, \nit is difficult to believe the difficulty we had in Hawaii as Japanese \nAmericans. To be a part of our Nation's military--we were denied. We \nwere considered aliens of this country. But he was one of those who \nwanted to serve their country, and they went to the highest level to \nreceive that dignity, and eventually they were given the honor to serve \nour country. As we now know, it became the greatest unit in military \nhistory, with the most decorations of any unit and also with the \nhighest levels of decoration, of the Medal of Honor.\n  He served as a leader, the third longest serving Member of the U.S. \nSenate in our Nation's history. He served as a defender of the people \nof this country, championing historic charges for civil rights, \nincluding the equal rights of women, Asian Americans, African \nAmericans, and Native Hawaiians. It is an incredible understatement to \ncall him an institution. This Chamber will never be the same without \nhim.\n  I remember, in our childhood in Hawaii, that Hawaii was a diversified \nplace. Where I lived in Pauoa Valley, there were many Japanese families \nwho lived around us. There were many nights that I spent sleeping in \nthe homes of our Japanese families, ate their food, slept on the tatami \non the floor, and I really was brought up with the Japanese families. \nSo when the war broke out, I couldn't understand what was happening \nbecause there were families who were removed from the community, and, \nof course, at that time the Japanese American boys weren't allowed to \nbe in the military, but they pursued it because they wanted to serve \nthis country as well. This is why, in my time in Congress, I did focus \non trying to help the Japanese Americans in this country and the Asians \nin this country as well and to help them achieve what they really \nearned.\n  I remember seeking the Medal of Honor for the unit and for those who \nfought in World War II, and I provided the Pentagon with 100 names from \nthese units. I was really surprised that there were finally 21 of them \nwho were selected for the Medal of Honor, and Senator Inouye was one of \nthem. But that showed that they were willing to give their lives for \nthis country, and they did. Since then, he has continued to serve his \ncountry.\n  We all used the G.I. bill to be educated in Hawaii. We went to the \nUniversity of Hawaii, graduated from there, and went on to further \ndegrees. They came back, in a sense, those who could help the \ncommunities, and became leaders.\n  In the case of Danny Inouye, he was one of the ones who turned the \ntide in Hawaii politically since 1954, and by 1959 we became a State. \nSenator Inouye ran for office and was our first Member of the House. \nAfter one term, he moved to the Senate because Senator Long decided to \nretire. As a result, Senator Matsunaga was elected to the House and \nserved the House and also the Senate as well, and he also was a member \nof the 100th infantry during World War II. But the Japanese Americans \nreally served our country, and Danny Inouye is one of those great \nleaders in the history of this country.\n  Through my career in Congress, I have been proud to be on Dan's team. \nWe have worked on everything from appropriations to Native Hawaiian \nrights, to veterans and to defense. All of us in Hawaii looked up to \nhim, and we are so sad to see him go.\n  Danny Inouye leaves behind him a list of accomplishments unlikely to \never be paralleled. His lifelong dedication and hard work in the name \nof his beloved country, the United States of America, influenced every \npart of his life and set him apart, even in the Senate. He was a fierce \nadvocate as a senior member of several committees, and the way he \nconducted himself commanded respect from all with whom he worked.\n  His legacy is not only the loving family he leaves behind, it can be \nseen in every mile of every road in Hawaii, in every nature preserve \nand every facility that makes Hawaii a safer place. He fulfilled his \ndream of creating a better Hawaii. He gave us access to resources and \nfacilities that the mainland States, I would say, took for granted.\n  Tomorrow will be the first day since Hawaii became a State in 1959 \nthat Danny Inouye will not be representing us in Congress. Every child \nborn in Hawaii will learn of Danny Inouye, a man who changed the \nislands forever.\n  I join all of the people of Hawaii tonight in praying for his wife \nIrene, his son Ken, and his daughter-in-law Jessica; his stepdaughter \nJennifer, and his grand-daughter Maggie, who really tickle his life. \nWhenever I had a chance to chat with him, we talked about Maggie. They \nbrought him so much joy in his life and will carry his legacy forward.\n  I am going to miss Dan, and so will all of us here in the Senate, and \nthis great country will also. He represented a true American, and for \nus in Hawaii, he represented a true Hawaiian in Hawaii. He served \nHawaii and this country well.\n  Dan and I have worked so well together all these years. When I was in \nthe House and on the Appropriations Committee there, we worked very \nwell between the House and the Senate. Many of the renovations that \nhave come about in Hawaii were because of Danny, and he really helped \nto shape Hawaii and this great country. He brought here on Earth a kind \nof life that people of our country and this world can follow to be \ngreat citizens of the world.\n  Dan, my dear friend and colleague, you will be missed in Washington \nas much as you will be missed in Hawaii. Rest in peace. God bless you \nand your spirit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
