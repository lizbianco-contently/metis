Madam President, last night, Senate Democrats put \nforth a plan to raise taxes on American energy that, in their words, \nwould have done nothing to lower the price of gas at the pump. As the \nchairman of the Finance Committee put it: ``That's not the issue.''\n  I think for most Americans, high gas prices actually are the issue.\n  According to a Gallup poll that came out this week, nearly 7 out of \n10 Americans say the high cost of gas at the pump is causing financial \nhardship for their families. More than half of Americans say they have \nmade major changes to compensate for it. More than 1 in 5 say high gas \nprices are jeopardizing their standard of living.\n  Americans are struggling. My constituents in Kentucky are hurting. \nThey want relief, and all they are getting from Democrats in Washington \nis a dog and pony show. Their own Members admit their legislative \nproposals are gimmicks. They spent a week vilifying the energy industry \nand another week trying to punish them.\n  The legislation they proposed yesterday would have done three things: \ndestroy jobs, send American jobs overseas, and make us more dependent \non foreign sources of oil. That is what yesterday's bill would have \ndone.\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\n  Democrats themselves admit it would not lower gas prices by a penny. \nSo it is a fair question: What in the world are they doing? Once again, \nDemocrats have been faced with a crisis and have done their best to \nturn it into a political exercise rather than doing something to \nactually help people and create jobs.\n  They pushed a tax on energy because evidently some of their leaders \nthink it polls well. So does Mother's Day. I would suggest Democrats \nspend a little more time looking at the price of gas at their local gas \nstations than at the latest polling numbers about class warfare \nrhetoric.\n  At a time when Americans are genuinely struggling out there, the \nDemocrats have chosen to waste 2 weeks making a political statement \nrather than in trying to make a difference.\n  The American people deserve a lot better than that, and that is why \nRepublicans have offered the Offshore Production and Safety Act of \n2011, which we will vote on later today.\n  Our plan has basically three objectives; first, to restore American \noffshore production; second, to improve safety; third, to require \nbureaucrats in Washington to get to work on the permitting process to \nmake a decision one way or the other.\n  It would have three corresponding effects. First, and most important, \nour plan would help reduce the price of gas at the pump. By unlocking \nour own domestic resources and speeding up the permitting process, our \nplan would actually do something to increase supply, putting downward \npressure on price. As the Democratic Senator from Missouri said \nyesterday: ``The more supply, the less the price.''\n  It would also help alleviate our dependence on foreign sources of \noil, and it would create thousands of energy jobs right here in America \ninstead of sending them overseas, which is why this bill has the \nsupport of both the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I have indicated what our bill does in general. Here are the \nspecifics.\n  In order to restore American offshore production, our plan directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to conduct previously scheduled offshore \nlease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, Virginia, and \nAlaska. In addition, the plan will extend lease terms by 1 year for \ngulf leases which were suspended under the 2010 Obama moratorium.\n  After the devastating oilspill we had last year in the gulf, \nimproving safety is one of our highest priorities. That is why our bill \namends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require all lessees to \ndevelop spill response and containment plans, establishes a public-\nprivate task force on oilspill response and mitigation, and orders a \nstudy on Federal response to oilspills by the Comptroller General to \nexamine capabilities and legal authorities related to spill prevention \nand response to clarify appropriate Federal roles.\n  Finally, it is imperative we put in place a process that makes \nbureaucrats operate more efficiently on the crucial issuance of \npermits. That is why our plan puts time limits on the review of and \ndecision on drilling permits, providing for 30 days of application \nreview, with two opportunities for the Interior Department to extend \nthe time period. Beyond that, it provides for a default approval if \nInterior does not reject the application within 60 days, and it directs \nthe Interior Department to provide rationale for rejection of permits.\n  This bill is not our last on this crisis. We could do a lot more to \nincrease production here at home, and we should. But it offers \nsolutions, and every provision in this bill has bipartisan support.\n  At a time of near record gas prices, this is a modest approach, a \ngood first step that takes everyone's concerns into account so we can \nactually achieve a practical result.\n  That is what Americans want. It is time to stop pointing fingers. It \nis time to stop picking winners and losers. It is time to stop telling \nAmericans what is best for them.\n  It is time to stop holding Americans back with moratoriums, fees, \nbureaucratic roadblocks, and the ever-expanding reach of a President \nwho seems to think business owners in this country need to get his \npermission first if they want to create jobs.\n  Every single American is feeling the pain at the pump, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. It is time for the two parties to come together and \nget serious about results. I urge all my colleagues to support the \nOffshore Production and Safety Act of 2011.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3064-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise this morning to commemorate \nNational Police Week and to speak to the service of the brave men and \nwomen in local law enforcement. But, first, I feel compelled to make a \ncomment in response to the exchange between the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader, to simply speak, if I could, briefly about the \nongoing pain each and every working American family feels when they go \nto the gas station.\n  With the price of gasoline at an alltime high, with the price of \ngasoline flirting with $4 a gallon, with the price of oil retreating \nfrom an alltime high, and with, most importantly, oil company profits \ngushing through the roof and hitting an alltime high, Members of our \nparty, Members of this body came forward yesterday with a bill which \ngot more than 50 votes but failed to hit the 60 needed in this body to \nmake for cloture, which would have made significant progress on dealing \nwith our deficit.\n  We just heard a comment on the floor that we need to stop picking \nwinners and losers and need to move forward in helping America end its \ndependence on foreign energy. I could not agree more because the \nexpenditures through our Tax Code--the billions and billions of dollars \nin needless expenditures through our Tax Code--that continue to \nsubsidize some of the most wildly profitable corporations in American \nhistory is exactly that, picking winners, and the losers are the \nAmerican people.\n  When I go home to my State--I know, Madam President, when you go home \nto your State--I hear people day in and day out say: Why can't you do \nmore to help create decent jobs, to deal with the deficit and, more \nthan anything, to stop the oil companies, which are despoiling our \nnatural resources and picking our pockets at the pump.\n  This is not picking on one particular industry. This is rationally \nlooking at our immense tax expenditures through the code and saying: \nThere is a time here for us to stop. We would save literally $21 \nbillion by fiscal year 2021; that is, over the next decade, $21 billion \nin deficit reduction. That does not solve the problem we need to come \ntogether and address as a body--both parties, both Chambers of this \ngreat Congress--but it is a significant downpayment.\n  I am from a State where we produce very little in the way of oil or \ncoal or gas but where we consume a lot of energy and where we have lots \nof opportunities to invest in alternative energy--investments that \nwould create new jobs, a competitive platform for the United States as \nwe enter this new century and that could, frankly, help sustain our \neconomy going forward.\n  The votes cast yesterday to sustain these senseless tax breaks and \ncredits, to help keep afloat the most profitable companies in American \nhistory, strike me as doing exactly what we were just urged not to do--\npicking winners, where the average American is, in fact, the loser.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  It is my hope we will continue to look, with a sharp and clear eye, \nat the billions of dollars, the more than $35 billion in first-quarter \nprofits made by the five largest American oil firms. I have nothing \nagainst corporations making profits. In fact, that is what helps propel \nour economy. As we try to recover from this terrible recession, having \na profitable private sector is the best way forward to help create jobs \nand to help grow our economy and to help deal with Federal revenues.\n  But the spending through our Tax Code--something that has accumulated \non the underside of the American economy over the last decade--has to \nbe stopped. We have to find ways to plug the holes through which \nbillions in potential Federal revenue are leaking. I frankly think it \nis time for us to have a sensible national energy policy. And \ncontinuing to defend decades-old, needless tax breaks for major oil \ncompanies so that they can engage in manufacturing by extracting oil \nfrom the ground, for example--one of the five that would have been \nended by this bill--is just senseless.\n  So it is my hope that we will reconsider; that as we move forward and \ntry to find a way together to create jobs, to reduce spending and deal \nwith our deficits, we will look hard at some of these outdated tax \nbreaks that make it possible for bloated oil companies to make billions \nof dollars of profit off working Americans who pay too much at the \npump.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3065-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, this week we are honoring the service and \nsacrifice of Americans who serve us as police.\n  May 15 to May 21 is National Police Week, and Americans all across \nthis country will be recognizing those who serve and have served in \npolice departments in communities from coast to coast. Law enforcement \npersonnel and their families will also be coming together to hold \nmemorials for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and lost their \nlives in the line of duty.\n  National Police Week holds special significance to me because for the \n6 years I served as county executive in New Castle County, DE, I was \nresponsible for a police force that worked hard day and night to keep \nour community safe. Every year in May, I would gather with our law \nenforcement officers, with the Fraternal Order of Police, which so ably \nrepresented them, with the families of those who had served, and with \nthe families of the one member of our law enforcement community, the \nNew Castle County Police, who had been killed in the line of duty.\n  I often had differences with the Fraternal Order of Police in my 6 \nyears of leadership, but I will tell you, they were great and tireless \npartners in standing up for the working men and woman who kept us safe \neach and every day. They kept us focused on officer safety, and they \nkept us focused on providing for them the equipment and the training \nand the support they so richly deserve.\n  I will tell you that each and every week that I would have a tough \nweek, when we had difficult times dealing with local budgets or coming \nto compromise and making reasonable progress in the county, if I ever \nfor a moment felt sorry for myself as I drove home from the county \ngovernment center, all I needed to do was to turn on my police radio in \nmy county car and listen to dispatch. There was always something going \non. As every patrol car went out, as every squad responded to crises, I \nwas reminded day-in and day-out of the incredible selfless service of \nthe men and women of local law enforcement all over this country, these \ndedicated men and women who sacrifice time away from their families to \nput themselves daily in harm's way. And sadly, too often, it finds \nthem.\n  Since the beginning of 2009, 122 American police officers have lost \ntheir lives in service to their local community. Today, I wish to focus \non one--Patrolman Chad Spicer of Georgetown, DE. A Georgetown native, \nChad attended the Sussex Central High School and graduated from Del \nTech in 1999. Following 4 years with our State department of \ncorrections, he began service with the police department in \nBridgeville, later in the town of Laurel. In 2008, Chad joined the \nforce in his hometown, fulfilling his greatest childhood dream.\n  On September 1, 2009, Chad and his partner, Corporal Shawn \nBrittingham, were in pursuit of a vehicle containing suspects in a \nrobbery. The car abruptly stopped. Before the two officers had a chance \nto get out, a suspect fired a single gunshot at close range, killing \nChad and, in a ricochet, seriously wounded his partner. The suspects \nwere eventually apprehended and have been brought to trial.\n  Patrolman Chad Spicer was only 29 years old when he was murdered \ndoing his job. He is survived by his fiancee, his beautiful young \ndaughter Aubrey, his parents Ruth Ann and Norman, a brother, two \nsisters, and a family of fellow officers in Georgetown and across our \nState of Delaware.\n  His funeral service was one of the most moving experiences I have had \nin my adult life. Thousands of law enforcement professionals, men and \nwomen, and family members from literally all across our country \ngathered to pay tribute to this brave, likeable, dedicated young man \nwho gave his life in the protection of our community.\n  Earlier this month, the people of Georgetown, DE, erected a memorial \nto Chad and his courage and the sacrifice he made for all of us. \nGeorgetown Chief of Police Topping noted that: Everyone in town knew \nand liked Chad, even those from the roughest part of town, even those \nwho were on the receiving end of his service to our community. Chad \ndied protecting the community where he was born and raised, and losing \nhim to senseless violence like that had a devastating impact on the \npeople of Georgetown and on our whole State.\n  Chad was the first Delaware police officer to die from wounds \nreceived in the line of duty since 1993. His loss is a constant \nreminder that law enforcement officers all over our country live with \nthe daily reality that each time they go out on patrol, every time they \nreport for duty, their lives may be put on the line as they serve their \ncommunities and our country.\n  This is why I think it is so important that the Federal Government \ncontinue to strengthen local police department capacities through \nthings such as the Federal vest grant program that helps local law \nenforcement purchase bulletproof vests and other critical police \nsupplies. It is so important to me that when law enforcement--Federal, \nState, and local--work together, we can succeed in keeping Americans \nsafe. There is always more we can do. This is why the Judiciary \nCommittee will be holding a field hearing later next month in \nWilmington, DE, to explore ways we can better improve the collaboration \nand cooperation between Federal and local law enforcement.\n  While we honor our men and women of law enforcement every day and \nevery year, during National Police Week, we celebrate their service and \nsacrifice and thank them for being forever on watch.\n  In memory of Patrolman Chad Spicer and all of the other law \nenforcement professionals who have made the ultimate sacrifice, I today \nstand in memory of their service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Last Friday, the Social Security trustees' report and the \nMedicare trustees' report were both released. They showed that as large \nas our debt and deficits are now, without tackling these two \nentitlements, our future debts and deficits will dwarf current levels. \nIn fact, this year alone, Medicare is running a cashflow deficit of \nmore than $32 billion. This is the largest deficit ever for this \nprogram. Likewise, Social Security will run a cashflow deficit of $46 \nbillion this year. This requires the Treasury to finance\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nthese programs through additional borrowing, adding even more to our \ndeficit.\n  In total, Social Security faces a $6.5 trillion unfunded liability. \nThe reason for this, according to the report, is the aging of our \nsociety. As we live longer and as the size of families has decreased, \nthe number of workers financing benefits has steadily decreased. For \nexample, in 1950 there were 16\\1/2\\ workers for every Social Security \nrecipient and life expectancy was 69 years old. By 1960, the number of \nworkers supporting each recipient was just half of what it was 10 years \nbefore. Now there are fewer than three workers for each beneficiary. By \n2040, it will be just over two.\n\n  Around the same time, in 2036, Social Security's trust fund will run \nout of all of the IOUs the government has issued to it. After this \npoint, Social Security will be able to pay just over 75 percent of the \ncurrent benefits. That is an important point because some say Social \nSecurity does not need to be reformed because these benefits are still \ngoing to be able to be paid. I think we have to remind ourselves of how \nthis will work.\n  But you can see the demographic trend here, what is happening. Going \nback to the 1950s when you had a life expectancy that was shorter, you \nhad more people paying in--16.5 for every 1 who was drawing out. Now we \nare looking at three people paying in for every one drawing out. And, \nof course, the life expectancy now is up to about 78 years average. In \n2040, as I said earlier, there will be two people paying in for every \none drawing out. So the crunch is coming. We all know that. We can \npredict it. We see it coming.\n  Of course, the expectation is that because the Social Security trust \nfund will be able to pay benefits until sometime in the 2037 timeframe, \neverything is OK; we do not need to take steps to rectify this \nsituation today. The problem with that is the so-called IOUs in the \nSocial Security trust fund are just more borrowing. When we get to that \nyear, when we get to the 2036-2037 timeframe, there will only be about \n75 cents coming in for every dollar that will have to be paid out. So \nyou will have people who literally will take a huge cut in benefits or \nwe would have to undergo a massive payroll tax increase in order to \nmake that up or dramatically increase the borrowing of the Federal \nGovernment because, in fact, those IOUs in the trust funds are not an \neconomic asset that can be used to pay a cash benefit. It is simply \nborrowing. We all know that. And I think the important date--in my \nmind, at least--is the date at which the amount we receive coming in to \nthe Social Security trust fund in the form of payroll taxes no longer \nexceeds the amount we are paying out in the form of benefits. That \nhappened this year to the tune of $45 billion.\n  Many of us have committed to preserving these programs for existing \nretirees and for those who are about to retire soon. If we do not \nreform Social Security, these cuts of nearly 25 percent would be \ninstant and automatic, giving retirees no time to make other \narrangements.\n  Working back from the 2036 date to ensure that the program remains \nsolvent and can pay out benefits to future generations requires us to \ntake action today. We do not have the luxury of time. We cannot afford \nto wait. The sooner we take action, the more time the current \ngeneration has to prepare for a realistic level of benefits and not be \nblindsided when their benefits are dramatically cut. Without reform, \nAmericans aged 42 and younger will not see full Social Security \nbenefits when they retire.\n  In addition to the aging population, the rapidly rising cost of \nhealth care is placing enormous pressure on the Medicare system. \nDespite the recently enacted health care reform legislation, health \ncare costs rose by over 7 percent in 2010 compared to about a 1-percent \nincrease in all other goods and services in the economy. The Medicare \ntrustees reported that the program has an unfunded liability of nearly \n$36.8 trillion and that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will \nbe completely insolvent by the year 2024. Medicare spending is expected \nto rise from 3.6 percent of our entire economy--of our gross domestic \nproduct--in 2010, which is where it is today, to 10.7 percent in 2085. \nThat means the amount of money the government spends on health care is \ngoing to triple over the next 75 years.\n  Now that, unbelievably, is the rosy picture of what will happen. Due \nto the double counting that occurred in unrealistic savings and targets \nthat were included in the health care reform bill that was passed last \nyear, these numbers are going to be invariably worse if further action \nis not taken.\n  Finally, the Medicaid system also faces nearly all the same increases \nin costs and funding challenges as the Medicare system, while also \nfailing to provide States with the flexibility they need to provide \nquality care for beneficiaries.\n  Unfortunately, this administration and the last Congress made these \nproblems even worse. Instead of reforming these entitlement programs, \nthey created yet another new entitlement program called the CLASS Act, \nwhich even the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has \ncalled a Ponzi scheme.\n  Included in the same health care bill passed last year was a massive \nexpansion of Medicaid and the creation of new credits for individuals \nto buy insurance, all of which adds to the budget burdens we are \nalready experiencing.\n  If these programs are not reformed, we know what we will face. Under \nthe Congressional Budget Office's ``alternative fiscal scenario'' which \nmakes realistic assumptions about the growth of these programs, \nspending in 2020 would comprise 25.9 percent of GDP, more than 25 \npercent above the historical average. It would continue to grow, and in \n2035 spending would comprise 35.2 percent of GDP or nearly 60 percent \nmore than the historical average.\n  In that same year, deficits would comprise nearly 16 percent of the \nGDP of our entire economy, and debt would be 185 percent of GDP.\n  I want to illustrate that in the form of a chart and show you what \nthis would look like. The historical average for deficits--3 percent, \nas I said. Look at what we faced in the last 40 to 50 years, roughly, \nand where that is headed in these outyears. As you look at 2010, how \nthis thing spiked up in the last couple of years, we have added \nmassively to the debt, the stimulus spending, the massive health care, \nthe entitlement programs, all of which will make this worse. But we are \non a trend to follow the trajectory where we will get to where the \ndeficit is literally going to represent 61 percent of our entire \neconomy.\n  That is a stunning path to be on--why it cries out for us to take the \nnecessary steps to get back on the right fiscal track. Interest on the \ndebt would comprise nearly 9 percent of our economy, half of which is \npaid to foreign debtors. We all talk about the impact of carrying this \namount of debt. Today, we have so much debt that, in a few years, the \namount we pay for interest will exceed the amount we spend on national \nsecurity. In other words, we will spend more financing our debt and \nsimply making the interest payments than we do defending the country.\n  Think about that. Think about where we have gotten to. Think about \nthe fact too that if we saw even a 1-percent increase in interest \nrates, if interest rates went up 1 percent and we had to pay more to \nborrow money from those creditors, some of which are foreign countries, \nit would increase the interest we pay annually by $140 billion. That is \nhow sensitive we are to a slight increase in interest rates because of \nthis massive debt. We passed, yesterday or the day before, the $14.3 \ntrillion level, the debt limit. We are going to have to raise the debt \nlimit here. We don't know exactly when--sometime in July or August. But \nthat is coming. We have maxed out our credit card, our borrowing \nauthority, we have hit the limit, and in order to keep our economy \nfunctioning we have to increase the amount our country borrows.\n  If we follow the President's budget, we would double that in the next \ndecade. We will go from $14.3 trillion to literally over $26 trillion \nin the next decade under the President's budget. Why? Because the \nPresident didn't make any attempt in his budget to reduce spending or \nreform entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--which are \nthe big drivers of Federal spending. If we don't take steps to reform \nthose entitlement programs, this picture gets worse and worse over \ntime.\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\n  I want to illustrate this with a chart. This is where we are today. \nThis is debt as a share of the economy. As I said before, if you look \nat historical averages, what we have carried in the form of debt, in \nWorld War II, obviously, there was a big ramp-up because we had to \nfinance the war and coming out of the war. As the economy started to \nexpand and we got spending under control, the debt, as a percentage of \nour economy, started to come down to historical averages, which is \nwhere it stayed for about 40 to 50 years. It started to spike in the \nlast couple of years, as we have seen spending increases. The reason is \nbecause the amount we spend as a percentage of our total economy has \ncontinued to tick up.\n  I mentioned earlier that we are looking at--what was the number--25.9 \npercent of GDP is what we will spend on the Federal Government in 2020, \naccording to the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario. If you think about \nthat, the amount we have spent historically as a percent of our economy \non the Federal Government is 20.6 percent. That has been the 40-year \naverage. We are going from 20.6 spending as a percent of our economy--\nthe amount the Federal Government spends for our entire economic \noutput--to 25.9 percent a decade from now. It continues to spike up. \nBecause we are having to finance so much spending with borrowing, the \nborrowing level will increase dramatically, to the point where we are \nlooking at debt to GDP--if we don't take steps to change, this is what \nwe are looking at on this chart. It is a straight up spike in the \namount of borrowing to GDP. This is pointed out too by where we are \ncurrently; right now, we are running somewhere in the $1.4 trillion to \n$1.6 trillion in annual deficits on $3.8 trillion in total spending, \nwhich means that out of every dollar the Federal Government is \nspending, we are borrowing over 40 cents.\n  Can you imagine any family or business in this country that could \ncontinue to get by borrowing literally over 40 cents out of every \ndollar they spend? You cannot do it. That would be like the average \nfamily in this country having an annual income of about $60,000 and \nspending $110,000. You cannot do that. The Federal Government has been \ndoing that for way too long. That is why we have to take on this issue \nof spending and debt.\n  Some people argue that we don't have enough revenue, we need to raise \ntaxes, and that is the way to deal with this fiscal crisis to get more \nrevenue coming into the Federal Government. I argue that, based upon \nthese facts, this is not a revenue problem, this is a spending problem. \nThe reason we are where we are is not because we don't have enough \nrevenue, it is because we are spending dramatically more as a \npercentage of our economy than we have in the last 40 to 50 years. The \nhistorical average is 20.6 percent over the last 40 years--what we have \nspent on the Federal Government as a percentage of our entire economy--\nand today that is 24 percent, and by 2020 we are looking at over 25 \npercent--an increase of 25 percent in the amount we are spending on the \nFederal Government as a percentage of our entire economy. That is a \nspending problem, not a revenue problem.\n  We need to address this and recognize it, and we need to understand \nthat the only way we can fix it is to deal with what is driving that \nspending. It is Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those programs \ncomprise 55 to 60 percent of all of government spending. Absent reforms \nto those programs, this is what we will end up with; this is where we \nwill be as a nation. That is certainly someplace I don't think most \nAmericans want to go.\n  The other reason is critically important. I have said this before, \nand I will say it again. It has implications not only for future \ngenerations but in the here and now. One is that when you are carrying \nthis kind of debt to GDP, sustaining this kind of debt level, it \nimpacts your economy's ability to create jobs, because you are crowding \nout private investment that otherwise would be allocated to more \nproductive uses, and you are spending it on the government. You are \nalso impacting interest rates and inflation in ways that could be \ncounter to the economic expansion, growth, and job creation in this \ncountry. There has been a great amount of research and study that has \ngone into at what level does that start to take away from economic \ngrowth, economic expansion, and job creation?\n  Two people who have recently put out a book; Carmen Reinhart and \nKenneth Rogoff have suggested, from their study of developed countries \nover the last half century, that when your debt to GDP reaches 90 \npercent, it is costing you about 1 percentage point of economic growth \nevery year. In this country, losing 1 percentage point of economic \ngrowth costs us about a million jobs. If we say we are serious about \njob creation, one of the problems we ought to focus on is getting \nspending and debt under control. If we sustain and carry this kind of \ndebt level for the foreseeable future, we are going to cost the economy \n1 percent of economic growth and, therefore, a significant amount of \njobs that might have been created by that economy. That is one reason \nwe need to rein it in.\n  The statement has been made repeatedly by ADM Mike Mullen that the \ngreatest threat to our national security is our national debt. I would \nsay that the national security implications are very real as well. When \nyou have the highest ranking military official saying the greatest \nthreat to America's national security is our national debt, that is a \nstunning statement. I think it speaks volumes about why it is important \nto get this issue under control.\n  One of the reasons he says that, obviously, is that so much of the \ndebt is held by foreign countries, all of which have additional \nleverage on us because we owe them so much money. We need to get \nspending under control and get the debt dealt with. That starts with \nentitlement reform. I hope the discussions currently occurring between \nthe White House and some of the leaders here in the Congress will come \nto a result where we can work together and use this as an opportunity \nto, once and for all, put this country back on a fiscal track that will \nensure that future generations are not burdened and saddled with an \nenormous amount of debt and an economy that is saddled with that weight \nand not able to create the jobs to get people back to work and to grow \nand prosper and create a higher quality of living and standard of \nliving for the next generation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time of the quorum call be divided \nequally on both sides, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today the Senate is going to consider a \nbill to increase offshore drilling. This is the Republican response to \nthe Nation's need for a national energy policy and to rising gasoline \nprices. I believe the Republican approach to this will be unsuccessful. \nI believe it overlooks some very fundamental and basic facts, and the \nfacts are these: We cannot drill our way out of our problem. If we take \na look at all the known oil reserves in the United States offshore and \nonshore--all of them--they comprise 2 percent of the known oil reserves \nin the world--2 percent. Now take a look at how much oil the United \nStates consumes each year: 25 percent of the world oil production.\n  The Republican answer is drill, baby, drill. Honestly, that is not \ngoing to solve the problem, and it is going to invite some dangerous \nactivities that we should know better than to engage in. It has not \nbeen that long ago that 170 million gallons of oil poured out of a well \nthat was improperly drilled by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. The \ndevastation that followed to the local economy and to the environment \nis virtually incalculable. Have we learned a lesson--a lesson that \nsafety should be the hallmark when it comes to drilling; that we ought \nto make certain that before\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nwe go into an environment which is precious, where an accident could \ncreate some unknown hazard or danger, that we thoroughly investigate \nthat in advance. That is not too much to ask. We know what is going on \nin the Gulf of Mexico today as the economy is still trying to recover.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle who produced the \nMcConnell approach--the drill, baby, drill approach--want to just \nforget the spill. They want us to rush into drilling with the same \nreckless practices that led to the spill in the first place. This is \nnot going to solve the problem. In fact, it may create more problems.\n  If passed, the Republican bill would require the Secretary of the \nInterior to evaluate a permit application in 60 days regardless of its \ncomplexity--60 days. If the Secretary cannot make a decision within 60 \ndays, the permit is automatically approved even if it contains \npotential environmental and safety risks. This arbitrary deadline makes \nit impossible for regulators to do the in-depth scientific analysis \nneeded to accurately evaluate the risks and safety requirements for \nevery application.\n  The bill also mandates the sale of offshore oil and gas leases in the \nGulf of Mexico, off the coast of Virginia, and the Arctic Ocean--sales \nthat were postponed in order to investigate the potential environmental \nimpact.\n  Not only does the Republican bill not add any new protocols to ensure \nthat increased drilling will be safe, it revokes some of the additional \nrequirements that were instituted following the BP spill. They have not \nlearned any lesson from what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. \nEssentially, this bill would lead to more offshore drilling, with less \nsafety and regulation of the industry. One would think that the BP \noilspill never happened, if we consider this bill, which will be on the \nfloor later today.\n  There is really no reason to rush to begin new drilling projects in \nsuch an irresponsible manner because under President Obama, domestic \noil production has grown to its highest level in the last 7 years. That \nis right, it has grown to its highest level in the last 7 years. If one \nlistened to the other side, one would think the opposite was true--that \nwe cut back or stopped drilling. Since February, 34 permits for 14 \nunique deepwater wells have been issued under the new safety \nrequirements since the BP spill. Oil production in Federal waters has \nincreased in both of the last 2 years.\n  Last weekend, the President announced several steps the \nadministration would take to expand further responsible development of \ndomestic energy resources. The Department of the Interior will hold \nlease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska by mid-2012, once \nadditional analyses have been completed. Extensions will be granted to \nall leases offered by the deepwater suspension, as well as delayed \nleases in Alaska. Annual oil and gas lease sales will be held in \nAlaska's National Petroleum Reserve. And the mid-Atlantic and South \nAtlantic coast will undergo an expedited review for fuel resources. The \nPresident's actions show we are continuing to expand our domestic \nresources responsibly.\n  This careless Republican bill is unnecessary. It is bad policy. The \nbill proposed by Senator McConnell would force us to disregard all the \nlessons we learned from the tragic oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico a \nyear ago.\n  It has been many years back when I was up in Alaska when the Exxon \nValdez ran aground in the Prince William Sound and dumped tens of \nthousands of barrels of crude oil into this beautiful place in our \nworld. I was up there, and we had workers out. They were literally \nswabbing up the oil off the rocks as it washed up on the shore. They \nwore these yellow slickers, which in no time at all were covered with \nthis black crude oil. People with cameras were running around taking \nphotos of the workers.\n  I went over to an old fellow in one of those yellow slickers who had \nthese big swaddling cloths, mopping up the crude oil that had been \ndumped into this beautiful place of Prince William Sound. I said to him \nafter the cameras left: Do you think this is helping? He said: Well, I \nthink if we didn't do anything, God would take care of this in about 10 \nyears. By taking extra effort, maybe it will be 9 years and 6 months.\n  The point I am making is this: Once the spill has taken place, it \ntakes time for nature to restore itself, if it can. In Prince William \nSound, some species of fish never returned. I do not know what will \nhappen in the Gulf of Mexico. Perhaps over time nature will heal this \nwound. I hope it does.\n  Do we not have a special responsibility as stewards of this planet \nEarth and of this Nation to be careful? Is it too much to ask that we \nengage in fuel efficiency and thoughtful energy policy rather than \nrecklessly drill in every direction without asking the hard questions, \nwithout taking the time for an honest analysis? Not only did the BP \noilspill despoil that area, it claimed human lives. When it comes to \nsafety and environmental responsibility, we should not be cutting \ncorners such as the Republican bill would do.\n  At the end of the day, even if they could drill every place they \nwanted to drill with no questions asked, it would have virtually no \nimpact on gasoline prices. Oil prices are set in the global market, and \nwe cannot change them simply by attempting to increase oil production \nwhen it comes to only 2 percent of the known oil reserves.\n  Given the President's recent action and steady increase of \nproduction, this bill is pointless and dangerous. For this reason, I \nurge my colleagues not to support it and to vote against this measure \nthat will be offered later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3068-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3068-S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BELARUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was last February that I went to \nBelarus. I had been invited to go to Lithuania to speak to the \nParliament on the 20th anniversary of their independence from the \nSoviet Union, and I took a second trip into Minsk, Belarus, a neighbor \nnation, because there was a political crisis. It was February, and \nsince the Presidential election in the December before, there had been \na wholesale effort by Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, to imprison \nhis political opponents.\n  With so many significant events going on in the Middle East, there is \nan understandable risk that we lose sight of events happening in \ncountries such as Belarus. In Belarus, under Aleksandr Lukashenko, if \nyou have the temerity to run for President or protest a fraudulent \nelection, you will find yourself thrown in a KGB jail where you are \nlikely to face torture and harsh prison sentences. If this sounds like \na throwback to the Cold War in the Soviet Union, that is exactly what \nit is. Not only is Belarus a throwback to the worst political abuses of \nthe old Soviet era, but the government's enforcers of this bankrupt \nsystem still call their police the KGB.\n  On Saturday, the Lukashenko regime continued its nightmare of \ntotalitarian rule when it convicted one of the country's opposition \nPresidential candidates and former Foreign Minister Andrei Sannikov to \n5 years in prison. You see, Mr. Sannikov had the temerity to run \nagainst the dictator of Europe, Lukashenko. Because of that, even \nhaving lost the election, he is going to pay for it by spending 5 years \nin prison.\n  This photograph shows Mr. Sannikov in the defendant's cage during his \ntrial in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. They put him in a cage. Can \nanyone think of a more telling symbol of Lukashenko's tyranny than a \nsham court proceeding with a KGB cage? His crime? This man ran for \nPresident of his country.\n  In December last year, after nearly two decades of unchecked power, \nLukashenko decided he would have an open election--in his words, an \nopen election. Many took him at his word and decided they would run for \nPresident. Apparently, Lukashenko did not care for that idea. His idea \nof an election is that no one runs against you. So he staged a sham \nelection and then arrested 5 of the 6 Presidential candidates and more \nthan 600 peaceful demonstrators after the election.\n  I visited Belarus some weeks afterward. I met with the family members \nof these brave candidates and activists. I have to tell you, it was a \nmoving experience. The meeting included members of Mr. Sannikov's \nfamily. This is a photo we took in the office of the U.S. consulate in \nMinsk, in Belarus. It shows Kanstantsin Sannikov, Ala Sannikava, and \nLyutsina Khalip. Kanstantsin and Ala are Mr. Sannikov's son and mother.\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\n  Ala told me in tears that her son's arrest led to no contact between \nhim and his family for weeks, and they denied him a lawyer. After he \nwas sentenced to 5 years in prison, she told Radio Liberty that she was \nproud of her son and that ``he suffered so much for the sake of Belarus \n. . . The judicial system has steamrolled our family.''\n  Lyutsina is the grandmother of the candidate's 3-year-old son Danil. \nI wanted to put this photo up because Lukashenko decided it was not \nenough to throw this boy's father into prison; he basically said he was \ngoing to remove this boy from the family as part of the punishment they \nwere going to impose on him for running for President in that country. \nYou see, not only did they arrest Sannikov, but they arrested his wife \ntoo. She was a journalist--automatically suspect in Belarus. Even more \ndespicable, they tried to take custody of this little boy, who was \nstaying with his grandmother. What kind of cruel mind is so afraid of \nthe free expression of ideas that they would go after this little boy \nto further punish the parents--the father who had the nerve to run for \nPresident and the mother who had the nerve to publish in some \nunderground publication an article critical of Lukashenko.\n  President Lukashenko's repression and totalitarian regime have been \ncondemned around the world. Asset freezes and travel bans have been \nplaced on his enablers and police state enforcers. This Senate and the \nEuropean Parliament both have passed sweeping resolutions condemning \nthe regime and calling for new legitimate elections and the release of \nall political prisoners. The families of the detained, the Senate, the \nEuropean Parliament, and National Hockey League Hall of Famer Peter \nStastny have called on the International Ice Hockey Federation to \nsuspend its Belarus-hosted 2014 Ice Hockey Championship until all \npolitical prisoners are unconditionally released. A dictator such as \nLukashenko should not be awarded the international prestige of an event \nwhile prisoners languish in prison for simply exercising their human \nrights. I think it is time for the International Criminal Court \nprosecutor to look into Lukashenko's regime, most notably for the \nallegations of torture.\n  I conclude by simply saying that I want Mr. Sannikov and his many \nbrave colleagues in Belarus and their families to know that the United \nStates will stand by them in their effort to bring a peaceful democracy \nto this great nation of Belarus. We commend their bravery and let them \nknow they are not forgotten.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3069-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 953, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 953) to authorize the \n     conduct of certain lease sales in the Outer Continental \n     Shelf, to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \n     modify the requirements for exploration, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 4 hours of debate equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, we have been debating tax subsidies \nto the big oil companies. The bill proposed by the Senator from New \nJersey would have limited it to just the big five oil companies even \nthough many of the tax breaks or tax credits or deductions they receive \nare the same tax credits that every other company may take--Starbucks, \nMicrosoft, Caterpillar, Google, and Hollywood film producers for \nexample. Many of the other credits look a lot like the R tax credit \nor other tax credits all American businesses may receive. Well, I am \none Senator who is very intrigued with the idea of looking at all of \nthe tax breaks in the Tax Code. There are currently about $1.2 trillion \na year in what we call tax expenditures, and those are intended to be \nfor tax breaks we think are desirable. I am ready to look at all of \nthem and use the money to reduce the tax rate and/or reduce the Federal \ndebt. But if we are going to talk about energy subsidies--tax \nsubsidies--we ought to talk about all energy subsidies. Senator John \nCornyn of Texas has asked the Congressional Research Service to do just \nthis. It is an excellent study, and I commend Senator Cornyn for asking \nfor it. This is some of what it finds.\n\n  According to the report, fossil fuels contributed about 78 percent of \nour energy production in 2009 and received about 13 percent of the \nFederal tax support for energy. However, during that same time 10.6 \npercent of our energy production was from renewables and 77.4 percent \nof our energy tax subsidies went to renewables. So if we are to compare \nthe subsidy per unit of energy, the estimated Federal support per \nmillion Btu's of fossil fuels was 4 cents, while support for renewables \nwas $1.97 per million Btu's.\n  So Federal subsidies for renewables are almost 50 times as great per \nunit of energy as Federal subsidies for fossil fuels. This would be \ndistorted because included within renewables is hydroelectric power. \nMost people think of renewables as ethanol, solar, or wind and those \nare the renewables that actually get the subsidies while hydroelectric \ndoes not.\n  So at least 50 times as great per unit of energy is the Federal \ntaxpayer support for renewable energy compared with fossil fuel energy. \nSo why aren't we including in our debate subsidies for all renewables? \nSpecifically, if we are talking about Big Oil, why don't we talk about \nBig Wind? The Senate seems an appropriate place to talk about Big Wind.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created what is called the production \ntax credit for energy produced using renewable resources. Most of this \nmoney has gone to subsidize Big Wind. It is a policy that was supposed \nto last a few years. It has lasted two decades.\n  Today, the production tax credit for wind gives 2.1 cents for every \nkilowatt hour of wind electricity produced by a wind turbine during the \nfirst 10 years of operation. Let's put this into a context that is \ncurrent. The new Shepherd's Flat Wind Farm in Oregon will have 338 of \nthese huge wind turbines, producing enough power to run approximately \n250,000 homes and will cost the American taxpayer about $57 million a \nyear in subsidies for that electricity produced. If we allocated the \ntax credit per home, taxpayers will be paying $2,300 over the next 10 \nyears for each of the homes served by the Shepherd's Flat Wind Farm in \nOregon.\n  This doesn't even take into account the fact that $1.3 billion in \nFederal loan guarantees to this project means Big Wind will have its \nrisk of default also financed by the taxpayer. Fossil fuel companies \ndon't have that advantage. Nuclear power companies don't have that \nadvantage, even though their electricity is completely clean--no \nsulfur, no nitrogen, no mercury, no carbon. If, like nuclear or fossil \nloan guarantees do, the wind farm in Oregon had to pay the risk of \ndefault up front as a fee, it would cost another $130 million. That is \nmoney out of the pockets of taxpayers.\n  The total cost of the wind production tax credit over the next 10 \nyears will cost the American taxpayers more than $26 billion. Let me \nsay that again. American taxpayers are subsidizing big wind over the \nnext 10 years by more than $26 billion with one tax credit. In fact, \nthe tax breaks for the five big oil companies we have been debating on \nthe Senate floor this week actually cost less than all of the money we \ngive to big wind. The tax breaks for the five big oil companies amount \nto about $21 billion over 10 years.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration in 2007, big wind \nreceived an $18.82 subsidy per megawatt hour--25 times as much per \nmegawatt hour as subsidies for all other forms of electricity combined. \nBut wind is about the least efficient means of energy production we \nhave. It accounts for just about 2 percent of our electricity. It is \navailable only when the wind blows, which is about one-third of the \ntime. The Tennessee Valley Authority says it is reliable even less than \nthat, meaning we can have it when we need it only about 12-15 percent \nof the time.\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\n  Wind farms take up a huge amount of space. Turbines are 50 stories \nhigh. Their flashing lights can be seen for 20 miles. An unbroken line \nof turbines along the 2,178-mile Appalachian Trail would produce no \nmore electricity than four nuclear reactors on 4 square miles of land.\n  Wind is generally the strongest and land is available where the \nelectricity isn't actually needed. So we have thousands of miles of new \ntransmission lines proposed to get the energy from where it is produced \nto where it needs to go. Those often go through conservation areas, and \naccording to the National Academy of Sciences wind power is more \nexpensive than other forms of electricity, such as coal, nuclear, \nbiomass, geothermal, and natural gas.\n  We haven't even talked about the fact these wind turbines only last \nabout 25 years. The question is, Who is going to take them down? Wind \nfarms also kill as many as 275,000 birds each year, according to the \nAmerican Bird Conservancy. They can interfere with radar systems, and \nmany who live near them say they are very noisy.\n  So I ask the question: If wind has all these drawbacks, is a mature \ntechnology, and receives subsidies greater than any other form of \nenergy per unit of actual energy produced, why are we subsidizing it \nwith billions of dollars and not including it in this debate? Why are \nwe talking about Big Oil and not talking about Big Wind?\n  I believe there are appropriate uses of temporary incentives and \nsubsidies to help jump-start innovation and the development of new \ntechnology--such as jump-starting electric cars or natural gas fleets \nof trucks or loan guarantees for nuclear powerplants and other forms of \nclean energy--as long as these are short term. I believe research and \ndevelopment is an appropriate role for the Federal Government whether \nit is in recycling used nuclear fuel or finding alternative biofuels \nmade from crops we don't eat. I believe it is entirely appropriate for \nthere to be research for offshore wind farms, which we don't know as \nmuch about and which might actually prove to be a useful supplement in \nthe Northeast. But my point is, if we are going to debate subsidies to \nBig Oil, we ought to be debating all the energy subsidies including \nthose to Big Wind.\n  There is a difference between the Republican plan and the Democratic \nplan for $4 gasoline and high energy prices. The Democratic cure for \nhigh prices is basically to raise the price. They want to tax energy \nmore, but that makes energy cost more. Republicans want to find more \nAmerican energy and use less energy. We might sum it up this way: \nRepublicans want to find more and use less; Democrats want to find less \nand tax more.\n  The Democratic plan, according to Senator Schumer of New York, was \nnever intended to talk about lowering gas prices. Senator Reid agreed, \nSenator Baucus agreed, Senator Landrieu agreed, and Senator Begich \nagreed, but why aren't we talking about trying to find a way to lower \ngasoline prices when it is $4 a gallon and going up?\n  The Republican plan is very specific: Find more American oil and more \nAmerican natural gas. We can find that offshore where 30 percent of our \ndomestic oil and 25 percent of our natural gas is produced. We can find \nit on Federal lands, and we can find it in Alaska.\n  The other part of our equation is to use less. We have some agreement \nwith the Obama administration on some of these ideas. There are a \nnumber of them: jump-start electric cars. Senator Merkley and I have a \nbill that is before the Energy Committee tomorrow to do just that. I \nbelieve electrifying our cars and trucks is the single best way to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. There is legislation to jump-\nstart natural gas for trucks, biofuels from crops we don't eat, and \nfuel efficiency. All these are various ways to use less.\n  Senators Thune and Barrasso have performed a service by setting the \nrecord straight to show that the United States produces a lot of oil. \nWe are actually the third largest oil producer in the world. So I ask \nthis question: If less Libyan oil can raise gasoline prices--which it \ndid--then more American oil should help lower gasoline prices. At least \nfor every dollar of American oil we produce, it is one less dollar we \nhave to send overseas for foreign oil.\n  So, Madam President, the Republican plan is to find more American oil \nand natural gas and to use less. My suggestion is, if we are going to \nbe talking about tax subsidies for Big Oil, let's talk about tax \nsubsidies for all energy. The Senate floor seems an especially \nappropriate place, if we are going to talk about Big Oil, to also talk \nabout tax subsidies for Big Wind.\n  Madam President, I commend to my colleagues a report of the \nCongressional Research Service sent to Senator John Cornyn of Texas \ndated May 16 entitled ``Energy Production by Source and Energy Tax \nIncentives'' from Molly Sherlock.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see the Senator from Kansas is \nhere, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nlegislation that has been introduced by my friend and our Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, that would take our country in the direction \nof greater domestic energy production, and certainly robust job \ncreation, as opposed to taxing--or trying to--the very people who \nprovide our energy.\n  Madam President, as every American knows, few issues today are more \ncritical to the American taxpayer than the price of energy. Whether it \nis powering our homes or fueling farm equipment or filling up our cars \nat the pump, the price of energy directly impacts the cost of goods and \noperating expenses for our American producers.\n  Now, while there is a multitude of variables that impact the cost of \ngasoline, it is important we don't overlook the main factor in \nimpacting prices at the pump--and one more time, for my colleagues \nacross the aisle, that is the global supply and demand of crude.\n  With roughly 70 percent of the price of gasoline and diesel \ncontingent on the price of crude, it should be easy to understand that \nany fluctuations in global supply and demand is the most important \nfactor determining what consumers pay at the pump. Considering in my \nState alone the oil and gas industry supports over 119,000 jobs and \nannually contributes $14 billion to the Kansas economy, it is not hard \nto understand that much of our concerns regarding the U.S. economy and \nrising unemployment could be addressed--could be addressed--if we \nstopped hindering the ability of American energy businesses to grow and \nto produce.\n  I am sure most Americans wonder why Washington is even considering a \npolicy that is counter to an industry solely capable--solely capable--\nand responsible for this type of job creation. Sadly, this is exactly \nthe proposal floated by some of my colleagues and friends in Congress \nand by the President.\n  In the President's 2012 budget proposal, he proposed almost $90 \nbillion worth of tax increases on the oil and gas industry--taxes the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service has stated could make oil \nand natural gas more expensive for U.S. consumers and likely increase \nforeign dependence. Well, that didn't work in regards to the budget, so \nthey are back. Complementing the President's troublesome budget \nproposal last week, a number of my colleagues introduced legislation \nsingling out U.S.-owned integrated oil and gas companies by removing \ntax expenditures these companies rely on to hire more American workers, \ndeveloping greater amounts of needed energy, and--hello--to support the \nmillions of American investors whose IRAs and pension funds invest \nsignificantly in energy stocks.\n  What is even worse, at least six of my colleagues across the aisle \nare on record admitting this legislation will do nothing to reduce \nprices at the pump. It is sort of a ``gotcha'' piece of legislation. So \nto address American concerns about rising gas prices, my friends across \nthe aisle have introduced\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nlegislation they readily know will not ease the price at the pump. This \ndoesn't make any sense. In addition to the fact the Democratic energy \nbill will not help reduce gas prices, I want to further highlight the \nnegative impacts it would have on American investors. This is \nimportant.\n\n  Probably the biggest distortion repeated in the media and by some of \nmy friends here on Capitol Hill is the notion that a few select \ncorporate executives are the sole benefactors of record high profits \nenjoyed by these energy companies. It makes good politics today to beat \nup on these people and that is what happened in regard to the Finance \nCommittee--a lot of press there--when in reality it is the millions of \nmiddle-class American investors whose retirement plans benefit greatly \nfrom healthy profits. Because these companies are publicly traded, they \nare owned largely by individuals and institutional investors \nresponsible for managing the mutual funds and IRA and pension plans for \nmillions of Americans whose future economic security depends on the \nsuccess of these companies.\n  For example, in Kansas alone there are over 18,000 shareholders of \nExxonMobil--that is 18,000 of my constituents--who will be hurt, angry, \nfrustrated when they find out that legislation that targets citizens, \ninvestors who actually own these companies, could be passed.\n  Beyond individual shareholders, many teachers, State government \nemployees, rely on strong returns on their investments in these \ncompanies. One example is the New Jersey Public Employee Pension Fund. \nIts holdings of U.S.-based integrated oil and gas companies make over 4 \npercent of its total portfolio.\n  Realizing the likelihood of a strong return on their investment, it \nis no wonder why so many public employee pension funds throughout the \ncountry invest heavily in energy companies. The good news is that the \nenergy tax increase proposal was defeated last night, as its passage \nwould have done absolutely nothing toward reducing energy prices or \nhelping the economic security of millions of middle-class American \ninvestors. Unfortunately, the problems facing true economic growth and \nenergy security do not end with misguided tax policy. In addition to \nmaking it more costly to produce domestic energy, the administration is \nworking to close off some of our Nation's most abundant sources.\n  For example, under the current administration, the Department of the \nInterior canceled seven oil development leases in Utah that were \nlocated within the larger formation covering three States that the \nBureau of Land Management has estimated contains around 800 billion \nbarrels of oil--more than three times the proven reserves in Saudi \nArabia. This of course is in addition to the Gulf of Mexico deep water \ndrilling moratorium imposed last summer which has had a lasting \nnegative effect on gulf coast economies. I know the President said we \nare going to permit these and they can drill, but somehow or other you \nnever get the permit finalized.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate my point about the underlying \neconomic factors which, like it or not, despite the politics, are not \nthe driving forces behind the price of gas at the pump. As global \ndemand rises, prices will also rise. As global demand is potentially \ndisrupted, as we see in the Middle East today, then market instability \nfollows. If we can allow greater access to our own domestic resources \nand provide industry the necessary tools to expand--which is exactly \nwhat Leader McConnell's energy bill would do--then we will be able to \nput more Americans back to work and add to the global supply of crude \nwhich, over time, undoubtedly will help stabilize prices.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nRepublican leader's Offshore Production and Safety Act, S. 953. I have \nto say it is a breath of fresh air to be discussing a substantive \nenergy policy proposal.\n  Last week in the Senate Finance Committee and yesterday on the Senate \nfloor, we witnessed a cynical charade as some of my colleagues \nattempted to exploit high gas prices as an excuse to, once again, raise \ntaxes. It is no secret the liberals in Congress have an answer to every \nproblem but unfortunately it has been the same answer for every \nproblem. Whether the problem is health care costs, out-of-control \nspending, unemployment, or high gas prices, their answer in every case \nis to raise taxes. The American people have caught on to the uninspired \nmonotony of that particular message.\n  In the last election they sent us their own message: enough with the \nspending and enough with the taxing. Apparently, though, that message \nwas not loud enough or clear enough because the worn-out big government \napproach remains the only option being offered by my friends on the \nother side. Americans are fed up with lame excuses to expand the size \nof government. What Americans want, need, and deserve is real solutions \nto real problems. Those problems are real. High gas prices are an \nindicator of a much deeper problem facing our Nation's energy security. \nIt is a problem that runs deep but it is not too difficult to \nunderstand.\n  Our problem is a President who would rather buy foreign oil than \nproduce it here in America. In fact, he not only wants to buy foreign \noil, he is willing to subsidize it. These are Brazilian workers, \nBrazilian oil workers. I hope Americans were watching the news as \nPresident Obama handed over more than $2 billion to Brazil's \ngovernment-owned oil company to produce Brazilian oil. It was a nice \ngesture, I am sure. But why aren't we spending it here at home? And why \naren't we able to drill here at home? Why aren't we, the third largest \noil producer in the world, able to go after our own oil to bring these \nprices down.\n  Liberals spent this last week calling basic tax deductions for \nAmerican companies ``subsidies.'' Funny thing, because those same \nliberals appear to have no problem with this gigantic handout of \ntaxpayer dollars to a foreign competitor.\n\n  I like Brazil, and I am happy they are doing as well as they are, so \nthis is not a knock at Brazil. It is basically a criticism of our \nPresident for giving $2 billion to help them with their oil exploration \nwhen they seem to be doing just fine by themselves. At least I am \nassuming the liberals have no problem with it because they have been \ndeathly silent on this subject during this entire debate.\n  I hope Americans were watching because that was their money our \nPresident was sending out of our country, out of our economy, and out \nof the reach of tens of thousands of unemployed American energy workers \nwhom this administration has helped to put out of work.\n  Let me put up another chart. These are our workers. These guys are \nout of work. These men and women who can develop our own oil are out of \nwork because of this administration.\n  We all know about the President's artificially broad moratorium on \ndrilling in the gulf and how it has devastated that already crippled \nregion. But the President's anti-Midas touch has reached out to kill \noil production in other regions of the country as well.\n  Since taking office, President Obama has cut Federal energy lease \nofferings by 67 percent in the Rockies alone and a whopping 87 percent \nin my home State of Utah. Is it any wonder we are becoming more \ndependent on foreign oil? Is it any wonder our jobless rate remains at \nhistoric levels? Is it any wonder government revenues are down? Let's \nnot forget that this is the same President using our tax dollars to \nsubsidize Brazilian oil production to the tune of $2 billion.\n  After taking office, one of President Obama's earliest actions was to \nwithdraw 77 energy leases in Utah. These leases had been through almost \na decade of environmental studies. They had jumped through every \nenvironmental hoop there was and had already been auctioned off and \npaid for by good-standing energy companies. We know we are dealing with \na very aggressive anti-energy agenda when we see leases pulled back \nthat have already been\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\npaid for. The energy companies are not blind; they see it too.\n  A recent survey of the energy industry in the Rockies tells us the \ntragic and unnecessary story. Due to the hostile atmosphere created by \nthe Obama administration, $1.1 billion of capital investment was \nshifted from the Rockies to other areas, including overseas. If it were \nnot for the anti-energy efforts of this administration, the companies \nsurveyed stated they would invest an additional $2.8 billion in the \nregion in the future. Eighty-nine of the energy companies surveyed said \nthey would continue to divert investment from the Rockies until the \ncurrent policies become less hostile, and 71 percent of the industry \nrespondents stated that dissatisfaction with the Federal permitting \nprocess is the general variable driving investment right out of our \nNation.\n  When are we going to wake up? When is this administration going to \nwake up?\n  Some of my friends on the other side have an extremely difficult time \nunderstanding this, but when we deter energy companies, we kill real \njobs and we kill domestic energy production, and we make America \nweaker. These aren't just jobs, these are highly paid jobs. Yet we are \nwilling to subsidize the Brazilian oil workers. I like those workers. I \nthink they are finding oil for their country. I think their country is \nenergy efficient because of their work offshore. Some of those rigs \nused to be in the gulf but no longer can be there because of the stupid \nanti-energy policies of this administration.\n  Here we have American companies willing to spend more than $2 billion \nof their own money to create American jobs and American oil, but \nPresident Obama says no--or at least the people around him who advise \nhim tell him to say no. Yet our President does not hesitate to give \nmore than $2 billion in taxpayer funds to Brazil to create foreign \njobs. Just wait, because this story actually gets worse. The President \nthen hopes taxpayers will send even more money overseas as we buy \nBrazil's oil--oil we already have subsidized in the first place.\n  But the President saved the best for last. He now proposes raising \ntaxes on American energy production.\n  This deserves repeating. The President says no to American energy \ncompanies wanting to use their own profits to make more American jobs \nand more American oil, but he then gives away taxpayer money to \nsubsidize foreign jobs and create more dependency on foreign oil. While \nhe is at it, he may as well tax American energy production for good \nmeasure. That is what they want to do to us. It doesn't make sense.\n  Look, I like the President. I personally am a friend of the \nPresident. I can't believe he is doing this on his own. He has to have \nthese dumbbells down there at the White House feeding him this stuff. \nBut he is bright enough to look through it and see it doesn't work or \nis it just that their supporters are demanding--the Democratic \nsupporters are demanding--this type of harm to our country and to our \npeople?\n  Well, I said it twice, and it makes less sense the more I think about \nit. He may as well tax American energy production for good measure.\n  The whole farce would be comical if it weren't so incredibly harmful \nto our Nation, our economy, and to our American families who have \ndedicated their lives to providing the United States with the domestic \noil and gas we so desperately need.\n  I wish to read an excerpt from a letter I received from Cindy and \nBruce of Uintah County, UT, an oil-rich county, if we were allowed to \nget the permit and go out and find it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to continue my \nstatement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Cindy and Bruce write:\n\n       Our family returned to the Vernal, Utah, area . . . after \n     being absent for 10 years. We realized we loved the area and \n     wanted to be back with our families. . . . At that point we \n     decided we wanted to do more than just get by in life working \n     for someone else. . . . Since things looked very promising \n     for the oilfield industry, we started a small oilfield \n     trucking company. We struggled to make all this work and to \n     establish a reputable and trusted company with a good \n     customer base. In February of 2009, as the new presidential \n     administration and new head of the Department of the Interior \n     took over, the oil and gas production companies slowed their \n     drilling and production programs drastically. The RAPID \n     economic change was shocking. Overnight, we went from being a \n     prospering business to a business that is just hoping we can \n     pay our bills. . . . Our story is not unique. It is the same \n     story for many of our friends, neighbors and family members. \n     Our lives and the economy here are in shambles. It is not \n     because we did not work hard, spend wisely, follow all the \n     government rules, or that we made irresponsible decisions. It \n     is because of sudden changes in our government.\n\n  This was no naturally occurring economic downturn that killed Bruce \nand Cindy's business. It was hostile government policies intent on \nslowing domestic energy production on Federal lands.\n  This point is made again and again to me in letters from Utahans from \nthis region. One letter states:\n\n       As I talk with many people each day at work, there is one \n     common thread: The policies of the current administration \n     have made it a very risky business for companies trying to \n     produce oil in this area. Leases have been canceled, then \n     resold, and then suspended. The confidence of the oil \n     producers has been undermined by these actions. They have \n     lost a lot of money on the bids for these leases.\n\n  These experiences are duplicated wherever Federal energy leases are \noffered. I can say I have never seen a more anti-energy administration \nthan the current one, and all Americans are feeling the pain of \nPresident Obama's suicidal energy policies.\n\n  Today, we are talking about a real solid energy proposal. It is a \nproposal that will create American jobs in the gulf and throughout \nAmerica's energy industry. The Offshore Production and Safety Act is a \nproposal that will strengthen our Nation, not weaken it. It will get us \nproducing American oil again in the gulf, and that is a critically \nimportant goal.\n  If I had my choice, we would be discussing a more comprehensive \nenergy bill that would also be reopening oil production on onshore and \noffshore leases. I am an original cosponsor of a bill with my \ncolleague, Senator David Vitter, called the 3-D Bill. The Ds stand for \ndomestic jobs, domestic energy, and deficit reduction. This bill \ndeserves full consideration. It is a bill that would increase jobs, \nreduce energy costs, and generate significant revenue to State and \nFederal Governments. In short, the bill would reverse the Obama \nadministration's onerous new constraints on domestic oil and gas \nproduction. The 3-D bill would reverse bans of some offshore Federal \nleases in each Outer Continental Shelf planning area, it would open \nANWR to oil production, directing some of the resulting revenues toward \nrenewable energy production, and it would reverse President Obama's \nrecent moves against commercial oil shale production.\n  Unfortunately, we are not discussing that bill today and here is why. \nRepublicans have had to force the Democrats' hand to allow a debate on \neven a limited proposal such as the one introduced by our Republican \nleader--and well done. But this issue is not going away, and I will \ncontinue to push the issue of onshore and offshore Federal leases and \nadvocate for the 3-D bill.\n  The bill we voted on yesterday had nothing to do with gas prices or \nenergy policy or getting more energy. As we heard from Member after \nMember on the other side, that bill was about raising taxes for more \ngovernment spending. The bill we are voting on today is a serious \nenergy proposal. It is a smart proposal that, if passed, would create \nreal jobs, produce real domestic oil and gas, and leave the deficit-\nbusting revenues for the government. As such, I strongly support it. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I hope our friends on the other side will see this. It is time we \nstand and start changing this, regardless of what this administration \nis doing to America.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise to discuss our Nation's energy \npolicy. I was very disappointed by last night's vote. Actually, as one \nof my colleagues pointed out, it was more political theater instead of \na serious attempt at addressing this Nation's energy needs.\n  Instead of investing time on votes that will not bring gas prices \ndown, we need to do what Americans expect us\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nto do; that is, adopt a careful, all-inclusive, comprehensive approach. \nPut simply, we need to consider our assets and we need to develop those \nassets in a responsible way. That sounds very simple to the average \nperson but, unfortunately, it seems to allude us here.\n  Last night's vote on a narrow tax issue, that in a very bipartisan \nway was recognized not to reduce the price of gas, doesn't get us \nheaded in the right direction. If anything, it was a step backward. So \nI wish to take a more serious look at the energy resources we have in \nthe United States to lay the foundation for the argument that we need \nto develop these resources--energy that could help address our Nation's \nsecurity as well as our economic security.\n  Unfortunately, we are a victim of misperception that somehow the \nUnited States is running out of energy and that our own resources are \nnot sufficient. But that is not true. In fact, the data tells us that \nthe United States can be a dominant energy power. Let me say that \nagain. The United States can be a dominant energy player--a power--in \nthe global marketplace. With the proper Federal policies in place, the \nUnited States can step into a dominating position.\n  This isn't something I dreamed up last night. This is not something \nMike Johanns just invented. This comes directly from the Congressional \nResearch Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress.\n  So let's go through what the CRS said to us in a recent report. They \nsay the United States is No. 3 in global oil production. In 2009, the \nUnited States produced about 9.1 million barrels per day. By \ncomparison, Saudi Arabia produced about 500,000 more than the United \nStates per day at 9.8 million, and Russia leads all countries at 9.9 \nmillion barrels per day. So today we are No. 3 in global production of \noil, behind Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\n  For an additional perspective, consider this: The United States \nproduces more than double what Iran produces and produces more than \nIran and China combined.\n  Looking beyond oil production, let's consider our existing assets. \nAccording to the CRS, the United States has 163 billion barrels of oil \nthat is technically recoverable. That is a lot, and that is more than \nsix times what the administration suggests in its favorite talking \npoints.\n  Let's compare our oil assets to what we import from Saudi Arabia, a \nmajor U.S. supplier. In 2009, we imported about 1 million barrels per \nday from Saudi Arabia, for a total of 365 million barrels per year. So \nevery 3 years, at 2009 import rates, we will import just over 1 billion \nbarrels of oil from Saudi Arabia. So the United States has enough oil \nto entirely replace imports from Saudi Arabia for a long time--more \nthan 400 years.\n  If we shift the focus to natural gas, the United States has enough \nnatural gas reserves to meet U.S. demand for 90 years.\n  Let's turn to coal. Again, based on CRS analysis, our domestic coal \nresources are huge. In fact, the United States is No. 1 in world coal \nresources. The United States has 28 percent of the world's coal. \nAmerican recoverable coal reserves are 262 billion tons of coal.\n  To put that in perspective, the United States consumes about 1.2 \nbillion short tons per year--simply extraordinary. What I am saying is, \nthat is over 200 years' worth.\n  Then, CRS did something else interesting. They consolidated the \nenergy resources, and then ranked the United States against the rest of \nthe world. The United States came in at No. 1. This does not include \noil shale or methane hydrates.\n  CRS concluded that total fossil fuels within the United States, in \nbarrels of oil equivalent, are 972.6 billion.\n  So considering the United States leads the world in total energy \nresources, we need to evaluate any energy policy on whether it makes \nstrides to use those resources in a responsible way or whether it keeps \nthose resources on the sidelines.\n  The Congressional Research Service has debunked the myth that we are \nenergy poor, that we have somehow consumed our resources. In fact, our \nNation is No. 1. We are rich with resources: oil, natural gas, coal, \nand other resources--and lots of it.\n  Yet the President, for whatever reason, keeps using a dramatically \ndifferent talking point, and it creates the wrong impression. Just \nrecently, on May 6, 2011, he said:\n\n       The challenge is we've got about two to three percent of \n     the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's \n     oil.\n\n  The impression I think he is trying to create is that we have \nvirtually no reserves. Yet we are trying to grab all the resources. \nThis statement seriously, if not intentionally, underestimates \nAmerica's energy resources because it only relies upon proven reserves. \nThat would be like a millionaire complaining he cannot afford a $10 \ndinner because he has only $5 in his pocket.\n  Here is what CRS says about proven reserves:\n\n       Proved reserves are oil, natural gas, or coal that have \n     been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or \n     other exploratory measures.\n\n  In other words, unless you drill or otherwise explore, proven \nreserves never expand and our country stays neutral.\n  So the President's talking point completely ignores what they call \nundiscovered technically recoverable--the estimated American resources \nin those areas where exploration has not yet occurred. Thus, it is no \nsurprise what happens when we do not issue permits to explore and \ndrill. Proven reserves would never expand if you did not issue the \npermits.\n  That is the problem with this administration's approach to energy \npolicy. They have gone out of their way to oppose utilization of \nAmerican energy sources and then they claim that somehow we have used \nthem up.\n  Most famously, the administration supported a national energy tax \ncalled cap and trade--a bill that was intentionally designed to \nincrease costs for consumers on everything from oil to gasoline we put \nin our cars, to coal, to the electricity we use. In fact, the President \neven admitted his policy was designed to make the prices for American \nconsumers ``necessarily sky-rocket.'' Unfortunately, if not remarkably, \nif not completely unbelievably, that is a direct quote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Today, even after this policy has been repudiated on a \nbipartisan basis by Congress, the administration continues to march \nahead with similar proposals at the administrative level.\n  The administration has canceled leases across the Rocky Mountain \nWest. They have blocked permits in the Gulf of Mexico. They have \nblocked permits in Alaska.\n  While the President's announcement this weekend would appear to be a \nwelcome recognition that oil and gas leasing matters, it disregards the \nvirtual lack of permits to explore. No doubt, leasing is necessary, but \nif you do not have the permits, leasing means nothing. Supply stays the \nsame, world demand continues to increase, and no one should be \nsurprised by the economics.\n  No one should be surprised that this administration's policy has a \ndirect correlation to the price of gasoline you pump into your vehicle. \nThat is why today we are debating legislation that is enormously \nimportant. This bill requires the issuance of permits. It emphasizes \nsafety and environmental responsibility. It does require spill response \nand containment plans, and it requires we do everything we can to try \nto improve supply. It says we can develop our natural resources \nexpeditiously but in a responsible and prudent way. It is a responsible \nstep in the right direction.\n  Let me put this another way: We, the United States, do not need to \nbeg the rest of the world for energy resources. We do not have to go \nwith cup in hand. Energy is too important to our growth, to job \ncreation. It is too big an issue to outsource to another country, \nespecially to countries that do not like our policies.\n  It is critical we get energy policy right. Gasoline prices are now \nover $4 a gallon. That is hurting every American. It is hurting job \ncreation. Heating\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nand cooling bills are going up. Farmers see their fertilizer, their \nnatural gas bills expand. Their input costs are going through the roof.\n  Our people deserve better, and that is why I encourage my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Robert Harris\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise, as I try to do on a regular \nbasis, to honor another one of our great Federal employees. I know in \nthe great Empire State of New York there are literally thousands of \nfolks who oftentimes work anonymously to make sure, day in and day out, \nour Federal Government functions. This is a recognition I took over \nfrom our colleague, Senator Ted Kaufman, after he served in the Senate, \nand I am proud to continue this tradition where, on a regular basis, we \ncome forward and honor one of those Federal employees who contributes \nto making our Nation safer, making our Nation more efficient, allowing \nmany of us in America to enjoy the benefits of our country, oftentimes, \nagain, without a lot of recognition.\n  The individual I am recognizing is Robert Harris, who is the Deputy \nLegal Advisor at the U.S. State Department.\n  Mr. Harris has played a critical role in advancing American foreign \npolicy around the world. He has served as the lead negotiator on \nseveral important bilateral and multilateral agreements on \nantiterrorism, extradition, and global environmental protection. He \nalso provides advice on issues ranging from treaties to law enforcement \nand intelligence.\n  But it is Mr. Harris's work to advance human rights around the world \nthat sets him apart. In recent years, the United States had fallen out \nof compliance with five global human rights treaties, making it \ndifficult for our Nation's diplomats to press other nations to fulfill \ntheir human rights obligations--something I know the Acting President \npro tempore has a particular interest in. Mr. Harris oversaw five major \nreports documenting U.S. human rights activities and got our country \nback on track with the rest of the world.\n  Mr. Harris is also leading the U.S. delegation in the U.S.-China \nLegal Experts Dialogue, which provides an opportunity for both \ncountries to exchange expertise and discuss reforms on a variety of \nissues.\n  Mr. Harris has successfully engaged the Chinese to implement an \nexisting law--an existing Chinese law--that reduces prison terms and to \nmore frequently grant parole to individuals serving for nonviolent \noffenses--again, advancing human rights in China.\n  Michael Kozak, a senior aide at the State Department, commented that \nMr. Harris's negotiations have ``done more for concrete advancement of \nChinese human rights than any previous human rights dialogue that I've \never seen.''\n  Mr. Harris also supervised the legal team that supported the \nPresident's signature on the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities in 2009 and guided the administration's legal \napproach to handling a U.N. conference on racism. More recently, he led \nU.S. and international efforts at the United Nations to prosecute \npirates engaged off the coast of Somalia.\n  As a 25-year veteran of the State Department, Robert Harris's \ncontributions have gone a long way to advance American foreign policy \nand preserve our Nation's record as a leader in human rights. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in thanking him for his service.\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, Mr. President, as you see me on this floor--and I \nknow you share this commitment to those Federal employees who work in \nthe great State of Minnesota--too often, when we have our political \ndialogs here, we get closed and sometimes cavalier attitudes toward \nshutting down our Nation's government and the economic consequences it \nwould have on our overall economy and the private sector and also the \nimmediate consequences it would have on the literally hundreds of \nthousands of great Americans who serve us as Federal employees. Today \nwe take a moment to celebrate Mr. Harris's service, particularly in the \narea of human rights.\n  I think it is a record of service of which we can all be proud. We \nsometimes come down here and have tendencies to trash the Federal \nGovernment. I sometimes believe we do that at the expense of these \npeople who work oftentimes for less pay, longer hours, and without a \nlot of recognition. This is some small way we are trying to recognize \nMr. Harris and countless others who serve our Nation day in and day \nout.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last night the Senate defeated a \nmisguided attempt to raise taxes on the five largest energy companies \nthat are operating in our country. That bill, as we discussed, would \nhave done nothing to reduce our gas prices, nothing to create jobs in \nAmerica, and nothing to increase domestic energy production.\n  Furthermore, it would have hardly made a dent in our spiraling debt. \nPut another way, last night's effort would have done nothing to address \nthe problems that most Americans care about, that most Americans are \ntalking about, as they discuss things around the dinner table.\n  This morning we are here to debate a very different bill, called the \nOffshore Production and Safety Act. It was recently introduced by the \nminority leader, myself, and 16 other Senators. There is a very clear \ncontrast, without a doubt, between this and what was brought up \nyesterday.\n  Instead of punishing a handful of companies within the oil and gas \nindustry, we provide new opportunities to put Americans back to work. \nInstead of merely attempting to assign blame for our Nation's energy \nchallenges, we develop a policy that we are proposing that will start \nto work right now and yield real benefits in the years ahead. And \ninstead of raising taxes regardless of the consequences, we ensure that \na far larger source of revenues, those that are derived from new \noffshore production, will be generated in the years ahead.\n  The bottom line is that our legislation is both common sense and long \noverdue. It will move our energy policy forward, not backward, and it \nwould do so by addressing three pressing needs: We provide a boost to \noffshore energy production; we improve the safety of those operations; \nand we streamline our notoriously slow Federal bureaucracy.\n  Before I describe these sections in greater detail, I think it is \nimportant to explain why we focus on offshore production while at the \nsame time we are focusing on offshore safety. The answer to the first \npart of that question is that our Outer Continental Shelf contains huge \nquantities, vast quantities of undiscovered oil and gas, some 86 \nbillion barrels of oil, and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  The answer then to the second part is we all remember--we all \nremember and we should not forget--what happened last summer. We are \ncommitted to improving the safety of offshore production activities so \nit does not happen again.\n  As I mentioned, we call our bill the Offshore Production and Safety \nAct, because we understand that those terms--both production and \nsafety--should be part and parcel of the same policy. We want our \noffshore industry to be working. But we need it to be working safely.\n  Those were words I used yesterday in the committee hearing on energy \nwhen we focused on the OCS reform bill. We want our offshore industry \nto be working, but we want to have that safety component. We know our \nNation will need oil for decades to come, even under the most \noptimistic scenario we have out there.\n  We know offshore production will create thousands of badly needed \njobs, not just on the offshore rigs themselves, but all across America, \nand that it will simultaneously generate tremendous revenue for our \ngovernment at a time when we are looking for those revenues. We know \nthat for every barrel of oil we produce here, that is one less barrel \nwe have to purchase from someone else, typically from somebody else \nthat could care less\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nabout our situation here in this country.\n  It is not just me, not Lisa Murkowski from a producing State. It is \nnot just Republicans who understand these benefits. Clearly President \nObama and his team acknowledge these benefits as well. I do want to \ntake an aside and recognize and commend the President for announcing \nthat he will hold annual leases in Alaska's Natural Petroleum Reserve, \nthe NPRA, establishing a permitting office in Alaska, and pursuing \ndevelopmental opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic.\n  I have routinely criticized this administration on certain aspects of \ntheir energy policy. But the President deserves credit for taking these \nsteps and I acknowledge them. I will look forward to seeing those \nactually carried out, to see that followed through.\n  The Offshore Production and Safety Act offers us a chance to make \neven greater profits. To boost offshore production, the first part of \nthe bill would require lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and \nVirginia to be put back on the schedule. Those are areas that are \nprojected to contain billions of barrels of oil. But if we refuse to \neven offer up the leases, then that energy is never going to be brought \nto market. We would also extend for 1 year all of the leases that were \nheld back from production because of the administration's moratorium.\n  The second part of the bill relates to the safety, the safety of \noffshore production. Again it is pretty straightforward. It is pretty \nsimple. We require that each leaseholder develop a spill response and \ncontainment plan to make sure if an accident does occur, immediate \naction can be taken to contain it and to protect the environment. This \nis critical. This is what we are all hoping for and waiting for after \nthe Deepwater Horizon last year.\n  To further increase our Nation's response capacity, we would \nestablish a public-private task force on spill response and mitigation \nmeasures. We would also require the Comptroller General to identify any \ngap in the legal authority or spill response capability that would need \nto be resolved.\n  This bill we have before us and that we will move to today, with the \nvote this afternoon, will actually mark the first time any safety \nlegislation has been voted on in the Senate since the Deepwater Horizon \nincident. So this Republican proposal is the first time. We did not see \nthat happen last Congress. I know Chairman Bingaman and I certainly \nhoped we would see it. But it was not moved through last year. It was \nnot part of the proposal we took up yesterday.\n  The third and final part of our bill addresses our notoriously slow \nFederal bureaucracy. Oil and gas projects are routinely delayed, not \nbecause of the technological limits, or even the regulatory \nrequirements, but because the Federal Government is simply too slow in \nmaking decisions. To remedy the situation, we would limit the amount of \ntime that Interior can take to decide on drilling permits. We do allow \nfor some flexibility here, but when delays do occur, we require an \nexplanation as to why. What happened? What is holding it up? Because \nlitigation is increasingly used to halt new development, we provide \nexpedited consideration of those cases in a specific court.\n  We know this bill does not contain every pro-production piece every \nMember may wish. I wish to see an ANWR provision in here, but it is not \nin here. There are additional items I clearly wish to advance, most \nnotably, revenue sharing, critically important for a coastal State such \nas Alaska, and for my friend and colleague from Louisiana.\n  I am going to be working to advance this bill and, if it advances, \noffer amendments. If the bill does not advance, I am going to be \nworking within the committee to continue to push revenue sharing and \nother issues that speak to the pro-production piece. But for purposes \nof this bill before us, I realize that with the revenue-sharing issue, \nthis does present a scoring issue which we need to resolve. So clearly \nmore discussion needs to come for that to happen. But, regardless, I \nurge every Member who realizes the critical need for increased domestic \nproduction to join together to advance this modest and very responsible \nstart.\n  The purpose of this bill, the reason why we are ready to take it up, \nmove it today, is it really is so simple. We are not asking for that \nmuch: a handful of lease sales to be put back on the schedule, basic \nsafety measures be implemented, and permitting decisions be made on \ntime. Our goal--pretty simply--is to put offshore production back on \ntrack closer to where it should be and closer to where we need it to \nbe.\n  If there is one word that should be used to describe this bill, it \nwould be modest. Everything within it is straightforward. Nothing is \noutlandish. Nothing goes too far. There are no poison pills in it. \nSince its introduction, the President has very explicitly endorsed \nseveral of the provisions that are contained within it. Our proposal is \nfair, it is sensible, and I believe it is time for the Senate to send \nit on to the House of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Goodwin Liu Nomination\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof Professor Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Very simply, America deserves and needs the best of our legal \nprofession on the bench, the best Americans on the bench. Goodwin Liu \nis an extraordinary American and an exceptional lawyer, and he will \nserve with distinction on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals if he is \nconfirmed by the Senate, as I urge he should be.\n  He is qualified by reason not only of his remarkable intellect but \nalso his professional experience, his life experiences, which are \nimportant to anyone who serves on the Federal bench. As demonstrating \nhis intellect, he graduated with honors from Stanford University in \n1991. He was a Rhodes scholar, graduating with honors also from Oxford. \nHe then went to the Yale Law School, where he was editor of the Yale \nLaw Journal, and clerked for two distinguished Federal judges, \nincluding Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  He has been a professor and a dean at the University of California-\nBerkeley School of Law. He has worked in private practice, including \nserving as a special assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Education. \nBut his life has been about public service. Indeed, he served for 2 \nyears at the Corporation for National Service, helping to begin the \nAmeriCorps National Service Program.\n  He has dedicated immense amounts of time to representing and serving \nthe disadvantaged, including minority and low-income children in public \nschools, and he has received numerous awards, not only for his academic \nperformance but also for that public service.\n  He brings to the bench potentially also life experience and diversity \nas an Asian American. There is no Asian-American member at present on \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There should be and Professor Liu \nought to be that judge.\n  He has been endorsed by jurists across the political spectrum. Ken \nStarr, the former Watergate prosecutor, said about him that he has \n``obvious intellect and legal talent.''\n  Ken Starr also highlighted Professor Liu's ``independence and \nopenness to diverse viewpoints, as well as his ability to follow the \nfacts and the law to their logical conclusion, whatever its political \nbalance may be.''\n  That is a quality that is priceless in a jurist. It is to be valued \non the Federal bench, it is to be sought, and it is the reason he has \nbeen endorsed, as well, by Clint Bolick, Bob Barr, Tom Campbell, John \nHu, Richard Painter--the list could go on. But that list is simply \nreflective of that quality of the open-mindedness and willingness to \nlisten that the Federal bench, and any bench, needs today.\n  He is supported by business leaders and law enforcement officials, \nincluding a bipartisan group of 27 former judges and prosecutors and \nthe California Correctional Peace Officers Association. Again, \nendorsements reflect quality.\n  I want to finish by talking about a couple of qualities that I think \nare particularly important. One of them is the willingness to admit \nerror and recognize the need for acknowledging error,\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nas Professor Liu did in the hearing I attended. By the way, he has had \nnumerous hearings--an extensive review by this body. In that hearing \nmost recently, he acknowledged statements that perhaps should have been \nsaid differently, could have been said better. We all, from time to \ntime, commit those kinds of errors, but rarely do people have the \ncourage to acknowledge them. Professor Liu is the kind of human being \nwho searches for the best in himself, as well as in others. He has a \nquality of integrity I think is perhaps most important in a Federal \njudge, or any jurist, and I hope across the political spectrum in this \nbody there will be support for Professor Liu when his nomination comes \nto a vote within the next couple of days.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Offshore \nProduction and Safety Act, a measure to increase domestic production of \noil and natural gas in this country.\n  There are any number of things that make the United States the great \nNation it is. Three of these things relate directly to the debate on \nthe legislation that we will vote on this afternoon. They include our \nbountiful natural resources, the freedoms established by our Founding \nFathers, and the determination of the American people.\n  The measure offered by the majority yesterday would have worked to \nstifle these very characteristics by discouraging economic activity, \ntaxing industriousness, and putting more of our resources off-limits \nfor development. From the oil wealth of the gulf coast, to the coal \nreserves of Appalachia, from the hydroelectric power that characterizes \nmuch of the American West, to the oilfields of Alaska, America is \nblessed with an almost boundless supply of energy wealth. From the time \nof this Nation's founding, Americans have sought to explore and develop \nthis bounty. I am pleased to note that in recent decades we have become \nmore responsible stewards of this endowment.\n  Last night, I held a telephone townhall meeting with many of my \nconstituents, and the issues of gasoline prices and energy independence \nwere raised repeatedly. It is certainly not surprising in light of the \nhigh gasoline prices we are facing today. As I told Mississippians \nagain last night during this townhall meeting that I favor an all-of-\nthe-above approach to addressing America's energy needs. I have \nsupported, and continue to support, innovation in the area of biofuels, \ngeothermal power, wind, and solar energy.\n  At the same time, however, we need to address current needs with \ncurrently available domestic energy resources, such as oil and natural \ngas. The measure we debate today, the Offshore Production and Safety \nAct, is a balanced one that offers a timely way forward by presenting a \npath toward lower fuel prices, job creation, and energy independence.\n  This legislation is responsive to the needs of the American people, \nnot at some uncertain date in the future but now, making use of the \nresources and technology available today.\n  The specifics of the legislation before us are straightforward and \ncommonsense. This bill would require proposed lease sales in the Gulf \nof Mexico, in the Mid-Atlantic, and those off of Alaska to be \ncompleted. It would cut bureaucratic redtape while speeding up the \napproval of drilling permits. Energy activities suspended during the \nadministration's moratorium on offshore drilling would be extended by 1 \nyear. Safety considerations are also taken into account under this \nbill, taking lessons that we learned from last year's Deepwater Horizon \ntragedy, to make deepwater drilling safer than before.\n  Energy independence--a goal we all share--can only be achieved \nthrough conservation, innovation, and domestic exploration, but \ndomestic exploration must be a part of this in order for us to obtain \nindependence.\n  According to a 2009 report by the CRS, America's combined recoverable \nnatural gas, oil, and coal endowment is the largest on Earth. It is far \nlarger than the reserves of Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada. We have \nthe resources to meet our energy needs. I point out again that this is \nthe independent Congressional Research Service that tells us this.\n  Closely related to this issue is the one of job creation in America--\none that we should all be interested in with the unemployment rate \ncurrently at 9 percent. America's oil and natural gas industry is \nresponsible for 9.2 million jobs in this country. I know the people who \nhave those jobs are proud to have them. I know the families who are \nsupported by those jobs are proud of their family members who work in \nthis industry. Wouldn't it be great if we can expand that 9.2 million \nto a higher figure?\n  There was much discussion yesterday about taxation and budget \nconsiderations. Oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico \nraised over $67 million in revenues for the Federal and State \ngovernments in fiscal years 2008 through 2010. That is according to the \nDepartment of the Interior. Millions more went to land and water \nconservation. But because of the administration's moratorium, energy \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to decrease by 13 percent \nthis year, as estimated by the Energy Information Administration. \nAgain, that is an official organ of this government. Overall, U.S. \nproduction is projected to drop by 110,000 barrels per day this year. \nThis is not progress.\n  The fact is, the United States is dangerously dependent on foreign \nsources for our energy needs. We import 60 percent of our petroleum \nneeds in the United States. This is hardly a revelation. Yet the \nproposed bill offered by my friends in the majority would have led to \nincreased dependence on the importation of energy from foreign \ncountries, many of which are not supportive of American interests, to \nput it mildly.\n  Furthermore, the suggestion that the appropriate response to soaring \nprices of gasoline is greater taxation on the companies that produce \ngasoline simply runs counter to common sense. In the larger picture, \nthe administration's energy policy is not comprehensive in nature \nbecause it fails to promote the utilization of proven domestic \nresources, and the traditional domestic production it allows comes \nwrapped in bureaucratic redtape. If our goal is to increase our energy \nindependence in the near term, the White House seems to want to lead us \nin the opposite direction. We do not encourage the increased production \nof any good by raising taxes and imposing more regulations on it.\n  The McConnell alternative, which we will vote on this afternoon, \ntakes a different strategy--one that would increase access to domestic \noil and natural gas. It is a strategy that would create jobs and spur \neconomic growth, while increasing government revenues and improving \nindustry safety.\n  Oil and natural gas reserves are abundant and accessible in the \nUnited States today. Tapping these domestic resources is integral to \nlowering energy prices and making us more energy independent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Offshore Production and Safety \nAct as a logical, prudent step in the right direction for U.S. energy \npolicy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate debated a bill to \nincrease taxes on the production of oil and gas in the United States, \nas well as the tens of thousands of Americans that industry employs and \nreally the millions of Americans it serves. We should have been \ndebating a budget. In fact, the Senate has not passed a budget for 749 \ndays.\n  The majority decided to bring their bill to the floor yesterday in an \neffort, I think, to change some of the conversation from the problem at \nhand, which is our spending problem in Washington. Today we borrow 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend. Spending on domestic government \nagencies domestic\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nnondefense government agencies in the past 2 years increased 24 \npercent. That does not count the $700 billion, almost $800 billion \nstimulus package. It was much more than that added to it. The Medicare \ntrust fund will go bankrupt in 2024. The Social Security trust fund \nwill be insolvent in 2036. In the past decade, our Nation's debt has \nincreased from $5 trillion to $14 trillion.\n  Despite the gravity of our situation, the majority has chosen to \ndebate a bill to increase taxes on oil and gas, an industry that \nemploys 170,000 Americans and a number in my State and added this past \nyear 11,000 new jobs. Mr. President, $1.9 trillion in taxes has been \ngenerated by the industry since 1981. The Reid-Menendez bill would not \nhave decreased prices at the pump but would have shipped more jobs \noverseas and resulted in the importation of more oil and gas. Whenever \nyou tax something, you get less of it. Whenever you tax a refining \nprocess, you drive up the cost. It is just that simple.\n  We are all aware that gas prices have doubled in the President's \nfirst 2 years in office. Raising taxes on energy companies operating in \nAmerica would do nothing to help that situation. The real solution is \nfor America to enact legislation that increases domestic American \nenergy production from a variety of sources--oil, natural gas, \nnuclear--we need to do more on nuclear--hydroelectric, biofuels, coal \nand other sources of reliable energy that Americans can put to good \nuse--our energy.\n  Conservation is a very important factor and should play a very \nimportant role. America needs an energy policy that strengthens our \nnational security, fosters economic growth, and protects the \nenvironment in a reasonable and cost-effective manner. Americans need \naffordable domestic energy. Regrettably, the Senate majority plan does \nnot seem to be interested in that kind of energy policy.\n  In April of this year--just last month, the United States imported \n344 million barrels of oil from foreign sources. That is over 60 \npercent of the oil consumed in America. That means we sent $42.5 \nbillion overseas in April alone to purchase the oil we import.\n  Stated differently, last month alone the United States spent over \n$980,000 per minute on oil from foreign sources. That is almost $1 \nmillion a minute. This presents a significant risk to our national \nsecurity, as so many have told us, as many of these dollars are going \nto nations that are not friendly to us.\n  This also further exacerbates our Nation's trade balance. We import \nfar more than we export, and our exports now are beginning to rise a \nlittle bit, but those gains are being more than offset by the \nimportation of oil and the price of oil.\n  The Reid-Menendez bill would have increased the price of energy in \nAmerica, which, I have to say, seems to be the objective of the \nadministration and some in this Senate. In September of 2008, Steven \nChu told the Wall Street Journal in an interview:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  Dr. Chu is now the Secretary of Energy for the United States of \nAmerica. He needs to be thinking about how to get the costs down and \nserve the constituency of America. I do not know what idea he has that \nwe ought to be raising the cost of energy to the level in Europe.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, in fact, is enacting new \nregulations that will also drive up the cost of energy in a way that \nshould never have happened, in my view. We have had some close votes on \nthat issue. Hopefully, we will soon be able to pull back that effort. A \nstudy by the Affordable Power Alliance concluded that EPA's greenhouse \ngas regulations could increase the cost of gasoline by 50 percent, \nelectricity by 50 percent, and natural gas by 75 percent over the next \n20 years. That is a stunning figure. There is no doubt it will drive it \nup. The majority has yet to recognize the negative impact these tax \nincreases and new EPA regulations will have on the economy.\n\n  With gas prices up to $4 a gallon, from $2.75 in September--$4 from \n$2.75--this translates into a 5-percent cut in the average American's \ndiscretionary income just for the same amount of gas they are buying. \nThis means less spending on home improvements, furniture, clothes, \nvacations--things people and families need. All that is eaten up by \nincreased energy costs. In a way, it is a form of a stealth tax on the \nAmerican people.\n  Furthermore, increasing energy taxes will make doing business in the \nUnited States more expensive. As a result, jobs will go overseas.\n  The rise in gas prices over the past two years has meant that a \nfamily paying $100 a month for gasoline will now pay over $140 a month \nfor gasoline. If someone is paying $200 a month--and many are--they \nwould pay $280 a month just because of a change in the gasoline price. \nAdd it up. That is what it amounts to--$80 for a family who uses $200 a \nmonth in gasoline.\n  Some argue raising taxes will help reduce our deficit, but the tax \nincreases in the Reid-Menendez bill would have raised approximately \n$1.2 billion in 2012. With a projected deficit of over $1.6 trillion \nthis year, the revenue produced from these taxes would be a drop in the \nbucket. Don't think it is going to balance our budget, that is for \nsure.\n  Furthermore, the bill's sponsors claim the money would be used to \nreduce the deficit, but there is nothing in the bill that does that. \nAlthough the language sounds good, the language is essentially what we \ncall a sense of the Senate and has no binding power. In the end, \nnothing in the bill could have been construed as mandating deficit \nreduction. It is simply a tax increase, plain and simple--tax and \nspend.\n  As the majority tried yesterday to increase taxes on the energy \nindustry, they ignored the convoluted tax system that is increasing and \ninhibiting job growth in America. The United States has the second \nhighest corporate tax rate in the world--39.5 percent. All the \ndeveloped nations have been reducing their taxes. Only Japan has as \nhigh a corporate tax rate as we do, and they are reducing theirs. The \nCanadian Finance Minister, whom I had the chance to meet with last \nweek, says Canada is bringing its tax rate down to below 15 percent. \nAnd we are taxing at 39.5 percent? Will that not cause a business to \ndecide maybe to build their factory in Canada rather than in the United \nStates and cost us much needed time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I believe the McConnell legislation, which has three \ncomponents--one aimed at restoring American offshore production in the \nwake of the moratorium that has been imposed, a safety component aimed \nat preventing future incidents like the Deepwater Horizon, and an \nefficiency component aimed at streamlining the issuing of permits--is \nthe right way to go. More production of American energy will help our \ncountry, our economy, and our people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nthe Republican bill to expand coastal drilling without environmental \nreview, without the normal planning process, and without important \nsafety measures. But before I do, I just have to respond to the remarks \nof my distinguished colleague from Alabama about our bill debated on \nthe floor yesterday.\n  Only in Washington--only in Washington--could taking $21 billion from \nthe oil companies' tax breaks, which the legislation clearly stated \nwould go to deficit reduction, at a time that oil companies are making \nanywhere between $125 billion and $144 billion in profits--not revenue \nbut profits--would that be not reducing the deficit. Only in Washington \ncould you say taking $21 billion from the oil industry and the tax \nbreaks they get, with record profits--and the law said very clearly \nthat was going directly to deficit reduction--only that could be viewed \na different way. And to suggest the oil companies cannot do without \nthat $21 billion of the taxpayers' money when they are making $125 \nbillion to $144 billion in profits is pretty outrageous.\n  But I know what today's legislation is about. Yesterday, the \nRepublicans were standing up for Big Oil and today they are standing up \nfor Big Oil again because this is not about reducing gas prices.\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\n  Haven't we learned anything from the tragic death of 11 men aboard \nthe Deepwater Horizon rig a little over a year ago? Haven't we learned \nanything about the families who lost livelihoods and the gulf economy \nthat will take decades to finally rebuild? Just over a year ago, I came \nto the floor to speak about this human and environmental catastrophe, a \nspill that many in this Chamber said was inconceivable--well, \ninconceivable despite the fact that a remarkably similar spill had \nhappened a year before off of Australia's coast. Two hundred thirty \nmiles of coastline in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida was \nspoiled by toxic oil, and countless families who made their living on \nthe coast had their lives turned upside down. This chart reflects the \noilspill in Australia, but this is similar to what happened in the \ngulf.\n  Despite that sobering reality, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have introduced a bill that would open new areas to coastal \ndrilling and put millions more families at risk of losing everything. \nAnd at the same time they are calling on coastal communities, such as \nmy home State of New Jersey, to risk everything, they have blocked \nefforts to address the fundamental safety concerns raised by the \nDeepwater Horizon blowout and the results of what the commission said. \nThis reckless bill would allow drilling in sensitive coastal areas even \nthough current safety and oversight laws have been deemed to be \ninadequate to prevent a repeat of the gulf disaster.\n  So I ask, have we learned nothing? My home State of New Jersey would \nface a risk of drilling along Virginia's coast, less than 100 miles \nfrom the Jersey shore. If the gulf spill happened in Virginia waters, \nmany New Jersey families and much of our coastal economy would be \nruined. We have magnificent pristine beaches. The dunes along the coast \nare breathtaking, wildlife is abundant, and tourism depends on it. It \nwould all be in jeopardy. This is the second major driver in billions \nof dollars for our economy. And for what?\n  This photo shows what happens to wildlife when coastal drilling goes \nwrong. It shows a risk we cannot take. A spill similar to the one in \nthe gulf could quickly travel to Cape May and blanket the entire Jersey \nshore in a sheen of toxic oil. This would not only be an environmental \ndisaster but also an economic disaster for New Jersey. If our coast was \ncovered in oil and our wildlife disappeared, tourists wading into the \nocean would be replaced by cleanup crews in biohazard suits. That is \nnot what I want for the people of the coastal communities of my State \nor any other State.\n  With approximately 60 percent of New Jersey's $38 billion tourism \nindustry generated by the Jersey shore, we cannot afford to let this \nhappen. And when we add the effect a spill would have on my State's \nmultibillion-dollar fishing industry, the economic consequences are \nunimaginable. It simply does not make sense to play Russian roulette \nwith an asset that generates thousands of jobs and tens of billions of \ndollars per year for drilling assets that could never generate even \none-tenth of that.\n  My colleagues argue that we must risk our coastal economies in order \nto bring down the price of gas; that what we need is more production \ndomestically. But here is the problem. As this chart shows, we now have \ngreater production than at any time since 2005. Yet what do we see? Gas \nprices haven't gone down. So how does that theory play out? We have \ngreater production domestically than ever before, but gas prices \nhaven't gone down.\n  What does the Department of Energy tell us? It estimates that opening \nall the shores--all shores--to drilling would reduce gas prices by--how \nmuch, Mr. President?--one, two, three cents in the year 2030. That is \nfrom the Department of Energy of the United States. Drill everywhere \nand a 3-cent reduction in 2030. I don't think that is about providing \nrelief right now. Three cents per gallon in 20 years, and yet we would \nrisk tens of billions of dollars in damage to our coastal economies?\n\n  So instead of doubling down on 19th-century fuels, we should be \ninvesting in a new 21st-century green economy that will create \nthousands of new jobs, billions in new wealth, and will help protect \nour air and water from pollution. It is time for this country to move \nforward and embrace the future rather than clutch at the ways of the \npast.\n  Over the last 2 days, we had two bills presenting clear choices--my \nbill to cut oil tax breaks and this bill to recklessly expand oil \ndrilling. Neither bill will do anything to gasoline prices. And despite \nrhetoric on the other side of the aisle, neither bill is about gasoline \nprices.\n  I said it very clearly. My bill to cut oil subsidies was about \nlowering the deficit and doing so by cutting wasteful subsidies. It is \nhard enough to be paying nearly $4 a gallon for gas, but then to have \nthe taxpayers reach into their pockets and give more money to Big Oil \nto have them make bigger profits is pretty outrageous. The Republican \nleader's bill is about enriching oil companies by granting them new \nareas to drill without normal safety or environmental review. My bill \nwas designed to help taxpayers, and their bill is designed to help oil \ncompanies.\n  When it is all said and done, this is what we are deciding today: Are \nyou with the working, middle-class Americans or are you with Big Oil? I \nthink there is only one fair answer, only one answer that makes sense \nfor American families, and only one answer for ourselves as a country \nlooking to future generations.\n  If we learned nothing from the tragedy of a year ago, then that is a \nsad commentary. But if we have learned, yes, we can pursue drilling in \ncertain areas, but it must be done safely or else we spend billions \nafterward cleaning up the mess. I don't want to clean up the oil \ncompanies' messes. I don't want to put future generations of Americans \nat risk in terms of the conservation of their environment. And I \ncertainly do not want to wait for 2030, to take all of that risk, to \nrisk all of the billions of dollars in our coastal economies for three \ncents.\n  Mr. President, let's vote no on this suggestion, and let's move \nforward to a green energy future that finally breaks our addiction to \nforeign oil and breaks our addiction to those gas prices we suffer with \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I hear talk about gas prices and the \neconomy, the effect on the economy and our future. We need to work hard \nto be sure we are producing more American jobs. Frankly, I can't think \nof a better way to do that than to produce more American energy. We use \nabout the same amount of energy in a good economy as we do in a weak \neconomy. It is the place to go where we know the consumers are, whether \nit is the electric bill or the gasoline at the gas pump, and we ought \nto be doing all we can to produce those jobs.\n  Certainly there are many factors that affect the price of oil, things \nsuch as the value of the dollar, supply and demand, and the global \nevents that affect oil, such as the problems now in Libya and other \noil-producing countries, or even the weather. I live in a State bounded \nby the Mississippi River, and the flooding down the Mississippi has had \nsome impact on the north-south movement of refined products in the \ncountry. All those things have impact on gas prices.\n  One thing that will come up this summer and that I have worked hard \non and on which many of my colleagues have joined me is looking into \nwhat we can do to be sure our efforts to have clean air don't \nneedlessly restrict the supply of gasoline. As we get into the summer \nmonths, too many cities have their own unique blends of fuel. That \nmeans we turn the refineries into profit centers making these unique \nblends of fuel instead of places that process oil into gasoline and \ndifferent blends of gasoline only when necessary as opposed to whenever \nsomeone has convinced a city that a unique blend of fuel is the only \none they can possibly use.\n  In my State of Missouri we have one blend of fuel in the summer in \nSt. Louis, another blend of fuel across the State in Kansas City, and a \nthird blend of fuel in between. All those have to be blended \nseparately, trucked separately, sold, obviously, separately. The Gas \nAct, which I hope we can talk about more in the next few weeks, is one \nof the ways we can bring as much common sense into the system as we \ncan. Let's take the supply that we have available and use it in the way \nthat makes the most sense.\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\n  In fact, right before Katrina in 2009, the President was given new \nauthority in cases of natural disaster to suspend these fuel blends if \nthere is a restriction of supply, and the President did that. I don't \nthink he had the authority a month before Katrina hit. The President \ndid that, and in the 6 months that authority was used, gas prices did \nnot go up in any significant way at all, as I recall, because for that \n6-month period of time gasoline became a commodity again.\n  If one could get gasoline, one could sell gasoline. If somebody had \ngasoline, one could buy gasoline. It did not matter whether it was the \nunique blend that one had become convinced that in their community that \nwas the only one right for them, and we set some standards on those \nblends at the time, in the Gas Act, with 38 of my colleagues who \ncosponsored it. We will set more standards. That is one way to try to \nuse the supply we have in a way that makes the most sense.\n  Another way, clearly, is to go out and find more. Our approach to \nenergy needs to be threefold: to use energy more efficiently so we use \nless, to find more, and to invest in the future to find out what those \nthings are that we need to be looking at as we transition the system.\n  I am not at all of the opinion we will not have a system, a fleet of \ncars that is powered in different ways at some date in the foreseeable \nfuture. But the foreseeable future would be 25, 30, 40 years. I am \nequally convinced that no matter what direction we go for fueling \nautomobiles, 25 years from now the majority of cars on the highway are \nstill going to be using gasoline. That means we need to find more of it \nhere. That is what the Offshore Producing and Safety Act that Senator \nMcConnell introduced does and what I am cosponsoring along with my \ncolleagues.\n  This bill tries to restore our offshore exploration of energy. Thirty \npercent of our domestic energy supply has come from the gulf in recent \nyears. We want to be sure that number continues to remain at that \nlevel.\n  Since April of 2010, the administration has only approved 53 shallow-\nwater and 14 deepwater permits--most of those underway before the \nDeepwater Horizon spill a year ago. In fact, the moratorium has, for \nall practical purposes, become what some people are describing as a \npermatorium. We permanently decided we were not going to look at the \ngulf for the kind of oil that it can, should, and needs to produce. In \nfact, offshore energy production is projected to fall by 210,000 \nbarrels per day this year. That means in the gulf we would be getting \n210,000 fewer barrels of oil every day this year than we got last year.\n  Surely, that is no solution, to become more dependent on other \ncountries that are recipients of the jobs that follow our energy \nfuture. We need those jobs to be here. The estimate is, we would be \ndown 190,000 barrels per day in 2012 because we have not been pursuing \nthe drilling permits.\n  It is possible that 2011 could be the first year since 1958 that the \nFederal Government will not hold an offshore lease sale--the first time \nsince 1958. Does that mean we are less dependent on oil and gasoline \nthan we were in 1958 or 1959 or 1969? No, it does not mean that. We are \nmore dependent, and we need to move forward with looking at the \nresources we have.\n  Recently--recently meaning Saturday, in his Saturday speech--the \nPresident appears to have reversed course on this issue and has called \nfor Alaska and Gulf of Mexico leases to be reinstated and for an \nextension of leases impacted by the moratorium. I think this bill \nactually helps what the President called for on Saturday. It would be \nlightening speed for the Senate to pass a bill on Wednesday or Thursday \nthat the President asked for on Saturday. I think this is very much in \nline with what I would admit is a new position for the President to \ntake, but it is one he seemed to take firmly on Saturday. This \nlegislation would help him.\n  The number of lease sales is undetermined by the President's address, \nbut we could help by pursuing leasing and permitting with this act. \nThis act directs the Interior Department to conduct the offshore lease \nsales that the administration canceled in December of 2010. These were \nlease sales that were underway, the process was well along, and the \nadministration canceled those lease sales in December of last year.\n  These were lease sales in the western and central gulf and on the \nVirginia Outer Continental Shelf and the Alaska Outer Continental \nShelf. Let's go back to that point: Let those lease sales move forward \nas they were doing before they were canceled. The President just said \nSaturday: Let's do this. Let's do it, and let's give him the tools and \nencouragement he needs to do it right now.\n  This would end the permanent moratorium that occurred last year in \nthe gulf. It includes a 30-day time limit for the Interior Department \nto review and decide on drilling permits. If rejected, the Interior \nDepartment has to disclose why it rejected the permits. There should \nnot be anything wrong with that. If a permit should be rejected, \neverybody ought to be told why, and it ought to be part of the record. \nIt also provides for default approval if the Interior Department does \nnot make a decision within 60 days.\n  Finally, it improves safety procedures by adding additional \nrequirements for a spill response plan and a containment response plan \nto see that was done.\n  This would mean we would have more American energy, and more American \nenergy has two impacts. No. 1, it would inject more supply in the \nmarketplace, putting price pressure on the worldwide marketplace. If we \nfully pursue our own resources, that does have an impact on the short-\nterm response of the industry because they know America is going after \nits resources.\n  I urge we approve this bill. I intend to vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me say I will be supporting the \nbill that we have before us today. It did not go far enough, though. \nWhat we ought to do is open everything. I am talking about the Pacific, \nthe Atlantic, the gulf, the North Slope, the public lands. That is what \nwe really need to be doing.\n  I know there are some reasons they are confining it to the gulf in \nterms of this legislation. While I respect that, again it does not go \nfar enough.\n  Let me make one comment about yesterday's vote. Right now the single \nissue people have in terms of energy is the price of gas at the pump. I \nknow it is not just my wife, they are all that way. I can see that. But \nwhen the Democrats came up with their bill last night, I hope people \nremember who was voting for this. That was for a major tax increase on \nwhat they call Big Oil.\n  Big oil is the five biggest oil companies. I hate to say this, but \nsometimes you walk on the floor with half truths and get by with it, \nand people will assume that is true. As much as I love my fellows on \nthe other side, some of the things that were stated were actually just \ntotally inaccurate.\n  To say the big five don't pay taxes--they pay huge taxes. I don't \nknow where they come up with some of these numbers. I am going to \nsingle out one company, ExxonMobil, and tell my colleagues something \nthey are not aware of because it has not been said on the Senate floor \nyet.\n  In 2010, ExxonMobil's total tax expenses in the United States were \n$9.8 billion. That is what they paid in taxes in 2010. That includes \nincome tax expense of more than $1.9 billion. That $9.8 billion in \ntaxes exceeded the 2010 U.S. operating earnings of $7.5 billion.\n  What we are saying is, they paid $9.8 billion in taxes. They only \nreceived $7.5 billion in terms of earnings from the United States. Why \nis that? It is because about 80 percent of their operations are in \nother countries. They are in 100 different countries. Not one of the \nother countries charges taxes when they go offshore. I believe we are \nthe only country that charges a U.S. tax on production that takes place \nin some other country.\n  For that reason, if we tax them like most people do it would have \nbeen a tax credit and not a tax at all. Nonetheless, they were \naccountable for paying taxes that year of $9.8 billion. Look at this \nyear. That was 2010. During the first quarter of this year, our U.S. \noperating earnings of this particular company were $2.8 billion--that \nis the first quarter of 2011. The rest of their earnings, more than $8 \nbillion, came\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nfrom operations in more than 100 countries worldwide.\n  Here is a number we will not hear in Washington. During the first \nquarter on those earnings, U.S. earnings of $2.6 billion, they incurred \na tax expense and paid a tax of $3.1 billion. They are paying more than \nthey are getting out of this country. I think sooner or later we have \nto come up and just tell the truth of what is happening. It is all \nclass warfare. I think we know that: Big, bad oil. They are all bad.\n  We have a lot of production in my State of Oklahoma. We have \ncompanies such as Devon and Anadarko and others that are doing a lot to \nrelieve this problem. I know what is going to happen. It did not pass, \nobviously, and is not going to pass, but if it had the next target \nwould be some of the smaller domestic companies.\n  I remember coming down to the floor last year when the good Senator \nfrom Vermont had a bill and was bringing it up by unanimous consent, \nand I just happened to get here in time to stop it and debate it and \ndefeat it. In that bill they even held up a picture of a check from \nExxonMobil as to what their tax liabilities were--totally wrong, in my \nopinion, and apparently in the opinion of 61 of the 100 Senators \nbecause they joined me in opposing that particular legislation.\n  We have a solution to the problem. This is not rocket science. Right \nnow we have the data. It just happened in the last 8 months that the \nCongressional Research Service--nobody has stood on the Senate floor \nand questioned the fact that they are nonpartisan; they are objective. \nThey looked at our recoverable reserves in coal, oil, and gas and found \nthey are greater in America than any other country in the world. We \nhave those recoverable reserves.\n  The problem is, we have a political problem where the liberals here, \nalong with liberals in the White House, including the President, will \nnot exploit our own resources. We have all the oil and gas and coal \nthat is out there. We could be totally independent of the Middle East \nin a very short period of time if we would just go offshore on all \nthree coasts, along with the North Slope, ANWR, and with our public \nlands. As I say, every other country does it.\n\n  So we have to wonder: Why don't we do it? Why is it we don't care \nabout supplying ourselves with homegrown oil, gas and coal and taking \ncare of our own energy needs? We have the ability, but the politicians \nwill not let us do it.\n  There is one reason. That is--and this is disturbing--that in the \ncase of this administration, they don't want to do it. This \nadministration has said many times they are not interested. Listen to \nwhat Alan Krueger, Assistant Secretary of Treasury, said:\n\n       The tax subsidies that are currently provided to the oil \n     and gas industry lead to inefficiency by encouraging an over \n     investment of domestic resources in industry.\n\n  Secondly, he says:\n\n       The administration believes that it is no longer sufficient \n     to address our nation's energy needs by finding more fossil \n     fuels. . . .\n\n  Look, I am all for coal, gas, oil. I am for nuclear. I am for all of \nthe above. I am for all of the renewables: Sun, wind, and everything \nelse. But we have to run this machine today, tomorrow, and the next 5 \nand 10 years. We can't do that without fossil fuels.\n  Further, they stated:\n\n       The administration's goal is to have resources invested in \n     ways which yield the highest social return.\n\n  Social return, that is a totally different thing--not an economic \nreturn, not the ability to run our country ourselves but some kind of a \nsocial engineering that is going on.\n  The best quote and the most telling is the one that came from \nSecretary Chu, the Energy Secretary for President Obama. Listen to \nthis:\n\n       We are going to have to get some sort of regulatory thing \n     going on that [hydraulic fracturing].\n\n  He said:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  This is our administration saying this. This is the Secretary of \nEnergy:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  They are intentionally raising the price of gas and it is by their \nown admission.\n  We were warned way back during the campaign when President Barack \nObama was a Senator. He said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  So we have an effort by them. I would just warn my good friends on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle to watch this pretty closely because \njust because the President wants to increase the price of oil doesn't \nmean that your constituents do. In fact, I can assure you your \nconstituents do not, unless there is something unusual about my State \nof Oklahoma.\n  Let's see what the CRS report said a little bit more specifically. \nThey said, in the updated report, America's combined recoverable oil, \nnatural gas, and coal endowment is the largest on Earth. America's \nrecoverable resources are far larger than those of Saudi Arabia, China, \nand Canada combined. That is the resources we have in oil, coal, and \ngas.\n  America is the world's third largest oil producer and is endowed with \n163 billion barrels of recoverable oil which will run the United States \nof America for 50 years. We can run it. All the oil we will need for 50 \nyears, we have it. We just have to get the politicians out of the way \nso we can produce it.\n  Natural gas, in terms of trillions of cubic feet, America's future \nsupply of natural gas is over 2,000 trillion cubic feet, an increase of \nmore than 25 percent just since the committee's 2006 estimate. At \ntoday's rate of use, this is enough natural gas to meet America's \ndemand for 90 years.\n  Keep in mind natural gas is not just natural gas to develop energy, \nbut also natural gas is something we are going to be using in our cars \ntoday. It is available. They are working on technology. We are working \non the certification of engines that will burn natural gas. When we \nare, it is going to relieve that tension also. Right now, the price of \na comparable gallon of natural gas to run an automobile is $1.60 \ngallon--$1.60 as opposed to $4, so it is out there.\n  I have to say this. The President made a speech, and I responded on a \ncouple of TV stations. This was probably 3 weeks ago. It was on energy. \nHe said in that speech: We have an abundant supply of good, clean \nnatural gas. We need to be using it. Then, at the end of that speech, \nhe said: However, we have to be very careful what we are going to be \ndoing because we don't want to contaminate our drinking water with \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  I happen to come from Oklahoma. The first hydraulic fracturing job in \nOklahoma was done in 1948. We have not had one documented case of \ngroundwater contamination ever since 1948, 60 years. Yet, right now, \nthey are going to stop us from going after natural gas by taking away \nhydraulic fracturing. In these tight formations, the shale formations, \nyou can't develop a cubic foot of natural gas without using hydraulic \nfracturing. It is a way of inserting liquids in to force the gas out so \nwe can develop it. So it is there. So the President is saying we need \nto use natural gas, but we don't want to use hydraulic fracturing.\n  There is an effort right now by many Members to try to take that over \nas a Federal function, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Right \nnow, there has never been a problem with it. It is regulated \ndifferently in different States. For example, in my State of Oklahoma, \nin the Anadarko Basin, we are talking about depths of some 35,000 feet. \nIf you go just north in Kansas, it is between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. So \nit is different in different States. It needs different regulation. It \nis not broken and we don't need to fix it.\n  What has the President done? He has put Secretary Chu in charge of \ndetermining what we are going to do with hydraulic fracturing. \nSecretary Chu is the same guy who said we have to raise the price of \nour gasoline to be comparable to the gasoline price in Europe. So that \nis the wrong guy for that kind of a study.\n  Besides that, I would remind my colleagues we actually have a study \nthat is going on right now by the Environmental Protection Agency on \nhydraulic fracturing that isn't through yet. It would seem to me we \nought to at least finish and get this study before we rush in and try \nto pass something that will stop us from being able to develop our \nnatural gas.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  I can say the same thing for coal. America is No. 1 in coal reserves. \nRight now--people aren't aware of it--we are reliant upon coal for 50 \npercent of the power it takes to run this machine called America. \nAmerica is No. 1 in coal resources, accounting for more than 28 percent \nof the world's coal.\n  So we have it here. We have gas. We have coal. We have oil. All we \nhave to do is develop them.\n  How many people in America who have gone through elementary school \ndon't remember supply and demand? We have a huge supply and there is a \ngreat demand for it, but we have our politicians who will not let us \ndevelop our supply. As long as that holds, it is going to be very \ndifficult for us to do it.\n  So I would just say this. This is a wakeup call for the American \npeople. We have a vote this afternoon. It is not good enough. I am \ngoing to vote for it. But we ought to be opening our exploration and \nproduction all over America. To do that, we have to go beyond this \nbill. This is a start and it is a start that is worthwhile.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our \nNation's energy policy, or, frankly, our lack thereof.\n  Georgians, as well as folks all across America, are shocked every \ntime they pull up to a gas pump, both at the price of gas per gallon \nand at the jaw-dropping cost each time they fill up their tanks.\n  With rising food prices and a stagnant economy, skyrocketing gas \nprices could not come at a worse time. This situation illustrates why \nit is imperative for Congress to focus on creating a policy to expand \nand diversify our energy sources so the American people are no longer \nheld hostage by prices at the pump.\n  The necessity of congressional action has become all too clear as we \nwatch gas prices climb and unrest spread throughout the Middle East, \npotentially threatening major sources of energy we import.\n  It highlights the fact that we cannot afford to keep sending hundreds \nof billions of dollars per year to foreign countries--many of which are \nnot America's friends--to meet our energy needs. It poses a threat to \nour national security and further harms our Nation's struggling \neconomy.\n  This week we are considering two pieces of legislation that both deal \nwith domestic production of oil and gas: the Reid proposal that aimed \nto stifle it, and one introduced by Leader McConnell that increases \noffshore production while improving the safety of offshore drilling \noperations.\n  Unfortunately, the Reid proposal would have increased taxes on \ndomestic production of oil and gas, which would have discouraged \ndomestic drilling and resulted in the loss of many American jobs \nassociated with the oil and gas industry.\n  Without incentives to produce oil and gas in the United States, there \nis real risk that energy companies will take many of their drilling \noperations overseas. This goes directly against goals I know many of my \nDemocratic colleagues share of reducing our dependence on foreign \nsources of oil and encouraging job growth. Moreover, as we watch gas \nprices rise, why would anyone want to impose new taxes on energy which \nwill only further increase prices Americans pay at the pump?\n  My colleagues across the aisle who support this legislation portray \ntheir proposal as a deficit-cutting measure. As much as anyone here, I \nrecognize the importance of reducing our Federal deficit. But I do not \nsupport targeting one industry to bear the brunt of the deficit-cutting \nmeasures while others enjoy tax incentives.\n  Rather than hindering domestic production of oil and gas, we must \nencourage the development of abundant energy resources we have right \nhere inside the United States, and we must do so in an environmentally \nresponsible manner.\n  I was pleased the Reid proposal did not pass yesterday. As a \ncosponsor of Leader McConnell's Offshore Production and Safety Act, I \nwill continue to support domestic oil and gas exploration and \nproduction. It is an essential component of a comprehensive energy \npolicy that will enable America to become more energy independent.\n  As I hear more reports of new oil and natural gas deposits found \nwithin our borders and off America's shores, I am stunned we are not \ndoing more to encourage the development of these resources. I cannot \nthink of a better means of improving our economy by both reducing \nAmerica's energy imports and encouraging job growth.\n  After the oilspill last year, the Obama administration reviewed its \ndrilling and permitting process for domestic oil and gas production, \nand is still in the process of revising it. While changes clearly \nneeded to be made, the Department of the Interior continues to hold up \nand unnecessarily delay approval of drilling leases and permits. Now is \nnot the time to tie up valuable and much-needed American energy \nproduction in bureaucratic redtape. Senator McConnell's bill would \nactually streamline the permitting process while improving safety.\n  A responsible energy policy that will make gas prices reasonable, \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil, and strengthen our economy will \nalso result in increased domestic energy production, improved energy \nefficiency through technology, increased conservation, and a \ndiversified energy supply through the use of renewable fuel sources.\n  Along with supporting America's oil and gas development, we must also \nfocus on other domestic energy sources--including nuclear energy, wind, \nclean coal, and solar power--that will allow us to achieve sustainable \nenergy independence.\n  I am hopeful that in the 112th Congress we will take on some form of \ncomprehensive energy legislation. For the sake of our national security \nand our economy, we need to take this issue on now instead of kicking \nit down the road for others to handle.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the McConnell proposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of S. 953. Today \nI wish again to speak about gas prices in our country and the pressing \nneed to increase domestic supply. In a nutshell, the way you reduce \nprices at the pump for American consumers is by increasing supply, \nparticularly domestic supply. More supply will not only help bring down \nthe price of gasoline at the pump for American consumers, but it will \nalso help create good American jobs for our workers across the country.\n  It is important to remember that government does not create jobs, but \ngovernment can create the environment, the legal, tax, and regulatory \nenvironment that will stimulate private investment, and that private \ninvestment will stimulate the deployment of new technologies, new \ncompanies, and, of course, create jobs to help grow and sustain our \neconomy.\n  I want to start out by giving you some examples close to my home in \nthe great State of North Dakota. In North Dakota, we launched a \ncomprehensive energy plan about 10 years ago. At that time oil \ncompanies had either left the Williston Basin, which is the energy \npatch in our State, or they were leaving. You might ask: Well, why was \nthat? First, it was because they were getting better returns elsewhere. \nThe technology was lacking to produce oil and gas economically from new \nformations in our State. Companies were going to other places in the \nworld where they could extract that oil more cost effectively.\n  Second, the data on confirmed reserves was also lacking, and the \ntechnology to produce oil from shale was not sufficiently developed.\n  Third, our workforce was aging.\n  And, fourth, transportation constraints limited production. In other\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nwords, there were better places for those companies to go, better \nplaces than our State, to invest their dollars, to get a return for \nshareholders.\n  To turn that around, we worked very hard to build a climate for \ninvestment and growth. I wish to tell you about some of what we worked \nto put in place. First, we put tax incentives in place that made it \nworthwhile to invest. Second, we established an oil and gas research \nfund. Third, we initiated studies of the Bakken formation, not only \nthrough the North Dakota Geological Survey, but also through the U.S. \nGeological Survey. We asked for updates to those studies now as well.\n  We improved infrastructure, including four-laning some of our major \nhighways. We established a pipeline authority to expand transportation \ncapacity, to move product out of the Williston Basin to market, and we \nalso established a center of excellence for petroleum safety and \ntechnology at Williston State College, to train workers in oil \nproduction and recovery methods.\n  Up until that time, we had to send our workers to States such as \nColorado or Wyoming or maybe Oklahoma for that education and training \nin oil field technologies, and sometimes they did not always come back \nto our State. So we established that training there at home.\n  As a result of our advanced business environment, we drew investment \ncapital technology and ingenuity to the Williston Basin, and those \nefforts unlocked the potential not only of the Bakken formation but \nalso the Three Forms formation.\n  This year, North Dakota will produce more than 120 million barrels of \noil, the fourth most amongst all 50 States. We passed other States now \nsuch as Oklahoma and Louisiana, and our production continues to grow. \nWhat is more, the private investment that funded and deployed those new \ntechnologies to produce more oil most cost effectively and more \ndependably also funded the development and deployment of new \ntechnologies that helped us produce that oil and gas in more \nenvironmentally sound ways.\n  New technologies such as directional drilling, and the way we do \nhydraulic fracking, enabled companies to recover as much or more oil \nfrom one well bore than they had formerly recovered from up to a dozen \nwell bores. That means more domestic production, less environmental \nimpact, and better results for the American people.\n  Bear in mind that most of these measures I am talking about, most of \nthese measures we implemented to enhance our business climate, were not \nabout government spending. They were about creating an environment that \nattracted private investment.\n  Increased economic growth not only generated revenues for our State \nand broadened our economic base but also actually enabled us to reduce \ntaxes for our citizens. It also has a national impact. Increased North \nDakota oil production is also helping to reduce our dependence on \nforeign imports, and increase the domestic supply of oil in this \ncountry.\n  As I mentioned in my remarks last week, between 1985 and 2005, \ndomestic oil production in this country was going down--it was \nshrinking--and foreign imports were growing. In 2005, we were importing \n12.4 billion barrels of oil a day into this country, 60 percent of what \nwe consumed.\n  By 2010, however, our imports had fallen to 9.4 million barrels a \nday, a reduction of about 3 million barrels a day over 2005. So over \nthe last 5 years, we have actually reduced our daily imports of oil \ninto this country by 3 million barrels a day.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil has been reduced from 60 percent down \nto about 49 percent. So what changed? Well, in part, we are using less. \nBut the fact is, we have increased domestic production. We have \nincreased our domestic supply. Increased supplies from onshore \nproduction in the lower 48 States such as North Dakota, also from \nnatural gas liquids throughout the country, and from offshore drilling, \nhave all raised domestic output by 1.5 million barrels a day in this \ncountry.\n  That is what today's vote on S. 953 is all about. The bill before us, \nwhich was introduced by Senator McConnell--and I am pleased to be one \nof his cosponsors, is about more offshore domestic production, more \noffshore domestic production from off our coasts, and, hence, more \ndomestic supply.\n  Like our approach in North Dakota, onshore production, S. 953, the \nOffshore Production and Safety Act will encourage more domestic \nproduction with better environmental stewardship. It will open areas in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska's Outer Continental Shelf, and parts of \ncoastal Virginia to new exploration and production. At the same time, \nit will help to expedite the approval or denial of growing permits to a \nreasonable period of time--in this case 60 days--thereby allowing \nprojects to move forward in a timely fashion.\n  But it does not just speed up the clock. This bill is also about \nsafety. It requires companies drilling offshore to have safety plans \nthat must be certified by the Secretary of Interior. To further improve \nsafety, it also requires ongoing preview and research into spill \nprevention procedures and methods.\n  This legislation, the Offshore Production and Safety Act, is the kind \nof energy policy that will help to attract investment and increase \nproduction in this country. That means not only more supply to help \nbring down the cost of gasoline at the pump for American families, but \nit also means more jobs for American workers. It is a good piece of \nlegislation and we ought to pass it.\n  Although it is a step in the right direction, no single piece of \nlegislation will do it all. Congress has not passed a comprehensive \nenergy policy in years. But, frankly, we can no longer wait for that \nsingle sweeping master plan that will do it all at once.\n  Again referring to my home State, we built Empower North Dakota over \na decade piece by piece, and saw firsthand the power of energy \ndevelopment in our State. The bill before us today is one piece, a \npiece that can become part of a comprehensive national energy plan.\n  To build a comprehensive plan we need other legislation as well, \nother legislation such as the Boutique Fuel Reduction Act of 2011, \nwhich would simplify our Nation's fuel standards and make more fuel \navailable to American consumers. My esteemed colleague, Senator Roy \nBlunt from Missouri, was on the floor a few minutes ago talking about \nthat piece of legislation, and also legislation such as the Regulatory \nResponsibility for our Economy Act, which would actually work with a \ndirective from President Obama to review and remove outmoded or \nexcessively burdensome rules that may be impeding economic development \nand job growth across our country.\n  We need to work in a bipartisan way, because high gas prices, high \nunemployment, and low economic growth are not a Republican or a \nDemocratic issue, they are an American issue. That is why we also need \nlegislation such as the EPA Fair Play Act, which will prevent the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from rescinding previously approved 404 \npermits. I am pleased to be cosponsoring that legislation with my \ncolleague, Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia. Collectively, all of \nthese pieces of legislation and more are the bricks and mortar out of \nwhich we can build a comprehensive national energy policy. But we need \nto get going, and we need to get going today. Let's get going with S. \n953, and let's build a brighter energy future for ourselves and for \nfuture generations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Goodwin Liu Nomination\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to support Goodwin Liu's \nnomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nYears ago, in the early 1990s when I was working for the national I \nHave a Dream Foundation, I first crossed paths with Goodwin Liu, who \nwas then a senior program officer with the Corporation for National \nService. An issue\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nhad arisen with regard to the corporation's support of one of our \nfoundation's programs. We were running an AmeriCorps program. Mr. Liu \nvery quickly distinguished himself through his competence and obvious \ncommitment to education and national service. In fact, my interactions \nwith him were so positive and memorable that 18 years later, when I had \njoined this body and heard of his nomination, I immediately remembered \nhim and was anxious to find out what he had been up to in the \nintervening years.\n  The opportunity to reconnect with Goodwin Liu as part of his \nconfirmation process has turned out to be one of the real pleasures of \nthis job. It is readily apparent to me, as well as to so many Senators \non both sides of the aisle who have had the opportunity to meet with \nhim, to question him, and get to know him better, that Professor \nGoodwin Liu is a good, decent, bright, and engaging man.\n  His career, in my view, is marked by a profound commitment to \nservice, from his time working at the Corporation for National Service, \nthe organization of our Federal Government that supports VISTA and \nAmeriCorps, and all sorts of different commitments to national service \nacross our country, to his later work as a clinical and summer \nassociate while in law school, to his work for the Department of \nEducation as a young attorney, to his service as a judicial clerk, and \nthen his scholarship in support of opportunities for all Americans.\n  Professor Liu has been guided by a desire to leave the world a better \nplace than he found it. Despite these many positive personal qualities \nto recommend him, it is, perhaps, something of an understatement to say \nthat Goodwin Liu's has been controversial.\n  First nominated in February of 2010, and then after a searching and \ndifficult nomination hearing, and a vote here, a renomination in \nJanuary of this year, a second confirmation hearing in front of the \nJudiciary Committee, in which I was able to participate, we now stand \non the verge of a cloture vote required for us to even get to the \nconsideration of his nomination.\n  Professor Liu is a prolific scholar, who has written on a number of \ntopics relating to educational rights and public schooling, among \nothers.\n  When I heard the attacks against Professor Liu, I was shocked, but \nconcerned. The charges that are being leveled against Professor Liu--\nthat he is a radical who would use the bench to engage in judicial \nactivism--are serious. So I took it upon myself to meet with Professor \nLiu, to review his record, and to come to my own conclusions.\n  I can say with certainty that Professor Liu will be a first-rate \njudge in the finest traditions of the legal profession. Professor Liu \nknows the difference between lecturing and judging. He knows that the \nrole of a judge is not to advocate but to follow the Constitution and \nthe precedents of the Supreme Court. Goodwin Liu will obey the law. We \ncan and should ask no more.\n  If we take a step back from the partisan rhetoric, I think we can \nfind broad agreement across the aisle that a judicial candidate ought \nto be evaluated according to his legal ability and experience, his \nstanding within the legal profession, his integrity, and his \ntemperament. Professor Liu rates extraordinarily highly in all of these \nareas.\n  Professor Liu's academic and professional qualifications demonstrate \nthat he is a lawyer of the utmost ability with a broad range of \nexperience. He was a Rhodes scholar and holds a law degree from Yale \nUniversity, where he was editor of the Yale Law Journal. He went on to \nclerk for one of the great intellects on the DC Circuit, Judge David \nTatel. After that, he clerked for Justice Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Since that time, he has worked in private practice and earned a \ntenured professorship at the University of California, Berkeley School \nof Law. At Berkeley, he has been a prolific scholar of exceptionally \nhigh regard.\n  In addition to a sterling resume, Professor Liu enjoys the highest \nesteem of his colleagues. Noted conservative scholar John Yoo has \nspoken out in support of his nomination, as has Kenneth Starr. He is \nthe recipient of the University of California's highest teaching award. \nClint Bolick, director of the Goldwater Institute, has said that \nProfessor Liu's writings ``exhibit fresh, independent thinking and \nintellectual honesty.'' This high opinion of Professor Liu is broadly \nshared. In giving Professor Liu its highest rating of ``Unanimously \nWell Qualified,'' the American Bar Association interviewed scores of \nattorneys and judges who have worked with Professor Liu and, evidently, \nfound that his reputation is one of impartiality, integrity, and great \nability. For nominees to our circuit courts of appeal, we could ask no \nless.\n  Professor Liu's activity as a noted legal and policy scholar is, in \nmy view, being used unfairly to impugn his judicial temperament. In \nmeeting with Professor Liu, he explained to me that he understands and \nrespects the difference between scholarship and jurisprudence. \nAcademics explore the contours and limits of the law, often advocating \nfor policy outcomes. Judges, on the other hand, apply legal precedent \nto come to the conclusion that the law compels, without prejudice or a \npolicy agenda.\n  When Professor Liu has been asked to apply the law, as would a judge, \nany criticism that he allows policy preferences to cloud his judgment \ndoes not pass muster. As an example, though Professor Liu has said that \nhis personal views are that individuals should be treated equally, \nregardless of sexual orientation. Even so, he testified before the \nCalifornia State Senate in 2008 that California's controversial \nProposition 8, which banned same-sex marriages, would pass muster under \nthe California constitution. This is a concrete example, from before \nhis nomination to public office, that Professor Liu is capable and \nwilling to set aside personal preferences and views when called upon to \nrender a legal judgement.\n  I also examined Professor Liu's scholarship on the topics of \neducation and welfare, to which his opponents claim he would create a \nconstitutional right if confirmed to the bench. I would be concerned if \nthese charges have merit, but they do not. Rather, they reflect a \ndistortion of what he has actually written. Professor Liu has \nrepeatedly clarified his unexceptional belief that Congress, and not \nthe courts, have the power to create new fundamental rights through \namendment to our Constitution.\n  An objective review of Professor Liu's qualifications, temperament, \nand intellect lead to the conclusion that he is an outstanding nominee \nand should be confirmed to the bench. Former Representative Tom \nCampbell, a five-term Republican Member of the House, agrees. In urging \nhis swift confirmation, Representative Campbell specifically praised \nProfessor Liu's reputation for, quote ``integrity, fair-mindedness, and \ncollegiality.''\n  I call upon all of my colleagues to take a fresh look at Professor \nLiu and to come to their own conclusions about him. In my opinion, \nProfessor Liu is a dedicated public servant who has undergone intense \nscrutiny over the past 15 months at great personal sacrifice. Too \noften, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that judicial and executive \nnominees are also people, with families, careers, and other \nresponsibilities in their lives. The confirmation process can exact a \nsteep cost and, as a result, many qualified and decent individuals \neither withdraw or decline to submit to it in the first place.\n  Professor Liu is an exceptional nominee to the Circuit Court. He has \nborne the challenges of confirmation with grace and dignity, as is in \nkeeping with his character and dedication to public service. In voting \non the petition to invoke cloture, I ask my colleagues to consider the \ncontent of Professor Liu's character. Listen to those who know him \nabove the interest groups who have sensationalized his nomination. I \nask them to consider his bipartisan support from those who work with \nhim and those who know him best.\n  I know Goodwin Liu. I trust him and know he will make a fine judge. I \nurge my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Senator \nMcConnell's production bill. The bill might be too much for some, too \nlittle for some, and maybe it is not perfect, but we must take a step \nin the direction of adding production of our Nation's natural resources \nif we are going\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nto bring down the cost of gasoline, bring down the cost of fuel, bring \ndown the cost of all the elements we have that are providing for our \nelectricity, natural gas, and other forms of energy.\n  I hope we can pass Senator McConnell's bill. Oil is, today, slightly \nunder $100 per barrel, and with the summer driving season approaching, \nwe know the price could go up. It is graduation season and people are \ndriving to their graduation ceremonies, and they are having to pay \nthese enormous prices at the pump. It is over $4 in many places. I \nrecently read a story about a constituent who was going to College \nStation for a Texas A graduation, and he complained, rightfully, that \nhe had a diesel truck and it cost him $74.41 to get his truck half \nfull. That is a lot for a half tank of fuel. I think we can do \nsomething about it.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Obama administration has put up barriers \nto increasing our domestic energy potential. We must stop that policy \nand go in the other direction and open our natural resources and use \nour natural resources, so we can bring down the cost of fuel and try to \nhelp our small businesses and families by providing opportunities to \nlower fuel.\n  The McConnell legislation gets the ball rolling. Supporters of the \nbill agree that long-term energy solutions involve removing the anti-\nenergy barriers to safely produce energy for Americans by Americans. On \nMarch 30, the President stated that producing more oil in America can \nhelp lower oil prices, create jobs, and enhance our energy security. \nBut what is happening is our regulatory agencies are going in the \nopposite direction. They are stopping the production of oil and gas in \nour country.\n  Let me read excerpts from a FOX News article, by Dan Springer, in \nApril of this year:\n\n       Shell Oil Company has announced it must scrap efforts to \n     drill for oil this summer in the Arctic Ocean off the \n     northern coast of Alaska. The decision comes following a \n     ruling by the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board to withhold \n     critical air permits. . . .\n       Shell has spent five years and nearly $4 billion on plans \n     to explore for oil in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The \n     leases alone cost $2.2 billion. . . .\n       The closest village to where Shell proposed to drill is \n     Kaktovik, Alaska. It is one of the most remote places in the \n     United States. According to the latest census, the population \n     is 245, and nearly all of them are Alaska natives. The \n     village, which is 1 square mile, sits right along the shores \n     of the Beaufort Sea, 70 miles away from the proposed offshore \n     drill site.\n       The EPA's appeals board ruled that Shell had not taken into \n     consideration emissions from an ice-breaking vessel when \n     calculating overall greenhouse gas emissions from the \n     project. . . .\n       At stake is an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil. That's \n     how much the U.S. Geological Survey believes is in the U.S. \n     portion of the Arctic Ocean. For perspective, that represents \n     two and a half times more oil than has flowed down the Trans \n     Alaska Pipeline throughout its 30-year history. The pipeline \n     is getting dangerously low on oil. At 660,000 barrels a day, \n     it's carrying only one-third of its capacity.\n\n  So we hear what the President is saying, but his own agencies are \ngoing in the opposite direction.\n  Here is another example: We are approaching June. The Department of \nthe Interior has not conducted an offshore lease sale in the Gulf of \nMexico. Lease sales usually occur twice a year. If a lease sale doesn't \noccur by the end of the year, 2011 would be the first year since 1958 \nwhich we have not conducted an offshore lease sale.\n  Because of the President's moratorium and lack of permitting in the \nGulf of Mexico, offshore energy production is expected to decrease by \n13 percent in 2011. Senator McConnell's bill addresses the need for \nincreased domestic production by reinstating the oil and gas leases in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the Atlantic, which President Obama \ncanceled.\n  This legislation also tackles the permitting delays companies in the \ngulf have experienced. Since October, the Department of the Interior \nhas only issued 53 shallow water permits and 14 deepwater permits. The \nmonthly approval rate before the moratorium was approximately 10 \nshallow water and 8 deepwater permits.\n  This legislation eliminates the bureaucratic delays which have \nburdened operators and have taken away their ability to raise capital \nto do the exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. In the bill, it says the \nDepartment of the Interior will approve or reject permit applications \nwithin 30 days. It doesn't require approval of every application, but \nit puts a limit of 30 days on the approval process, so people will not \nbe hung out, as they have been since last October. They are still \npaying the costs, but they cannot explore. So they are sitting idle. \nThis has caused the bankruptcy of at least one company I know in Texas, \nSeahawk Drilling. This is not good policy when we are talking, as the \nPresident is, about increasing production in our country and then doing \nthe opposite by enacting proposals that do not make sense, such as a \nmoratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n  On March 9 of this year, Senator Landrieu and I introduced S. 516, \nthe Lease Extension and Security Act, known as the LEASE Act. All this \ndoes is simply extend for 1 year the leases that have had a moratorium, \nbut the people are still paying the costs of those leases when they \nhave been prohibited from using them. The leaseholder continues to pay \nthe Treasury for all expenses associated with maintaining a lease, but \nthey have been prohibited from exploring the lands the lease is on.\n  It is very important that we pass this legislation. In the bill \nbefore us, the McConnell bill, we have a variation of the LEASE Act. It \nextends the leases for those that are going to come to an end at the \nend of this year. If they come to an end at the end of this year, they \nwill get a 1-year lease. That is a right step in the right direction.\n  Senator Landrieu and I believe every leaseholder--even if their lease \ndoes not run out this year--should have the full opportunity for their \nlease exploration capabilities in order to make it fair for the price \nthey have paid in the open bidding process for those leases.\n  The President has said he approves the extension of some leases. We \nagree. Why not all of them? They have been paid for. In many instances, \nthe companies are still paying the employees, even though the employees \nare not able to do the work. This year alone, over 350 leases will \nexpire and many of them are in moratorium.\n  The bill before us would help those people to use the next year for \ndetermining if it is worth drilling for more of the oil on the leases \nthey have purchased.\n  I think it is very important that we pass this legislation that we \nwill vote on very shortly today if we are serious about increasing the \nproduction of our own natural resources for the benefit of our people. \nIt seems to me we need to back up the words of the President with \nactions that will be positive, proactive, and productive in getting the \nprice of gasoline down at the pump. If we can start now, I hope the \nPresident would take some of the steps, for instance, to allow Shell, \nwith the investment it has made, to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean. \nThat is a place where there are vast reserves that have not been \ntapped. The people of Alaska support it.\n  If we would use our natural resources, we could put people in America \nto work. We could stop the heavy importation of foreign oil, which is \nwhat we depend on now for over 50 percent of our fuel, and certainly we \nwould like to add to our economy in this precarious economic time. We \ncan do it with our own natural resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the McConnell bill, and maybe then \nwe can open it for amendments and get started in doing the right thing \nfor our country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss high gas prices and \nthe direct impact they are having on every American. Every day, we see \nthe impact of high gasoline and diesel prices on our constituents and \ntheir pocketbooks. Some wonder if they will be able to put food on the \ntable when they cannot afford the gas it takes to get them to work. \nOthers see skyrocketing food prices caused by the increased fuel costs \nand wonder if they can afford a healthy meal for their children. Others \nwonder if they can take a vacation or cool their houses this coming \nsummer.\n  Today, gas prices hover around $4 per gallon. According to a recent \nUSA Today/Gallup poll, nearly 7 in 10 Americans say that the cost of \nfuel is causing a financial hardship for their families. That same poll \nsuggested that 21 percent of Americans say the impact of high gasoline \nprices is so dramatic that their standard of living is jeopardized.\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\n  This is a serious problem and it needs immediate action. \nUnfortunately, rather than taking action to address the problem, I am \nconcerned that Congress will once again punt on doing what we need to \ndo to bring prices down now. To bring prices down, we need to address \nthe fact that the United States imports too much oil from foreign \nnations. We need to increase supply at the same time we work to reduce \ndemand.\n  There are two approaches that have been considered in recent weeks. \nMy Republican colleagues and I have offered legislation that will \nincrease production in the Gulf of Mexico. It will allow for the \ndevelopment of more American energy, which will decrease the amount of \noil we import. With unrest in the Middle East, it will start the \nprocess of giving America a more stable source of domestic energy, and \nit will create American jobs at a time when the unemployment rate is 9 \npercent. Our bill looks at the problem--an unstable supply of energy--\nand provides a solution that will make our country more energy \nindependent today.\n  The other approach being considered is that of my Democratic \ncolleagues. Their bill, which failed to move forward yesterday, sought \nto increase taxes on five companies in the oil industry. Whether or not \nthose tax benefits should exist is worth debating in the context of \noverall corporate tax reform, but that is not what we are debating \ntoday. We all know that their approach to energy policy won't do \nanything to improve the current situation. In fact, their legislation \nmight make matters worse by leading to less domestic production and a \nlarger increase in gasoline prices.\n  The contrast couldn't be greater. Republicans have put forth \nthoughtful legislation that will begin to address the problem and help \nlower gasoline prices. Democrats have put forth punitive legislation \nthat might make some feel good now because it punishes ``Big Oil,'' but \nultimately it will not do anything to lower gas prices. Republicans \nsupport legislation that will create American jobs. Democrats support \nlegislation that will drive American jobs overseas.\n  Some suggest that our bill will not do anything to lower prices \nbecause it will take too long to implement to have a real effect. That \nis the same argument I have heard since I came to the Senate over 14 \nyears ago. Opponents of domestic production always say that it will not \ndo anything to lower prices today. If we had taken action to open up \nareas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when I came to the \nSenate in 1997, we would be producing approximately 1 million more \nbarrels of domestic oil today. If we had stopped efforts to lock up the \ngulf coast 10 years ago as many Republicans suggested, we might not be \nhaving this conversation today. And, if we do not do anything today, \nSenators will still be asking these same questions 10 years from now. \nAnd, it might not take 10 years for oil to come online if agencies are \nnot delayed from issuing permits by frivolous lawsuits. The 2006 \nhighway bill included a provision that prohibited lawsuits from being \nfiled more than 180 days after publication of the final permit in the \nFederal Register. Such a provision should be included in future \nlegislative efforts to move forward with American energy development in \na timely manner. With high oil prices, we have an opportunity to act \ntoday and we should not let this opportunity pass without action.\n  In addition to lowering gasoline prices, we have the ability to \nincrease revenues to the Federal Treasury today without raising taxes \nin a punitive manner on one industry. By passing legislation that \nallows for more domestic production, we will increase revenues to the \nFederal Treasury at the same time it creates good paying American jobs. \nIn 2008 and 2009, the oil and gas industry paid over $30 billion in \nrents, royalties, and fees. The industry is estimated to generate \napproximately $100 million in revenue each day this year to the Federal \nGovernment. This amount will only increase as we allow for the \nproduction of more domestic energy.\n  With Americans hurting, we need to do something--anything to reduce \ngasoline prices. But, instead of working on solutions for one of the \nsingle most important issues confronting the American people, my \ncolleagues in the majority loudly sings campaign rhetoric chorus and \nverse. They say, ``let's punish big oil for making big profits'' and \n``let's not allow these energy companies to dupe us when Americans are \npaying record high prices.'' What they do not say is that their \napproach will do nothing to help the situation and will likely make the \nsituation worse. They do not admit that their proposal is good \npolitics, but bad policy. This is not the way we should legislate when \nAmericans cannot afford to fill up their tanks. We need to do something \nabout energy and we need to do it now.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I support developing more alternative \nenergy. I support the use of wind energy and the development of better \nsolar energy technologies. Wyoming is the perfect place for much of \nthat development to happen. While we need to develop these technologies \nfor the long term, we need of the energy we can get today. We need more \nAmerican oil from American soil. We need more domestic natural gas. We \nneed more nuclear energy and we definitely need more clean coal.\n  Republicans stand ready to have a serious debate about our country's \nenergy policy. We have offered a proposal that looks at the supply and \ndemand challenges we face and addresses them head on. Republicans stand \nready to pass legislation that will lower gasoline prices and will \nincrease domestic production. Those actions will, in turn, create \nAmerican jobs and will increase revenues to the Federal Treasury at a \ntime when we see record deficits.\n  For too long, we have talked about the need to have a comprehensive \nenergy policy. We have talked about the need to decrease our dependence \non foreign energy sources. It is time for us to stop talking and to \nact. The upcoming vote on S. 953, the Offshore Production and Safety \nAct, is our first opportunity to act, and I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in working to lower gas prices by passing this measure.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand the wealth and \nopportunity represented by our Federal offshore petroleum and natural \ngas resources. We are blessed in this country with an abundant public \nestate. Montana, too, is abundant with natural resources and relies \nheavily on these resources for jobs and economic stability. I support \nefforts to develop these resources with commonsense safeguards that \nreduce our exposure to volatile foreign energy resources. I have \nsupported onshore and offshore drilling in the past, and will continue \nto do so long as it is done responsibly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to address the \nOffshore Production and Safety Act. It is legislation that attempts to \naddress the regulation and the critical need to drill for oil in this \ncountry.\n  Let me tell you, I understand the frustration from my colleagues who \nare upset about the bureaucratic agencies that really do not understand \nthe urgent need to review permits in a timely and responsible manner. \nMining in West Virginia has long been a direct target of the EPA and \nthese unfair regulatory practices they have practiced for far too long. \nFor example, in May of 2009, the EPA had a permit backlog of 235 \napplications. Two-thirds of them were already deemed complete for final \nprocessing by the Army Corps of Engineers. Clearly, there is a problem. \nThe question is, Is this legislation the right solution?\n  The truth is, I would love to sink my teeth in and vote for this \nmeasure, but I simply cannot. I do not believe this legislation strikes \nthe right commonsense balance among our energy demands, responsible \nregulation, our economy, and the environment. In fact, the unintended \nconsequence of this legislation is that it could make regulatory \nagencies more powerful and more Draconian--a fact that would actually \nhurt the drilling, the energy independence we could gain, and the \nbusinesses' and our need to achieve energy independence.\n  Quite simply, if we place a fixed 30-day deadline on these permits \nwith two 15-day extensions, I believe we would see more permits denied \nthan we would see processed. How does this make sense? It would create \na perverse effect\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nthat could encourage government bureaucrats to stop any and all \npermits, and that would be a terrible outcome.\n  The fact is, neither the legislation we will vote on today nor the \nlegislation we voted on yesterday addresses the bigger issue that our \nNation must declare its independence from foreign oil. We can only do \nthat by developing a true national plan for energy independence.\n  I have come to this floor many times to urge my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues to work with me to put together an energy plan \nthat works for all of America. In fact, just last week, I came here to \naddress the importance of expanded domestic drilling. I truly believe \nthis Nation needs to develop all of our domestic resources, whether it \nis drilling for oil or natural gas, mining coal, producing wind and \nsolar, developing better nuclear, biomass, or geothermal so that we can \ndeclare our energy independence within a generation. But in developing \nand pursuing a national energy plan, we cannot lose sight of our \ncommonsense values and our priorities.\n  This bill falls short of those commonsense priorities, but I assure \nmy colleagues that I will work with any Senator from either party who \nwill try to create a national energy policy that will truly help the \nNation achieve energy independence.\n  I thank all of my colleagues, and I hope we will be able to work \ntogether to move this Nation forward for true energy independence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to call for the resignation of \nMr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund. \nThe criminal allegations against Mr. Strauss-Kahn are alarming and \nundermine confidence in the institution at a critical juncture in our \neconomic history. Mr. Strauss-Kahn has forfeited our confidence and \nshould resign or be fired from his position at the IMF.\n  Over the last 2 years, the IMF presided over the European debt \ncrisis, which included controversial bailouts of Greece, Ireland and \nPortugal. I remain especially concerned about the U.S. taxpayer share \nof funding these European bailouts and American taxpayers' exposure to \nnew sovereign risks. While I have questions about the actions taken by \nthe IMF to handle the debt crisis, the institution's role in our global \nfinancial system requires strong leadership.\n  The IMF's Deputy Managing Director, John Lipsky, should assume full \nresponsibility of the IMF and the process to determine a permanent \nreplacement should commence at once. I encourage U.S. Executive \nDirector of the IMF, Meg Lundsager, to strongly advocate for Mr. \nStrauss-Kahn's resignation or termination and aid in the search for a \nmore worthy replacement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                      Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nsenior Senator from Virginia who is about to speak. I will be brief.\n  I wish to applaud the President today on his comments and the \nadministration's comments, especially the comments of Trade Ambassador \nKirk and Gene Sperling, the President's top economic adviser. They have \nmade it clear they will not submit the three free trade agreements--one \nwith Colombia, one with Panama, and one with South Korea--until \nlegislation has come to their desks to take care of the issue of trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  This Congress, because of some objections on the other side of the \naisle, allowed the trade adjustment assistance language to expire in \nFebruary. That simply means many workers who lost their jobs because of \nfree trade agreements, or lost their jobs because of trade--not \nnecessarily the countries we had trade agreements with--were going to \nget some assistance so they could, in fact, be retrained so they could \ngo back to work. Losing their jobs had everything to do with what \nhappens in other ways but has nothing to do with their job performance \nor even their company's job performance.\n  The President made the right decision by saying we are not going to \nmove forward with these free trade agreements. I don't much like them, \nbut that is not the point. We are not going to move forward until we \nhave helped these workers find jobs.\n  Second, we are going to make sure, as Senator Casey and I have said \non the floor before, that the health coverage tax credit is also \nrenewed. That matters, to be able to continue the health coverage of \nmany workers.\n  And, third, that the work of Senator Wyden, Senator Stabenow, and \nSenator McCaskill will continue, to work on trade enforcement in making \nsure\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nthese trade rules and trade laws that are in effect will actually be in \nforce so we can protect American jobs.\n  When we pass these trade agreements, they always cost us jobs. It is \nabout time we take care of workers and communities that suffer from it.\n  I thank Senator Webb, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on the pending \nnomination of Professor Goodwin Liu for a seat on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Regretfully, I will be voting against this nomination \nfor reasons I will explain. At the same time, I wish to emphasize my \nprofound respect for this institution and for my fellow Senators from \nboth parties, and I believe it would be wrong to vote against a cloture \nmotion whose intent is to proceed with debate on the merits of one who \nhas been nominated to be a judge. I made this point loudly and clearly \nwhen the nomination of one of my Virginia constituents, Barbara Keenan, \nwas filibustered. Philosophical consistency--and my admiration and \nrespect for all the work Chairman Leahy has been doing in order to fill \nthe many vacancies in our Federal court system--compel me to vote to \nproceed with the debate on Mr. Liu, but I do not, however, intend to \nvote in favor of his confirmation.\n  I have met with Mr. Liu. I have read many of his writings and most of \nthe testimony from his two confirmation hearings. He is clearly \ntalented and whatever he ends up doing, he is certain to have a long \nfuture in our country. He also has been blessed beyond words by the \ngoodness of our society. Both his parents came to this country already \nas physicians. He attended our finest universities. He was a Rhodes \nscholar. He is a Yale Law School graduate, and he has spent almost his \nentire career as a talented, if somewhat controversial, professor of \nlaw. When I met with Mr. Liu I found him to be personable and clearly \nbright.\n  But intellect in and of itself does not always give a person wisdom, \nnor does it guarantee good judgment, and the root word of judgment is, \nof course, judge. This is our duty today: to decide whether Professor \nLiu's almost complete lack of practical legal experience, coupled with \nhis history of intemperate, politically charged statements, allows us a \nmeasure of comfort and predictability as to whether he would be fair \nand balanced while sitting on one of the highest courts in the land. \nMr. Liu's temperament and his frequently strident political views have \nbeen called into question by many well-intentioned observers, including \nmy respected colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, who, like myself, voted \nin favor of both Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. Senator Graham concluded \nthat Professor Liu seems better fit for a life in politics rather than \non the bench. My own concern is that we in the Senate have no real \nability to know whether Mr. Liu would temporize these views or conduct \nhimself in a different manner if he were to be given a seat in one of \nthe highest judicial positions in our country.\n  The list is long, and time is short, but I would summarize my \nconcerns through two observations.\n  The first involves Professor Liu's public comments regarding Supreme \nCourt Justice Alito, which I know will be repeated by others. Mr. Liu's \nview was that:\n\n       Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may \n     shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away \n     with a stolen purse . . . where a black man may be sentenced \n     to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man . . . I \n     humbly submit that this is not . . . the America that we \n     aspire to be.\n\n  Obviously, I share the view of many others that whether one agrees or \ndisagrees with Justice Alito's view of the Constitution, this is hardly \na fair representation of his view of our society.\n  The second observation is more telling and it goes to the America we \nall should aspire to be: an America where every person, regardless of \nrace, creed, national origin, or personal circumstances, has the same \nopportunities to succeed to the full extent of their potential. Let me \nmake a point that a lot of people seem uncomfortable with in speeches \non this floor. That means White people too. Economic disadvantage is \nnot limited to one's race, ethnic background, or time of immigration to \nAmerica. When it comes to policies that are designed to provide \ndiversity in our society, we do ourselves an enormous injustice by \nturning a blind eye to the wide variance among White cultures as we \ndiscuss greater representation from different minority groups.\n  For all of his emphasis on diversity programs, I do not see anywhere \nthat Mr. Liu understands this vital point. In fact, one tends to see \nthe opposite. In 2004, Mr. Liu made a speech at an American \nConstitution Society Conference. In this speech he mentioned: ``The \npower of the courts to influence society, . . . the power of legal \nprinciple to ratify inequality.'' He then went on to comment:\n\n       If we work hard, if we stick to our values, if we build a \n     new moral consensus, then I think someday we will see \n     Millikan, Rodriquez, Adarand, be swept into the dustbin of \n     history.\n\n  So we know, first, that Mr. Liu wants to use the courts to influence \nsociety and to ratify his view of inequality. OK. How does that fit \ninto Adarand being swept into the dustbin of history?\n  What was Adarand about? Well, it was about Randy Pech, one of five \nkids born to a welder and a mom, whose family had lost their farm in \nIowa during the Great Depression. The mom then worked as a sales clerk \nin a department store. Neither of them had ever gone to college. Mr. \nPech left college after 3 years and started a company that put up \nguardrails along highways. His startup was the money he would have used \nin his fourth year of college and his loan was accomplished by using \nhis parents' retirement pensions as collateral. He made a bid as a \nsubcontractor on a highway construction project in Colorado that was by \nfar the lowest bid, but he lost to a minority-owned company because our \nown government was paying bonuses to contractors who made subcontracts \nwith so-called ``disadvantaged businesses,'' and Mr. Pech happened to \nbe White. The Supreme Court decided that this was wrong and decided in \nMr. Pech's favor, although the Civil Rights Commission pointed out 10 \nyears later that the Supreme Court's decision was still not being \ncomplied with by Federal agencies.\n  Mr. Liu offered an explanation for his comments during his \nconfirmation process, but taken in the context of his other remarks, I \nfind that statement unconvincing.\n  Last July I wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal saying that \nwhile I continue to support the original goal of affirmative action, \nwhich was to assist African Americans who still suffer the badges of \ndiscrimination and slavery, it is time for us to recognize that we harm \nourselves any time we cut away any person or group from the opportunity \nto reach their full potential in our wonderful and unique society. As \none can imagine, I got a few questions from some groups about this \narticle, so let me answer those questions--and sum up my concerns about \nMr. Liu--with an observation.\n  The same day my Wall Street Journal ran, July 23, a Remote Area \nMedical Clinic was held in the open air of the Wise County fairgrounds \nin the Appalachian mountains of southwest Virginia. These clinics bring \nmedical professionals into underserved areas where medical care is hard \nto find. They are not that different from what we used to do out in the \nimpoverished villages of Vietnam when I was a Marine infantry officer \nmany years ago. Twelve of my staff members went down to Wise County to \nvolunteer. Working in tents, mobile units, and horse stalls, over these \n3 days the RAM clinic took care of 6,869 patient visits and pulled more \nthan 4,000 teeth in the open air of the Wise County fairgrounds. In \nthis part of Virginia, nearly half the population lives below 200 \npercent of poverty, almost a quarter of them have no insurance \nwhatsoever. Age-adjusted mortality rates in some counties are as much \nas 70 percent higher than in the rest of Virginia. This Appalachian \nmountain region is, of course, predominantly White. Let me emphasize \nthat these conditions come from cultural issues based on many \ngenerations of hardship and strife and not simply individual choice.\n  Back there in those mountains, there is no doubt somebody who is \nthinking that if he could put together a little money and maybe get \nsomebody to believe in him, maybe he could start up a\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\nconstruction company just like Randy Pech did and compete for \ngovernment contracts on a completely fair playing field, which has \nalways been the gift and the miracle of America. I want him to have \nthat opportunity, just as I want every other American to have it. And I \ndon't want a judge on a circuit court somewhere telling him that his \nown chance for a fair and prosperous future should be swept into the \ndustbin of history.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, over the past couple of days here on the \nSenate floor we have had a lot of discussion about domestic energy \nproduction and there have been a lot of good points made. But, frankly, \nit is more of a political exercise than something that is going to help \nthe American people.\n  If one listened to the debate, one might think there is no consensus \nand no way forward. I disagree with that. I think given our energy \nchallenges, including $4 a gallon gasoline, we need an energy policy \nthat encourages more affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy. I think \nwe can reach a consensus on a few areas, and let me raise a couple of \nthem today.\n  The first is natural gas exploration and development. In my own State \nof Ohio, we have had exciting new developments over the past several \nyears. Geologists have known we have big shale formations in the \neastern part of the United States for years, but until recently we \nhaven't had the drilling technologies that allowed us to tap into these \nhuge reserves. We now have that.\n\n  In Ohio, we have both the Marcellus and the Utica shale finds that, \nunfortunately, have not been tapped yet but have tremendous potential. \nSome of the oil and gas reserve estimates associated with these finds \nare truly amazing. For the State of Ohio alone, in one of those \nformations--Utica--I am told we could yield over 15 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas. So this is a great opportunity both to be sure we have \nthe energy we need to power our economy but also to create jobs that go \ninto energy production.\n  By the way, other States around us, including Pennsylvania, West \nVirginia, and upstate New York, as an example, have even more \nproduction potential than Ohio. Already there are some Ohio counties, \nsuch as Belmont County and Jefferson County and Columbiana County, that \nare beginning to explore some of these finds, and we are very hopeful \nthat in some of these counties, where there is incredibly high \nunemployment, we will be able to begin production soon. These counties \nhave been hard hit by the downturn in the economy, and they can use the \neconomic activity and the jobs that will be created by this production.\n  Earlier this year, I visited an Ohio company that is an example of \none of the industries that is going to benefit from this natural gas \nproduction. It is V Star. It is a company that makes piping. It is \nnear Youngstown, OH. They just decided to expand their manufacturing \ncapability. Why? Because they are looking at Marcellus and Utica, \nunderstanding this is going to create great opportunities for them. \nThey are investing in our State. They are investing in jobs. They are \ndoing it because of these finds. We have to be sure we put out the \nFederal policies to promote and encourage the development of these \nresources.\n  In addition to using natural gas for electricity generation and as a \nfeedstock for a lot of industries, including the chemical industry, \nnatural gas holds incredible potential as an alternative to gas. Today, \nwe are talking about the need to be less dependent on foreign oil, \nwhich happens to be one of the top issues on both sides of the aisle. \nNatural gas is a way we can do that very directly because it can be \nused particularly in fleets. Today, the equivalent price for a gallon \nof natural gas is $1.60. Think about that: as compared to $4 for \ngasoline, $1.60 for natural gas. The infrastructure costs create some \nchallenges, but, again, for fleets, where there is central refueling, \nit makes all the sense in the world. Widespread conversion of our \nfleets, including our Nation's buses, garbage trucks, and utility \nvehicles, would help reduce demand for gasoline.\n  America arguably has the greatest energy reserves in the world, \ndepending on which estimate you look at. We have to find a way to \nresponsibly tap these reserves, in a way that we can become less \ndependent on foreign nations for energy needs, in a way where we will \nstop sending so much of our wealth overseas to pay for foreign imports, \nparticularly of crude oil.\n  Ohio is still in the throes of an economic downturn. Today, we are at \n9 percent unemployment in Ohio. Underemployment makes Ohio's situation \neven worse. One way to create jobs and to get Ohio back on track is by \nexpanding, again, the use of our own resources, including natural gas. \nThere should be a consensus on this issue. We should be promoting \nFederal policies to encourage the exploration and the development of \nthese resources, and we should do it now.\n  Another area where I think you could see some consensus on energy \npolicy in the short term in the Senate is in the area of energy \nconservation and efficiency. We should both find more and use less. It \nis that commitment to use less that led me, last week, to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire called the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act. It is S. 1000, for those \nwho would like to check it out.\n  It is a bipartisan bill, a targeted and achievable piece of \nlegislation that would leverage energy efficiency investments in a \nnumber of areas, including the building and industrial sectors but also \nwith the Federal Government. It would help consumers and the Federal \nGovernment save money on their energy bills and help industry improve \nthe efficiency of their production processes.\n  Again, this is an example of where we should be able to come together \nas Republicans and Democrats to get something done. There is widespread \nconsensus that energy efficiency is the low-hanging fruit, a way to \nreduce our energy use and, again, to make America's economy more \ncompetitive. As with anything, the devil is in the details. There will \nbe some Senators who may disagree with some of the specifics in this \nlegislation, but, again, it is the type of bill we should be debating \non the floor of this Senate. With a little hard work, I believe it is \none we can ultimately get enacted into law.\n  Instead, again, we have spent the better part of this week debating \ntwo bills; one that, in my view, would have done more harm than good, \nby raising taxes on certain businesses, while doing nothing to increase \nenergy production or lower gas prices; and another one I supported that \nI think would do a lot of good but we knew did not have the necessary \n60 votes to move forward and, therefore, we were not able to make \nprogress this week for the American people.\n  We have all the ingenuity, the know-how, and the resources within our \nown borders to be able to have the energy we need to run our economy \nand to improve our economy and to create jobs. I hope moving forward we \ncan find agreement on these issues and begin to tap this great American \npotential.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CARDIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the nomination of Goodwin Liu to be U.S. \nCircuit Judge for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture on this nomination.\n  I am disappointed we had to file a cloture motion. I hope my \ncolleagues would want to vote up or down on this nomination, and I hope \nthey would vote for his confirmation.\n  As we begin the debate on the nomination of Mr. Liu, let me start by \ntelling my colleagues how thoroughly his nomination has been vetted by \nthe Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Chairman Leahy.\n  President Obama first nominated Goodwin Liu for this position in \nFebruary of last year. That was over 1 year\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nago. The Judiciary Committee has held two separate hearings on this \nnomination. Mr. Liu's latest set of questions and answers, for the \nrecord, spanned over 130 pages. The Judiciary Committee has favorably \nreported his nomination on three separate occasions: in May of 2010, \nSeptember of 2010, and April of 2011.\n  So I am disappointed my Republican colleagues have refused to allow \nthis nomination to come to a vote without the necessity of filing a \ncloture motion. As we know, the majority leader has filed cloture on \nthis nomination. Senators have had ample information on the background, \nexperience and qualifications of this nominee and it is time for the \nSenators to perform their constitutional duty to debate the nomination \nand to vote up or down on this nominee.\n  I was privileged to serve on the Judiciary Committee in the 111th \nCongress and participated in a debate of the Goodwin Liu nomination on \nseveral occasions. I was pleased to cast my vote in favor of Mr. Liu's \nnomination in committee, and I look forward to supporting his \nnomination on the floor.\n  When I examine judicial nominations that are submitted by the \nPresident, I use several criteria.\n  First, I believe judicial nominees must have an appreciation for the \nConstitution and the protections it provides to each and every \nAmerican.\n  Second, a nominee must embrace a judicial philosophy that reflects \nmainstream American values, not narrow ideological interests.\n  Third, a judicial nominee must respect the role and responsibilities \nof each branch of government, including a healthy respect for the \nprecedents of the court.\n  Fourth, I look for nominees with a strong commitment and passion for \nthe continued forward progress of civil rights protections.\n  Finally, I want a judge who has the necessary experience, \ntemperament, and commitment to public service.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a little background on Mr. Liu, \nhis qualifications, and why I intend to support his nomination.\n  Goodwin Liu, in many ways, embodies the American dream. He is the son \nof immigrants to this country. His parents were doctors who came to the \nUnited States from Taiwan in the late 1960s, when foreign doctors were \nbeing recruited to work in underserved areas.\n  Goodwin Liu did not speak English until kindergarten. During high \nschool, Goodwin Liu had the opportunity to serve as a page in the House \nof Representatives, after being sponsored by late Congressman Bob \nMatsui of California, whom I had the privilege of serving with in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Professor Liu has a sterling academic record. He earned his B.S., Phi \nBeta Kappa, from Stanford University, where he was elected copresident \nof the student body. A Rhodes Scholar, he earned his M.A. from Oxford \nUniversity. He received his J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was an \neditor of the Yale Law Journal. He then went on to clerk for DC Circuit \nCourt Judge David Tatel and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  Professor Liu has a track record of working on public policy issues \nin public service. He worked for 2 years at the Corporation for \nNational Service. He served as a special assistant to the Deputy \nSecretary of Education, where he worked on numerous legal and policy \nissues.\n  Professor Liu has worked in private practice. After his clerkships, \nhe served as an associate in the Washington, DC, law firm of O'Melveny \n& Myers, working on a wide range of business matters. About half his \npractice consisted of appellate litigation, preparing him well to serve \non a court of appeals. He has also maintained an active pro bono \npractice at that firm, which also tells me of his commitment to equal \njustice under the law.\n  Professor Liu then went on to his current occupation, joining the \nfaculty of the University of California Berkeley School of Law and \nhelping to teach our next generation of lawyers. He serves as a \nprofessor at the law school, was promoted to an associate dean of the \nlaw school, and was elected to the American Law Institute.\n  Professor Liu has received the law school's Distinguished Teaching \nAward. Professor Liu is considered an expert on constitutional law and \neducation law and policy, with a particular focus on the needs of \nAmerica's most disadvantaged students. He is the author of numerous law \nreview articles and the coauthor of an influential book on \nconstitutional law interpretation entitled ``Keeping Faith with the \nConstitution.''\n  I heard my colleague talk about Goodwin Liu. But I would just urge my \ncolleagues not to penalize an individual because he is active or \nexpresses his own opinions. We should judge the nominees based upon \ntheir qualifications and their commitments to interpret the law as \nrequired on the court.\n  Professor Liu answered numerous questions about his approach to \nconstitutional interpretation during his two confirmation hearings. He \ntestified:\n\n       The role of the judge is to be an impartial, objective and \n     neutral arbiter of specific cases and controversies that come \n     before him or her, and the way that process works is through \n     absolute fidelity to the applicable precedents and the \n     language of the laws, statutes, or regulations that are at \n     issue in the case.\n\n  I do not know who would disagree with that. That is what many of us \nhave been calling for on both sides of the aisle.\n  He has also answered questions about his ideology as a judge. He \ntestified:\n\n       It would not be my role to bring any particular theory of \n     constitutional interpretation to the job of an intermediate \n     appellate judge. The duty of a circuit judge is to faithfully \n     follow the Supreme Court's instructions on matters of \n     constitutional interpretation, not any particular theory. So \n     that is exactly what I would do. I would apply the applicable \n     precedents to the facts of each case.\n\n  Once again, I could not agree with that statement more. In written \nresponses to Senators' questions, he also stated:\n\n       I do not believe it is ever appropriate for judges to \n     indulge their own values or policy preferences in determining \n     what the Constitution and laws mean.\n\n  Professor Liu certainly has written a number of thought-provoking \narticles on controversial public policy issues of the day, but this \nshould not disqualify him from being a judge. I am confident Professor \nLiu understands the difference between being an advocate and being a \njudge and I hope we can draw that distinction and will respect the \ndifference if he is confirmed and puts on the judicial robe.\n  Specific questions concerning affirmative action were asked during \nhis confirmation hearings. So let me quote from Professor Liu's \ntestimony to the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       I absolutely do not support racial quotas, and my writings, \n     I think, have made very clear that I believe they are \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  He then said:\n\n       I think affirmative action, as it was originally conceived, \n     was a time-limited remedy for past wrongs, and I think that \n     is the appropriate way to understand what affirmative action \n     is.\n\n  I think we should take a look at his record on this, and I think it \nis unfair to judge him based upon certain innuendoes.\n  Professor Liu also has broad support from distinguished legal \nscholars from both parties. The former Solicitor General and White \nHouse prosecutor, Ken Starr, praised Professor Liu's ``strong \nintellect, demonstrated independence, and outstanding character''--\nqualifications we all want to see on the court. We want to see \nintellect, we want to see independence, and we want to see character. \nKen Starr summed that up fairly well.\n  In a March 19, 2010, letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. \nStarr joined with another professor, stating:\n\n       Goodwin is a person of great intellect, accomplishment, and \n     integrity, and he is exceptionally well qualified to serve on \n     the court of appeals. . . . What we wish to highlight, beyond \n     his on obvious intellect and legal talents, is his \n     independence and openness to diverse viewpoints, as well as \n     his ability to follow the facts and the law to their logical \n     conclusion. . . .\n       These are qualities we expect in a judge. And Goodwin \n     clearly possesses them . . . [A] judge takes an oath to \n     uphold and defend the Constitution, and in the case of a \n     circuit judge, fidelity to the law entails adherence to \n     Supreme Court precedent and . . . adherence to circuit \n     precedence as well. . . . Goodwin knows the difference \n     between what the law is and what he might wish it to be, and \n     he is fully capable and unafraid of discharging the duty to \n     say what the law is.\n\n  That is what Ken Starr said about a person he knows very well, \nGoodwin\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nLiu, and he strongly recommends his confirmation to our colleagues. I \nalso want to discuss the importance of improving diversity on our \ncourts. If confirmed, Professor Liu would be only the second Asian \nAmerican currently serving on a Federal appeals court, and the only \nAsian American in active service in the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Ninth Circuit is home to over 40 percent of the Asian American \npopulation in the United States. Finally, Professor Liu has received \nthe highest possible judicial rating, ``unanimously well qualified'' \nfrom the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary.\n  With this distinguished record and recommendations that we have \nreceived, we have an excellent nominee to serve on the court of \nappeals. I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my privilege, it is my honor, to \nsupport Goodwin Liu, a Californian--and a brilliant Californian--who \nhas been nominated by the President to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. And what a fine nomination this is. I thank the President for \nhis belief in Goodwin, and his, I think, amazing perception that this \nis a young man--and he is young, he is about 40. This is a young man \nwho is just exceptional, is a perfect example of the American dream, \nand someone who has worked so hard to put himself into this position \nwhere he was nominated for this great honor.\n  I want to show folks a picture of Goodwin. He is a very special and \ntalented person. He has had a long struggle with this nomination, which \nwe will talk about. I also wish to thank, of course, Chairman Leahy for \nworking hard to bring this nomination to the Senate floor, and Senator \nFeinstein, my colleague, for her hard work in the committee and her \nleadership in helping to shepherd this nomination in the Senate.\n  This vote is not only historic, because Goodwin will make history--if \nhe gets this vote. This vote is long overdue. First, let me talk about \nwhy it is historic. It is historic because if we get the 51 votes we \nneed today, Professor Liu will be one of only two Asian Americans \ncurrently serving as a Federal appellate judge in the United States. \nThere is currently only one Asian American among the 160 active judges \non the Federal Courts of Appeals, and there is no active Asian American \njudge on the Ninth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over an area that is \nhome to more than 40 percent of our Nation's Asian American population.\n  Let me repeat that. There is no active Asian American judge on the \nNinth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over an area that is home to more \nthan 40 percent of our Nation's Asian American population. The beauty \nof our great Nation--one of the beauties--is our great diversity. \nAmerica is great because we are representatives of so many faiths and \nso many ethnic backgrounds. We know all of our institutions, whether it \nis here in the Senate or anywhere, all of our institutions do better \nwhen they have a diversity of views and diversity. Clearly, when \nsomeone as brilliant as Goodwin gets this nomination, we should be so \nproud in this body. We should be joining hands over party lines. We \nshould be pleased that our court would have such a brilliant member.\n  Professor Liu was originally nominated in February 2010 for a \njudicial emergency seat, one that has been vacant since January 2009. \nSo we have had a judicial emergency, and yet we have had a hard time \ngetting this vote to the floor.\n  Chief Justice Roberts called on Senators not to play politics with \nour nominees. He warned that ``delays in filling vacancies have created \nacute difficulties in some judicial districts.'' Undoubtedly, the Ninth \nCircuit certainly is one of the jurisdictions that Chief Justice \nreferred to because the Ninth Circuit is the Nation's largest and \nbusiest appellate court in the country, accounting for over 20 percent \nof all new appellate cases in the country, according to court \nstatistics.\n  Now, I have said--and I heard Senator Cardin, and I thought he just \ndid a beautiful job of laying out why he is supporting Goodwin Liu. But \nI also heard some other comments that did not connect to Goodwin Liu. I \nheard comments that just did not fit what Goodwin Liu has said about \nhis role as a judge.\n  So I wanted to put up a couple of the quotes directly from Professor \nLiu and what he said about his role as a judge. He said:\n\n       I think the role of the judge is to be an impartial, \n     objective, and neutral arbiter of specific cases and \n     controversies that come before him or her. And the way that \n     that process works is through absolute fidelity to the \n     applicable precedents and the language of the laws, statues, \n     regulations that are at issue in the case.\n\n  Another statement by Professor Liu I wanted to share with you. He \nsaid:\n\n       If I were fortunate enough to be confirmed in this process, \n     it would not be my role to bring any particular theory of \n     constitutional interpretation to the job of an intermediate \n     appellate judge. The duty of a circuit judge is to faithfully \n     follow the Supreme Court's instructions on matters of \n     Constitutional interpretation, not any particular theory. And \n     so that is exactly what I would do, is I would apply the \n     applicable precedents to the facts of each case.\n\n  It could not be clearer. So if you hear any colleague of mine saying \nsomething else about how Professor Liu views the role of a judge in \nthis particular appellate area, just refer them to these quotes.\n  Professor Liu has sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee twice for \nmore than 5 hours--5 hours--answering any and all questions posed to \nhim during the hearing. He has also answered numerous written questions \nfrom committee members. He has been voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee three times.\n  I just ask the American people, as they tune in to this debate--they \nmay not be familiar with the confirmation process--if they think it is \nfair for someone like Professor Liu--and we will put his picture back \nup so we personalize this--this young man, this husband, this father, \nthis teacher, to have to sit for all of those hours, and then to \nfinally be brought to the floor, after the third time we voted it--that \nis why I praised Senator Leahy for doing this again because sometimes \nthere are reasons that we go back and back and back. There are reasons \nof fairness and justice and because we do not want to miss an \nopportunity to put someone like Professor Goodwin Liu on the bench.\n  Now, I will tell you, there have been 12 months of attacks on Goodwin \nLiu, misrepresentations, unfounded distortions of his record. I want \nthe American people to know this. Politics is tough. I can tell you, \nrunning four times for Senate, it is tough. It is brutal. It is ugly. \nBut there is no reason to turn that venom on a nominee like this, and \nit is offensive to me.\n  Through it all, Professor Liu could have said: You know what, I \ncannot take this. I do not need this. My kids do not need this. My \nfamily does not need this. But he showed courage and character and \ndignity.\n  I was so pleased when President Obama nominated Goodwin Liu to serve \non the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because Goodwin Liu is \nconsidered one of the brightest legal scholars not just in California \nbut in the Nation. He is a respected authority on constitutional law.\n  At UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of law, where he is an associate \ndean and a professor, he is admired widely for his writings and his \ndevotion to his students.\n  To Professor Liu, if you are watching these proceedings, I am proud \nof you. To Professor Liu's wife, Ann, and his two small children, \nViolet and Emmett, I say thank you for your patience and your \nunyielding support. You should be so proud of your dad.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about Goodwin Liu's background. He was \nborn in Augusta, GA, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who came to this \ncountry to practice medicine in underserved areas.\n  In 1977, they moved to Sacramento, where his parents were primary \ncare physicians for over 20 years. In Goodwin, his parents instilled \nboth perseverance and a strong work ethic, even leaving math problems \non the kitchen\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\ntable every day of the summer to supplement his school work. As a high \nschool student, he pulled all-nighters studying the dictionary to \nexpand his vocabulary and raise his SAT scores. His hard work paid off, \npropelling him to Stanford University, where he graduated Phi Beta \nKappa, and then to Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, who often say it ought to \nbe the results of your life that count, it ought to be your record that \ncounts, it ought to be your qualifications that count--Stanford \nUniversity, Phi Beta Kappa, Oxford University Rhodes scholar.\n  Liu's experience at Stanford and Oxford in student government, as a \nsummer school teacher for low-income youth, codirecting a K-12 youth \neducation conference, and studying philosophy encouraged him to pursue \nthe law and public service. In fact, Liu spent the next 2 years at the \nCorporation for National Service helping to launch the groundbreaking \nAmeriCorps program. He led the agency's effort to build community \nservice programs at colleges and universities throughout the country, \nand he traveled to over 30 States to encourage service among students.\n  The spark of public service and the law clearly ignited, Liu then \nwent on to attend Yale Law School. His stellar record of achievements \ncontinued at Yale, where Liu, along with a classmate, won the prize for \nthe best team argument in the moot court competition. Several of his \npapers won awards, and he earned prestigious clerkships on both the \ncourt of appeals and the Supreme Court.\n  What more does anyone want from a nominee? I can't even imagine, \nfrankly, even matching this.\n  In between the clerkships, Liu again chose public service, working at \nthe U.S. Department of Education, helping to implement a congressional \nappropriation to help turn around low-performing schools. Former South \nCarolina Governor Richard Riley, who was Secretary of Education at the \ntime, called Liu a `` `go-to' person''--in his words--``for important \nprojects and complex issues because of Liu's ability to see the big \npicture while also mastering the details of legal and policy \nproblems.'' What else do you want in a judge? He has an ``ability to \nsee the big picture while also mastering the details of legal and \npolicy problems.'' That is a quote from former South Carolina Governor \nRichard Riley.\n  After completing his Supreme Court clerkship, Liu joined the \nlitigation practice at O'Melveny & Myers, working on a wide range of \nbusiness matters while maintaining an active pro bono practice. So you \nhave a person who worked in government, private practice, and in \neducation. He earned high praise from his peers, including Walter \nDellinger, chair of O'Melveny's appellate practice, who said Liu was \n``widely respected in law practice for his superb legal ability, his \nsound judgment and warm collegiality.''\n  Then Liu joined the faculty at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law \nin 2003 and quickly established himself as an outstanding teacher as \nwell as a constitutional law and education law and policy expert.\n  Think about this. This is a young life, with all these experiences, \nincluding raising a family.\n  In the classroom, Liu is popular and well regarded. His introductory \nconstitutional law course is consistently one of the most \noversubscribed at Boalt. They want to hear him. They want to be in his \npresence to understand how the Constitution works and why this country \nis so special. In 2009, Liu received UC Berkeley's Distinguished \nTeaching Award, the university's most prestigious teaching excellence \naward, and was selected by that year's graduating class to be \ncommencement speaker.\n  Students often remark on Liu's efforts to illustrate the impact of \nthe law on everyday life. As anyone who has taken his con law class \nknows, to demonstrate that principle, Liu uses a wedding photo that \nshows him and his new bride, Ann O'Leary, the Irish American daughter \nof a social worker and union leader from Orono, ME. The two married in \nVirginia, a State that restricted interracial marriages until the \nSupreme Court invalidated the provision in the landmark 1967 case \nLoving v. Virginia.\n  Berkeley Law School Dean Christopher Edley describes Professor Liu \nthis way:\n\n       Goodwin Liu is an outstanding teacher, a brilliant scholar, \n     and an exceptional public servant.\n\n  Professor Liu is widely respected and has tremendous support across \nthe legal spectrum and from both sides of the political aisle.\n  I want to read what Ken Starr said about Goodwin Liu. Remember Ken \nStarr, the former Whitewater prosecutor? This is what he said. He wrote \nthis with Professor Amar in an op-ed piece that ran:\n\n       In our view, the traits that should weigh most heavily in \n     the evaluation of an extraordinarily qualified nominee, such \n     as Goodwin, are professional integrity and the ability to \n     discharge faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. \n     Because Goodwin possesses those qualities to the highest \n     degree, we are confident that he will serve on the Court of \n     Appeals not only fairly and competently, but with great \n     distinction. We support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n\n  I point out to my Republican friends that Ken Starr is one of your \nheroes. Come on, listen to what he says about Goodwin Liu. Don't come \nto the floor and say things about Goodwin that aren't so. Please come \nto your senses about Goodwin Liu.\n  There is another supporter I want to talk about too. This is former \nBush administration counsel, Richard Painter:\n\n       I have done my share of vetting judicial candidates and \n     fighting the confirmation wars. I didn't know much about Liu \n     before his nomination, but I became intrigued by the \n     attention the nomination generated, and I wondered if his \n     Republican critics were deploying the same tactics Democrats \n     used to attack Republican nominees. They were. If anything, \n     the attacks on Liu have been even more unfair. Based on my \n     own review of his record, I believe it is not even a close \n     question that Liu is an outstanding nominee whose views fall \n     well within the legal mainstream.\n\n  That conclusion is shared by leading conservatives who are familiar \nwith Liu's record. We even have a quote from Clint Bolick of the \nGoldwater Institute, one of the most conservative institutes. They \nendorsed Liu. This is what they said:\n\n       Because of his fresh, independent thinking and intellectual \n     honesty, as well as scholarly credentials and experience, he \n     will serve with distinction on this important court.\n\n  If that is not enough for my Republican friends, I have some more. I \nhave former Republican Congressman Bob Barr. He offered praise of \nProfessor Liu's ``commitment to the Constitution and to a fair criminal \njustice system.'' Barr also noted that ``[Liu's] views are shared by \nmany scholars, lawyers and public officials from across the ideological \nspectrum.''\n  Tom Campbell of California, a former Republican Congressman--someone \nwho actually attempted to run against me a couple of times for the \nSenate--wrote that ``Goodwin will bring scholarly distinction and a \nstrong reputation for integrity, fair-mindedness, and collegiality to \nthe Ninth Circuit.'' Reflecting on Liu's many years of work in serving \nthe public interest, Campbell also said, ``I am not surprised that \n[Liu] has again been called to public service.''\n  Yes, he has been called and nominated, but he won't be able to \ncontinue his extraordinary work unless we get 51 votes here. I know \nthere is some letter that is circulating that attacks Goodwin Liu \nagain. I hope my colleagues will read not just what I am saying but \nwhat leading Republicans are saying about how talented Goodwin Liu is. \nEvery single thing the man has done has turned to gold--every single \nthing he has done. He is best at everything he does. Why would we lose \nthis opportunity for the American people to have him serve them in this \nimportant capacity? I ask that rhetorically. I cannot imagine why \nanybody would vote no.\n  Here is another one. Professor Liu has even drawn praise from Brian \nJones, who served as General Counsel at the Department of Education \nafter Liu's tenure there. This is what Brian Jones, the General Counsel \nat the Department of Education, said:\n\n       During [2001 abd 2002], and even after he became a law \n     professor in 2003, [Goodwin] volunteered his time and \n     expertise on several occasions to help me and my staff sort \n     through legal issues he worked on during the previous \n     administration. In those interactions, Goodwin's efforts were \n     models of bipartisan cooperation. He brought useful knowledge \n     and careful lawyerly perspectives that helped our \n     administration to achieve its goals.\n       But I am convinced, based on his record and my own \n     experiences with him, that he is\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n     thoughtful, fair-minded and well qualified to be an appellate \n     judge.\n\n  I don't know why the Republicans filibustered this nomination. I \ndon't know why they filibustered this. I don't understand it.\n  Let's look at some of the organizations that back Goodwin. Of course, \nthose in the Asian American community are so proud, as they should be \nand as I am, because Goodwin is a Californian by choice.\n  In an op-ed published just today, former Secretary Norm Mineta, the \nfirst Asian Pacific American member of a President's Cabinet; that is, \nthe Bush Cabinet, wrote that ``Professor Liu is an extremely well-\nqualified nominee who has the intellectual capacity, experience, \ntemperament and integrity to be an excellent jurist.'' Mineta went on \nto warn that ``if Liu is not confirmed, Asian Pacific Americans may be \nleft with the impression that there continues to be a glass ceiling \nblocking Asian Pacific Americans from top-level leadership positions \nregardless of their qualifications.''\n  Again, Norm Mineta--and anybody who knows Norm knows what a wonderful \nhuman being he is. George W. Bush chose Norm Mineta, who is a Democrat, \nto be the Secretary of Transportation. Norm Mineta says that because \nProfessor Liu is so qualified and has so much intellectual capacity, \nsuch great experience, such great temperament, and so much integrity, \nhe warns that ``if Liu is not confirmed, Asian Pacific Americans may be \nleft with the impression that there continues to be a glass ceiling \nblocking Asian Pacific Americans from top-level leadership positions \nregardless of their qualifications.''\n  We also have a quote from the Committee of 100, a national nonprofit, \nnonpartisan membership organization that addresses issues concerning \nSino-U.S. relations affecting the Chinese American community. They \nwrote that ``[Liu's] ascension to the bench would signal that talented \npeople of all backgrounds are integral to our justice system.''\n  What we do here matters. It matters whom we send to these important \npositions. We have someone here who will break down barriers, but, do \nyou know what, that would not be enough. He has to be great, he has to \nbe outstanding, and he is all those things. Yet we are very nervous \nabout getting 51 votes. We are very nervous that politics is being \nplayed. We don't know what is going to happen at the end of the day. \nThat is why I am taking this time, because I want my colleagues to know \nthat if they cast an ``aye'' vote, it should bring a smile to their \nfaces, and they should feel good in their hearts and their minds that \nthey are doing the right thing.\n  Twenty-five prominent Asian-Pacific Americans who serve as general \ncounsel to Fortune 1000 companies and other large companies wrote:\n\n       Professor Liu has earned praise from conservatives and \n     progressives alike for his sense of fairness, open-\n     mindedness, and integrity. His intellect and qualifications \n     are beyond dispute. Indeed, Professor Liu has been rated \n     unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the American Bar \n     Association.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       It is worth noting that Professor Liu, if confirmed, would \n     become the only Asian Pacific American active appellate court \n     judge in the Ninth Circuit, and only the second Asian Pacific \n     American active appellate court judge nationwide. Especially \n     given the large number of Asian Pacific Americans in \n     California, Hawaii, and other states, covered by the Ninth \n     Circuit--\n\n  And I said before I think it is 40 percent of Asian Americans who \nlive in this particular area that the court covers--\n\n       the lack of an Asian Pacific American judge in this circuit \n     is striking. We feel that Professor Liu would serve our \n     country well and with distinction.\n\n  Professor Liu has drawn law enforcement support, including the \nCalifornia Correctional Peace Officers Association, as well as the \nNational Asian Peace Officers Association, which noted that Professor \nLiu has ``earned the respect of [its] members and the large audience of \nthe law enforcement community.''\n  David Lum, the president of National Asian Peace Officers \nAssociation, went on to compliment Liu as ``a person of integrity, \ndedication, passion, enthusiasm, and law and order.''\n  Liu has also received support from the business community, including \nfrom the prominent business executives with whom Liu served on the \nStanford University board of trustees. In a letter of support, Liu's \nfellow trustees wrote the following:\n\n       Across a wide range of complex issues, Goodwin routinely \n     asks thoughtful and incisive questions. He is good at \n     thinking independently and zeroing in on important issues \n     that need attention. Even in a room full of highly \n     accomplished leaders, Goodwin is impressive. He is \n     insightful, constructive, and a good listener. Moreover, he \n     possesses a remarkably even temperament; his demeanor is \n     unfailingly respectful and open-minded, never dogmatic or \n     inflexible. Given these qualities, it was no surprise that he \n     was asked to chair the board's Special Committee on \n     Investment Responsibility after serving just one year of his \n     five-year term.\n\n  Again and again, there is a thread running through this man's life at \n40. That is how old he is, 40--40 years old. Everything this man has \ndone, this young man has been unbelievably--I want to say unimaginable \nat his age that he has done all he has done.\n  They continue:\n\n       In short, Goodwin's strengths are exactly what we expect in \n     a judge: objectivity, independence, collegiality--\n\n  This is what the Stanford trustees say--\n\n     respect for differing views, sound judgment. Goodwin \n     possesses these qualities on top of the brilliant legal \n     acumen that is well-established by his professional record \n     and the judgment of those most familiar with his scholarly \n     work.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  The President of Stanford University, along with two presidents \nemeritus, wrote to endorse Liu's nomination. They said that Liu ``has \nepitomized the goal of Stanford's founders, which was to promote the \npublic welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and \ncivilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by law, and \ninculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government \nas derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness.''\n  This eloquence that is coming out of people's mouths about Goodwin--\nhonestly, I have stood here many times, and I have spoken on behalf of \nmany nominees. I honestly have not had a situation where the eloquence \nand passion of the supporters has come through as it has for this young \nman. He is a blessing, honestly. I feel at this moment we need to back \nhim--all of us--and bring this country together around someone who \nepitomizes the American dream.\n  I want to speak about, as I wind down, newspapers across the country \nthat weighed in to support Liu's nomination.\n  The Washington Post remarked that:\n\n       Mr. Liu has sterling credentials that earned him the \n     highest rating from the American Bar Association. And there \n     have been no allegations of impropriety to disqualify him \n     from serving. The brilliant professor [they call him], who \n     just turned 40 in October, testified that he would not allow \n     his academic musings to interfere with the duties of a lower-\n     court judge to follow precedent. He should be confirmed and \n     given the opportunity to demonstrate that he can do that.\n\n  I was going to ask unanimous consent because I know Senator Tester \nhas been waiting for 40 minutes--I ask the Senator, does he need about \n5 or 7 minutes in morning business?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Tester be able to \nspeak for 7 minutes in morning business before we get to Senator \nGrassley; is that acceptable?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator is done, that is OK.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am almost done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am closing in the next 2 minutes.\n  The Sacramento Bee noted that Liu would add luster to any court. The \nLos Angeles Times joined the New York Times in endorsing his \nconfirmation.\n  We heard from Professor Liu when I opened, and I am going to close by \nsaying this: When we ask people in this country to give back to this \nNation and they step to the plate and they want to give their talent to \nthis Nation and they are supremely qualified and they bring with them \nmainstream views, mainstream endorsements, bipartisan endorsements from \nthe progressive community to Ken Starr, for goodness' sake, give this \nman an up-or-down vote and do not say that you believe that judges \ndeserve an up-or-down\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nvote when you are in the majority and suddenly say they do not deserve \nit now.\n  I hope we will see the 60 votes for cloture and then the 51 votes for \nconfirmation. I am privileged to have had this opportunity to share the \nstory of Professor Goodwin Liu with my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I think this is appropriate. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Debit Interchange Fees\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank Senator Boxer and Senator \nGrassley for their generosity. I am not here to talk about Goodwin Liu. \nI am going to talk about the debate over debit interchange.\n  In a matter of weeks, the government is planning to price-fix debit \ncard swipe fees below--below--the cost of doing business. They are \ngoing to price-fix debit card swipe fees below the cost of doing \nbusiness.\n  On the surface, the plan might make sense. But peel back the layers \nand we will see why a whole bunch of folks out there on both sides of \nthe aisle are raising a flag.\n  I am not asking to repeal the rules or even change them. I am asking \nthat we take a closer look so we can get the information to understand \nthe impacts, both intended and unintended. I have listened to the \nfeedback my colleagues have shared on this issue. I have heard their \nconcerns.\n  While it is important to stop and examine the impact of limiting \ndebit card swipe fees, some have said 2 years is simply too long. I am \nwilling to adjust my legislation to address those concerns. Senator \nCorker and I have decided to shorten the timeframe from 24 months to 15 \nmonths.\n  Here is how the 15 months is going to be used. Fifteen months will \nprovide the agencies with 6 months for a study. It will provide the \nFederal Reserve 6 months to rewrite the rules using that study. It will \nallow 3 months to implement the final rules. Fifteen months is the bare \nminimum to get this study right, and we want to get it right.\n  For me, stopping and studying the unintended consequences of \ngovernment price-fixing has everything to do with access to capital for \nsmall businesses and consumers in rural America. Make no mistake, the \nbig banks are going to do fine no matter what. So I opposed bailing \nthem out. All but two banks in my entire State are considered small \ncommunity banks and will be affected by this debit interchange price-\nfixing rule.\n  All of Montana's credit unions will be affected as well. They will \nfeel the pinch, and they will lose because the government is going to \nset a price for doing business that does not cover their costs.\n  Let me say it again. The Federal Government is going to tell these \nfolks what price to set on interchange rates, and it will not be enough \nfor the little guys to be able to compete in the marketplace.\n  Let me ask this: How would a big box retailer react if we set the \nprice of T-shirts below what it cost to make, ship, and market them? \nYou can bet the retailers would be up in arms--and rightfully so--about \nthe government setting prices and telling them how to run their \nbusiness.\n  Some have suggested that the only way to have a competitive \nmarketplace is by capping rates. That kind of reasoning does not make \nsense to a farmer like me. When we slant the playing field against \nsmall banks, they cannot compete with the big guys. If they go under, \nthe businesses and consumers who rely on them are left hanging. That is \nwhy a populist farmer from rural America is on the side of common sense \nin this debate, and I am on the side of Montana small businesses and \nconsumers.\n  Last Thursday, I asked Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke about the impact of \ngovernment price fixing as it applies to rural America. He is not the \nonly major regulator who has raised serious questions about whether the \nsupposed exemption for small banks will work. He is not the only one. \nLast week, Chairman Bernanke said ``it could result in some smaller \nbanks being less profitable and failing.''\n  Let me repeat that, in the words of Chairman Bernanke, the small \nbanks in Montana and across America could fail under this planned rule.\n  What does it mean if more banks fail? It means more consolidation in \nthe banking industry. How in the world is that good for consumers? How \nis it better for a small business in Glendive, MT, to have to ask a \nbank headquartered on Wall Street for a loan instead of going to the \nbank on Main Street? Are big banks going to provide the same level of \nservice as community banks? I think not. Will they be able to evaluate \nthe prospects of a small business by only looking at data, without \nunderstanding the communities they serve? Will big banks create strong \nrelationships with the people in rural America? Will they do that? How \nabout those folks who are looking to start a small business?\n  We know credit unions are one of the few financial institutions to \never consider going into Indian Country to help bring investment to \nsome of the most impoverished areas in this country. Do you think if \nthese small folks go under, there will be anyone else willing to lend \non reservations? No way. No way.\n  During last week's hearing, FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair said this new \nrule is ``going to reduce revenues at a number of smaller banks, and \nthey will have to pass that on to customers in terms of higher fees.'' \nRural America--especially in this fragile economy--cannot afford that.\n  Today I want to share why a few businesses in Montana are opposed to \ngovernment price fixing. Their stories are not uncommon. They are quite \nordinary.\n  Doris Rocheleau runs Doris's Day Care in Great Falls, MT. She has \nbeen doing business for nearly 30 years with a community bank. She \ntells me she is struggling to make ends meet, as many small businesses \nare, and paying more in monthly checking would hurt her very much.\n  Also, in Great Falls there is a small business owner named Mark \nVoyles. Mark owns Y-Not Trucking. His reason for supporting my \namendment to stop and study the government limit is because he \n``doesn't want to pay more fees on his money in his bank.''\n  Cabela's is a large retailer, a popular sporting goods store in \nBillings, MT. They are wary of the Durbin amendment because they offer \ntheir customers a reward credit card. They have real concerns with \ngovernment price controls and what they will mean for their ability to \nmeet the needs of their customers.\n  The bottom line is this: Allowing the government to price-fix debit \ncard swipe fees is a slippery slope. Maybe that is why my amendment is \nto stop and study the impact of this proposed rule. It has broad \nbipartisan support from folks such as the National Education \nAssociation and Americans for Tax Reform--different sides of the \neconomic equation. Then there are nonprofit organizations, such as \nRural Dynamics in Montana. Rural Dynamics serves the entire State of \nMontana--thousands of folks every year. Their mission? To help \nindividual people and families achieve economic independence, to make \nsure folks can earn, keep, and grow their assets to reach economic \nindependence.\n  Rural Dynamics is a well-respected organization. Many of their \nstrategies involve helping Montanans manage their assets and save for \ntheir future, enabling them access to banking services. Anything that \nwould result in undue higher fees would take their mission backwards.\n  Rural Dynamics says simply: We want to understand the long-term risk \nassociated with limiting debit card swipe fees, how it will impact \nrural America, how it will affect economic independence.\n  Just as convincing as the small businesses in my State are the \nadministration experts who have been tasked with trying to make this \nrule on debit interchange work. Chairman Bernanke last week said he is \nstill not sure whether the small issuer exemption would work, saying:\n\n       There are market forces that would work against the \n     exemption.\n\n  Sheila Bair, Chairwoman of the FDIC, raised similar concerns about \nthe workability of the small issuer exemption. So has Chairwoman Debbie \nMatz of the National Credit Union Administration. So has the Conference \nof\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nState Banking Supervisors. So has the National Association of State \nCredit Union Supervisors.\n  This represents all--all--of the regulators of the small financial \ninstitutions at the State and national level--every one of them. These \nare the folks who are tasked with keeping our community banks and \ncredit unions vibrant and strong, ensuring these institutions are well \ncapitalized and making sound loans. Let me say again, all of them--all \nof them--have raised concerns about the impact of this rule on the \nsmall financial institutions they supervise.\n  These regulators are not convinced these rules are going to be able \nto work in the way they were intended. My friends on the other side of \nthis debate continue to attack these folks. They have said they are \nshills for the big banks; that they do not understand market forces; \nthat they don't understand small institutions. This couldn't be further \nfrom the truth.\n  And no one--no one--has been able to explain to me why studying this \nissue to make sure these rules do what they say they are supposed to do \nis a bad idea. To stop and to study. That is what the bipartisan bill I \nam sponsoring does. To stop and to study the unintended consequences \nfor rural America and this country as a whole. If this rule goes into \neffect, the consumers and businesses who rely on community banks and \ncredit unions--oh, yeah--are going to pay the price. And we can bet \nmany retailers won't be eager to pass the few pennies they save down to \nyou. Yet Doris Rochileau's monthly banking fees will go up. Mark Voyles \nwill have to pay more to keep his money in his bank. The folks at \nCabela's will be asking: What is next? And will it hurt their loyal \ncustomers? Thousands of Montanans who rely on Rural Dynamics will have \nmore hurdles to jump over to reach economic independence.\n  These stories hit home. They are the stories I tell when someone \nasks: Why would a populist farmer be against the government telling the \nsmall banks that drive our economy how to do business? I am not asking \nto repeal this provision; far from it. I am asking us to do our \nhomework in this body, to make sure we understand exactly what it means \nfor Montana and all of America.\n  With that, I want to express my thanks to the good Senator from Iowa \none more time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak on the \nnomination of Goodwin Liu to be Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit.\n  I have said many times over the past 2 weeks--and perhaps for longer \nthan the last 2 weeks--that by any fair measure we are moving judicial \nnominees at a very brisk pace. This month alone, we confirmed 7 judges \nin 10 days. In the short time we have been in session this year, we \nhave confirmed 24 judges. That is a rate, almost, of one judge every \nother day. This year, the committee has favorably reported 51 percent \nof President Obama's nominees, yet it seems the more we work with the \nmajority on filling vacancies, the more complaints we hear.\n  Furthermore, as we work together to confirm consensus nominees, we \nare met with the majority's insistence that we turn to controversial \nnominees, such as the one before us today--Goodwin Liu--because this \nseems to be the most controversial of President Obama's nominees we \nhave had to this point. I have pledged, and indeed I have demonstrated, \ncooperation in moving forward on consensus nominations. There is no \ndoubt that Mr. Liu does not fall into the category of being a consensus \nnominee.\n  My objections to this nominee can be summarized in five areas of \nconcern: his controversial writings and speeches, an activist judicial \nphilosophy, his lack of judicial temperament, his troublesome testimony \nand lack of candor before the committee, and his limited experience.\n  Mr. Liu describes his writings as critical, inventive, and \nprovocative, and that is what they are. He states he is simply a \ncommentator and his role is merely to poke, prod, and critique. The \nproblem I have with that is his legal scholarship goes well beyond \nsimple commentary. The nominee argues the 14th amendment creates a \nconstitutional right to some minimum level of public welfare benefits. \nThat is a real reach. He has said:\n\n       The duty of government cannot be reduced to simply \n     providing the basic necessities of life. . . . The main \n     pillars of the agenda would include . . . expanded health \n     insurance, child care, transportation subsidies, job \n     training, and a robust earned income tax credit.\n\n  There is no doubt those may be policy issues Congress ought to deal \nwith, but it is a real stretch to say that they are constitutionally \nprotected rights.\n  Mr. Liu is a strong proponent of affirmative action and the \nconstitutionality of affirmative action. Celebrating the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, he said:\n\n     . . . [a]chieving racial diversity throughout our leading \n     [educational] institutions is not merely constitutionally \n     permissible, but morally required.\n\n  He believes bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional. The nominee \nwas one of several law professors who filed a brief with the California \nSupreme Court in a suit seeking to have the California same-sex \nmarriage prohibition declared unconstitutional.\n  These statements, just a sample of his works, are not merely a \nscholarly reflection on the state of law. Instead, they are a \nprescription for change--big change. He stated, following President \nObama's election in an interview with NPR's ``Weekend Edition'':\n\n       Whereas I think in the last seven or eight years we had \n     mostly been playing defense in the sense of trying to prevent \n     as many--in our view--bad things from happening. Now we have \n     the opportunity to actually get our ideas and the progressive \n     vision of the Constitution and of law and policy into \n     practice.\n\n  Mr. Liu holds a view of the Constitution that can only be described \nas an activist judicial philosophy. The centerpiece of his judicial \nphilosophy--a theory he describes as ``constitutional fidelity''--\nsounds nice until you learn what it actually means. Here is what he \nmeans by fidelity:\n\n       The Constitution should be interpreted in ways that adapt \n     its principles and its text to the challenges and conditions \n     of our society in every single generation.\n\n  Continuing on, he states:\n\n       On this approach, the Constitution is understood to grow \n     and evolve over time as the conditions, needs, and values of \n     our society change.\n\n  That is not a far cry from the unwritten constitution of Great \nBritain, where the Parliament is supreme and makes a determination from \ntime to time on what the policies are, as opposed to in this country \nwhere the natural law--or the laws that are the rights we have given to \nus by our Creator, not by government--are the basis of our law.\n  When I questioned the nominee at his hearing regarding his position, \nhe stated his book respects the notion that the text of the \nConstitution and the principles it expresses are totally fixed and \nenduring. I must admit some confusion with this contradiction. Either \nthe text and the principles are fixed and enduring or they are \nadaptable--something that grows and evolves, as it happens with the \nConstitution of Great Britain. Mr. Liu is, apparently, comfortable with \nthis contradiction. I am not. It is a pattern I find throughout his \ntestimony.\n  I am concerned by his apparent lack of appreciation for the proper \nrole of a judge in our system of checks and balances. His philosophy \nleads to an inevitable expansion of the power of the judiciary. For \nexample, according to Mr. Liu, courts should play a role in creating \nand expanding constitutional welfare rights. He argues that once a \nlegislative body creates a welfare program, it is the proper role of \nthe courts to grasp the meaning and the purpose for that welfare \nbenefit. He states the courts can recognize welfare rights by \n``invalidat[ing] statutory eligibility requirements or strengthen[ing] \nprocedural protections against the withdrawal of benefits.'' That is \nforthrightly an attack on the legislative branch of government, and on \nits power to make statute and law. The courts are supposed to be \ninterpreting, not making law.\n  The nominee also seems to favor a social needs-based view of living \nconstitutionalism. His scholarly work argues that judicial \ndecisionmaking should be shaped by contemporary social needs and norms, \nrather than the certainty of the Constitution. Notably, he has said:\n\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\n\n     . . . the problem for courts is to determine, at the moment \n     of decision, whether our collective values on a given issue \n     have converged to a degree that they can be persuasively \n     crystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine.\n\n  It is just as if what the writers of the Constitution in 1787 thought \nought to be the basic law of this land means nothing today. So as you \nknow, I think this is very troublesome. Our constitutional framework \nputs the legislative function in the Congress, not the courts. It is \nthe legislative function, through the political process, where the \npeople rule, that determine when a particular value is to become part \nof our law. This is not the duty of judges. The judiciary is limited to \ndeciding cases and controversy, not establishing public policy.\n  I would note further that this view of constitutional interpretation \ndoes not rely on the acts of the legislature or on the precedents \nestablished by higher courts. Rather, it is based on a concept of what \nhe prefers to call ``evolving norms.'' Furthermore, as he testified \nbefore the committee, it is those ``evolving norms'' that inform the \nSupreme Court's elaboration of constitutional doctrine.\n  Mr. Liu tried to sound like a mainstream jurist when he stated the \nduty of a circuit judge was to faithfully follow the Supreme Court's \ninstructions on matters of constitutional interpretation. Who is going \nto argue with that? Again, that sounds nice, doesn't it, but what does \nit mean? If we accept his premise that the Supreme Court's instructions \nare based upon evolving norms, it follows that such ``evolving norms'' \nwill shape the circuit courts' decisions as well. This activist theory \nleads to a judicial system substituting the whims of individual judges \nover the text and original meaning of the U.S. Constitution. This is \nnot the duty of any circuit judge.\n  Mr. Liu's legal views and judicial philosophy are clearly out of the \nmainstream. A small example illustrates this point. I questioned four \nof President Obama's district judge nominees who followed Mr. Liu on \nthe day of his hearing. I asked each of them concerning a specific \npoint about Mr. Liu's philosophy. Each and every one of them flatly \nrejected Mr. Liu's position.\n  This included his view on judges considering ``collective values'' \nwhen interpreting the Constitution; on using foreign law; on \ninterpreting the Constitution in ways that adapt its principles and its \ntext; and on considering ``public values and social understandings'' \nwhen interpreting the Constitution.\n  Based on his out-of-the-mainstream views, it is no surprise that his \nnomination is opposed by so many. Included in that opposition are 42 \ndistrict attorneys serving in the State of California. They are \nconcerned, among other things, about his views on criminal law, capital \npunishment, and the role of the Federal courts in second-guessing State \ndecisions.\n  My third area of concern is that the nominee has made a number of \ncritical statements which indicate a lack of judicial temperament. He \nhas been very openly critical of the current Supreme Court.\n  In one article, he said that the holding in Bush v. Gore was \n``utterly lacking in any legal principle.'' He has claimed that the \ncurrent Court as a whole is unprincipled, saying that ``if you look \nacross the entire run of cases, you see a fairly consistent pattern \nwhere respect for precedent goes by the wayside when it gets in the way \nof result.''\n  Mr. Liu was highly critical of the nomination of Justice Roberts. He \npublished an article on Bloomberg.com entitled ``Roberts Would Swing \nthe Supreme Court to the Right.'' In that article, he acknowledged that \nRoberts was qualified, saying ``[t]here's no doubt Roberts has a \nbrilliant legal mind. . . . But a Supreme Court nominee must be \nevaluated on more than legal intellect.'' He then voiced concerns that \n``with remarkable consistency throughout his career, Roberts ha[d] \napplied his legal talent to further the cause of the far right.'' He \nalso spoke very disparagingly of Justice Roberts' conservative beliefs:\n\n       [b]efore becoming a judge, he belonged to the Republican \n     National Lawyers Association and the National Legal Center \n     for the Public Interest, whose mission is to promote (among \n     other things) ``free enterprise,'' ``private ownership of \n     property,'' and ``limited government.'' These are code words \n     for an ideological agenda hostile to environmental, \n     workplace, and consumer protections.\n\n  Let's think about what he just said there, about Judge Roberts, now \nChief Justice Roberts. He said private ownership of property, limited \ngovernment, and free enterprise are code words for an ideological \nagenda hostile to environment, workplace and consumer protections? Does \nhe think we are Communist-run China, that the government runs \neverything, that their system of government is a better one? When they \nbring online a coal-fired plant every week? Plants that pollute the air \nand put more carbon dioxide into the air than we do in the United \nStates? Where children are dying because the food is poisoned and \nconsumers aren't protected? Where every miner is in jeopardy of losing \ntheir lives? That is how far off base this nominee is when he refers to \nfree enterprise, private ownership of property, and limited government \nas being bad. But if you get government more involved, as they do in \nChina, it is somehow a better place?\n  The nominee has been very publicly critical also of Justice Alito in \nparticular. He believes it is a valid criticism of Justice Alito to say \nthat ``[h]e approaches law in a formalistic, mechanical way abstracted \nfrom human experience.'' And we are all familiar with Mr. Liu's \nscathing attack at Justice Alito's confirmation hearing. When asked \nabout his testimony, Mr. Liu admitted the language was unduly harsh, \nprovocative, unnecessary, and was a case of poor judgment. That is one \nstatement of Mr. Liu with which I can I agree.\n  I can appreciate that Mr. Liu now understands the unfortunate \nlanguage he uses. The trouble I have with this, however, is that it \nshows that even when stepping out of the academic world, the nominee \npromotes extreme views and intemperate language. Even if I accept his \nrationale for the tone of his work in the academic world, that does not \nexplain his congressional testimony. That was one opportunity where he \ncould demonstrate a reasoned, temperate approach. Yet he failed that \ntest. I think it may also indicate what we might expect from a Judge \nLiu, should he be confirmed--the same thing. To me, that is an \nunacceptable outcome.\n  The fourth major area of concern is Mr. Liu's testimony and candor \nbefore the committee, which was troubling at times and lacked \ncredibility. Even before he appeared before the committee, the nominee \nhad difficulty providing the committee, with materials required by his \nquestionnaire. As Senator Sessions said at the time:\n\n       At best, this nominee's extraordinary disregard for the \n     Committee's constitutional role demonstrates incompetence; at \n     worst, it creates the impression that he knowingly attempted \n     to hide his most controversial work from the Committee.\n\n  During his testimony, the nominee said, in reference to his past \nlegal writings, ``whatever I may have written in the books and the \narticles would have no bearing on my action as a judge.'' Oh? Trying to \npaint himself as a judicial conservative, the nominee attempted to walk \naway from his previous positions. He tried to distance himself on the \nproper role of a judge, on the use of foreign law, on the \nappropriateness of racial quotas and from his previous views on free \nenterprise and private ownership of property. Even the Washington Post \nfound his testimony a bit hard to believe. The Post's editorial stated:\n\n       Mr. Liu is unlikely to shunt aside completely the ideas and \n     approaches he has spent years developing. But the real \n     problem, of course, is not that he adheres to a particular \n     judicial philosophy, but that he--like so many others before \n     him--feels the need to pretend not to have one.\n\n  We have often heard the term ``confirmation conversion'' applied to \nnominees who appear to have a change of legal philosophy when they are \nnominated to a Federal judgeship. As I review the record, I think this \nnominee has taken that concept a step further--I would use the phrase \n``confirmation chameleon.'' It seems to me that Mr. Liu is willing to \nadapt his testimony to what he thinks is most appropriate at the time.\n  I have discussed other contradictions already, but let me give you a \nclear example. Senator Cornyn of Texas asked him about his troubling \nrecord contained in his work-product that expressed opinions on issues \nsuch as the\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\ndeath penalty, same-sex marriage, and welfare rights. Senator Cornyn \nthen stated ``You are now saying, `Wipe the slate clean because none of \nthat has any relevance whatsoever to how I would conduct myself as a \njudge if confirmed by the Senate.' Is that correct?'' Mr. Liu \nresponded, ``That is correct, Senator.''\n  A few minutes later I asked him, ``If we were to, let us just say, \nwipe the slate clean as to your academic writings and career, what is \nleft to justify your confirmation?'' The nominee responded, ``I would \nhope that you would not wipe my slate clean, as it were. You know, I am \nwhat I am.''\n  Mr. Liu cannot have it both ways. Either his record stays with him or \nwe wipe the slate clean. Perhaps in the long run it doesn't matter, \nbecause either way it leaves us with an individual who should not be \ngiven a lifetime appointment. If you include his record as a law \nprofessor, then we are left with the evidence of a left-leaning, \njudicial activist. If you do not include it, then we are left with a 2-\nyear associate with law clerk experience and little else.\n  That leads me to my final point. I am concerned about the nominee's \nlack of experience. After graduating from law school in 1998, he \nclerked for Judge David S. Tatel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. When his clerkship ended, Mr. Liu became special \nassistant to the Deputy Secretary of Education for 1 year.\n  In 2000, he worked as a contract attorney for the law firm of Nixon \nPeabody, LLP, where he ``assisted with legal research and writing.'' \nFrom 2000 to 2001, the nominee clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \non the Supreme Court. After his Supreme Court clerkship, he became an \nassociate at O'Melveny & Myers, where he remained for less than 2 \nyears. According to his questionnaire, he appeared in court only \n``occasionally.'' He also reported that his other work as an attorney \nhas not involved court appearances. He has not tried any cases to \nverdict, judgment, or final decision, Since 2003, the nominee has been \na full-time law professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, and in 2008 he \nbecame associate dean.\n  After his nomination last year, the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary gave Mr. Liu the rating ``Unanimous Well-Qualified.'' \nI am somewhat perplexed by this rating. According to the standing \ncommittee's explanation of its standards for rating judicial nominees, \n``a prospective nominee to the federal bench ordinarily should have at \nleast twelve years' experience in the practice of law.''\n  Further, ``the Committee recognizes that substantial courtroom and \ntrial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is important.'' At the time \nof his nomination and rating, the nominee had graduated from law school \nless than 12 years prior. He has been a member of a State bar only \nsince May 1999. As noted above, he has no trial experience and has \nnever been a judge.\n  I will conclude with this thought. Given his record and testimony, I \ndo not believe the nominee has an understanding and appreciation of the \nproper role of a judge. I believe, if confirmed, he will bring a \npersonal agenda and political ideology into the courtroom.\n  It is ironic that in commenting on the Roberts nomination, Mr. Liu \nsad ``the nomination is a seismic event that threatens to deepen the \nNation's red-blue divide. Instead of choosing a consensus candidate \n[the President] has opted for a conservative thoroughbred who, if \nconfirmed, will likely swing the Court sharply to the right on many \ncritical issues.''\n  If confirmed, I am concerned that Mr. Liu will deeply divide the \nNinth Circuit and move that court even further to the left--if that is \npossible. If confirmed, his activist ideology and judicial philosophy \nwould seep well beyond the Berkeley campus--and it seems that is \ndifficult. Sitting on the Ninth Circuit, his opinions and rulings would \nhave far reaching effect on individuals and businesses throughout the \nnine-State circuit, including places like Bozeman, MT; Boise, ID, and \nAnchorage, AK.\n  For the reasons I have articulated--No. 1, his controversial writings \nand speeches; No. 2, an activist judicial philosophy; No. 3, his lack \nof judicial temperament; No. 4, his lack of candor before the \ncommittee, and No. 5, his limited experience--as well as many other \nconcerns which I have not expressed today, I shall oppose this \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent I might be given permission \nto speak for one-half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have been on the Judiciary Committee \nfor 18 years. I have never heard a harsher statement about a brilliant \nyoung man than I have just heard. During those 18 years, I have seen \nthe standards for appointment change rather dramatically. I have seen a \nsearch engine develop on the Republican side to go out and find \nanything and everything an individual may have written, and then \ncompile a dossier, almost like one would of a criminal, and then \ncharacterize and depict the individual in the terms they wish to do.\n  I regret this, and I hope to lay out how the Democratic side, with a \nnumber of nominees, has not done the same thing. But to see a young man \nwith the credentials Goodwin Liu carries belittled in the way he has \nbeen belittled in these hearings and also on this floor really upsets \nme.\n  This man is a professor of law and the former associate dean of one \nof the 10 best law schools in America. He is a nationally recognized \nconstitutional scholar. He is a truly brilliant legal mind. I have \nevery confidence in his intellectual firepower, his integrity, and his \neven-keeled demeanor, and I believe it will make him a fine judge.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little about his background. He was born \nin Augusta, GA. He is the son of Taiwanese immigrants who were \nrecruited to America to provide medical services in rural areas.\n  He attended public schools in Clewiston, FL, and in Sacramento, CA. \nHe first struggled to learn English and master vocabulary but, \nultimately, he graduated co-valedictorian from Rio Americano High \nSchool in Sacramento.\n  He was admitted to Stanford University, my alma mater. He graduated \nPhi Beta Kappa. He received numerous awards for his contributions to \nthe university, and he was elected co-president of the student body. \nPretty good.\n  He received a Rhodes scholarship. He graduated with a master's degree \nfrom Oxford University. He attended Yale Law School. Once again, he was \nat the top of his class. He was editor of the Yale Law Journal. He won \nthe prize for the best team argument in the moot court competition and \nwon awards for the best academic paper by a third-year law student and \nthe best paper in the field of tax law.\n  He received prestigious judicial clerkships with Circuit Judge David \nTatel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and then with \nRuth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He worked in the Department of Education as a special assistant to \nthe Deputy Secretary of the United States of the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  He spent 2 years in private practice at O'Melveny & Myers, which is a \nprestigious law firm--not a minor firm, a major firm--where he handled \ncommercial matters, including antitrust, insurance, and class action \ncases. Appellate law comprised roughly half his practice.\n  Finally, in 2003, he accepted a tenure-track position on the faculty \nof Boalt Hall School of Law. At Boalt, he quickly established himself \nas one of our most astute legal scholars, with specialties in \nconstitutional law, the Supreme Court, education law, and education \npolicy.\n  He published articles in the Yale Law Journal, the Stanford Law \nReview, the California Law Review, the Iowa Law Review, the Harvard Law \nand Policy Review, and many other academic journals.\n  He received the Education Law Association's Steven S. Goldberg Award \nfor Distinguished Scholarship in Education Law, and he was elected into \nmembership of the American Law Institute.\n  In 2008, his colleagues on the faculty of Boalt selected him as their \nassociate dean. In 2009, the University of California at Berkeley \nawarded him their Distinguished Teaching Award, the highest award for \nteaching across the entire university.\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\n  I believe he holds a deep appreciation for what opportunities our \ncountry affords. I believe his background and his legal prowess are \nfitting for him to become an appellate court judge. When one speaks \nwith him about his family and upbringing, one gains a sense of him as \nsomeone who loves this country and bears an abiding belief that ours is \na land of opportunity and a place where everyone has a chance to learn \nand grow and to thrive.\n  Some of my colleagues have questioned a number of his writings and \nhis temperament, and what figures very formidably, as I have talked to \nthe Republican side, is particularly testimony he gave on the \nconfirmation of Justice Alito. What he did was provide a long analysis \nof Alito's opinions and then at the end he used a rhetorical flourish \nthat was, quite frankly, misguided. He strung together a series of \nfacts from cases Alito had decided and then made a statement that I \nbelieve he very much regrets. It was over the top. But he has \nacknowledged it, he has been forthright, and he has apologized.\n  Before the Senate Judiciary Committee he said:\n\n       What troubles me most is that the passage has an ad hominem \n     quality that is unfair and hurtful. I regret having written \n     this passage.\n\n  He said if he had to do it again: ``I would have deleted it.''\n  It was a mistake--no question about it--but a mistake should not \ncolor this man's entire record.\n  I wish to read from two letters we received in the Senate from people \nwho knew and know Goodwin Liu well, not just for a moment but for \nyears. The first was sent to us jointly by three successive presidents \nof Stanford University. I have never seen a letter on behalf of a \nnominee from three different presidents of a university of the quality \nof Stanford.\n  Donald Kennedy was president when Goodwin Liu was a student at \nStanford. He worked with Liu at the Haas Center for Public Service and \nwas present when Liu won not only the Dinkelspiel Award, which is the \nuniversity's highest award for undergraduate service, but also the \nJames W. Lyons Dean Award for Service and the President's Award for \nAcademic Excellence.\n  Gerhard Casper is president emeritus of Stanford and currently \nprovost at the University of Chicago. He knows Liu both as a Stanford \nalum as well as a colleague in the field of constitutional law. He is \nfamiliar with Liu, as, in his own words, ``a measured interpreter of \nthe Constitution.''\n  Finally, John Hennessy is Stanford's current President. He describes \nLiu as insightful, hardworking, collegial, and of the highest ethical \nstandards.\n  Together, these three presidents of the university wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       Goodwin Liu as a student, scholar and trustee, has \n     epitomized the goal of Stanford's founders, which was to \n     promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on \n     behalf of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings \n     of liberty, regulated by law, and inculcating love and \n     reverence for the great principles of government as derived \n     from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty, and the \n     pursuit of happiness.\n\n  It is a fitting and, I believe, an accurate tribute.\n  We have one of the most brilliant legal scholars of our time. There \nis a majority here to confirm him. We know that. But, unfortunately, \nthe minority is trying to use cloture to prevent us from ever casting a \nvote to confirm him.\n  Let me turn to another letter. This one is from eight top executives \nof major American companies, including Yahoo, General Atlantic, Morgan \nStanley, and Google. They have all worked closely with Liu on the \nStanford board of trustees. They wrote to say the following:\n\n       Even in a room full of highly accomplished leaders, Goodwin \n     is impressive. He is insightful, constructive, and a good \n     listener. Moreover, he possesses a remarkably even \n     temperament. His demeanor is unfailingly respectful and open-\n     minded, never dogmatic or inflexible.\n\n  Goodwin's strengths, they said:\n\n     . . . are exactly what we expect in a judge: objectivity, \n     independence, respect for differing views, sound judgment.\n\n  We know the American Bar Association has unanimously rated him ``well \nqualified'' for the U.S. court of appeals, and his background is \nsimilar to many who have been confirmed to the circuit court in the \npast. But some on the other side, nevertheless, say he is too young and \nhe doesn't have judicial experience, or his credentials are not right.\n  For those who ask for a judicial record to review, I would ask, what \nabout Edward Chen? We considered Judge Chen's nomination last week. He \nwas a district court nominee with a 10-year judicial record. He had \nwritten more than 350 published opinions, and the minority didn't \ncriticize one. But most in the minority voted against his nomination \nanyway. So a judicial record doesn't get it done.\n  Then there is the criticism based on age or other qualifications. But \nLiu's qualifications surpass those of many we have confirmed under \nRepublican Presidents.\n  Since 1980, the Senate has confirmed 14 circuit court nominees who \nwere under the age of 40. That means they were all younger than Liu is \nnow. All 14 were nominated and confirmed during Republican \nadministrations.\n  Let me give two examples. Judge Kimberly Moore sits on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit. She was nominated by President Bush \nat the age of 38. She had 2 years of experience as a law clerk, less \nthan 4 years in private practice, and 6 years as a professor at three \ndifferent law schools. The Senate confirmed her unanimously.\n  Judge Harvey Wilkinson is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. He was nominated by President Reagan at the age of \n39. He had 1 year experience as a law clerk, 3 years as a newspaper \neditor, 1 year of government practice, and 5 years as a professor. He \nwas confirmed.\n\n  Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit, also comes to mind. He was 38 when he was nominated. \nUnlike Liu, he had little track record to review and much of the record \nthat did exist was partisan. He had been a law clerk for 3 years, spent \n3 years in private practice, and spent the remainder of his career in \nthe Solicitor General's Office, Ken Starr's Office of Independent \nCounsel, and the Bush White House. When the ABA conducted its reviews, \nmany troubling reports were received, but I voted for cloture, as did \nmany of my colleagues on this side, and he was confirmed.\n  Professors are hardly a new game for us when it comes to judicial \nnominees.\n  John Rogers is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. At the time President Bush nominated him, he had only 4 years \nof practice experience, no appellate clerkships, and had spent the \nremainder of his career as a professor. He was confirmed by the Senate \nby a voice vote.\n  Finally, there is Michael McConnell from the State of Utah. President \nBush nominated Professor McConnell for the Tenth Circuit. At the time, \nhe had been a constitutional law professor for 16 years and his \nwritings contained scores of controversial thoughts, ideas, and \nprovocations. In reviewing McConnell's record, many of us on the \nDemocratic side found writing after writing that we strongly disagreed \nwith. McConnell had repeatedly stated that Roe v. Wade was wrongly \ndecided. He called the Supreme Court decision ``a grave legal error'' \nand ``an embarrassment.''\n  He wrote that the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and the \nViolence Against Women Act were unconstitutional. He criticized a \nSupreme Court decision barring racial discrimination at tax-exempt \nschools and one prohibiting sex discrimination in civic associations. \nHe called the fundamental guarantee of one person, one vote ``wrong in \nprinciple.''\n  But similar to Professor Liu, he made clear in the Senate \nconfirmation process that he understood the difference between the role \nof a professor and the role of a judge. Here is what he said when asked \nabout all of his writings:\n\n       I have a whole bunch of writings out there that were \n     provocative, and innovative, and taking a different view. \n     Well, within--my academic colleagues understand that that's \n     what we do. If you try to make those look as though they are \n     legal analysis, as if they were what a lawyer thinks the law \n     is, of course they don't reflect the law. They're not meant \n     to. They're not a description of the law.\n\n  Professor Michael McConnell, Senate Judiciary Committee, September \n18, 2002.\n  He then assured us he would apply the law as written, not as put \nforward in academic theory. Guess what. He\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nwas confirmed to the Tenth Circuit by voice vote. There was no cloture \nvote. He was confirmed by voice vote because the Democrats on this side \nof the aisle believed he would do just what he said. I don't understand \nwhy this same situation is not accorded to this brilliant young \nAmerican.\n  Today, we have Professor Liu before us. He has also written article \nafter article as a law professor and people have disagreed with some of \nwhat he has written.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       I think that there's a clear difference between what things \n     people write as scholars and how one would approach the role \n     of a judge. And those two are very different things. As \n     scholars, we are paid, in a sense, to question the boundaries \n     of the law, to raise new theories, to be provocative in ways \n     that it's simply not the role of a judge to be. The role of \n     the judge is to faithfully follow the law as it is written \n     and as it is given by the Supreme Court. And there is no room \n     for invention or creation of new theories. That's simply not \n     the role of the judge.\n\n  A very similar statement. It was made by Goodwin Liu before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, April 16, 2010.\n  Professor McConnell went through by voice vote. The same kind of \nsituation--voice vote--yet we may be prevented from even taking a vote \non Professor Liu's nomination because he may not get a supermajority \nfor cloture. I must say, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander.\n  Professor Liu, like Professor McConnell, is a brilliant legal mind. \nHe has written extensively. He has been absolutely clear that if \nconfirmed he would follow not any academic theory or writing, but the \nlaw as it is written and handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court. We took \nProfessor McConnell at his word. Professor Liu deserves the same \ntreatment.\n  (Mr. WHITEHOUSE assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What is interesting to me is how much things have \nchanged on this committee--and we have a new Presiding Officer who also \nis on the committee--since before the Presiding Officer came on, when \nwe would look at a person's personal record, what they have said, what \nthey think the kind of judge they will be, and make a decision.\n  So I do not understand, if we can confirm Professor McConnell by \nunanimous consent, why can't we grant cloture to a man who has \ndistinguished himself as one of the great legal scholars of our \ncountry?\n  Let me address one particular criticism that has been made of \nProfessor Liu's writings, and that is his writings on constitutional \ninterpretation and fidelity to the Constitution.\n  Some in the Senate have harshly criticized his book ``Keeping Faith \nwith the Constitution'' because he says at one point that the Supreme \nCourt has taken ``social practices, evolving norms, and practical \nconsequences'' into account when interpreting the Constitution. This, \nsome colleagues say, means he will be an activist.\n  First, Liu has said this book was written as a professor, as an \nacademic, that it is in no way a roadmap for how he would decide cases \nas a judge. He said, in his own words:\n\n       The duty of a circuit judge is to faithfully follow the \n     Supreme Court's instructions on matters of constitutional \n     interpretation, not any particular theory. And so that is \n     exactly what I would do, is I would apply the applicable \n     precedents to the facts of each case.\n\n  But I think some are using this nomination to try to set a new \nstandard, to say that the only valid theory of constitutional \ninterpretation is originalism. So I want to point out that Liu's \ncomments about constitutional interpretation are hardly exceptional.\n  In fact, they echo statements made by some of our very best jurists \nacross the span of American history: Chief Justice John Marshall, \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, to name \na few.\n  The most famous example: Chief Justice John Marshall wrote, in 1819, \nin the case of McCulloch v. Maryland:\n\n       We must never forget that it is a constitution we are \n     expounding.\n       . . . This provision is made in a constitution, intended to \n     endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to \n     the various crises of human affairs.\n\n  Chief Justice John Marshall.\n  We are not all originalists here, and originalism does not define the \nlegal mainstream. In an interview, published in the California Lawyer \nin January, Justice Scalia made the shocking statement that he does not \nbelieve the U.S. Constitution guarantees women equal protection of the \nlaw. This came out this January. This is a sitting Supreme Court \nJustice saying the Constitution does not guarantee women equal \nprotection under the law.\n  The text of the 14th amendment says no ``person'' shall be denied \nequal protection of the law--and after decades of precedent, unanimous \nSupreme Court decisions agree that women are protected. But regardless \nof text and precedent, Justice Scalia says it cannot be so because that \nis not what the drafters of the 14th amendment intended.\n  This is not the American mainstream. Following this line of \nreasoning, the minimum wage would be unconstitutional, schools could \nstill be legally segregated, States could prohibit married couples from \nusing birth control, and I, as a woman, could be prohibited from \nstanding here today as an elected Member of the Senate.\n  That kind of thinking cannot be a criterion for acceptance onto our \nFederal courts. So some may disagree with Liu's statement about \nconstitutional interpretation, but it is hardly far afield of the legal \nmainstream today.\n  Let me tell you what others who are familiar with Liu's full record--\nfull record--have said about his work.\n  Richard Painter, a chief ethics officer for President George W. Bush, \nrelayed similar thoughts after reviewing Liu's record. Here is a quote: \nLiu's ``views are part of the legal mainstream'' and that the \n``independence, rigor, and fair-mindedness of his writings support a \nconfident prediction that he will be a dutiful and impartial judge.'' \n``Liu respects the law, which is what we should expect of a judge.''\n  Yet the Senate may well not give him cloture even to come to a vote \non his confirmation. That is unfair.\n  Jesse Choper, who reviewed all of Liu's writings as the chair of his \ntenure committee, has similarly said, ``in addressing a wide range of \nissues, Liu demonstrates rigor, independence, fair-mindedness, and--\nmost importantly for present purposes--sincere respect for the proper \nrole of courts in a constitutional democracy.'' ``One thing is clear,'' \nhe says, ``Liu's interpretive approach is part of mainstream legal \nthought.''\n  Finally, someone who has been quoted often here today, Kenneth Starr, \na prominent conservative and former Reagan appointee to the DC Court of \nAppeals, has written to us together with Professor Akhil Amar to say, \nGoodwin Liu is ``a person of great intellect, accomplishment, and \nintegrity, and he is exceptionally well qualified to serve on the court \nof appeals.''\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       In our view, the traits that should weigh most heavily in \n     the evaluation of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such \n     as Goodwin are professional integrity and the ability to \n     discharge faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. \n     Because Goodwin possesses those qualities to the highest \n     degree, we are confident that he will serve on the court of \n     appeals not only fairly and competently, but with great \n     distinction.\n\n  I have a very hard time understanding why people would do this: we \nlistened to and read Judge McConnell's views, which were antithetical \nto many of us on this side, but we believed he would be a fair and good \njudge, and he was confirmed by voice vote; but today someone who has \nthe finest education America has to offer, who is supported by scholars \non both sides of the political aisle, who is truly scholastically \nexceptional, who could quote case after case after case in his \nhearings, may be denied cloture.\n  If he is, this is not the Senate of the United States of which I am \nmost proud. I hope I am wrong. I hope he will be granted cloture \nbecause he deserves a vote up or down. A majority vote--that is \nAmerica--a majority vote on his confirmation. We will see what happens.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Goodwin Liu for \nconfirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Goodwin Liu and I share the immigrant experience. He is the proud son \nof Chinese immigrants and my father came to this great Nation from \nJapan. He holds degrees from some of the top universities in the world. \nBefore attending Yale Law School, he worked with the Corporation for \nNational\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\nService in Washington, DC, where he helped launch the AmeriCorps \nprogram. In 2000, he served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Since 2003, he has taught law at the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley School of Law, Boalt Hall. He has \nalso served as a special assistant to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, advising the Department on a range of legal \nissues including the development of guidelines to help turn around low \nperforming schools.\n  Goodwin also practiced as a litigant for the firm of O'Melveny & \nMyers in Washington, DC. There, appellate litigation comprised nearly \nhalf his practice.\n  Were these accolades not enough to demonstrate Goodwin's capacity to \nserve as a Federal appellate judge, I would also point to the \n``unanimously well qualified'' rating he received from the American Bar \nAssociation, ABA, the ABA's highest rating for Federal judgeships. I \nbelieve Goodwin's extensive knowledge of the law, understanding of \nappellate procedure, and appellant litigation experience make him an \noutstanding candidate for confirmation.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that there are still many \njudicial vacancies that need to be filled. The constitutional right to \na speedy trial correlates to the number of judges able to hear cases. \nWhile it is important to ascertain the character and capacity of a \nnominee to such an important position, postponing Goodwin Liu's \nconfirmation does a disservice to our Nation, and to this body's \nresponsibility for confirming Presidential nominees. I believe Goodwin \nLiu will make a fine judge, and will serve with distinction in the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nconfirming Goodwin Liu to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have week \nafter week since we passed the health care law, giving a doctor's \nsecond opinion of the law. I come today because last month President \nObama delivered a very big speech on spending. Unfortunately, it seemed \nto be more of a political attack than a substantive speech offering a \ndetailed plan to attack the American debt crisis.\n  The President did, however, mention one bit of substance that really \nshould raise a red flag to the American people. He said:\n\n       We will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening \n     an independent commission.\n\n  Well, the Washington commission he is referring to is called the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board. This board may sound harmless, but \nlet me assure you that the American people deserve to know and have a \nright to know more detail about the board and its work.\n  Many Americans may not remember that the health care law created this \nunelected, unaccountable board of Washington full-time bureaucrats. The \nsole purpose of the board is to cut Medicare spending based on \narbitrary budget targets--not based on the number of people on Medicare \nor the number of seniors but based on arbitrary budget targets. These \nare cuts above and beyond the $500 billion already taken from a nearly \nbankrupt Medicare Program during the health care law--taken from our \nseniors--not to save Medicare but to start a whole new government \nprogram.\n  Now the President wants to slow the growth of Medicare costs by \nstrengthening this independent commission. Well, this board empowers 15 \nunelected Washington bureaucrats to make these Medicare cuts, all \nwithout full transparency and accountability to the American seniors \nand also to elected officials.\n  Once again, this board proved that the President and the Democrats in \nCongress who voted for the health care law simply didn't have the \npolitical courage to make tough spending decisions. Instead, they took \nthe easy road and pulled a classic Washington maneuver: they created a \nboard and then punted the tough decisions to the board. Well, this \nforced Congress to abdicate two important congressional duties. First \nis the constitutional responsibility to manage Medicare spending. The \nsecond is the responsibility to explain to the American people why \nspecific payment changes might be necessary to keep Medicare afloat--\nall because the President and Washington Democrats refused to lead. \nThey simply threw up their hands and said: Let someone else deal with \nit.\n  If expanding this independent board is--they call it ``independent,'' \nbut I am not so convinced it is. It is called the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board. If expanding the board is the one and only concrete \nproposal the President has to reform Medicare and reduce the debt and \nmost Americans have never even heard of it, then it is important that \nwe take the time on the Senate floor today to discuss exactly how this \nboard works and the impact it will have on medical care in America.\n  I call this the top 10 things you need to know about the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board. To me, this issue is so important that I plan \nto talk about five of them today, and I will come back next week, as \npart of the doctor's second opinion on the health care law, and talk \nabout the next five.\n  No. 1, this board is how Washington will limit patient care.\n  When Congressman Paul Ryan offered his 2012 budget plan, the \nPresident and members of his party launched an all-out media assault on \nMedicare spending. The White House and Democrats used inflammatory and \npatently false statements to scare people about the Ryan plan. What \nthey failed to mention, however, is that the President's own health \ncare law actually has significant caps on Medicare spending. To enforce \nthe caps, the President and Washington Democrats went with their tried-\nand-true solution: create another board.\n  What does this mean for people who are currently on Medicare and for \nfuture Medicare patients? A centralized Washington board will \narbitrarily cut payments to Medicare providers--doctors, nurses, and \nother people taking care of patients. They are going to squeeze \nMedicare savings by cutting provider payments and treatment options, \nwhich will punish patients. Why? To start a whole new government \nprogram--not for the people who paid into Medicare but for a whole \ndifferent group of people. Not only will medical professionals facing \nthese cuts decide to simply stop seeing Medicare patients--and we see \nthat now. Frankly, doctors are running away from Medicare, not wanting \nto see those patients. Individuals and families will watch helplessly \nas a Washington bureaucrat decides what kind of treatments that person \ncan have.\n  No. 2, this board is going to make recommendations, and those \nrecommendations will automatically become law.\n  How can it be that something the board does automatically becomes \nlaw? But their spending recommendations automatically become law--\nunless Congress acts to stop it. If Congress would actually want to \nstop the board's policies, there are very few options. The options are \nseverely limited. Overriding the board's recommendations requires a \nthree-fifths majority vote in the Senate, a high hurdle to jump, or \nCongress can pass a different Medicare spending plan. But there is a \ncatch. It still has to meet the same arbitrary spending target. So if \nCongress does nothing, then Health and Human Services Secretary \nKathleen Sebelius will implement the board's plan.\n  Medicare consumes about 13 percent of the Federal budget, and former \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Peter Orzag called this board \n``the largest yielding of sovereignty from Congress since the creation \nof the Federal Reserve.''\n  The bottom line is that this board isn't making recommendations to \nCongress; this board is passing law. Well, Congress doesn't have to \napprove these policies of the board, and the President\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\ndoesn't have to sign them. They are law. This represents an \nunprecedented shift of power from the legislative branch of the Federal \nGovernment to an unelected board of 15 bureaucrats.\n  No. 3, the policies of this board cannot be challenged in court.\n  On April 19 of this year, the New York Times published an article \nentitled ``Obama Panel to Curb Medicare Finds Foes in Both Parties.''\n  This article explains that:\n\n       In general, federal courts could not review actions to \n     carry out the board's recommendations.\n\n  Well, there is an institute called Arizona's Goldwater Institute. \nThey filed a lawsuit based upon this payment advisory board. Part of \nthe lawsuit says:\n\n       Congress has no constitutional power to delegate nearly \n     unlimited legislative power to any federal executive branch \n     agency, much less to entrench health care regulation against \n     review, debate, revision, or repeal. . . . Such federal \n     overreaching must be rejected if the principles of limited \n     government and the separation of powers by the United States \n     Constitution mean anything.\n\n  That is what the lawsuit says.\n  Let's go to No. 4. This board's mission is to cut provider payments. \nThe board is strictly limited in what it can do to achieve Medicare \nspending reductions. By law, the board cannot raise revenue by \nincreasing taxes. It cannot increase patient cost-sharing methods, such \nas premiums, copayments, and deductibles. It cannot alter Medicare \neligibility or benefit package.\n  What can it do? One thing and one thing only: It will adjust provider \nreimbursement rates. We all know Medicare payment rates are already \nwell below market rates. That is why so many doctors are limiting the \nnumber of Medicare patients they see and, in more severe cases, \nrefusing to treat Medicare patients at all.\n  Additional subjective cuts to Medicare will not make the program more \nefficient or more available. These measures will simply reduce the \nsupply of medical care to the Medicare patients of America.\n  The Medicare Chief Actuary, Richard Foster, warned us that the health \ncare law's Medicare cuts would cause providers to leave the program, \nand we are seeing that today. It is not because they do not want to \ntreat Medicare patients; it is because the doctors know the payments \nwill be too low to even cover their costs. Mr. Foster, the Medicare \nChief Actuary, has said approximately 15 percent of our Nation's \nhospitals would drop out of Medicare in 10 years.\n  Then No. 5: This board could eventually impact all patients, not just \nMedicare patients. Washington Democrats have long supported policies \nthat give government more power to set health care prices, not just in \npublic programs such as Medicare, but also in the private sector. \nPresident Bill Clinton asked for this authority in a 1994 debate on \nwhat at the time was called ``Hillary care.'' It was one reason his \neffort failed. President Obama learned from that failure. Make no \nmistake, he wants to achieve the same objective. This time he is using \nthis board as a Trojan horse to sell it.\n  If President Obama's health care law remains the law of the land, \nmillions of Americans will have government-subsidized health insurance. \nPaying for this new entitlement program will cost trillions. It will be \nno surprise when we inevitably hear cries for increased cost control. \nThis is when the President will make his move--proposing to extend this \nboard's reach beyond Medicare to the new health care law's subsidized \ninsurance premiums. Last month, the President opened the door to this \nstrategy when he proposed in his speech to expand this board's power \nand its control over Medicare.\n  That is why I come to the Senate floor each and every week to deliver \na doctor's second opinion about the health care law--a law that I \nbelieve is bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and doctors \nwho take care of those patients--and bad for our taxpayers. I believe \nthe more the American people discover about this so-called independent \npayment advisory board, the more unpopular the President's health care \nlaw will become.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nconfirmation of Professor Goodwin Liu to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit. As a member of the Judiciary Committee for the past \n2 years, I have had the opportunity to meet with Professor Liu and vote \non his nomination on several occasions. He is a singularly talented \nindividual, and I wish to associate myself with the remarks all my \ncolleagues have made in support of his confirmation.\n  But the strongest arguments I have heard in support of Professor Liu \nhaven't come from my colleagues. In fact, they haven't even come from a \nDemocrat. No, the most persuasive arguments I have heard for confirming \nProfessor Liu come from the former chief ethics lawyer for the \nadministration of President George W. Bush, a gentleman named Richard \nPainter. Professor Painter, a Republican, is now a prominent law \nprofessor at the University of Minnesota.\n  Earlier this year, Professor Painter wrote a lengthy article that \nsystematically catalogued Professor Liu's strengths and systematically \nanswered his critics. This is his conclusion:\n\n       In sum, Liu is eminently qualified. He has support from \n     prominent conservatives. . . . He is pragmatic and open-\n     minded, not dogmatic or ideological. . . . Many, though by no \n     means all, of his scholarly views do not align with \n     conservative ideology or with the policy positions of many \n     elected officials in the Republican Party. . . . \n     Nevertheless, his views are part of the American legal \n     mainstream. The independence, rigor, and fair-mindedness of \n     his writings support a confident prediction that he will be a \n     dutiful and impartial judge.\n\n  When I circulated Professor Painter's article to the members of the \nJudiciary Committee, my Republican colleagues sent me a series of \narticles critiquing Professor Liu. I would like to take a few moments \nto rebut the criticisms in these articles because they simply don't \nhold water.\n  The first and most common criticism of Goodwin Liu is that he somehow \nbelieves in a so-called living Constitution. His opponents are \nespecially worried about his suggestion that in interpreting the \nConstitution, judges should consider the ``evolving norms and \ntraditions of our society.''\n  Professor Liu has written an entire book about his theory of \nconstitutional interpretation. On page 2 of that book, he writes that \nwe need to consider a lot of different things when we interpret the \nConstitution. We need to consider the original understanding of the \nFramers. We need to consider the purpose and structure of the \nConstitution. We need to consider precedent. We need to consider the \npractical consequences of our laws. Lastly, we need to consider the \nevolving norms and traditions of our society. So this is just one \nthing--one thing--that we should take into account.\n  But even more important, this idea that we should merely consider the \nevolving standards of our society in interpreting the Constitution is \nnot a radical idea. In fact, it isn't even a new idea. This issue \nfrequently comes up in fourth amendment cases. Over 40 years ago, in a \n1967 case called U.S. v. Katz, the Supreme Court was asked to determine \nwhether a wiretap constituted a search under the fourth amendment. If \nit did, law enforcement would have to get a warrant to get a wiretap.\n  The problem, of course, was that the Founders never anticipated the \ntelephone, let alone the wire to the telephone. So this was a new \nquestion for the Court. But the Court voted 7 to 1 to find that a \nwiretap was, in fact, a search under the fourth amendment, and one of \nthe main reasons they cited was that people in modern society had come \nto expect and assume that their phone calls were private. Two years \nlater, in a separate case called Smith v. Maryland, the Court formally \nadopted the rule that the fourth amendment will protect people where \nour society recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy. So for 40 \nyears, it has been the law of this land that you have to look at social \nnorms when interpreting the fourth amendment.\n  Here is another example, one that Senator Feinstein cited, but still, \nit bears repeating. This is what Chief Justice Marshall said about the \nNecessary\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nand Proper Clause in McCulloch v. Maryland.\n\n       . . . [t]his provision is made in a constitution, intended \n     to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted \n     to the various crises of human affairs.\n\n  McCulloch v. Maryland was decided in 1819. So the idea that we should \nmerely consider the state of our society when we interpret the \nConstitution isn't new, it is old. It is very old. In fact, it is \narguably older than the Senate Chamber we are standing in, which first \nopened in 1859.\n  Professor Liu's detractors have also accused him of believing that \njudges may ``legitimately invent constitutional rights to a broad range \nof social `welfare' goods, including education, shelter, subsistence, \nand health care.'' That is the accusation. This argument is based on an \narticle Professor Liu wrote in 2008.\n  But if you actually read the article, you will find this statement \nright in the introduction. This is a quote from the article:\n\n       [B]ecause the existence of any welfare right depends on \n     Democratic instantiation of our shared understandings, the \n     Judiciary is generally limited to an interstitial role within \n     the context of a legislative program. Courts do not act as \n     `first movers' in establishing welfare rights . . .\n\n  In other words, Professor Liu is being accused of saying judges can \ninvent welfare rights because of an article he wrote where he said \njudges cannot invent welfare rights.\n  The final point I wish to address is the idea that Professor Liu \nsomehow supports ``using foreign law to redefine the Constitution.'' \nProfessor Liu's critics cite an obscure speech he gave at a Japanese \nlaw school 5 years ago. According to his critics, he said in this \nspeech that it is ``difficult for him to grasp how anyone could resist \nthe use of foreign authority in American constitutional law.''\n  I went and got a copy of the speech. If you read it, you will see \nthat Professor Liu was referring to a series of Supreme Court decisions \nwritten by Justice Anthony Kennedy, where Justice Kennedy reviewed the \nlaws of foreign countries on certain issues. Justice Kennedy didn't use \nthe laws of foreign countries to decide the cases before him, he used \nthem to get a sense of how other countries were resolving the legal \nissues before him.\n  Professor Liu was basically saying he found it difficult to grasp how \npeople could disagree with Justice Kennedy. He has repeatedly said in \nhis testimony, under oath, that he does not believe that foreign law \nshould be binding in any way on Federal law.\n  There are other critiques against Professor Liu that I will not go \ninto further, but I urge my colleagues to dig behind these blanket \nstatements. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, I think you will find there \nis no there there.\n  I think what my colleagues will find is an extraordinary intellect, a \nfundamentally decent man, and someone who will be a strong and \nimpartial jurist. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to vote \nto support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HOGAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate a friend \nof mine who is a valued servant to the people of Kentucky, BG Stephen \nR. Hogan. On March 12 of this year, the former colonel had his \npromotion ceremony to the rank of brigadier general. This promotion to \ngeneral is a very special accomplishment, as very few career officers \nin our Armed Forces ever reach the general rank.\n  This promotion is well deserved for all that Brigadier General Hogan \nhas done for his country. Serving as the assistant adjutant general for \nthe Kentucky Army National Guard, he is responsible to the adjutant \ngeneral for balancing the requirements of readiness, modernization, \nforce structure, and sustainment of the National Guard for mobilization \nand domestic missions.\n  Brigadier General Hogan's significant duty assignments include tours \nwith the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, KY; the \n6th Infantry Division Light, Fort Richardson, AK; the Army Operations \nCenter, the Pentagon; and with the Multi-National Corps Iraq based in \nBaghdad, Iraq. When not serving on Federal active duty, he has served \nin the Kentucky Army National Guard as an active-duty guardsman with \nthe State's Counter-Drug Unit, and $11 billion worth of illegal \nmarijuana has been eradicated during his service.\n  Brigadier General Hogan's awards, medals and decorations include the \nMeritorious Service Medal, with three Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters; the \nArmy Commendation Medal, with one Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster; the Army \nReserve Components Achievement Medal, with one Silver Oak Leaf Cluster; \nthe National Defense Service Medal; with one Bronze Service Star; the \nIraq Campaign Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the \nArmed Forces Reserve Medal, with ``M'' Device and Silver Hourglass; the \nArmy Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon; the Master \nParachutist Badge; the Pathfinder Badge; the Air Assault Badge; the \nKentucky Merit Ribbon; the Kentucky Service Ribbon, with three Oak Leaf \nClusters; and the Kentucky Counter Drug Ribbon.\n  Despite all this accomplishment, at his promotion ceremony, Brigadier \nGeneral Hogan said, ``All I ever wanted to do in life is be a \nprofessional soldier.'' Well, we in Kentucky are certainly glad he got \nhis wish. I want to congratulate him on his promotion, and I know my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate will join me in honoring his service and \nhis sacrifice for our country.\n  An article extolling the virtues of Brigadier General Stephen R. \nHogan appeared recently in the Marion Star. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Marion Star, April 18, 2011]\n\nConner High Grad Named Brig.

Meis\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, today I pay tribute to a young \nColoradan, LCpl Christopher S. Meis, who died on March 17, 2011, from \nwounds he received while supporting combat operations in Helmand \nProvince, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old. The loss of Lance Corporal \nMeis weighs heavily on his hometown of Bennett, CO, where he grew up \ndreaming of serving his country as a marine.\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n  According to his mother, Lance Corporal Meis set his mind to becoming \na soldier in the eighth grade. He always preferred the Marines, she \nsays, because of its distinct reputation for rigor and excellence. \nLance Corporal Meis enlisted in January 2010 after graduating from \nBennett High School. He served a tour of duty in Afghanistan in support \nof Operation Enduring Freedom, earning numerous decorations.\n  He was a machine gunner in the 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine \nDivision, based at Camp Lejeune, NC. This post situated Lance Corporal \nMeis on the front lines of battle in Afghanistan, which for him meant \nan opportunity to contribute. His mother said that, when he called \nhome, he spoke of his readiness for action and commitment to ``making a \ndifference.'' He told his family that he ultimately wanted to pursue \nthe Marine Corps as a career.\n  Lance Corporal Meis's bravery and exemplary service quickly won the \nrecognition of his commanding officers. He earned, among other \ndecorations, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Just 3 \nweeks before his passing, he received a promotion to lance corporal.\n  His record as a soldier exhibits America's proudest traditions of \nvalor, commitment to duty, and strength of character. To his family, he \nwill be remembered as a dedicated son and brother. For Lance Corporal \nMeis, family and duty sometimes took the same form. By putting on the \nuniform, he followed his two grandfathers in a proud family tradition \nof service in the Armed Forces. His paternal grandfather served in \nWorld War II, and his maternal grandfather retired from the Air Force.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Lance \nCorporal Meis's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  I stand with the citizens of Colorado and across our country in \nprofound gratitude for Lance Corporal Meis's tremendous sacrifice. In \nAfghanistan, he fought with unwavering courage to protect America and \nher citizens, and for his service he will forever be remembered as one \nof our bravest. To honor those who survived him, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending our deepest respects and condolences to Holly, his \nmother, Chris, his father, Hunter, his brother, and to his entire \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3102-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CARNEY CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, on May 17, 2011, the Senate considered \nthe nomination of Susan Carney to serve as a Judge on the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I voted against her nomination and want to \nexplain my vote.\n  The qualifications of a judicial nominee are critically important. \nSusan Carney received her A.B. in 1973 and her J.D. in 1977 from \nHarvard, graduating both times with honors. Following law school she \nclerked on the First Circuit. She then worked in private practice in \nWashington from 1979 until 1986. After several years of self-\nemployment, she became affiliated with another Washington law firm in \n1994 before becoming associate general counsel of the Peace Corps in \n1996. Since 1998 she has worked in Yale University's General Counsel's \nOffice; she has been deputy general counsel since 2001.\n  I question whether Ms. Carney has the proper experience to serve as \nan appellate judge. She has no litigation experience in the last 15 \nyears. She has never tried any cases to verdict, judgment, or final \ndecision. There is nothing in her background that will provide this \nbody with any information as to how she will view the law and what she \nmay or may not be inclined to do as an appellate court judge.\n  When examining a nominee, especially a nominee for the circuit court \nof appeals, I am looking for evidence in the nominee's history that \nwill establish that the nominee is a constitutionalist. Someone who \ntakes the original, public meaning of the text of the Constitution and \nour laws seriously and does not look for excuses to depart from it and \nread into it what he or she wants.\n  In making a determination as to whether to vote for a nominee, I look \nfor evidence that the nominee meets Chief Justice John Roberts' analogy \nof a baseball umpire, someone who doesn't bend the rules for the game, \nbut just calls them as he sees them; someone who offers no favoritism \ndepending on who is at bat.\n  All Americans should expect Members of U.S. Senate to carefully \nexplore and guard against judicial nominees who are activists. Judges \nwho interpret the Constitution and laws in light of his or her personal \npreferences or how he or she thinks they ought to have been written \nshould not be on the bench. We should guard against a nominee who would \nelevate ``empathy'' over what the rule of law requires.\n  The only information that has been produced about Ms. Carney's \npotential judicial inclinations is that she was a supporter of pro-\nabortion groups such as NOW, NARAL, and Planned Parenthood. This \nnominee has little legal and no judicial history to rely upon. The \nburden of proof to show that the nominee will be a fair and impartial \njudge falls on the nominee. There is nothing in the record that would \nallow me to conclude that Ms. Carney will always be fair and impartial \nor that she will not elevate empathy over the rule of law. What I \nbelieve we should seek is a fair judge should be neutral and rule the \nsame way according to the laws as written regardless of who is before \nthe court.\n  Senators Sessions, Coburn, and Lee voted against this nomination in \ncommittee. The Republican members of the ABA committee that review \nnominees found Ms. Carney unqualified.\n  A review of Ms. Carney's record lacks any indicia as to how she would \nrule or how she would handle her role in this critical position. In my \nview, the burden of proof falls to the nominee and despite the support \nthis nomination garnered from my colleagues, I do not believe that Ms. \nCarney met this burden. Given the higher scrutiny associated with \nconsideration of nominees to the circuit courts of appeal, this \nnominee's limited record coupled with her history of supporting liberal \norganizations and because the nominee has the burden of establishing \nfidelity to constitutional principles, I voted against this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3102-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3102-S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          MAKOTI, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On July 15-17, the residents of Robinson will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  The vibrant community of Robinson is a Northern Pacific Railroad \ntownsite. It was named after John F. Robinson, president of the First \nNational Bank in Steele.

Madam President, today, I am pleased to recognize \na community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. \nFrom July 8-10, the residents of Selfridge will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's founding.\n  The Selfridge Milwaukee Road Railroad Station was established in \n1911. Several theories exist on how Selfridge received its name. Some \nsay the name describes the ridge of hills in the area, while others say \nit was named for a Milwaukee Road Railroad official. Others contend \nthat it was named for Thomas E. Selfridge, a pioneer army aviator \nkilled in service.\n  In 1925, Selfridge boasted 63 business establishments and 51 homes. \nBy 1930, the town's population had more than doubled. In the early \n1940s, crops harvested in the countryside around Selfridge brought \nagricultural success, and during the 1950s the city council established \na water and sewer system for the community. Because prairie fires have \nbeen a concern for Selfridge since its founding, a voluntary fire \ndepartment has always been in existence.\n  Selfridge is located in south central North Dakota in Sioux County. \nIt is part of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Today the town is \nhome to the Selfridge Fire Hall, Selfridge High School, Selfridge Post \nOffice, Selfridge Farmer's Union Oil Co., and the Branding Iron Bar & \nSteakhouse.\n  In honor of the city's 100th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized, among other things, a high school reunion social, street \ndances, a parade, sporting activities, a performance by Native American \ndancers, a children's carnival, and a German supper.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nSelfridge, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in \nwishing them well in the future. By honoring Selfridge and all other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nSelfridge that have helped shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Selfridge has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3103-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3103-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3103-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works, and referred as indicated:\n\n       S. 840.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and \nnatural gas produced from marginal properties; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to announce the \nreintroduction of a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to \neliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and \nnatural gas produced from marginal properties.\n  Since 1926 small producers and millions of royalty owners have had \nthe option to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify their \naccounting methodology and to account for the decline in the value of \nminerals produced from a property. Percentage depletion is particularly \nimportant to America's 611,000 low-volume marginal wells. The average \nmarginal well produces barely 2 barrels per day, yet cumulatively they \naccount for nearly 28 percent of domestic production in the lower 48 \nStates. Since every on-shore natural gas and oil well eventually \ndeclines into marginal production, the economic life span and \ncorresponding production of all wells is extended by allowing the use \nof percentage depletion.\n  Until 1998, the deduction marginal producers could take from \npercentage depletion was limited to 100 percent of taxable income from \neach individual property. Many producers, however, specialize in \nmarginally producing wells and have many properties operating \nsimultaneously. Naturally, some wells in a producer's portfolio are \nmore productive than others. Some would have depletion rates greater \nthan 100 percent of taxable income, while others would have depletion \nrates lower than the limit. Removing the taxable income limitation \nallows producers to take percentage depletion deductions on a \nportfolio-wide basis, which makes their entire operation more \nefficient.\n  Since 1998, Congress has understood this fact and has suspended the \nlimitation. Unfortunately, the provision has never been made permanent. \nIt has just been extended year after year as part of the Tax Extenders \nPackage. Since we have had this suspension on the books for more than a \ndecade, I think it is time to give producers the predictability they \nneed by making this common sense tax accounting provision permanent.\n  At a time when our unemployment rate is at 9 percent, we need to be \ndoing everything we can to encourage economic growth. The energy \nindustry is a major contributor to our economy, and it has a lot of \nroom to grow. The Congressional Research Service recently released a \nreport that says the United States has the most energy potential under \nits soil than any other country on earth. Hiding beneath our soil are \njobs, wealth, and lower deficits. We should allow this sector to grow. \nThis is a common sense, easy way to do this, so I urge swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1008. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the depreciation rules for property used \npredominantly within an Indian reservation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention a \nbill I am reintroducing that would make permanent the current tax \nprovision that allows capital assets on Indian lands to be depreciated \non an accelerated schedule.\n  For many years, the Federal tax code has provided an incentive for \nbusinesses to invest in operations on Indian reservations and lands \nacross the country. According to the law, businesses that purchase \ncapital equipment and use it on Indian lands will be able to depreciate \nit, on average, more than 40 percent faster than would otherwise be \nallowed.\n  This tax provision is important to Oklahoma because of our \nlongstanding history and unique relationship with Indian tribes. In \nlight of the weak and ongoing economic recovery, we need to be doing \nall that we can to encourage businesses to reinvest in and expand their \noperations. This alone is what will create sustainable job growth.\n  The accelerated depreciation schedule helps do that by giving \nbusinesses the opportunity to recover investment dollars in capital \nassets more rapidly. This frees up capital and allows companies to \nreinvest that money more quickly than would have otherwise been \npossible. This is money that would have been tied up in the value of \ntheir capital assets, things like buildings, equipment, and machinery.\n  According to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, 96 companies in \nOklahoma announced $1.7 billion of investments during the 2009-2010 \nperiod, creating an estimated 10,500 jobs. The trickledown effect of \nthese investments\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\nis strong: 12,000 additional jobs and additional capital stock \ninvestments of over $200 million. Companies enjoyed at least $50 \nmillion in economic incentives as a direct result of the accelerated \ndepreciation schedule.\n  The Oklahoma Department of Commerce has also reported that many \ncompanies attribute this provision as a key reason for relocating to \nand expanding within the State. One Oklahoma food processing plant \nmanager recently stated that the credit was a significant factor in the \ncompany's decision to expand. Had the credit not been there, the \nbusiness may not have expanded, and the unemployment rate would be \nworse than it is today.\n  The accelerated schedule is currently allowed, but the law states \nthat it will expire at the end of this year. While the provision has \ntypically been renewed each year, many business leaders have expressed \nconcern that it is not permanent. I can understand why. As a former \nbusinessman myself, I understand the problem of unpredictability. More \nand more, unpredictability is the most serious concern I hear of from \nOklahoma's business leaders. They are frustrated that many government \npolicies, ranging from environmental regulations to the tax code, are \nchanging so dramatically that they have no way of estimating how the \nnew regulations will impact their businesses. How do you expect anyone \nto make investment decisions in that kind of environment? Businesses \nneed stability, and this is particularly true during times of economic \nweakness. We in Congress should take this point seriously, and we can \ntake a step in the right direction by making permanent this important \ntax provision. I urge swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3108-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3108-S3112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1020. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rules relating to loans made from a qualified employer plan, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Savings \nEnhancement by Alleviating Leakage in 401(k) Savings Act of 2011, \notherwise known as the SEAL 401(k) Savings Act. This bill, which I \nintroduce together with my friend Senator Mike Enzi, will reduce \nleakage from retirement plans and help ensure that retirement savings \nin defined contribution plans last throughout retirement.\n  With the recent shift from defined benefit retirement savings plans \nto 401(k)-type defined contribution plans, many Americans are now \nresponsible for making the proactive decision to save for their \nretirement. These decisions include how much to save and where to \ninvest their savings. Meanwhile, they also must resist the urge to tap \ninto their savings in times of hardship through withdrawals and loans.\n  During these difficult economic times, we are increasingly seeing \n401(k) funds being treated as rainy day funds, as participants take out \nwithdrawals and loans. According to a recent study by Aon Hewitt, as of \nthe end of 2010, about 28 percent of active participants in defined \ncontribution plans had an outstanding loan. This is a record high. \nWithdrawals from defined contribution plans also have increased since \nthe 2008 financial crisis. This leakage from these plans can \nsignificantly reduce workers' savings and put their retirement security \nat risk.\n  To determine how to best tackle the issue of leakage from retirement \nplans, the Special Committee on Aging, of which I chair, held a hearing \nin July 2008 entitled, ``Saving Smartly for Retirement: Are Americans \nBeing Encouraged to Break Open the Piggy Bank?.'' The Committee also \nrequested a GAO report entitled, ``401(k) Plans: Policy Changes Could \nReduce the Long-term Effects of Leakage on Workers' Retirement \nSavings,'' which was released in August 2009.\n  The SEAL 401(k) Savings Act builds on the recommendations the \nCommittee received from witnesses during our hearing and from the GAO \nand would reduce leakage and increase retirement savings. First, the \nbill would extend the time workers have to repay loans. When an \nemployee with a 401(k) plan loan loses his job, he generally is put to \nthe choice of defaulting on his outstanding loan and incurring tax \npenalties or immediately repaying the entire outstanding loan balance. \nPaying back a loan after just losing your job can be difficult so our \nbill would give people more time.\n  While having access to a loan in an emergency is an important feature \nfor many participants, a 401(k) savings account should not be used as a \npiggy bank for revolving loans. Also, the administrative burden of \nmanaging multiple loans for a few individuals can increase the costs \nfor all workers in a plan. The SEAL Act reduces the overall number of \nloans that participants can take to three at one time. Currently \nemployers determine the number of loans available, and many employers, \nlike the Federal Thrift Savings Program, have chosen to restrict the \nnumber of loans to reduce leakage and overall cost.\n  The bill also would allow 401(k) participants to continue to make \nadditional contributions during the 6 months following a hardship \nwithdrawal. Currently, after an employee takes a withdrawal from a \n401(k) plan due to a hardship, he or she is prohibited from making \ncontributions to the plan and all other plans maintained by the \nemployer for at least six months. This loss of both employee \ncontributions and company matching contributions during this period can \nexacerbate the long-term negative effects on retirement savings.\n  Finally, the bill would ban products that promote leakage, such as \nthe 401(k) debit card. By offering a 401(k) debit card, plans send the \nmessage that it is okay to use your retirement savings for every day \npurchases, despite the fact that the high fees associated with its use \nwill drastically diminish their savings.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in February the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions held a hearing on the success of the \nautomatic enrollment provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 \nwhich helped millions of workers and their families access to a 401(k) \nretirement savings accounts. Because of the Pension Protection Act, we \ngreatly expanded retirement savings and individuals ability to put \nmoney away for their golden years.\n  Just last week, Fidelity Investments released a report that employer-\nsponsored retirement plans with an automatic enrollment feature have an \noverall participation rate of 82 percent compared with only 56 percent \nwithout automatic enrollment. The Fidelity report also indicated that \naverage account balances for 401(k) and similar retirement accounts \nhave reached an all-time high. This is some good news to show that \nworkers and their families retirement accounts are coming back from the \neconomic distress of just a few years ago.\n  While our Nation's 401(k) retirement system is providing greater \nopportunities for individuals to save, there is still room for \nimprovement. Recent studies have shown that money saved in 401(k) \naccounts sometimes ``leaks'' out of the system and is never put back. \nAonHewitt released a report this week showing that unpaid loans, \nwithdrawals and cashouts of 401(k) monies, otherwise known as \n``leakage,'' can have a substantial effect on how much money ultimately \nwill be there for retirement. According to the AonHewitt report, an \nindividual who ceases to make loan repayments during the loan term is \nexpected to erode future retirement income by 10 to 13 percent. If the \nindividual has two loans and payments are not made then the reduction \nin retirement savings nearly doubles. In the event of a complete \ndefault of the loan, then the monies are permanently gone from the \nretirement system.\n  Today, I join the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, Senator \nKohl, in taking the first step in helping to stop leakage in the \nretirement system. Chairman Kohl held a hearing on this very issue and \nhad the Government Accountability Office, GAO, research and come up \nwith recommendations to stop retirement savings leakage. The bill we \nintroduce today, The Savings Enhancement by Alleviating Leakage in \n401(k) Pension Act also known as the SEAL Act, is based upon those \ninitial GAO recommendations.\n  The SEAL Act takes the first steps in helping workers and their \nfamilies to pay back loans from 401(k) accounts when a worker leaves a \njob. Typically, when a worker separates from an employer any \noutstanding 401(k) loan must be paid back immediately or suffer tax \npenalties. The SEAL Act would allow for a greater period of time for \nthe loan to be paid back thereby helping families to pay back the loan \nand allowing the monies to be put back into their retirement savings \nand avoid the tax penalty.\n  The bill also would remove the prohibition against individuals from \nmaking contributions to their 401(k) accounts in the following 6 months \nafter a hardship loan has been made. Situations where hardship loans \nare made are some of the most stressful times for individuals and their \nfamilies. If they have the ability and means to continue to contribute \nto their 401(k) accounts then they should be provided that option. The \nbill gives them the option to continue to save for retirement even in \ndire circumstances.\n  Finally, the bill would provide structural changes to 401(k) plans to \nhelp businesses keep down administrative costs and extra fees. \nCurrently, the Internal Revenue Code permits businesses to structure \nretirement plans with an unlimited amount of loans per individual but \nan individual cannot take more than 50 percent of their retirement \naccount balances in loans up to $50,000 for all outstanding loans. The \nFederal Government's Thrift Savings Plan has a limit of two outstanding \nloans, one personal loan and one loan for the purchase of a house, at \nany time. We consulted with retirement experts, mutual funds and \nretirement service providers and virtually all agreed that the optimal \nnumber of loans agreed upon was 3 outstanding loans at any time. Some \nbelieved that we should match the Thrift Savings Plan, however, we \nbelieve that businesses need to reduce administrative costs but they \nshould be able to provide flexibility to their workers. The bill also \nwould restrict the use of credit and/or debit card loans on 401(k) \naccounts. Again, these types of loans pull money out in ``reserve'' so \nthat individuals can tap the reserve at any time. However, the extra \nadministrative costs and fees are burdensome to businesses and to their \nworkers.\n  Overall, the SEAL bill is the first step in helping to provide \nflexibility for individuals and plan structure to help keep retirement \nmonies in retirement savings accounts. I look forward to working with \nChairman Kohl in moving this important piece of retirement savings \nlegislation. I also look forward to working with my colleagues to \nimprove and add other items to help reduce leakage in 401(k) retirement \nsavings and to help our Nation's workers and their families have their \nmoney there for them at retirement.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Reforestation Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to \n     support and seek protection of tropical forests around the \n     world;\n       (2) tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits by--\n       (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and \n     terrestrial resources of Earth and providing habitats for an \n     estimated 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 plant and animal species, \n     including species essential to medical research and \n     agricultural productivity;\n       (B) playing a critical role as carbon sinks that reduce \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as 1 hectare of tropical \n     forest can absorb up to approximately 3 tons of carbon \n     dioxide per year, thus moderating potential global climate \n     change; and\n       (C) regulating hydrological cycles upon which agricultural \n     and coastal resources depend;\n       (3) tropical forests are also a key factor in reducing \n     rates of soil loss, particularly on hilly terrain;\n       (4) while international efforts to stem the tide of \n     tropical deforestation have accelerated during the past 2 \n     decades, the rapid rate of tropical deforestation continues \n     unabated;\n       (5) in 1923, over 60 percent of the land of Haiti was \n     forested but, by 2006, that percentage had decreased to less \n     than 2 percent;\n       (6) during the period beginning in 2000 and ending in 2005, \n     the deforestation rate in Haiti accelerated by more than 20 \n     percent over the deforestation rate in Haiti during the \n     period beginning in 1990 and ending in 1999;\n       (7) as a result, during the period described in paragraph \n     (6), Haiti lost--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent (approximately 11,000 hectares) of \n     the forest cover of Haiti; and\n       (B) approximately 22 percent of the total forest and \n     woodland habitat of Haiti;\n       (8) poverty and economic pressures are--\n       (A) two factors that underlie the tropical deforestation of \n     Haiti; and\n       (B) manifested particularly through the clearing of vast \n     areas of forest for conversion to agricultural uses;\n       (9) 80 percent of the population of Haiti lives below the \n     poverty line;\n       (10) two-thirds of the population of Haiti depend on the \n     agricultural sector, which consists mainly of small-scale \n     subsistence farming;\n       (11) 60 percent of the population of Haiti relies on \n     charcoal produced from cutting down trees for cooking fuel;\n       (12) soil erosion represents the most direct effect of the \n     deforestation of Haiti, as the erosion has--\n       (A) lowered the productivity of the land due to the poor \n     soils underlying the tropical forests;\n       (B) worsened the severity of droughts and flooding events;\n       (C) led to further deforestation;\n       (D) significantly decreased the quality and, as a result, \n     quantity of freshwater and clean drinking water available to \n     the population of Haiti; and\n       (E) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees \n     in Haiti;\n       (13) tropical forests provide forest cover to soften the \n     effect of heavy rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the \n     soil with their roots;\n       (14) when trees are cleared, rainfall runs off the soil \n     more quickly and contributes to floods and further erosion;\n       (15) in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne struck Haiti, killing \n     approximately 3,000, and affecting over 200,000, people, \n     partly because deforestation had resulted in the clearing of \n     large hillsides, which enabled rainwater to run off directly \n     to settlements located at the bottom of the slopes;\n       (16) research conducted by the United Nations Environmental \n     Programme has revealed a direct (89 percent) correlation \n     between the extent of the deforestation of a country and the \n     incidence of victims per weather event in the country;\n       (17) the consequences of the January 2010 earthquake in \n     Haiti, which destroyed much of the infrastructure of Port au \n     Prince, were greater because of deforestation which reduced \n     hillside stability and increased the likelihood of mudslides, \n     soil erosion, and flooding--factors that also negatively \n     impacted the water supply and heightened concerns for the \n     spread of waterborne diseases;\n       (18) finding economic benefits for local communities from \n     sustainable uses of tropical forests is critical for the \n     long-term protection of the tropical forests in Haiti;\n       (19) On July 29, 2010, the Supplemental Appropriations Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-212) was enacted into law, which \n     included $25,000,000 for ``the reforestation and other \n     restoration of Haiti's' key watersheds''; and\n       (20) tropical reforestation efforts would provide new \n     sources of jobs, income, and investments in Haiti by--\n       (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling \n     programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable \n     agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber \n     harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services; \n     and\n       (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income \n     through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of \n     which exist on small scales in Haiti and in the rest of the \n     region.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     assistance to the Government of Haiti to develop and \n     implement, or improve, nationally appropriate policies and \n     actions--\n       (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in \n     Haiti;\n       (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and \n     reforestation in a measurable, reportable, and verifiable \n     manner--\n       (A) to restore social and economic conditions for \n     environmental recovery of 35 percent of Haiti's land surface \n     area within 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (B) to restore within 30 years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act the forest cover of Haiti to at least 10 percent \n     of the land in Haiti; and\n       (C) to establish within 10 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act agroforestry cover of land in Haiti to \n     more than 25 percent; and\n       (3) to improve sustainable resource management at the \n     watershed scale.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (2) Faisal Shahzad, who was attempting to flee the country \n     after attempting to set off a car-bomb in Times Square.\n       Whereas PNR data has been used to prevent the travel of \n     many other individuals considered to be national security \n     threats or otherwise inadmissible to the United States;\n       Whereas the privacy protections in the current EU-U.S. PNR \n     Agreement are robust, and a February 2010 joint review by \n     both signatories found no privacy violations, misuse, or \n     injury from the collection of PNR data by the Department of \n     Homeland Security;\n       Whereas although the United States and the European Union \n     have different governing mechanisms that lead to differences \n     in how oversight is conducted, both governments have a firm \n     commitment to the protection of data and the respect of \n     individual privacy;\n       Whereas in February 2011, the European Commission proposed \n     that the European Union create its own PNR system in order to \n     identify potential terrorists and other dangerous criminals;\n       Whereas in 2010, the Washington Post--\n       (1) recognized the important role that PNR data plays in \n     securing international aviation;

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. Res. 189.\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 189) recognizing and honoring Harmon \n     Killebrew and expressing the condolences of the Senate to his \n     family on his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will just make a very brief comment. I \nam not a great baseball fan. I am a baseball fan. I am sure there are \nbetter fans than me. I have followed baseball all of my life, starting \nas a little boy. I have listened to baseball games, and I would have \nloved to have met Harmon Killebrew. He was a man who, before anyone \never suggested steroids, was so powerful. He holds 10th or 11th place \nin the history of baseball for hitting home runs. According to what \neveryone says about him, he was such a nice man in addition to that.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to talk about a Minnesota icon. \nMinnesotans and baseball fans across this country are celebrating the \nlife of Harmon Killebrew today. We lost the great slugger yesterday.\n  I never met Mr. Killebrew, which is kind of hard for me to believe, \nbecause, similar to so many Minnesotans, I felt that I knew him. He was \nthe heart of the Minnesota Twins franchise, not just because of the \ntowering home runs he hit but because, on and off the field, he carried \nhimself with so much dignity and grace and humility.\n  I was 9 years old when the old Washington Senators moved to Minnesota \nand became the Minnesota Twins. We were so excited to have a major \nleague team in Minnesota, and Killebrew was the heart and the anchor of \nthe franchise, batting cleanup and cracking out 400-foot-plus home runs \nwith his unbelievably powerful swing.\n  By 1965, Killebrew, along with Tony Oliva, Zoilo Versalles, Bob \nAllison, Earl Battey, Jim Perry, Jim Kaat, and Mudcat Grant unseated \nthe Yankee dynasty and took the American League pennant. I was sitting \nalong the left field line of Metropolitan Stadium the game before the \nAll-Star break that year when Killebrew hit a ninth-inning walk-off \nhomer to beat the Yankees. It was not a typical Killebrew home run. It \nwas a line drive that just shot out of the park into the left field \nstands, and it sent us into the All-Star break in first place. I, along \nwith lots of Twins fans, believe that was the blow that was the key to \nthat season.\n  As I said, that rope of a homer was not a typical Killebrew home run. \nHe was known for these towering blasts. I remember one in particular. I \nwas watching the Twins on TV one summer night with my dad and my \nbrother, and the Twins were playing the Tigers in Detroit in the old \nTiger Stadium.\n  And Killebrew got ahold of one and it cleared the left field roof, \none of just four shots that cleared that roof in the 87-year history of \nthe stadium. My recollection is that by its trajectory, the ball was \nestimated to be a 480-foot home run. Killebrew hit the longest ball in \nthe history of Metropolitan Stadium--a 530-foot shot!\n  Now Killebrew was not that big a man. He was 5 feet 11 inches and \nabout 210 pounds. In his major league career, Harmon Killebrew hit 573 \nhome runs, all without the aid of steroids. Killebrew grew up in rural \nIdaho. According to one press account I read last night, Killebrew \nclaimed to have gotten his strength from carrying 10-gallon milk cans \nduring the summers as a youth.\n  But I know a little something, second hand, about where the power for \nthose home runs really came from. His legs. See, about 20 years ago, a \nfriend of mine did a little film with Killebrew, and travelled to his \nhome in Idaho.\n  My friend asked Killebrew where his power came from, and Harmon said \nthat it came from his legs. Killebrew told my friend that the \nKillebrews all had incredibly powerful legs and that his father, \nKillebrew's father, could jump over a cow from a standing position.\n  I had always hoped to meet Killebrew and ask him about that. I had a \nchance to. In 2005, there was a commemoration of the 40th anniversary \nof the 1965 Twins team. It was held in a tent after a Twins' game at \nthe Metrodome.\n  I was in the tent and I got Tony Oliva's autograph, and Camilo \nPascual's. And I saw Killebrew and he was surrounded by fans. And I \njust wanted to give him some space. He was a totally accessible guy. \nEvery Twins fan knew that from his years on the team and his years in \nthe Twins broadcast booth. But for some reason I decided to talk to \nanother member of that great team, and figured I would talk to Harmon a \nlittle later. But by the time I tried to find him again, he was gone.\n  So, I never met Harmon Killebrew. But, again, like all Twins fans, I \nfelt I knew him. A gracious, humble man that we in Minnesota were \nprivileged to watch, and who we were privileged to have represent our \nState.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, my colleagues Senators Jim Risch, Amy \nKlobuchar and Al Franken join me today in honoring the life of Harmon \nClayton Killebrew. We join with his family and friends in mourning his \npassing and paying tribute to his inspirational life.\n  Harmon Killebrew began his exemplary athletic career in Idaho. He was \nborn June 29, 1936, in Payette, ID, where he earned multiple awards as \nan athlete in baseball, basketball and football at Payette High School. \nHarmon explained his childhood in Idaho in a way that fellow Idahoans \ncould clearly understand. He often shared this quote from his \nchildhood. ``My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. \nMother would come out and say, `You're tearing up the grass'; `We're \nnot raising grass,' Dad would reply. We're raising boys.' '' We \nunderstand Harmon often credited then-U.S. Senator from Idaho, Herman \nWelker, for recommending to then-Washington Senators owners, the \nGriffith family, that their team sign Killebrew, and at age 17, \nKillebrew signed his first professional baseball contract with the \nWashington Senators.\n  He went on to play his first seven seasons here in Washington, DC, \nbefore moving with the franchise to Minnesota in 1961, when it would be \nrenamed the Minnesota Twins. Killebrew played 14 seasons in Minnesota, \nmaking the All-Star team in 10 of those seasons. He also competed in \nthe 1965 World Series, where his Twins would lose to the Los Angeles \nDodgers in seven games. Killebrew completed his professional baseball \ncareer in 1975, playing one season with the Kansas City Royals.\n  His remarkable skills earned him due recognition. He was awarded the \nAmerican League Most Valuable Player Award in 1969, when he led the \nleague in both home runs and runs batted in. Killebrew's No. 3 uniform \nwas retired by the Minnesota Twins, and he was elected to the Baseball \nHall of Fame in 1984. His accomplishment of 573 career home runs \ncurrently ranks 11th on the All-Time baseball list.\n  Killebrew's legacy extends far beyond the baseball field. He remained \nactive in Idaho following his retirement, including taking the lead on \nmany important charitable efforts. In 1977, Killebrew and former Idaho \nRepresentative Ralph Harding founded the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf \nTournament, in honor of Killebrew's former Minnesota Twins teammate, \nwho died from leukemia in 1976. Since then, this annual tournament, \nplayed in Sun Valley, ID, has raised more than $11 million, which has \nbeen leveraged with matching grants to over $25 million, for leukemia \nand cancer research. Each year, these proceeds are divided equally \nbetween St. Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute in Boise, Idaho and \nthe University of Minnesota Cancer Research Center.\n  Harmon Killebrew's talent and hard work have inspired countless young \nathletes, and he leaves behind a legacy of encouraging skill and \ndedicated service. We extend our condolences and prayers to his family, \nfriends and loved ones and deep gratitude for his compassion, service \nand leadership.\n  Mr. REID. I am very happy to ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 189) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Ribbs became the first African-\n     American driver to compete in the Indianapolis 500;\n       Whereas the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, by hosting the \n     IZOD IndyCar Series, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the MotoGP \n     Series, and the Formula One Series, is the only facility in \n     the world that has played host to these 4 elite worldwide \n     racing series;\n       Whereas every May since 1981 the Indianapolis Motor \n     Speedway has served as the backdrop for the annual Armed \n     Forces Induction Ceremony, in which citizens of Indiana who \n     have volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces are \n     administered the oath of enlistment;\n       Whereas in 1987, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was \n     officially listed on the National Park Service list of \n     National Historic Landmarks as the oldest continuously \n     operated automobile racecourse; and\n       Whereas the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race has played an \n     enormous part in shaping and defining the City of \n     Indianapolis, the State of Indiana, United States \n     motorsports, and the United States automobile industry, and \n     is a great source of pride to all citizens of Indiana: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 100th anniversary \n     of the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/18/senate-section/article/S3116-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 840\n\n  Mr. REID.
