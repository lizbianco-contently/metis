Mr. President, I expect to be joined in a moment by my \ncolleague and good friend, Senator Cardin, and he and I and perhaps \nothers will be talking about the deteriorating situation in Russia with \nregard to human rights and the rule of law.\n  I came to the floor in November to speak about the deteriorating \nsituation. I spoke about the wrongful imprisonment and tragic death of \nRussian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.\n  Mr. President, let me state that at this point I will be happy to \nyield to my colleague from Maryland to actually kick off this \ndiscussion. I think that was the agreed-upon order, and staff believed \nI would have a few moments. But I would be glad to defer to my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 \nminutes available for a colloquy controlled by Senator Wicker and \nmyself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Wicker for \nstarting us off on the discussion of what is happening in Russia today.\n  I rise today, along with some of my colleagues, to bring attention to \nthe growing issue of human rights violations in Russia, typified by the \ncase of Sergei Magnitsky. Just last week, as part of a bilateral \nPresidential commission, Attorney General Holder met with the the \nRussian Minister of Justice to discuss the rule of law issues. That \nsame week, Russian officials moved in their criminal prosecution of \nSergei Magnitsky. Mr. President, I remind you that Mr. Magnitsky has \nbeen dead for more than 2 years.\n  Last May I joined with Senator McCain, Senator Wicker, and 11 other \nSenators from both parties to introduce the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of \nLaw Accountability Act. We now have nearly 30 cosponsors, and I urge \nmore to join us and look at ways to move forward on helping halt abuses \nlike this in the future.\n  After exposing the largest known tax fraud in Russian history, Sergei \nMagnitsky, a Russian tax lawyer, working for an American firm in \nMoscow, was falsely arrested for crimes he did not commit and tortured \nin prison. Six months later, he became seriously ill and was \nconsistently denied medical attention, despite 20 formal requests. \nThen, on the night of November 16, 2009, he went into critical \ncondition. But instead of being treated in a hospital, he was put in an \nisolation cell, chained to a bed, beaten by eight prison guards with \nrubber batons for 1 hour and 18 minutes until he was dead. Sergei \nMagnitsky was 37 years old and left behind a wife, two children, and a \ndependent mother.\n  While the facts surrounding his arrest, detention, and death have \nbeen independently verified and accepted at the highest levels of \nRussian Government, those implicated in his death and the corruption he \nexposed remain unpunished, in positions of authority, and some have \neven been decorated and promoted. Following Magnitsky's death, they \nhave continued to target others, including American business interests \nin Moscow.\n  These officials have been credibly linked to similar crimes and have \nties to the Russian mafia, international arms trafficking, and even \ndrug cartels. The money they stole from the Russian budget was \nlaundered through a network of banks, including two in the United \nStates. Calls for an investigation have fallen on deaf ears.\n  In an Orwellian turn of events, the law enforcement officers accused \nby Magnitsky and those complicit in his murder are moving to try him \nfor the very tax crimes they committed. Think of the irony. He exposed \ncorruption in Russia. As a result, he was arrested, imprisoned, \ntortured, and killed. Now those who perpetrated the crime on him are \ncharging him, after his death, with the crimes they committed.\n  We cannot be silent. One of the most articulate voices in the Senate \non this issue has been Senator Wicker, who is the leading Republican on \nthe Helsinki Commission, and I applaud him for his efforts not only in \nbringing the Magnitsky abuse to public attention and what is happening \nin Russia, but in many other areas where human rights violations have \noccurred.\n  I will be glad to allow my colleague some time on this issue, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague from Maryland. And yes, indeed, \nthere are other cases of human rights violations, not the least of \nwhich I have highlighted time and again on this Senate floor--being the \ncases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. Each is an appalling \nstory such as the one Senator Cardin pointed out with regard to Mr. \nMagnitsky, a story about the corruption within the Russian Government \nitself. My colleagues and I will continue to speak out about these \ncases in the hope that attention will inspire change.\n  I look forward to the day when the focus of a floor statement can be \nabout the progress we have made with Russia. This is something to which \nmy colleague and I dearly look forward. We look forward to the day when \nRussia begins to uphold democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n  Unfortunately, today is not the day. In recent months, an \noverwhelming number of headlines out of Russia focus on the Russian \nspring. Opposition groups, citizens, and, in many cases, the mainstream \nmedia have reacted to moves by the Russian regime they view as no \nlonger acceptable.\n  On September 24 of last year, President Medvedev struck a deal that \nwould clear the way for his predecessor, Vladimir Putin, to run next \nmonth for a third Presidential term. As the Wall Street Journal noted \nin an opinion piece last December:\n\n       Even the most thick-skinned citizens saw that turning the \n     Presidency into the object of a private swap made a mockery \n     of the Constitution.\n\n  Russia's fraudulent parliamentary elections in December further \ndeepened the political crisis and affirmed the erosion of democracy. \nSecretary Clinton--our Secretary of State--called them neither free nor \nfair. So this is a bipartisan denunciation of the process.\n  Observers have claimed that 12 to 15 percent of the votes were \nfalsified in favor of the United Russia Party. According to most \nanalysts, improvement is not expected in the upcoming Presidential \nelection this March.\n  But these corrupt actions have not been ignored. On December 10, more \nthan 60,000 Russians took to the streets of Moscow in protest. \nSimilarly, on February 4, some 120,000 citizens from across the \npolitical spectrum braved below-zero weather during a prodemocracy \nmarch in central Moscow. Their demands were clear: Release political \nprisoners such as Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. Allow opposition parties to \nregister. Hold free and fair elections. And pledge not to give a single \nvote to Putin on March 4. Similar rallies were held in small towns \nacross Russia.\n  We can be glad for the call for reform and we are glad it is growing \nlouder. According to a February poll by Russia's independent Levada \nCenter, 43 percent of Russians now support prodemocracy protests. \nAdditional protests are already scheduled for later this month.\n  Specifically let me once again underscore the horrific facts about \nSergei Magnitsky, because they need to be heard, and perhaps some of \nour colleagues were not listening the first time.\n  In the midst of this public outcry and demand for democratic process, \nthe news out of Russia with regard to Mr. Magnitsky is almost \nunbelievable. Last week, it was revealed that the police in Russia plan \nto retry the tax evasion case of the late Sergei Magnitsky. As many of \nmy colleagues are aware, Mr. Magnitsky is already dead. He died in \nRussian detention more than 2 years ago. He was a lawyer and a partner \nin an American-owned law firm based in Moscow. He was married, with two \nchildren, as my friend has said. His clients included the Hermitage \nFund, which is the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia.\n  Through his investigative work on behalf of Hermitage, Mr. Magnitsky\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\ndiscovered that Russian Interior Ministry officers, tax officials, and \norganized criminals worked together to steal $230 million in public \nfunds, orchestrating the largest tax rebate fraud in the history of the \nRussian Republic.\n  In 2008, Mr. Magnitsky voluntarily gave sworn testimony against \nofficials from the Interior Ministry Russian tax department and the \nprivate criminals whom he found had perpetrated the fraud. A month \nlater, an arrest was made--and the person arrested was Mr. Magnitsky \nhimself. He was placed in pretrial detention and held without trial for \n12 months.\n  While in custody, he was pressured and tortured by Russian officials, \nhoping he would withdraw his testimony and falsely incriminate himself \nand his client. But he refused to do so, and his condition worsened and \nhis health worsened. He spent months without medical care. Requests for \nmedical examination and surgery were denied by Russian government \nofficials.\n  On November 13, 2009, Mr. Magnitsky's condition deteriorated \ndramatically. Doctors saw him on November 16, when he was transferred \nto a Moscow detention center that actually had medical facilities. Yet, \ninstead of being treated at those facilities immediately, he was placed \nin an isolation cell, handcuffed, and beaten until he died.\n  In the months following his death, Russian officials repeatedly \ndenied facts concerning his health condition. The Russian state \ninvestigative committee claimed that Magnitsky was not pressured or \ntortured, but died naturally of heart disease, and his death was \nnobody's fault. This is from the Russian Government.\n  Since Mr. Magnitsky's death, two subsequent reviews have helped \nclarify some of the facts. In late December of 2009, the Moscow Public \nOversight Commission, an independent watchdog mandated under Russian \nlaw to monitor human rights, issued its conclusions on this case. This \nindependent Russian oversight commission stated that in detention, \nMagnitsky had been subjected to torture, physical and psychological \npressure; that he was denied medical care; and that his right to life \nhad been violated by the Russian state.\n  The conclusions were sent to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, \nthe Russian State Investigative Committee, the Russian Ministry of \nJustice, and the Presidential Commission. None of these agencies has \nresponded to the report's conclusions.\n  More recently, a second finding was issued by the Russian President's \nHuman Rights Council. It issued its independent expert findings on the \ncase. The report found that Magnitsky was arrested on trumped-up \ncharges--yet, they are being brought forward again after his \nunfortunate death--in breach of Russian law and in breach of the \nEuropean human rights convention, that his prosecution was unlawful, \nthat he was systemically denied medical care, that he was beaten in \ncustody which was the proximate cause of his death, that his medical \nrecords were falsified, and that there is an ongoing coverup and \nresistance by all government bodies to investigate.\n  Senator Cardin and I and Senator McCain and others have no choice but \nto continue coming to this floor, to continue using every forum we can \npossibly use to bring these facts to light.\n  I have taken quite a bit of our time with my prepared statement, so I \nyield back to my friend from Maryland as to any other thoughts he might \nhave. I want to commend his leadership with regard to the legislation.\n  Do I understand now that we have some 30 cosponsors?\n  Mr. CARDIN. That is correct. And, again, I thank the Senator for his \nleadership and I thank him for his comments.\n  We have 30 cosponsors of the Magnitsky legislation and I am going to \nbe encouraging more of our colleagues to join us in cosponsorship. I \nwant to talk a little bit about that, if I might. But let me underscore \nthe point Senator Wicker made.\n  Mr. Magnitsky died 2 years ago for crimes perpetrated on him that \nhave been well documented. The Russian Federation is now charging him \nafter his death for those crimes--after his death. Not even in Stalin's \ntime did they try people after they died. This is the first time in \nRussian history that a man has been tried after his death. Further, \nthey have summoned Mr. Magnitsky's widow and ailing mother as witnesses \nagainst their husband and son. This is a new chapter in brazen \nimpunity.\n  An editorial last week in the Financial Times observed that:\n\n       If he is convicted, the accused's citizenship could be \n     revoked, he could be exiled, and forced to die somewhere \n     else.\n\n  That might be funny if it weren't real.\n  If that weren't enough, the Russian Justice Minister recently \nproposed that the United States and Russia conclude an extradition \ntreaty.\n  Legal farces like we have seen in the case of Sergei Magnitsky and \nmany others bring reasonable people to only two conclusions, both of \nwhich are profoundly disturbing: Either senior leaders are not the ones \nrunning the country or the senior leadership is complicit in these \noutrages.\n\n  The Magnitsky story sounds like a Hollywood thriller, but his case is \nreal and the rampant corruption, violence, and lawlessness do exist in \nthe Russian Government. His cause has become a global campaign for \njustice.\n  As Senator Wicker pointed out, the popular opinion in Russia is on \nthe side of justice. There have been over 4,000 stories on Sergei \nMagnitsky since his death in Russia.\n  We know from countless historical cases, such as the death in police \ncustody of the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in 1977, that one \nperson's life and sometimes death can change the system. Since we are \nnow living on the Internet, such change often comes much faster than \nexpected.\n  I am going to comment about the legislation I filed and the need for \nus to consider that, but I notice Senator Shaheen is on the floor. \nSenator Shaheen is a member of the Helsinki Commission. She also chairs \nthe Subcommittee on European Affairs on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and has been an outspoken champion on behalf of human rights. \nI am pleased she is here, and I wish to give her an opportunity to talk \nabout this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin and Senator \nWicker for their efforts today coming down to the floor to raise this \nimportant human rights issue.\n  As you say, if we didn't see the facts, we would believe this was \nfiction, what is going on in Russia today. But I think these efforts \nare particularly important given what is happening today in Russia.\n  We have seen historic demonstrations on the streets of Moscow over \nthe last several months. Ordinary Russian citizens, fed up with nearly \na decade of corruption, have courageously taken to the streets to \ndemand their voices be heard. The fraudulent Duma elections and the \ncynical and manipulative decision by Prime Minister Putin to return to \nthe Presidency have reawakened civil society throughout Russia.\n  As a leading Russian social activist Alexei Navalny wrote from his \njail cell following the peaceful December demonstrations:\n\n       We all have the only weapon we need and the most powerful. \n     That is the sense of self-respect.\n\n  Today, as we call for justice for human rights abuses in Russia, we \nalso stand with those brave Russian citizens who have risked so much in \ncalling for their rights to be respected, just as Sergei Magnitsky did.\n  As we have seen throughout this last year of upheaval around the \nglobe, the rising voice of a public driven to peaceful protest can be \ndeafening. Prime Minister Putin and his regime would be wise to listen \nto the people of Russia.\n  I also want to echo what Senators Wicker and Cardin have said about \nthe importance of passing the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act. There are now 28 Senate cosponsors. I am one of \nthose cosponsors and am proud to be, and I want to associate myself \nwith what Senators have said on the floor of the Senate today.\n  The case of Mr. Magnitsky is a tragic one. He was falsely imprisoned, \nbeaten, denied medical care, and ultimately killed, as you all have so \neloquently explained. And to this day, no one has been held accountable \nfor his tragic and unnecessary killing. We stand here today to press \nfor accountability in Mr. Magnitsky's death. However, I think it\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nis important for us to reiterate that this is more than simply a \nquestion of one man's tragic case.\n  The State Department's human rights report for this year described \nnumerous violations, as Senator Cardin said so well: attacks on \njournalists, physical abuse of citizens, harsh prison conditions, \npolitically motivated imprisonments, and other government harassments \nand violence.\n  The European Court of Human Rights has issued more than 210 \njudgments, holding Russia responsible for grave human rights \nviolations, including abductions, killings, and torture in Chechnya and \nthroughout the northern Caucasus.\n  There are many more cases like Magnitsky, which is why the bill is so \nimportant. It seeks to ensure that no human rights abusers, in Russia \nor elsewhere in the world, are granted the privilege of traveling to \nthis country or utilizing our American financial system.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on European Affairs, I was pleased to \npreside over a hearing on the Magnitsky bill and on the state of human \nrights in Russia. I thank Chairman Kerry for helping to make that \nhearing possible.\n  During the hearing we had a very constructive conversation with State \nDepartment officials, and we heard unanimous support for the \nlegislation from an impressive panel of human rights activists and \nRussian experts. We have also received letters that I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record from leading human rights and \ncivil society leaders in Russia calling on the Senate to pass the \nMagnitsky bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       People's Freedom Party,\n\n                                        Russia, December 11, 2011.\n     Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     Chairman,\n     Sen. John Barrasso,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on European Affairs, U.S. Senate \n         Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to express my strong support \n     for S. 1039, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability \n     Act of 2011, currently under consideration by the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Last Saturday, over 100,000 Russian citizens gathered in \n     central Moscow to protest against the authoritarian and \n     kleptocratic regime of Vladimir Putin--the regime that has \n     curtailed media freedom, turned elections into a farce, and \n     Parliament and the judiciary into rubber-stamps, put \n     opponents behind bars, and presided over unprecedented \n     corruption (the latest Transparency International Index \n     places Russia 143rd, below Eritrea and Sierra Leone). Too \n     often, as in the case of Sergei Magnitsky, the corruption and \n     the lawlessness result in human tragedy.\n       Apart from robbing the Russian people of its wealth and its \n     dignity, Mr. Putin's regime is robbing it of its voice. The \n     December 4th parliamentary election was marred by widespread \n     fraud: some 13 million votes were stolen as a result of \n     ballot-stuffing and other manipulations designed to preserve \n     the ruling United Russia party's majority (even with this, \n     the party received less than 50 percent of the vote). Nine \n     opposition parties across the political spectrum, including \n     the People's Freedom Party, were denied access to the ballot \n     altogether. This behavior violates not only Russian, but also \n     international norms--including the statutes of the OSCE, to \n     which both Russia and the United States are party.\n       It is time to end the impunity for those who continue to \n     show contempt for international norms and values, while \n     enjoying the privileges of free travel and financial \n     interactions in the West. S.1039 would provide an important \n     measure of accountability for those who violate the basic--\n     and internationally protected--rights and freedoms of Russian \n     citizens. It is time to tell thieves and human rights \n     violators that they are no longer welcome.\n       It is the task of Russian citizens and Russian citizens \n     alone to bring about political change and democratic \n     governance in our country. But by passing S. 1039, the U.S. \n     Senate can do more to help the cause of democracy and the \n     rule of law in Russia than by all the statements and speeches \n     combined.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Boris Nemtsov,\n     Co-Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                16 September 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate.\n     Dear Messrs. Senators: This letter is an expression of \n     support for S. 1039, the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \n     Accountability Act of 2011'', currently pending before the \n     Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       This bill prescribes sanctions in the form of denial of \n     visas to the US and freezing of bank accounts in the USA for \n     persons--including officials of the Russian Federation--who \n     have engaged in human rights violations, ones such as abuses \n     of power whether for personal or political motives or for \n     covering up abuses by colleagues.\n       Egregious abuses of human rights are, unfortunately, common \n     in today's Russia. Sergei Magnitsky, the namesake of the \n     bill, was deprived of his liberty without cause and in \n     violation of basic principles of justice. Russian authorities \n     were responsible for his perishing while in custody. \n     Magnitsky ended up in jail because, executing his official \n     duties, he discovered theft from the Russian budget of a \n     large sum of money, committed by a group of senior Russian \n     officials. Russian authorities continue to evade bringing the \n     officials guilty of Magnitsky's death to justice.\n       For us it is very important that US legislators take steps \n     to bring the persons who are violating the law and abusing \n     power in Russia to justice. We believe human rights should \n     not be sidelined for perceived political interests.\n       Human rights should not be sidelined for the sake of \n     political interests, whatever they may be.\n       Sergei Magnitsky fell victim to inhuman Russian justice. No \n     small number of our citizens are illegally deprived of \n     liberty in consequence of the defects of this system. \n     Impunity for those who fabricated the charges against \n     Magnitsky and caused him to die, gives free rein to other \n     officials, who enrich themselves with the property of others \n     or pursue the political opponents of the authorities. The \n     felonious enforcement cliques seize the property of their \n     victims who resist these takeovers, pursue them and deprive \n     them of their liberty for many long years. And in detention \n     they can be subjected to abuse and even torture.\n       The most famous victims of such takeovers are the owner of \n     the YUKOS company Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the manager of \n     this company Platon Lebedev. Amnesty International has \n     recognized both of them as prisoners of conscience. The \n     result of their arrest and the takeover of the company became \n     expansion of the gigantic economic empire owned by persons \n     from Prime Minister V. Putin's inner circle.\n       Opposition politicians, human rights advocates and civic \n     activists have become victims of persecutions and unlawful \n     arrests under made-up pretexts. Such persecutions will not \n     cease as long as those who are responsible for the death of \n     Magnitsky, for the imprisonment of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, \n     and the crackdown on Russian civil society remain unpunished.\n       Bill S. 1039 prescribes sanctions not only with respect to \n     the Magnitsky case, but applies to the entire range of human \n     rights abuses, among others, in Russia as well. Accordingly, \n     officials responsible for the politically motivated \n     persecution of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and the \n     other victims of the persecution of the YUKOS company as well \n     as those who impede the exercise of fundamental democratic \n     liberties, ones such as freedom of assembly, freedom to \n     create parties, freedom of elections etc. ought to be \n     included in this list. This is a list that is much longer \n     that that list of roughly 60 individuals sent by Senator \n     Cardin to the US State Department in 2010. Such a list must \n     from now on be supplemented with new names.\n       The threat of sanctions against the perpetrators of the \n     Magnitsky tragedy struck a raw nerve with the Russian \n     officials responsible for this tragedy. The consistent \n     implementation of international pressure on the \n     corruptioneers in the leadership circles of Russia will be a \n     significant support for our civil society and for those \n     honest people within the Russian power structures who are \n     trying to renew and reform government institutions.\n       We call upon you, Honorable Senators, to support S. 1039, \n     the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of \n     2011.'' We hope that it will be considered without delay and \n     favorably in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and \n     then by the full Senate.\n           Respectfully,\n         Ludmilla Alexeeva, chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki \n           Group; Lev Ponomarev, head of the All-Russia Movement \n           For Human Rights; Nina Katerli, writer, member of the \n           Russian PEN-CENTRE, member of the Public Expert Board \n           of the All-Russia Movement For Human Rights; Lidiya \n           Grafova, journalist; Liya Akhedzhakova, people's artist \n           of the RF; Natalia Fateyeva, people's artist of the RF; \n           Boris Vishnevsky, observer for Novaya gazeta; \n           Konstantin Azadovskii, literary historian, Chairman of \n           the executive committee of the Saint Petersburg PEN-\n           club; Eldar Ryazanov, film director, scriptwriter, \n           poet; Alexey Devotchenko, Russian theater and movie \n           actor, honoured artist of Russia; Boris Nemtsov, \n           politician; Mark Urnov, Russian political scientist, \n           scientific head of the Applied Political Science \n           Department of the Higher School of Economics State \n           University; Victor Shenderovich, Soviet and Russian \n           satirist, TV and radio host, liberal publicist, human \n           rights advocate; Vladimir Ryzhkov, opposition \n           politician; Rafail Ganelin, historian, corresponding \n           member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Around the world, governments are also taking up this\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\nimportant call. The European Parliament, Canada, and The Netherlands \nare considering similar pieces of legislation. This summer, the U.S. \nState Department barred dozens of Russian officials from traveling to \nthe United States over their involvement in the death of Magnitsky.\n  I want to commend the administration, and particularly Secretary \nClinton for her strong words condemning the recent fraudulent elections \nin Russia. But despite all these efforts, there is more we can do to \nsupport human rights in civil society, freedom of expression in Russia.\n  Passing the Magnitsky bill this year is one of them. In the midst of \nan election year, at a time of difficult partisanship, I believe this \nis one effort--as we have seen so well from Senator Cardin and Senator \nWicker today--this is one effort on which both sides of the aisle can \nagree. We stand today unambiguously in support of the rule of law, \ndemocracy, and respect for human rights in Russia. I hope our \ncolleagues in the Congress and at the State Department will work \nconstructively in the months ahead to pass this critical legislation.\n  Before I yield the floor, I also think it is important to call \nattention to the particularly egregious act that Russia committed in \nrecent days before the United Nations, when they vetoed the Security \nCouncil resolution aimed at halting the ongoing violence in Syria. \nToday, more than 25,000 people have fled Syria; more than 7,000 \ninnocent Syrians have died at the hands of President Assad. Despite \nSyria's growing isolation, Russia continues to harbor and arm the \nSyrian regime. This is unacceptable. I think our passage of the \nMagnitsky bill will send a very strong sign to Russia that not only in \nthe Magnitsky case and other human abuses in-country are they going to \nbe held accountable, but their actions internationally will also make \nthem accountable to the international community.\n  Again, I say thank you to Senators Cardin and Wicker for their \nleadership on this issue. I am pleased and honored to be able to join \nthem in making this fight.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we were honored to have Senator Shaheen \njoin us. I know there are others who would like to be here today.\n  We are here to tell the sordid facts of this case. But we are also \nhere because change can occur. If this were completely hopeless, what \nwould be the point of this exercise? Change occurred in Eastern Europe. \nI must admit there was a time in my younger days when I doubted it \nwould ever occur. My hat is off to the intrepid members of the Public \nOversight Commission who had the courage to issue a report critical of \ntheir government to the Russian President's Human Rights Council. So \nvoices are being heard. There is a thread of truth coming from the \nalmost Iron Curtain of authoritarianism that we have reverted to in \nRussia.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned other organizations in \nRussia. I am glad she has had those letters printed in the Record.\n  I also point out I have to applaud the international reaction. In \nDecember, the European Parliament passed a resolution recommending an \nEU-wide travel ban and asset freeze for officials tied to Mr. \nMagnitsky's death.\n  We need to act as a Senate and as a Congress. I am calling on every \nSenator within the sound of my voice today, every legislative director \ndealing with defense and foreign policy issues, once again to look at \nthe Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act.\n  I will tell my friend from New Hampshire that the number is now up to \n30, we learned on the floor today from Senator Cardin, so we have 30 \nSenators involved. We ought to have a majority of Senators before the \nend of this day, if people would just take the time to look. I join her \nin congratulating the Foreign Relations Committee on bringing further \nlight to this issue. I thank the State Department, as she said. I will \nsimply conclude my portion by saying recent events make it even more \nimportant that the Foreign Relations Committee and that this Senate \ntake up and pass this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to consider \njoining us on this legislation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If I might, I thank Senator Shaheen for her comments, but \nmore importantly I thank her for her leadership. The hearing she held \non the Sergei Magnitsky bill was very helpful.\n  First, I think in answer to the question of why we should care, we \nall understand America's leadership on moral issues. The world looks to \nAmerica to stand against these fundamental abuses of human rights, so \nthat in and of itself is a reason for us to act.\n  It is also apparent from the hearings that actions of these \ncriminals, these violations in Russia, involve our financial \ninstitutions. So we are talking about the integrity of American \ncompanies to be able to do business internationally.\n  It is not only the moral issue about which we have a right to speak \nout. As my colleagues on the floor know, in the commitments we all \nsigned onto in Helsinki in 1975, we had committed ourselves to basic \nhuman rights and the obligation of any member state to question the \nconduct in another state. Russia is a signator of the Helsinki Final \nAct. The United States is a signator. We have a responsibility to bring \nthis to the world's attention.\n  We can do more. What can we do about this? There are many aspects of \nthe Magnitsky tragedy that are difficult for us to pursue in the United \nStates. It cannot be through our justice system; it has to be their \njustice system that has to be reformed. But there are steps we can \ntake. The legislation we all filed recognizes the right to visit \nAmerica is a privilege granted by the United States. The visa is a \nprivilege. There is no guaranteed right to come to America.\n  One thing we can do is say those who are committing these gross human \nrights violations should not be given the privilege of entering the \nUnited States.\n  I wish to acknowledge and thank Secretary of State Clinton for taking \naction against human rights violators. That is the right policy. The \nlegislation we have authored institutionalizes a process where we deny \nthe right for those individuals to visit, to come to the United States.\n  Obviously, that has a price to them. Of course, what we are trying to \ndo is get the government--in this case Russia--to do what is right.\n  The second thing we could do is deal with their financial \nparticipation in U.S. institutions. These people do get involved in \ninternational finance. They do have resources that travel through U.S. \nfinancial institutions. We do have laws that allow us to hold those \nfunds through due process. We can do that.\n  That is the reason why the legislation we have talked about today, \nthe legislation I introduced, along with my colleagues, would \ninstitutionalize those types of changes. For those who think it may not \nmean much, let me remind them about what we did when the Soviet Union \ndenied the rights of Jews to be able to leave the country. In the \nCongress, we took action by legislation. Many said: Would that make any \ndifference?\n  It made a huge difference. It brought about change in the Soviet \nUnion. Other countries followed our leadership. As both my colleagues \nhave pointed out, if we act, other countries will act. It will become \nthe norm and that will help us establish the expectation that countries \ndo need to address tragedies such as Sergei Magnitsky's and, more \nimportantly, take steps so it never happens again. That is what we are \nattempting to do by moving forward with this legislation. As Senator \nWicker said, we do urge our colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Senator Wicker mentioned what is happening around the world. We see \ncountries go through a democratic transformation we never thought we \nwould see in our lifetime. It happened in Europe and they are now some \nmodel democracies, our NATO allies, countries that just a few decades \nago we thought would be our enemies to this day. So we have seen change \noccur. We want to be on the right side of this issue, the right side of \nhistory, on moving Russia forward with the types of reforms to which \nthe people of Russia are entitled.\n  We have the right to do that under the Helsinki Act. We have the \nresponsibility to point out these issues. We can take action that can \nmake a huge difference. That is why we are engaged in this discussion, \nto say we want Russia to do the right thing. We want to speak out to \nthe Russian people. We think we can play a very important role.\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\n  The U.S. Helsinki Commission, of which I had the honor to be the \nSenate chair and Senator Wicker is the lead Republican on the Senate \nside, has a proud history of putting a spotlight on problems. People do \nnot like name calling, but we have to point out where the violations \noccur. Unfortunately, if we do not do it, it becomes statistics. But if \nwe do it, we put a face on it--so we realize these are people who have \nfamilies who have been abused because they are trying to do the right \nthing--we can get action. That is why I am so proud of the legacy of \nthe U.S. Helsinki Commission and what we have been able to do.\n  This is another chapter in that proud history of saying we are going \nto stand for basic human rights, that is a priority for our country, we \ncan do better and we can do justice for Sergei Magnitsky and we can do \njustice for the people of Russia.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. One of the things the Senator talked about so \neloquently, as we talked about the ability of our financial systems to \nimpact what is happening in Russia--one of the things we heard about at \nthe hearing on the Magnitsky bill was from the head of the American \nChamber in Russia who talked about what the impact of this kind of case \nis on American companies trying to do business and the concern it \nraises about issues of corruption and the ability to operate freely in \nRussia. Does my colleague not agree that we can also urge those \ncompanies that are operating in Russia to speak out when cases such as \nthis happen and they have concerns about what it does to their business \nin the country?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's 30 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We are going to yield the floor. Let me agree with my \ncolleague, Senator Shaheen. She is absolutely right. It is going to be \neasier for them to speak out if they know we are going to continue \nraising these issues.\n  I thank Senators Shaheen and Wicker and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S810-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S810-S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor as someone who sat \nthrough the President's State of the Union and I have just come from a \nSenate Energy Committee hearing. I sat through the State of the Union \nnear the Secretary of Energy and was happy when I heard some of the \ncomments of the President when he talked about an ``all of the above'' \nstrategy, needing all of the sources of energy. But this Monday the \nPresident's budget came out which is very different than that. It is a \nbudget I would like to discuss this morning and talk about because, as \nI read through it, it looks to me as though the President has abandoned \nhis role as leader of the Nation by not being honest with the American \npeople about the significance of the debt that we as Americans face. To \nme, this budget ambushes the American people. The President, under the \npretense of economizing, promises to cut $4 trillion of deficit over 10 \nyears, but the budget itself actually piles $11 trillion of new debt in \nthat same timeframe.\n  Under the pretense of helping everyone to prosper, to me the \nPresident's budget buries every single American under a mountain of \ndebt and that is a debt that is going to rob more and more from their \npaychecks with each passing year. The savings the President promises \nare not going to come. The spending he demands is for things we cannot \nafford. It seems to me this President's budget is another painful step \non the road to bankrupting America.\n  We are in the fourth year of the Presidency, and for each of those 4 \nyears the deficit has exceeded $1 trillion; $1 trillion in each of the \n4 years of this Presidency.\n  How does that match with what the President has been saying? In \nFebruary of 2009, the President had been President about a month, he \nmade a pledge. The pledge was he would cut the deficit in half by the \nend of his first term in office. Here we are, the final year of the \nPresident's first term in office, and this deficit is still above $1 \ntrillion. Once again, what the President has said to the American \npeople is very different than what he has delivered to the American \npeople. I am still waiting for a chance in this body, in the Senate, to \nvote on the President's budget. The majority leader, who sits in the \nfront row, has said he doesn't intend to even bring it to the floor of \nthe Senate for a discussion or a debate or a vote. The law is pretty \nclear: The President has to introduce a budget by a certain date--the \nPresident missed that deadline--and the Senate and the House have to go \nahead and pass a budget, which this body has not done now for over \n1,000 days. Multiple years and no budget has passed this body.\n\n  There actually was a vote last year on the President's budget. It was \none where the budget itself was called irresponsible, and there were a \nnumber of press renderings on it. The majority leader refused to bring \nit to the Senate floor, so the minority leader brought the President's \nbudget to the Senate floor. Not one Republican voted for it, but not \none Democrat voted for the President's budget either. The total count \non the President's budget last year in the Senate: 0 votes for the \nPresident's budget, 97 votes against the President's budget. Yet the \nPresident introduces another budget this year ignoring the two major \ntidal waves we face, the tidal waves of Social Security and Medicare.\n  It is interesting. You read in the New York Times:\n\n       Obama Faces Task of Selling Dueling Budget Ideas.\n       President Obama more than ever confronts the challenge of \n     persuading voters that he has a long-term plan to reduce the \n     deficit, even as he highlights stimulus spending.\n\n  Challenging to persuade voters that he has a long-term plan to reduce \nthe deficit. What did he promise? What did he deliver? What we see is a \nhealth care law where he promised one thing and delivered something \nvery different. We see it now in the budget, and the numbers are so \nlarge. The numbers are so astronomically large that it is hard for one \nto comprehend how much a deficit of $1 trillion truly is. You can visit \nwith high school students or service clubs or go to townhall meetings \nor senior centers, the number is so large it is hard to wrap one's mind \naround it.\n  The President tries to make people believe that everything would be \nOK if he could just raise some taxes--just a little bit, he says--on \nsome other people--not you but other people--and everything would be \nfine. When you actually look through this, to get to $1.3 trillion, \nwhich is what the President has proposed in this year's budget as a \ndeficit, you could take all the millionaires and billionaires--things \nhe likes to rail about--and you could take every penny they earn over \nthat $1 million, all of them combined, and then on top of that sell off \nall the gold in Fort Knox, add it all together, and that would not be \nenough to cover just the deficit, that $1 trillion the President plans \nto spend over and above what comes in. It is completely irresponsible, \nbut that is what we have seen from this administration.\n  So we have a President who makes presentations, gives speeches, and \nyet what the American people see is something very different. So this \nmorning in the Energy Committee, we had an opportunity to visit with \nthe Secretary of Energy specifically on budgetary issues relating to \nthe budget and the future.\n  Of course, the President said he supported an all-of-the-above energy \nplan for the country. Well, I support an all-of-the-above energy plan \nfor the country, but when you go through the details, that is not \nexactly what the American people see. What the American people see is \nthe cost of gasoline at the pump continuing to go up. They see an \nadministration that is blocking an opportunity to move oil from \nnorthern parts of our country, as well as from Canada, to the United \nStates for use here.\n  Take a look at the front-page headline of USA Today from a couple of \ndays ago:\n\n       ``Chaotic spring'' predicted for gas. Average prices likely \n     to hit $4.05 a gallon.\n\n  People care about that. People all across the country drive around, \nthey see the signs up, they see what the cost of a gallon of gasoline \nis, and they see it impacting their daily lives.\n  Today a number of us visited the Energy Committee and talked about \ntoday's Wall Street Journal article this\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nmorning. ``Oil Rise Imperils Budding Recovery.'' We want this country \nto recover. We want people to get back to work. We want to make it \neasier and cheaper for the private sector to hire people and get \nAmerica working again. The price of energy goes up, the price of oil \ngoes up--``Oil Rise Imperils Budding Recovery.''\n  What does it say? ``The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline \nhas jumped 13.1 cents to $3.51 cents in the past month.'' So gasoline \nat the pump is up 13 cents in the last month. This is according to AAA.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Some parts of the country have seen even bigger increases, \n     with prices approaching $4 a gallon in parts of California.\n\n  Higher prices at the pump--and this is where it really hits home. \nThis is what I hear about at home in Wyoming when the price of gasoline \ngoes up. And we drive great distances, Mr. President, in your home \nState and my home State. People notice it because it impacts on other \nthings for which they can use that same money.\n  It says here in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Higher prices at the pump force consumers to cut back \n     spending on discretionary items like restaurant meals, hair \n     cuts and family vacations, hurting those industries.\n\n  Isn't that what it is really about as the price of gasoline at the \npump goes up? It hurts the ability of families and the quality of \nlife--they could spend that money in other ways.\n  It says:\n\n       A prolonged increase can drive up inflation and drive down \n     hiring.\n\n  We are a country that wants people to get back to work. We want to \ngive them those opportunities, and it just seems that the President's \nbudget and the policies of this administration and a rejection of \nthings that would actually help us with American energy are going to \nmake it harder for families. When the price of gasoline goes up, the \nimpact on an average family is over $1,000 a year in terms of their \nability to have disposable income. If it is a family dealing with a \nmortgage and bills and kids, that is a huge difference in the quality \nof life for those American families.\n  States around the country get it. I look at Wyoming. We are in our \nlegislative session there right now. We balance our budget every year. \nThe constitution demands it. If less money comes in, we spend less \nmoney. They make the tough decisions.\n  The President said he is ready to make the tough decisions, but I \ndon't see tough decisions in this budget. What I see is a political \ndocument, a campaign document, something that has more stimulus money \nin it, money so he can promise people things. We all know how that \nfirst so-called stimulus program went. To me, it was a failure. We had \nspending of about $800 billion. The President promised that if we \npassed the stimulus program, the unemployment rate would stay less than \n8 percent. They put out charts, and by today, from those charts, the \nunemployment rate should be 6 percent. The unemployment rate is still \n8.3 percent. It has been over 8 percent for 36 months now.\n\n  When you look at this and look at the President's budget, to me, it \nis debt on arrival. The budget spends $47 trillion, it borrows $11 \ntrillion, and it increases the national debt to $26 trillion by 2022. \nIt is debt upon debt upon debt. So from were do you borrow the money? A \nlot of it you borrow from overseas. A lot of it comes from China. So \nwhat role is China playing now? Well, they are continuing to lend us \nmoney.\n  By the way, when the President blocked the Keystone XL Pipeline, what \ndid China say to our northern neighbors, our big trading partner, \nCanada? If the United States doesn't want it, if President Obama isn't \ninterested, we will take the oil in China. The Prime Minister of Canada \nwas in China last week doing exactly that--cutting a deal with the \nChinese for energy that will be sold from Canada. I think we should \nwant it. I think if we want to be energy secure and work on energy \nsecurity, which, to me, is an issue of national security, we should \nwant that energy. Good jobs; the amount of money in terms of jobs that \nare available--this isn't government money, it is private money to put \npeople back to work. We haven't seen it, and this administration, \nthrough its budget and through its policies, continues to oppose those \nefforts for American jobs.\n  So what we see is that under the President's 10-year budget proposal, \nthe spending goes up every year without stop. Every year from now to \nover the next 10 years, spending goes up and we see trillion-dollar \ndeficits year after year after year.\n  What is most disturbing to some of my colleagues who have accounting \ndegrees--especially the senior Senator from the State of Wyoming, who \nis an accountant, who has run businesses; he looks at this, and he can \neasily point out the budgetary gimmicks, the accounting tricks that \nhave been used over and over to make this budget, as irresponsible as \nit happens to be, look not as bad as it really is.\n  This budget is bad for America, and it is a continuation of a number \nof policies that have come out of this administration that have made it \nharder and more expensive for the private sector to create jobs. What I \nam trying to do is look for ways to make it easier and cheaper for the \nprivate sector to create jobs. We have not seen it in the President's \nbudget, we have not seen it in the policies of this administration, and \nwe have not seen it in this President.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate was forced to spend the better part of this \nweek ending a filibuster against the nomination of Judge Adalberto \nJordan of Florida to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh \nCircuit. Finally, after a four month Republican filibuster that was \nbroken on Monday by an 89 5 cloture vote, and after Republicans \ninsisted on two additional days of delay, the Senate was allowed to \nvote on the nomination. We voted 94 5 to confirm Judge Jordan. I \nsuspect the vote would have been the same four months and two days \nsooner. It was a colossal waste of the Senate's time and another week \nlost to obstruction and delay.\n\n  Now the Senate Majority Leader has been required to file another \ncloture petition on yet another consensus nominee. This is the ninth \ntime the Majority Leader has had to file a cloture petition to overcome \na Republican filibuster of one of President Obama's superbly-qualified \njudicial nominees. The nomination of Jesse Furman to fill a vacancy on \nthe Southern District of New York has been stalled for more than five \nmonths after being reported unanimously from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Consensus nominations like this to Federal district courts \nhave nearly always been taken up and confirmed by the Senate within \ndays or weeks, whether nominated by a Democratic or a Republican \nPresident. Certainly that was the approach taken by Senate Democrats \nwhen President Bush sent us consensus nominees. That is how we reduced \nvacancies in the presidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the \nlowest levels in decades and how we confirmed 205 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees in his first term. Yet, in an almost complete \nreversal of this approach, Mr. Furman's nomination has been blocked by \nSenate Republicans for over five months, without reason or explanation.\n  Regrettably, for the second time, we will have to vote to end a \nRepublican filibuster of one of President Obama's district court \nnominations. I cannot recall a single instance in which a President's \njudicial nomination to a Federal trial court, a Federal district court, \nwas blocked by a filibuster. Yet, Senate Republicans nearly did so last \nyear when they sought to filibuster Judge Jack McConnell's nomination \nto the Rhode Island District Court, despite the strong support of both \nhome state Senators who know their state best. At that time I \nemphasized the danger of rejecting the Senate's traditional deference \nto home state Senators and beginning to filibuster district court \nnominations. Fortunately, the Senate rejected that filibuster and that \npath and Judge McConnell was confirmed. I trust the Senate will do so \nagain, bringing to an end another filibuster, this time for a district \ncourt nominee, Mr. Furman, who was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\n  Like the needless delay in Judge Jordan's confirmation, the \nRepublican filibuster of Jesse Furman, who by any traditional measure \nis a consensus nominee, is another example of the tactics that have all \nbut paralyzed the Senate confirmation process and are damaging our \nFederal courts. It should not take five months and require a cloture \nmotion for the Senate to proceed to vote on this nomination. At a time \nwhen nearly one out of every 10 judgeships is vacant and we have over \n20 judicial nominations reported favorably by the Committee, 16 of \nwhich have been stalled on the Senate calendar since last year, nearly \nall of them superbly-qualified consensus nominees, our Federal courts \nand the American people cannot afford more of these partisan tactics.\n  I read with interest this morning Gail Collins' column in The New \nYork Times on the approval rating of Congress. She notes that Congress \nis ``unpopular like the Ebola virus, or zombies . . . like TV shows \nabout hoarders with dead cats in their kitchens.'' She goes on to \ndiscuss the Republican filibusters of judicial nominees and writes:\n\n       This week, the Senate confirmed Judge Adalberto Jose Jordan \n     to a seat on the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th \n     Circuit in Atlanta. A visitor from another country might not \n     have appreciated the proportions of this achievement, given \n     that Jordan, who was born in Cuba and who once clerked for \n     Sandra Day O'Connor, had no discernible opposition.\n\n  I ask consent that a copy of Ms. Collins' column be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is the kind of obstruction that is hard to explain to \nthe American people. This Republican filibuster, like that of Judge \nJordan, is very hard to understand. Jesse Furman is an experienced \nFederal prosecutor who has prosecuted international narcotics \ntrafficking and terrorism and consulted on some of the Southern \nDistrict's most complex cases, including the Galleon insider trading \ncase, the prosecution of former Madoff employees, and the Times Square \nbomber case. A dedicated public servant, Mr. Furman has been a law \nclerk at all three levels of the Federal judiciary, including as a \nclerk to Supreme Court Justice David Souter.\n  I got to know Mr. Furman when he was the counselor to Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey. That is right: The Senate Republicans are \nfilibustering someone strongly supported by President Bush's Attorney \nGeneral who was himself a Federal judge. When Mr. Furman's nomination \nwas before the Committee last summer, Attorney General Mukasey wrote to \nthe Committee in strong support:\n\n       All I can hope to add is my own belief that he is a person \n     to whom one can entrust decisions that are consequential to \n     the lives of people and to the general welfare of the \n     populace, with confidence that they will be made wisely and \n     fairly . . . and I urge that he be confirmed.\n\n  Former Supreme Court clerks who served at the same time as Mr. \nFurman, including clerks for conservative Justices such as Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, Justice Thomas, and Justice Scalia wrote in support \nof Mr. Furman's nomination, stating that, ``Mr. Furman has demonstrated \nhis deep respect for and commitment to the rule of law, over and above \npolitics or ideology.''\n  With this bipartisan support, the strong support of his home state \nSenators, and his impressive background, Mr. Furman's nomination was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on September 15, without opposition \nfrom a single member of the Committee. We should have voted on his \nnomination many months ago, and certainly before the end of the last \nsession. Senate Republicans have blocked this nomination for over five \nmonths without any explanation.\n  Sadly, this is not the first New York judge to be filibustered by \nSenate Republicans. Just a few years ago, Judge Denny Chin, an \noutstanding nominee with 16 years of judicial experience, was delayed \nfrom being elevated to the Second Circuit for four months until the \nMajority Leader forced a vote and he was confirmed 98 0.\n  Last May, the Majority Leader was required to file for cloture to end \nthe filibuster of Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island. By rejecting \nthat filibuster, the Senate took a step toward restoring a longstanding \ntradition of deference to home state Senators with regard to Federal \nDistrict Court nominations. The Senate turned away from a precipice. It \nis wrong now for us to approach that precipice again. Filibustering \nthis nomination would set a new standard for obstruction of judicial \nnominations.\n  Indeed, I have looked back over the last six decades and found only \nfour district court nominations--four in over 60 years, on which \ncloture was even filed. For two of those, the cloture petitions were \nwithdrawn after procedural issues were resolved. In connection with the \nother two, the Senate voted on cloture and it was invoked and the \nfilibuster ended. All of those nominations were confirmed.\n  From the start of President Obama's term, Republican Senators have \napplied a heightened and unfair standard to President Obama's district \ncourt nominees. Senate Republicans have chosen to depart dramatically \nfrom the long tradition of deference on district court nominees to the \nhome state Senators who know the needs of their states best. Instead, \nan unprecedented number of President Obama's highly-qualified district \ncourt nominees have been targeted for opposition and obstruction. That \napproach is a serious break from the Senate's practice of advice and \nconsent. Since 1945, the Judiciary Committee has reported more than \n2,100 district court nominees to the Senate. Out of these 2,100 \nnominees, only six have been reported by party-line votes. Only six \ntotal in the last 65 years. Five of those six party-line votes have \nbeen against President Obama's highly-qualified district court \nnominees. Indeed, only 22 of those 2,100 district court nominees were \nreported by any kind of split roll call vote at all, and eight of \nthose, more than a third, have been President Obama's nominees.\n  Democrats never applied this standard to President Bush's district \ncourt nominees, whether in the majority or the minority. And certainly, \nthere were nominees to the district court put forth by that \nadministration that were considered ideologues. All told, in eight \nyears, the Judiciary Committee reported only a single Bush district \ncourt nomination by a party line vote. President Obama's nominees are \nbeing treated differently than those of any President, Democratic or \nRepublican, before him.\n  When I first became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001, I \nfollowed a time when Senate Republicans, who had been in the majority, \nhad pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominations, blocking them with secret holds in backrooms and \ncloakrooms, obstructing more with winks and nods, but with little to no \npublic explanation or accountability. I worked hard to change that and \nto open up the process. I sought to bring daylight to the process by \nmaking the consultation with home state Senators public so that the \nSenate Republicans' abuses during the Clinton years would not be \nrepeated.\n  When Senate Democrats opposed some of President Bush's most \nideological nominees, we did so openly, saying why we opposed them. And \nwhen there were consensus nominees--nominees with the support of both \nDemocrats and Republicans--we moved them quickly so they could begin \nserving the American people. That is how we reduced vacancies in the \npresidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the lowest levels in \ndecades. That is how we confirmed 205 of President Bush's circuit and \ndistrict nominees in his first term.\n  Now we see the reverse of how we treated President Bush's nominees. \nSenate Republicans do not move quickly to consider consensus nominees, \nlike the 14 still on the Senate Calendar that were reported unanimously \nlast year and should have had a Senate vote last year. Instead, as we \nare seeing today and have seen all too often, Senate Republicans \nobstruct and delay even consensus nominees, leaving us 43 judicial \nnominees behind the pace we set for confirming President Bush's \njudicial nominees. That is why vacancies remain so high, at 86, over \nthree years into President Obama's first term. Vacancies are nearly \ndouble what they were at this point in President Bush's\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nthird year. That is why 130 million Americans live in circuits or \ndistricts with a judicial vacancy that could have a judge if Senate \nRepublicans would only consent to vote on judicial nominees that have \nbeen favorably voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee and have been \non the Senate Executive Calendar since last year.\n  This is an area where we should be working for the American people, \nand putting their needs first. It is the American people who pay the \nprice for the Senate's unnecessary and harmful delay in confirming \njudges to our Federal courts. It is unacceptable for hardworking \nAmericans who are seeking their day in court to find seats on one in 10 \nof those courts vacant. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover \nthe cost of medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait \nfor years before a judge hears his or her case. When two small business \nowners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for \na court to resolve their dispute. With over 20 judicial nominees \nfavorably reported by the Committee and cloture motions being required \nfor consensus nominees, the Senate is failing in its responsibility, \nharming our Federal courts and ultimately hurting the American people. \nIs it any wonder that barely 10 percent of the American people view \nCongress favorably?\n  The slow pace of confirmations of President Obama's judicial nominees \nis no accident or happenstance. It is the result of deliberate \nobstruction and delays. For the second year in a row, the Senate \nRepublican leadership ignored long-established precedent and refused to \nschedule any votes before the December recess on the nearly 20 \nconsensus judicial nominees who had been favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. Here we are in the middle of February fighting to \nhold a vote on one of the 18 nominees who should have been confirmed \nlast year. Fourteen of the nominees being blockaded by Senate \nRepublicans were reported with the unanimous support of their home \nstate Senators and every Republican and every Democrat on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The result of these Republican delay tactics is \nclear--we are far behind the pace set by the Senate during President \nGeorge W. Bush's first term, with a judicial vacancy rate nearly twice \nwhat it was at this point in his first term.\n  During President George W. Bush's administration, Republican Senators \ninsisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional. \nThey threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to guarantee up-or-down \nvotes for each of President Bush's judicial nominees. Many Republican \nSenators declared that they would never support the filibuster of a \njudicial nomination--never. Yet, only a few years later, Senate \nRepublicans reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very \nfirst judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana, a \nwidely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench who had the \nsupport of the most senior and longest-serving Republican in the \nSenate, Senator Lugar. The Senate rejected that filibuster and Judge \nHamilton was confirmed.\n  But the partisan delays and opposition have continued. Senate \nRepublicans have required cloture votes even for nominees who ended up \nbeing confirmed unanimously when the Senate finally overcame those \nfilibusters and voted on their nomination. So it was with Judge Barbara \nKeenan of the Fourth Circuit, who was confirmed 99 0 when the \nfilibuster of her nomination finally ended in 2010, and Judge Denny \nChin of the Second Circuit, an outstanding nominee with 16 years \njudicial experience, who was ultimately confirmed 98 0 when the \nRepublican filibuster was overcome after four months of needless \ndelays. Just this week the long-delayed nomination of Judge Adalberto \nJordan to the Eleventh Circuit was confirmed 94 5.\n  This obstruction is particularly damaging at a time when judicial \nvacancies remain at record highs. There are currently 86 judicial \nvacancies across the country, meaning that nearly one out of every 10 \nFederal judgeships remains vacant. The vacancy rate is nearly double \nwhat it had been reduced to by this point in the Bush administration, \nwhen we worked together to reduce judicial vacancies to 46.\n  Some Senate Republicans are now seeking to excuse these months of \ndelay by blaming President Obama for forcing them to do it. They point \nto President Obama's recent recess appointments of a Director for the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and members of the National Labor \nRelations Board. Of course, those appointments were made a few weeks \nago, long after Judge Jordan's nomination was already being delayed. \nMoreover, the President took his action because Senate Republicans had \nrefused to vote on those executive nominations and were intent on \nrendering the Government agencies unable to enforce the law and carry \nout their critical work on behalf of the American people. Some Senate \nRepublicans are doubling down on their obstruction in response. They \nare apparently extending their blockage against nominees beyond \nexecutive branch nominees to these much-needed judicial nominees. This \nneedless obstruction accentuates the burdens on our Federal courts and \ndelays in justice to the American people. We can ill afford these \nadditional delays and protest votes. The Senate needs, instead, to come \ntogether to address the needs of hardworking Americans around the \ncountry.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to stop the destructive delays that \nhave plagued our nominations process. I urge them to join us not only \nin rejecting the five-month filibuster of Mr. Furman's nomination, but \nalso in restoring the Senate's longstanding practice of considering and \nconfining consensus nominees without extended and damaging delays. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Congress Has No Date for the Prom\n\n                           (By Gail Collins)\n\n       I am shocked to report that Congress, the beating heart of \n     American democracy, is unpopular.\n       Not unpopular like a shy kid in junior high. Unpopular like \n     the Ebola virus, or zombies. Held in near-universal contempt, \n     like TV shows about hoarders with dead cats in their \n     kitchens. Or people who get students to call you up during \n     dinner and ask you to give money to your old university.\n       The latest Gallup poll gave Congress a 10 percent approval \n     rating. As Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado keeps pointing \n     out, that's lower than BP during the oil spill, Nixon during \n     Watergate or banks during the banking crisis.\n       On the plus side, while 86 percent of respondents told \n     Gallup that they disapproved of the job Congress was doing, \n     only 4 percent said they had no opinion. That's really a \n     great sense of public awareness, given the fact that other \n     surveys show less than half of all Americans know who their \n     member of Congress is.\n       So little attention, yet so much rancor. We're presuming \n     that this is because of the dreaded partisan gridlock, which \n     has made Congress increasingly unproductive in matters that \n     do not involve the naming of post offices.\n       And Congress is listening! Lately, we have been seeing \n     heartening new signs of bipartisan cooperation. For instance, \n     the House and Senate are near an agreement on the payroll tax \n     cut, namely that it will continue and not be paid for.\n       This is actually sort of a tradition. No matter who is in \n     power in Washington, Congress has always shown a remarkable \n     ability to band together and pass tax cuts that are not paid \n     for. It's like naming post offices, only somewhat more \n     expensive.\n       But there's much, much more. For instance, both chambers \n     recently approved a big new ethics reform bill that would ban \n     members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.\n       Perhaps you imagined that this was already against the law.\n       This piece of legislation had been lying around gathering \n     dust since 2006. But, this year, the House and Senate decided \n     to stand tall and pass it as a matter of principle. It had \n     nothing to do with a ``60 Minutes'' report that made the \n     whole place look like a convention of grifters. Totally \n     unrelated. This was simply a bill whose time had come.\n       And that bill would probably already be signed into law \n     were it not for a disagreement over whether to require the \n     high-paid professionals who poke around Congress collecting \n     information that might be of use to their Wall Street clients \n     to register the same way lobbyists do.\n       You'd think this would be easy to sort out since most \n     members of the House and the Senate have gone on the record \n     in favor of registering these guys.\n       But, no, the idea ran afoul of the House majority leader, \n     Eric Cantor, the Darth Vader of Capitol Hill. Cantor says the \n     idea should be studied, which is, of course, legislatese for \n     ``trampled to death by a thousand boots.''\n       Still, the good news is that the basic idea of prohibiting \n     members of Congress from using the information they acquire \n     in the course of their public duties to engage in insider \n     trading did pass both chambers by enormous majorities.\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\n       Yippee.\n       And the bipartisan cooperation keeps rolling on. This week, \n     the Senate confirmed Judge Adalberto Jose Jordan to a seat on \n     the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. \n     A visitor from another country might not have appreciated the \n     proportions of this achievement, given the fact that Jordan, \n     who was born in Cuba and who once clerked for Sandra Day \n     O'Connor, had no discernible opposition.\n       But Americans ought to have a better grasp of how the \n     Senate works. The nomination's progress had long been \n     thwarted by Mike Lee, a freshman Republican from Utah, who \n     has decided to hold up every single White House appointment \n     to anything out of pique over . . . well, it doesn't really \n     matter. When you're a senator, you get to do that kind of \n     thing.\n       This forced the majority leader, Harry Reid, to get 60 \n     votes to move Judge Jordan forward, which is never all that \n     easy. Then there was further delay thanks to Rand Paul, a \n     freshman from Kentucky, who stopped action for as long as \n     possible because he was disturbed about foreign aid to Egypt.\n       All that is forgotten now. The nomination was approved, 94 \n     to 5, only 125 days after it was unanimously O.K.'d by the \n     Judiciary Committee. Whiners in the White House pointed out \n     that when George W. Bush was president, circuit court \n     nominations got to a floor vote in an average of 28 days.\n       No matter. Good work, Senate! Only 17 more long-pending \n     judicial nominations to go!\n       Meanwhile, the House named a post office in Missouri for a \n     fallen Marine.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes and that I be followed by the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. From Tennessee.\n  Mr. KYL. What did I say? From Tennessee. Whatever I said, I \napologize. I said Texas. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   The Budget and Our Nuclear Arsenal\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I need to speak for a few minutes this \nmorning about two important news events of this week: the budget that \nwas submitted by the President and the news reports that the President \nis considering reducing our nuclear arsenal to dramatically lower \nlevels than they are today. Let me speak to both those subjects briefly \nthis morning, and then I will have more to say about them as time goes \non.\n  In the President's budget, there is a specific part for the \nDepartment of Energy that funds the nuclear weapons program. Despite \npromises of the President that he would follow what is called the 1251 \nstudy over the course of his Presidency and request in the budget the \nsums of money for the Department that is called the NNSA--part of the \nDepartment of Energy--he reduced that this year by $372 million less \nthan the target. The net result of that over 5 years is going to be \n$4.3 billion.\n  I know my colleague from Tennessee is very interested in this. Before \nthe START treaty was debated, there was a big debate about whether the \nfunding for the NNSA in the nuclear modernization program was adequate.\n  On the Veterans Day recess, before we began the debate on START, \nGeneral Chilton, former head of STRATCOM, and Dr. Miller, the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, flew to Phoenix and said to me: You were right. \nWe were wrong. We have underfunded this by over $4 billion. We are \ngoing to add that to our 5-year budget profile.\n  This was the argument we had been making all along: You have \nunderfunded the nuclear modernization program. You need to add between \n$4 billion and $5 billion to it. They agreed and that is what went into \nthe revised 1251 report.\n  As a result of the budget request this year, we are right back where \nwe started from before the revision--$4.3 billion below--and that is \nwhere we were when the administration came forward and said: You were \nright. We were wrong. Our previous figure was not enough.\n  So we have a problem, and it is going to cause some real disruptions.\n  One of the things we have to do is extend the life of one of our old \nweapons called the B 61. This is a 2-year delay now on that, a 2-year \ndelay on another warhead called the W 76, at least a 5-year delay in \nthe construction of the plutonium processing facility at Los Alamos \nLaboratory called the CMRR facility.\n  Why is that important? We knew prior to commitments the President \nmade before the START treaty was debated that the CMRR was critical. We \ndo not have a production capacity. Unlike Russia and China, for \nexample, we cannot produce new nuclear weapons. We have to go back and \nrevise the ones we have. One of the facilities that would enable us to \ndo that is this CMRR facility. In fact, that is where a great deal of \nthe work would be done.\n  What we were told was that the President was fully committed to \nconstructing this facility on a timetable set out in the 1251 report. \nSome of us were a little dubious. The President's representative said: \nWe will put it to you in writing. So he did. What he said in his \nmessage on the New START treaty to the Senate with regard to this \nfacility--I will quote it; the letter related to his intent to \nmodernize and replace the triad:\n\n       [To] accelerate to the extent possible, the design and \n     engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing \n     Facility (UPF)--\n\n  That is the facility for uranium processing at Oak Ridge, TN--\n\n     [and to] request full funding, including on a multiyear basis \n     as appropriate, for the CMRR building and the UPF upon \n     completion of the design and engineering phase for such \n     facilities.\n\n  We were concerned he would not request the funding in the outyears \nand that they would not accelerate the construction of these \nfacilities. So he said he would. He would accelerate it to the extent \npossible and request full funding, including on a multiyear basis.\n  The budget he submitted this year breaks that commitment to the \nSenate, and those Senators who voted for the treaty based upon these \ncommitments are obviously going to be reevaluating their support for \nthe treaty. There are things that can be done by the Congress, \nincluding our power of the purse, to deal with the issue, which I will \nhope to have time to speak to in a moment.\n  Former Secretary Gates reflected on the Senate's reliance on these \ncommitments when he said:\n\n       This modernization program was very carefully worked out \n     between ourselves and the Department of Energy; and, frankly, \n     where we came out on that played a fairly significant role in \n     the willingness of the Senate to ratify the New START \n     agreement.\n\n  For those who relied on the administration's commitment, they have \nbeen broken. We are right back to where we started from before the \ntreaty was taken up.\n  If you want to know specifically what the problems are, Dr. Charles \nMcMillan, the Los Alamos Director said:\n\n       Without CMRR, there is an identified path to meet the \n     Nation's requirement of 50 to 80 pits per year . . . the \n     budget reduction in FY13 compounds an already difficult set \n     of FY12 budget challenges and raises questions about whether \n     we can meet the pace of the modernization path outlined in \n     the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.\n\n  So we have a problem. Unless the President is willing to work with \nMembers of Congress, and unless Members of Congress are willing to \nrecognize that the Senate acted based upon some commitments the \nadministration made and we have to keep our end of the bargain as well, \nwe are going to find a huge problem with our modernization program, \nwith our nuclear weapons\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\nprogram, and all that portends with respect to our deterrent \ncapability.\n  Now, let me turn to the other news of the week. The President's \npeople confirmed that, yes, they are, in fact, studying whether we can \nreduce our nuclear warheads. Remember, we were at 1,500 for START, and \nan 80 percent reduction could take us down to 300. That is almost \nunthinkable, especially in today's environment where we have Russia and \nChina with new production capacities. They are developing new nuclear \nweapons and producing them.\n  We are not designing or developing any new nuclear weapons. We have \nno plans to do so, and we have no production capacity to make them, \neven if we did. The capacity to refurbish the old ones is now going to \nbe delayed another 5 years. So why would we be thinking about reducing \nour warheads even further under these circumstances? Well, some people \nsay, with a robust missile defense program, and by upgrading our \nconventional capabilities, we might think about this. The problem with \nthese two assumptions is, this budget cuts both of them dramatically as \nwell. We are not enhancing conventional capabilities, we are drawing \nthem down, which, by the way, is what has caused the Russians to rely \nmuch more heavily on their nuclear program.\n  What about the people who rely on our nuclear deterrence, the 32 \ncountries that rely on our nuclear umbrella? If they see this, my guess \nis they are going to look at what they might do to develop their own \nweapons: So much for nonproliferation. What about the idea that \ncountries that now have close to 300 weapons could become peers of the \nUnited States? How is that for strategy, to have Pakistan, which will \nsoon have more weapons than Britain does, to have as many nuclear \nweapons as the United States?\n  That is not exactly the most stable place in the world today. Iran is \ndeveloping its capability. North Korea already has it. The Chinese are \nalready at roughly this level and improving their capability. Of \ncourse, Russia is much above it and talking about actually building \nmore nuclear weapons, not fewer.\n  The Deputy Defense Minister in Russia recently said, on February 6:\n\n       I do not rule out that under certain circumstances, we will \n     have to boost, not cut our nuclear arsenal.\n\n  Now we are talking about reducing ours. How are we going to convince \nthe Russians to reduce theirs? I presume this is all going to be done \nin some kind of additional treaty with the Russians, not likely to \noccur.\n  To me, what is most bothersome is that one of the arguments that \nnuclear opponents have always had is that we never want to get to a \npoint where our doctrine, instead of holding hostage the military \ncapability of any would-be adversary, would be to hold civilians \nhostage, innocent civilians. That is precisely what happens when \ninstead of having enough nuclear weapons to cover all of the military \ntargets of a potential adversary, we end up having only enough weapons \nto hold hostage the cities of our potential adversary and thus the \ncivilian population of those countries.\n  That is not a moral deterrent. As a result, I think we have to think \nvery carefully about this prospect of reducing our nuclear weaponry. \nWe, obviously, have to do a lot more work on this issue in the \nCongress. As I said, we have some means of expressing our views to the \nadministration. I think it needs to think very carefully about this. To \nthe extent that it thinks it is going to solve or going to help with \nour financial crisis, reducing the number of warheads, unfortunately, \ndoes not reduce a lot of expense. It is a little bit like the BRAC \nCommission. So that cannot be cited as a reason to do this.\n  Finally, nor is there any prospect that we can serve as a moral \nexample to other countries in the world by reducing our warheads to \nthat level. The START treaty was supposed to be a new reset showing the \nworld, through our moral example, the benefits of reducing warheads. \nNot a country in the world has reduced warheads since the signing of \nthe New START treaty except the United States. Russia has not, China \nhas not, Pakistan has not, our allies have not, and Iran and North \nKorea talk about expanding their programs.\n  So this is based on a very shaky proposition of benefits which are \nvery unlikely to occur, and it is fraught with dangers that we must \ndebate in this country before the President simply unilaterally decides \nto make such a drastic change in American policy.\n  We will have more time to discuss this in the future. Given the fact \nthat these two events were kicked off this week--the President's budget \nand this latest announcement--I thought we should at least have a \npreliminary discussion of it on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I yield to my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Marketplace Fairness\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to talk about another \nsubject, marketplace fairness. But before I do, I want to acknowledge \nthe importance of what the Senator from Arizona has had to say and his \nleadership in the whole area of our nuclear doctrine, but especially in \nthe area of nuclear weapons modernization.\n  I think he is correct to say that the discussion about section 1251, \nwhich he described--which is the goal for the amount of money we need \nto modernize our nuclear weapons that we have in this country--may not \nhave been the reason that the New START treaty passed. But I doubt the \nNew START treaty would have been ratified without it. So it is an \nimportant part of that debate, and it is an important part of the \ndebate today.\n  I am one of those Senators who is right in the middle of the \ndiscussion. I worked with the Senator from Arizona on the last \nappropriations bill, and he worked harder than anyone to try to get the \namount of appropriations closer to the 1251 number. We made some \nprogress but still fell short. This represents a substantial challenge \nto us.\n  I think he has put his finger on a very important problem. When we \ntalk about reducing defense spending--or sequestering defense \nspending--this is the kind of thing that we end up having to deal with \nbecause, even in the last year, both the administration and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee moved some money from defense over to this \naccount to try to increase the money for nuclear weapons modernization, \nand still there was not enough to meet the 1251 commitment that many of \nus agreed to at the time the New START treaty was announced.\n\n  I thank him for his comments. I look forward to working with him on \nthat important question.\n  I would like to talk about marketplace fairness, which ought to be an \nall-American subject in the Senate. It has turned out to be one that \nattracts strong bipartisan support. In November, Senator Enzi of \nWyoming, the Democratic whip, Senator Durbin, and I introduced, along \nwith seven other Senators--an equal number from both sides of the \naisle--what we call the Marketplace Fairness Act to close a 20-year \nloophole that distorts the American marketplace by picking winners and \nlosers, by subsidizing some businesses at the expense of other \nbusinesses, and subsidizing some taxpayers at the expense of other \ntaxpayers.\n  My colleagues and I keep talking about it because we strongly \nbelieve, as do many people across this country, that now is the time \nfor Congress to act. Many Americans do not realize when they buy \nsomething online, which we increasingly do today, or order something \nthrough a catalog, which we have done for a long time, from a business \noutside of our own State that we still owe the State sales tax.\n  So what we are talking about does not even rise to the dignity of a \nloophole. What we are talking about is a law that says you owe the \nState sales tax even if you buy it online and even if you buy it from a \ncatalog from out of State. The law already says, if you buy it you owe \nit.\n  This is not a problem only for big retailers such as Amazon and \nWalmart. It is a problem that is killing small businesses in Tennessee \nand across our country.\n  Last month, Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee and I spoke with small \nbusiness owners from Knoxville and Oak Ridge,\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\nChattanooga, Johnson City, Nashville and Memphis about this problem. \nEvery single one of those business owners shared personal stories about \nhow this loophole has hurt their businesses.\n  Basically, this is what they said happened. I remember the story of \nthe Nashville Boot Company. I talked to the owner. The customer came \ninto the store, tried on a boot, got advice from employees about the \nboot, and then went home to buy the product online in order to avoid \npaying the State sales tax, which the customer owes. The State law \nalready says you owe the tax.\n  The problem is, when you buy something at the Nashville Boot Company, \nor any other local store, the Nashville Boot Company collects the tax \nfrom you, adds it to your bill, and then sends the money to the State. \nThat is how it has always worked. But if you buy the same boot or the \nsame other item online or through a catalog, that business does not \ncollect the State sales tax, even though you owe it. So the result is \nthat similar businesses selling the same thing are being treated \nentirely different. That is not right, and it is not fair.\n  Most Americans who have looked at the issue agree with that. So how \ndid this happen? Well, in 1992, when most of us could not possibly have \nimagined how the Internet would have changed the way we shop for \nthings, the Supreme Court said States could not require out-of-State \ncatalogs or online sellers to do the same thing States require of \nstores up and down Main Street. What was the reason? It was too \ncomplicated for an online seller such as Amazon or a catalog seller to \nfigure out what the sales tax would be in Tennessee, and then how much \nto add on Maryville, which is the town in which I live.\n  Well, 20 years ago, I might have agreed with that. But today \ntechnology has made it easy for catalog sellers or online sellers to do \nthe same thing Main Street sellers are required to do. Let me give an \nexample.\n  This morning I wanted to know what the weather was in my hometown of \nMaryville, TN. So I opened my computer, went to Google, I typed in my \nZIP Code, I typed in ``weather.'' It told me the weather. The software \nnow exists to provide to catalog sellers or online sellers the same \nsort of easy way to find out sales tax.\n  If I were to buy a TV set online in Maryville, TN, I could just type \nin that city, the price, my name, and it would tell me the tax. I think \nit could even send the tax on to the State. In fact, it is about as \neasy--with this software that under our law is going to have to be \nprovided by the State to out of state retailers--it is about as easy \nfor them to find out what the tax is as it would be for the Nashville \nBoot Company when someone walks in and buys the boots in Nashville.\n  Some people have asked why should Congress get involved because \nnothing is preventing States from going ahead and collecting those \ntaxes. That is true. If I were to buy my boots online and not pay the \nsales tax, the Governor could come knocking on my door and add the \nsales tax onto the purchase price of the boots. But that is not going \nto happen in a practical world. I mean, the State cannot do that for \nmillions of purchases that are made every year online; and no one wants \nthe Governor and his agents knocking on their doors about that.\n  So there is a simpler way to do it. Congress should make it easy for \nStates to be able to do that because we should recognize the loophole \nis unfair, that it is anticompetitive, and it is distorting the \nmarketplace.\n  As a Republican Senator, I believe our party should oppose government \npolicies that prefer some businesses over other businesses and some \ntaxpayers over other taxpayers. I believe in States rights. Our bill \ngives States the right to make decisions for themselves. If Illinois or \nTennessee or California wants to prefer some businesses over others, \nwants to prefer some taxpayers over others, they can do that. That is \ntheir State's right. But we ought to make it possible for them to make \ntheir own decision.\n  A number of conservatives have been outspoken supporters for our \nlegislation.\n  At times, conservatives were reluctant to support it over the years, \nbecause it was complicated and because it ``sounded like a'' tax. Well, \nit is about a tax, but it is a tax that is already owed.\n  Here is what Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative \nUnion, says. He supports our legislation and says:\n\n       There is no more glaring example of misguided government \n     power than when taxes or regulations affect two similar \n     businesses completely differently.\n\n  Former Governor Haley Barbour also supports our bill. He said:\n\n       There is simply no longer a compelling reason for \n     government to continue giving online retailers special \n     treatment over small businesses.\n\n  Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana said a similar thing. Congressman \nMike Pence of Indiana, a well-known conservative Congressman, said:\n\n       I don't think Congress should be in the business of picking \n     winners and losers. Inaction by Congress today results in a \n     system that does pick winners and losers.\n\n  That is what Congressman Mike Pence had to say.\n  At CPAC this past weekend, in a gathering of conservative activists, \nthere was a panel of leaders and industry experts talking about this \nissue. The general agreement was that Congress should act to solve the \nproblem. The solution, the panelists said, should be fair, something \npeople can understand, and meet the needs of States, consumers, and \nretailers.\n  I believe our legislation accomplishes all these goals. In the first \nplace, it is a rarity in Federal legislation, because it is only 10 \npages long. You can actually read it in a few minutes. It is fair \nbecause it gives States the right to decide for themselves how to \nenforce the States' own laws. It protects businesses and consumers by \nrequiring States to adopt basic simplifications.\n  It exempts small businesses that sell less than $500,000 in remote \nsales each year. That is very important. I used the example of the \nNashville Boot Company. The owner sells online and he sells out the \nfront door. He said never in his history has he sold more than $400,000 \nworth of revenue from his boot sales online. And when he began, he was \nat least one of the larger online boot sellers. So the $500,000 \nexemption for small businesses from this legislation should go a long \nway to meeting the concerns of those Senators on both sides who want to \nmake sure we don't impose some sort of new rule on very small \nentrepreneurs.\n  Another reason Congress should act now is that States and local \ngovernments will lose an estimated $23 billion in uncollected sales tax \nrevenue in 2012 because of this loophole. Here is what former Governor \nJeb Bush had to say about that:\n\n       It seems to me there has to be a way to tax sales done \n     online in the same way that sales are taxed in brick and \n     mortar establishments. My guess is that there would be \n     hundreds of millions of dollars that then could be used to \n     reduce taxes to fulfill campaign promises.\n\n  Uncollected sales taxes could be used to pay for things our States \nneed to pay for now. They could be used to reduce college tuition. They \ncould be used to pay outstanding teachers. But they could also be used \nto reduce the sales tax rate or to reduce some other tax, or to avoid a \ntax altogether.\n  In Tennessee, where we don't have a State income tax, we want to \navoid one. ``State income tax'' are probably the three worst words in \nour vocabulary, and collecting tax on sales from everybody who owes it \ncould not only reduce our sales tax but help us avoid a State income \ntax.\n  Governor Haslam of Tennessee, who strongly supports our legislation, \nsays:\n\n       It's just too big of a piece of our economy now to treat it \n     like we did 20 years ago.\n\n  Governor Haslam is right. Online sales set new records last year. And \nwhile the growth of e-commerce is very good news for our economy, our \nlocal businesses are getting hurt because they are not competing on a \nlevel playing field. That is why our legislation has the support of the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Conference of Mayors, and the National Association of \nCounties, to name a few.\n  About the only ones left who are complaining about our legislation \nare taxpayers and businesses who are being subsidized by other \ntaxpayers and businesses because the playing field isn't level.\n  Amazon, a huge online seller, strongly supports our legislation. Over \nthe\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nyears, they have opposed legislation like this. Now they believe we \nhave solved the problem. Why? Because they say our bill makes it easy \nfor consumers and easy for retailers to comply with State sales tax \nlaws, and it helps States without raising taxes or new Federal \nspending.\n  Some people will tell you we are talking about taxing the Internet. \nThat is not true. Our legislation doesn't create a new tax. It doesn't \ntax the Internet. The Senate debated Internet access taxes several \nyears ago. I was in the middle of the debate. It led to a moratorium on \nInternet access taxes. That moratorium is still in effect today.\n  We are talking about state taxes that are already owed, and the \nmoratorium on an Internet access tax will stay in place and not be \naltered.\n  It is very hard to see how anyone can say with a straight face that \ngiving States the right to collect taxes that are already owed is a tax \nincrease.\n  I have spent a lot of time talking with my colleagues about making \nthe Senate work more effectively. One way to do that is to make sure \nSenators have an opportunity to thoroughly consider important \nlegislation.\n  On January 31, a few weeks ago, over 200 businesses and State and \nnational trade associations sent a letter to the Senator from Montana, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, asking him to cosponsor our bill and \nto address the inequity this year. Senator Enzi and the bill's \ncosponsors have also urged the Senate Finance Committee to hold a \nhearing on our bill as soon as possible.\n  The House Judiciary Committee has already held a hearing. Their \nhearing on November 30, gave House Members of both political parties \nthe opportunity to learn more about the issue and express their support \nfor it. I hope the Senate Finance Committee will seriously consider our \nrequest and soon find time so Senators can have the same opportunity \nthat House Members have had.\n  Ten years ago, the bills we considered to try to close this loophole \nsimply weren't adequate to solve the problem. The legislation we \nintroduced in November does solve the problem. It is simple, it is \nabout States rights, it is about fairness, and it solves the problem. \nIt doesn't cost the Federal Government a dime, it doesn't change \nFederal tax laws, and it doesn't require States to do anything. It \nsimply gives States the right to decide for themselves how to enforce \ntheir own laws.\n  This is a 20-year-old problem that only the Federal Government can \nsolve. Unless we act, States will continue to be deprived of their \nright to enforce their own tax laws and businesses will not be allowed \nto compete on a level playing field.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch from the 12 Senate \nbipartisan cosponsors of this legislation of January 31 asking for a \nhearing on the Marketplace Fairness Act, quotes from conservatives on \nthis issue, and another memo with quotes from the Conservative \nPolitical Action Conference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch: We urge the \n     Finance Committee to hold a hearing on The Marketplace \n     Fairness Act (S. 1832), bipartisan legislation to allow \n     States to collect sales and use taxes on remote sales that \n     are already owed under State law. For the past 20 years, \n     States have been prohibited from enforcing their own sales \n     and use tax laws on sales by out-of-state, catalog and online \n     sellers due to the 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill \n     Corporation v. North Dakota. Congress has been debating \n     solutions for more than a decade, and some States have been \n     forced to take action on their own leading to greater \n     confusion and further distorting the marketplace.\n       On November 9, 2011, five Democrats and five Republicans \n     introduced The Marketplace Fairness Act, which would give \n     states the right to decide for themselves whether to \n     collect--or not to collect--sales and use taxes on all remote \n     sales. Congressional action is necessary because the ruling \n     stated that the thousands of different state and local sales \n     tax rules were too complicated and onerous to require \n     businesses to collect sales taxes unless they have a physical \n     presence in the state.\n       Today, if an out-of-state retailer refuses to collect sales \n     and use taxes, the burden is on the consumer to report the \n     tax on an annual income tax return or a separate state tax \n     form. However, most consumers are unaware of this legal \n     requirement and very few comply with the law. Consumers can \n     be audited and charged with penalties for failing to pay \n     sales and use taxes.\n       Across the country, states and local governments are losing \n     billions in tax revenue already owed. On average, States \n     depend on sales and use taxes for 20% of their annual \n     revenue. According to the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, this sales tax loophole will cost states and \n     local governments $23 billion in avoided taxes this year \n     alone. At a time when State budgets are under increasing \n     pressure, Congress should give States the ability to enforce \n     their own laws.\n       The Quill decision also put millions of local retailers at \n     a competitive disadvantage by exempting remote retailers from \n     tax collection responsibility. Local retailers in our \n     communities are required to collect sales taxes, while online \n     and catalog retailers selling in the same state are not \n     required to collect any of these taxes. This creates a tax \n     loophole that subsidizes some taxpayers at the expense of \n     others and some businesses over others.\n       State and local governments, retailers, and taxation \n     experts from across the country are urging Congress to pass \n     The Marketplace Fairness Act because it gives states the \n     right to decide what works best for their local governments, \n     residents, and businesses. Given our fiscal constraints, we \n     should allow states to enforce their own tax laws and make \n     sure that state and local governments and businesses are not \n     left behind in tax reform discussions. The House Judiciary \n     Committee's hearing on this single issue on November 30, \n     2011, demonstrated the growing demand to close this loophole, \n     and your committee would provide the best public forum for an \n     open debate in the Senate on the merits of this important \n     policy issue.\n       The Finance Committee is in the best position to shape the \n     discussion on state and local taxation this year, \n     particularly on sales and use taxes on remote sales. We urge \n     the Committee to hold a hearing on the implications of The \n     Marketplace Fairness Act at the earliest date possible. Thank \n     you in advance for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael B. Enzi; Lamar Alexander; John Boozman; Roy \n           Blunt; Bob Corker; Richard J.

I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have on the floor of the Senate the \nTransportation bill. You might wonder why a bill that is the No. 1 jobs \nbill that we can do here is moving so slowly. You might wonder. Any \nnormal person would wonder why a bill that is so popular that it has \neveryone from the AFL CIO to the Chamber of Commerce supporting it is \nmoving so slowly. You might wonder why it is moving so slowly, since \nthe transportation authorization for all of our highway and transit \nprojects expires in about 1 month. You might wonder why it is moving so \nslowly. Why isn't anyone here? What is going on?\n  Yesterday, I came here and said I didn't see a clear path forward for \nthis bill. It is very disturbing, and I will tell you why it is so \ndisturbing. And that is that when you look at the construction area of \nour economy, it is still down. We have 1.5 million unemployed \nconstruction workers. If you think in your mind's eye what that is, I \nhave a picture here of a stadium during the Super Bowl. You could see \nthis stadium. I want you to picture everyone sitting in this stadium as \nan unemployed construction worker and think about 15 stadiums full. \nYesterday, I said it was 10; that was incorrect. I stand corrected \ntoday. It is 15 stadiums full of unemployed construction workers \npraying that we pass this bill, because they are unemployed and this \nbill will create or save up to 2.8 million jobs. It will create or save \n1.8 million jobs and create up to 1 million jobs.\n  Yesterday, I said I didn't see a clear path forward. Today, I see a \npath forward. I really do. There has been some progress overnight. But \nit isn't as clear as it should be. We asked both sides of the aisle, we \nsaid, Can you come up with amendments that you feel compelled to offer \nto this bill? And try to keep them related to transportation. Well, the \nbad news is there are a lot of extraneous amendments that were filed.\n  First and foremost, birth control. The Blunt amendment. Not only does \nit say that any employer could say they have a moral objection, it \ndoesn't even have to be a religious objection. Any employer. So if I am \nan employer and I employ 100 people, and let's say I believe in prayer \nover medicine, I can then deny health care to all my employees. This \nmakes no sense at all. Senator Blunt says, well, you could\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\ntake it to court. Oh, sure. Some low-paid employee is going to take it \nto court.\n  So we have to deal with this birth control amendment and health care \namendment on a highway bill. As I said yesterday, first when I saw the \nbirth control amendment, I thought maybe it says you can't take your \nbirth control pills when you are on a Federal highway. What is going on \nhere? There is no relation. It is bizarre to offer these unrelated \namendments.\n  Then we have an amendment on Egypt. Now, frankly, I am ready to vote \non the birth control. I am happy to vote on an Egypt amendment, \nalthough I believe--this is my own view as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee--that when we have such delicate negotiations going \non over the safety of our citizens who are being held there, we have to \nbe very careful not to interfere in that important backdoor diplomacy \nthat is going on. But we have one Senator who is holding up everything \nbecause he insists that we have to take a stand on Egypt even though we \nhave Americans in danger over there.\n  My Republican friends have to understand what is at stake. The \nbusiness community, the labor community, everyone is in favor of this \ntransportation bill, and we are going to have to face votes that are \nunrelated.\n  There is an idea to repeal a very important environmental regulation \nthat will clean up the pollution from boilers, pollution that is \ndangerous. It is mercury. It causes brain damage. It is arsenic. It is \nlead. And as I said yesterday--and I don't know whether you have had \nthis experience. I have never in the history of my electoral career, \nwhich spans a long time, had anyone come up to me and say, Please, \nBarbara, we really need more arsenic in our air, we need arsenic in our \nwater, we need more lead, we need more mercury. People don't want it. \nWhy on Earth would they now come forward in a highway bill and repeal a \nvery important rule that will make our families healthier? That is what \nmy Republican friends are putting out there. They want to drill off our \ncoast, even though it might interfere with the fishing industry, the \ntourism industry, the recreation industry.\n  I would say to my colleagues with a hand of friendship, we are happy \nto look at transportation-related amendments. We can work those \nthrough. My staff and Senator Inhofe's staff have a very close working \nrelationship, and we can take these relevant amendments and sit down \nand work through them. But obviously, if there is going to be a series \nof amendments on birth control and foreign policy matters and \nextraneous matters, it makes it very difficult. It diverts our \nattention from what is at stake. The clock is ticking on us. This \ntransportation authorization we have expires in March.\n  Here is where we are: We are going to have a cloture vote on the \nvarious titles to the bill, the Finance title, the Banking title, the \nCommerce Committee title. I want to praise all of the committees. They \nhave done their work. Four committees, including ours, the EPW, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, we have all done our work. We \nhave done our jobs. We did what we had to do. We passed out the \nlegislation. Now let's marry all the pieces and get going with \nlegitimate amendments and get this done. Get this done.\n  I urge colleagues to vote yes on cloture. I know some have problems \nwith one of the titles, and we can amend that. If you don't like \nsomething in that title, we can amend it. And if we don't make cloture \non the first round, we will come up with a path forward after that. \nBut, please, it won't work if we have all of these bizarre, extraneous \namendments. I am not saying the amendments are bizarre. Some are. But \nthey are extraneous and they don't belong on this bill.\n  I want to take a minute to remind my colleagues how popular the \ntransportation authorization is. We are going to show you the ad that \nis being run. But President Reagan was very clear on why it was so \nimportant to pass a transportation bill. Here is what he said:\n\n       The state of our transportation system affects our \n     commerce, our economy, and our future.\n\n  He said, clearly, this program is an investment in tomorrow that we \nmust make today. And there is a very good coalition out there, a broad \ncoalition taking out ads on the radio. After they quote Ronald Reagan, \nthey say:\n\n       It's time for leadership again, for new investments in \n     transportation, to keep America moving and jobs growing. Call \n     Congress. Tell them to pass the highway and transit bill and, \n     once again, make transportation job number one.\n\n  This is out on the radio airwaves. I am very grateful that it is \nhappening. I really, really am. Also, we have ads in the various \nnewspapers. Then there is another one that marries up two Presidents' \nstatements, President Reagan and President Clinton. They quote \nPresident Clinton by saying:\n\n       By modernizing and building roads, bridges, transit \n     systems, and railroads, we can usher in two decades of \n     unparalleled growth.\n\n  Then they also quote Ronald Reagan again. He says:\n\n       A network of highways and mass transit has enabled our \n     commerce to thrive.\n\n  At the end it says:\n\n       Tell Congress to pass the highway and transit bill and make \n     transportation job number one.\n\n  So here we sit--and I want to show you. I don't know if people can \nsee this. I hope you can see this. This is an ad that is running all \nover today: President Reagan stood up for public transportation. Will \nyou? Then they quote him and they say: A recovering economy is exactly \nthe time to rebuild America. President Reagan knew it in 1983 when he \nsigned into law dedicating motor fuel revenues to public transportation \nfor years to come. But now the House--and they talk about the problem \nwith the House bill and they tell the House to fix their proposal, \nwhich we hope they are doing as we speak.\n  This is a very important endeavor. Again, I have been around a long \ntime. I have never seen the likes of the coalition we have seen. We \nhave a coalition--it is the broadest coalition I have ever seen in my \nlife in every single State, whether it is Ohio or California or New \nYork or Alabama or Nevada or Kentucky. I am telling you, this is a \nstrong coalition. And this is what they wrote to us:\n\n       In 2011, political leaders--Republican and Democrat, House, \n     Senate, and the administration--stated a multi-year surface \n     transportation bill is important for job creation and \n     economic recovery. We urge you to follow words with action: \n     Make Transportation Job #1 and move legislation immediately \n     in the House and Senate to invest in the roads, bridges, and \n     transit systems that are the backbone of the U.S. economy, \n     its businesses large and small, and communities of all sizes.\n\n  That is basically from the letter signed by over 1,000 organizations.\n  I see my friend from California is here. She may be speaking on this \ntopic or another topic, and I am going to yield to her momentarily.\n  I think it is important to take a look at the organizations I talked \nabout to give you a sense of it. First of all, every State in the Union \nis listed on this letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nletter from over 1,000 organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 January 25, 2012.\n       To the Members of the U.S. House and Senate: As Congress \n     embarks on a new legislative session, we, the undersigned \n     companies and organizations, urge you to Make Transportation \n     Job #1 in 2012 and pass federal highway, transit and safety \n     legislation that, at a minimum, maintains investment levels \n     before the current law expires on March 31. The long-delayed \n     reauthorization of federal highway and public transportation \n     programs is a major piece of unfinished business that can \n     provide a meaningful boost to the U.S. economy and its \n     workers and already has broad-based support.\n       To grow, the United States must invest. There are few \n     federal efforts that rival the potential of critical \n     transportation infrastructure investments for sustaining and \n     creating jobs and economic activity over the short term.\n       Maintaining--and ideally increasing--federal funding for \n     road, bridge, public transportation and safety investments \n     can sustain and create jobs and economic activity in the \n     short-term, and improve America's export and travel \n     infrastructure, offer new economic growth opportunities, and \n     make the nation more competitive over the long-term. Program \n     reform would make the dollars stretch even further: reducing \n     the time it takes transportation projects to get from start \n     to finish, encouraging public-private partnerships and use of \n     private capital, increasing accountability for using federal\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n     funds to address the highest priority needs, and spurring \n     innovation and technology deployment.\n       We recognize there are challenges in finding the resources \n     necessary to adequately fund such a measure. However, with \n     the economic opportunities that a well-crafted measure could \n     afford and emerging political consensus for advancing such an \n     effort, we believe it is time for all involved parties to \n     come together and craft a final product.\n       In 2011, political leaders--Republican and Democrat, House, \n     Senate and the Administration--stated a multi-year surface \n     transportation bill is important for job creation and \n     economic recovery. We urge you to follow words with action: \n     Make Transportation Job #1 and move legislation immediately \n     in the House and Senate to invest in the roads, bridges, \n     transit systems that are the backbone of the U.S. economy, \n     its businesses large and small, and communities of all sizes.\n         From over 1,000 organizations, led by U.S. Chamber.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am going to name a few of them: the \nAmerican Composite Manufacturers Association, American Concrete \nPavement Association, American Hotel and Lodging Association, American \nNursery and Landscape Association, American Society of Civil Engineers, \nAssociated General Contractors of America, National Society of \nProfessional Engineers, National Resources Defense Council, North \nAmerican Die Casting Association, Pacific Northwest Waterways \nAssociation, Reconnecting America, Retail Industry Leaders Association, \nTransportation for America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Travel \nAssociation, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, Laborers \nInternational, International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association--\nit goes on and on, a thousand groups representing Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents.\n  I am so grateful to them. I speak to them, frankly, a couple of times \na week to tell them what we are doing here to move this important bill \nforward. I told them yesterday they needed to contact every single \nSenator in this Chamber to let them know what is at stake in their \nState.\n  In closing, I will say this: Sometimes when we act we not only do \nsomething good, which this bill will do--it is a reform bill, it is a \ngreat bill, and it adds to the TIFIA Program, an idea that came out of \nLos Angeles and is going to create up to 1 million new jobs while \nprotecting 1.8 million jobs--we do many good things. But also when we \ndo this, we stop bad things from happening. What will happen if we fail \nto act by March 31 and there is no action to fill that trust fund, \nwhich our bill does? There will be over 600,000 jobs lost.\n  Later today, at a time when others are not here, I will go State by \nState. Here it is. ``Estimated jobs lost.'' There would be a 35-percent \ncut in transportation funding if we do not pass this bill and the \nfinance title that raises the funds necessary. We will break this down. \nLet me tell you, it is an ugly picture for us to have to go home and \nface the music at home and tell construction workers that even though \nwe have 1.5 million unemployed construction workers, that is going to \ngo up by 600,000 jobs.\n  We cannot afford to let this bill stop. I will not let this bill go \naway. I will assert every right I have as a Senator from California, \nwhere we have 63,000 of these jobs at stake. I am going to be here on \nthe Senate floor. We are going to get this bill done one way or \nanother. We stand ready to work with our colleagues, to work with our \nRepublican friends, to go through these amendments that are relevant \nand urge them to backtrack on these very unrelated amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished chair of the committee, for her work in managing this \nbill. This is a huge bill. It has many titles. It is a complex bill. It \nis a totally vital bill. Both on this floor and off this floor, she has \nbeen advocating and pushing and doing what is necessary. I want to say \nthank you very much to my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator, and we are working on that too.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, let me describe what happened in \n2008 in Chatsworth, CA. On September 12, 2008, Metrolink commuter train \n111, carrying more than 200 people, departed the Chatsworth train \nstation about 4:20 p.m. Heading west, the commuter train ran through a \ntrain signal at 44 miles per hour at about 4:22 p.m. and 2 seconds. The \ntrain signal showed red, for stop.\n  At the same time, a Union Pacific freight train, weighing four times \nthe weight of the commuter train, was heading east on the same track. \nIt exited a tunnel with little time to react to the oncoming commuter \ntrain. Both trains were on the same track going in opposite directions, \neach going roughly 40 miles per hour. The trains collided head on.\n  The carnage was unspeakable; 25 people died. Their bodies, many torn \nto pieces, had to be extracted from heaps of steel and wreckage.\n  This is the scene. This is the commuter train. This is the freight \ntrain. This is the car that essentially chopped apart 25 people.\n  As Superior Court Judge Peter Lichtman wrote:\n\n       These were teachers, Federal, State, municipal employees, \n     business owners, executives, artists and students that were \n     all lost on that day.\n       Many families were left without any provider, not to \n     mention the loss of a mom or dad.\n\n  Another 101 people were injured, many of them very seriously. \nVolunteers and rescue crews worked valiantly to pull them from the \nwreckage.\n  You can see this overturned train here. You see the rescue crews. It \nwas a terrible, terrible scene.\n  Judge Peter Lichtman described many of these injuries. Passengers \nseated at table seats suffered ``horrible abdominal injuries that could \nnot be medically resolved.'' ``All of the bench passengers were \nlaunched head [or] face first into a bulkhead.'' ``Almost all of these \npassengers suffered traumatic brain injuries to varying degrees.''\n  Let me explain how and why this happened. Seconds before the crash, \nthe train's engineer was text-messaging on his cell phone. He was the \nonly personnel aboard that train when he looked down to send a text to \na teenage boy. This was one of 21 text messages sent by this engineer \nthis day. He received 20 secretaries messages and made four outgoing \ntelephone calls, all while he was driving a large commuter train.\n  According to the NTSB's comprehensive report on the crash, this \nbehavior distracted the engineer and caused the collision. It led to \nthe train running red signals. In fact, NTSB found the passenger \ntrain's engineer never even hit the brakes before impact. NTSB found \nthat a crash avoidance system would have stopped the train and \nprevented this disaster, but, unfortunately, the tracks in Los Angeles \nhad and have no such system nor do most tracks in the United States.\n  As a result of this accident, 25 people died and 100 people were \ninjured. The statistics about the Chatsworth disaster do not begin to \ntell the story. Perhaps I might be able to better put into words what \nis at stake in this debate in one of the votes we will be taking about \npositive train control by telling you a little bit about Kari Hsieh and \nAtul Vyas.\n  Eighteen-year-old Kari did not want to trouble her father to drive \nher from the family's Newhall home to a restaurant in Simi Valley, so \nshe took the train. In October 2008 she became one of many young people \nkilled in this crash. She was just starting her senior year at Hart \nHigh School and looking forward to a career in medicine, according to \nher family. She played tennis for the school and was well liked by her \nclassmates who described her as warm and caring. ``Anyone who knew her \ncan remember her by her beaming smile and infectious laugh,'' one of \nher classmates told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n  Here she is.\n  ``She had such a positive outlook on life and always had something \nnice to say about everyone,'' wrote a parent of a varsity tennis \nplayer. ``I feel blessed to have been part of her life.''\n  Then there is Atul Vyas, a student at Claremont McKenna College, who \nwas studying to become a doctor. At 20 years old, he was in the process \nof applying to graduate programs at MIT, Duke, and Harvard. He scored \nin the top 1 percent of his medical school entry exams, but he was \nhaving trouble answering one question on applications: Describe a \nhardship you have overcome.\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\n  ``He said `I have not had any.' I have had a blessed life,'' \nexplained his father. Atul never finished that application nor did he \nreach his goal of medical school. He took Metrolink train 111 home to \nvisit his family as he did every 2 to 3 weeks, but he never made it \nhome because an engineer was texting.\n  As the NTSB found, these young lives and the lives of 23 others could \nhave been saved if crash avoidance technology, known as positive train \ncontrol, had been in place. In 2008, Congress finally required \nrailroads to deploy positive train control, which the National \nTransportation Safety Board had placed on its top 10 most wanted safety \ntechnologies listed since 1990. This body gave the railroad industry 7 \nyears to deploy positive train control crash avoidance systems \nnationwide. The leaders of Southern California's Metrolink, Union \nPacific, and BNSF railroads each committed to deploy positive train \ncontrol systems in Los Angeles years earlier than the national mandate. \nThese railroads are still on track to deploy the system next year.\n  I met yesterday with John Fenton, the new CEO of Metrolink, and Matt \nRose, the CEO of BNSF. They both indicated their desire to make their \nhighest priority positive train control, and I thank them. Metrolink is \ngoing to go ahead with it as soon as possible regardless. BNSF told us \nif they delay--if this bill delays it, they may take an additional \nyear.\n  I salute both of them for their support of this program. However, I \nam very alarmed that others in the railroad industry and in Congress \ndiminish the value of positive train control.\n  As a matter of fact, the bill we will most likely be voting on--in \none of its titles, the commerce title--delays positive train control \nuntil 2018. The House bill delays it until 2020. When the technology is \nthere, despite its complications of installation, when you have high-\nrisk lines, freight lines and commuter lines traveling in opposite \ndirections on the same track, and when you have human frailty--in this \ncase one engineer texting aboard a commuter train of a couple of \nhundred people--the only answer to assure the safety to the commuter \ntrains of this Nation, in my view, is positive train control. I view it \nas an emergency need. The NTSB views it as an emergency need.\n  According to them, scores of deadly accidents across the country \nsince 1970 could have been prevented if positive train control in \neffect were installed. I agree strongly with the NTSB Chairman, Deborah \nHersman, whom I happen to know, who recently wrote to the Congress \nthat:\n\n       The NTSB will be disappointed if installation of this vital \n     safety system to prevent fatalities and injuries is delayed.\n\n  The need to extend the 2015 positive train control deployment \ndeadline has not been demonstrated. The Senate Commerce Committee has \nheld no hearings on this issue and no published reports investigating \nthis question have recommended an extension, according to the NTSB \nexperts.\n  Furthermore, every railroad has submitted an approved plan to meet \nthe 2015 deadline to the Federal Railroad Administration, and the \nadministration is preparing a report to Congress on positive train \ncontrol deployment progress this year, which should provide us guidance \non that effort to date.\n  I think Congress should consider the FRA's findings carefully before \nscaling back or delaying a system that can prevent crashes such as \nChatsworth. And there have been three prior crashes that have taken \nlives on this Metrolink system. These are not isolated. They happen. We \nnow have a technical system that can be 100 percent proof-positive to \nprovide safety. So I am very concerned that without a national \nstrategy, deployment of positive train control in southern California \nwill become more difficult. There will be excuses, and there will be a \nlessening of effort. And both BNSF and Metrolink have made very strong \nefforts to comply with 2015. Why change it? The Los Angeles area is a \nhuge commuter area, and when it is not necessary to change it, why do \nit? The national requirement to deploy the system by 2015 creates a \nsubstantial incentive for industry to develop new and cost-effective \ntechnology that lowers the deployment costs for everyone, including \nMetrolink.\n\n  The national strategy, which will hopefully be presented in the FRA's \n2012 report to Congress, could play a significant role in addressing \npositive train control deployment barriers. This system can prevent \nhuman error from causing collisions, dangerous releases of hazardous \nmaterials, and passengers and train crews from being killed and \ninjured.\n  So I make these remarks today in the hopes that there will be support \nin this body for the 2015 deadline. And I really appeal to the \ncommittee that right now it is locked in at 2018--we have tried, we \nhave talked to the staff, and we have been rejected--to understand that \nwhat they are delaying is a device that saves lives, and there is no \nexcuse for so doing. The case has not been made to do so. The hearings \nhave not taken place, there was no markup to add this, and I strongly \nbelieve it should not be delayed in this bill. I hope Members will \nlisten. I hope they will respond. Hundreds of thousands of commuters \nare at risk until this system is put into place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, dependency often leads to indolence, \nlethargy, a sense of entitlement, and ultimately to a state of \ninsolence. Egypt has been receiving welfare from the United States for \nnearly 40 years. America has lavished $60 billion on Egypt. They react \nwith insolence and disregard by detaining 19 of our U.S. citizens. For \nseveral months now these citizens have been essentially held hostage, \nunable to leave Egypt. They are held on the pretense of trumped-up \npolitical charges, held in order to display them in show trials to \nplacate the mob.\n  The United States can respond in one of two ways: We can hang our \nhead low; we can take the tack of Jimmy Carter; we can try to placate \nEgypt with concessions and offer them bribes in the form of more \ngovernment aid; or America can respond with strength.\n  Today the President should call the Egyptian Ambassador in and send \nhim home with a message, a message that America will not tolerate any \ncountry holding U.S. citizens as political prisoners. Congress should \nact today to tell Egypt that we will no longer send our annual welfare \ncheck to them; that this year's $1.8 billion is not on the way. America \ncould put Egyptian travelers on notice that the welcome sign in America \nwill temporarily expire unless the Egyptian Government lets our people \ngo; or America could hang her head, promise to continue the foreign aid \nto Egypt, and apologize for supporting democracy. Which will it be?\n  So far, the signal sent to Egypt from the President and from the \nSenate has been weak or counterproductive. In late January the \nPresident's Under Secretary of State said to the administration that he \nwanted to provide more immediate benefits to Egypt; let's speed up the \nwelfare checks. The President's budget this week still continues to \ninclude $1.8 billion for Egypt without a single word of rebuke or any \ndemand that our U.S. citizens be released. The President went one step \nfurther when he actually increased foreign aid to the Middle East in \nhis budget, and now the Senate refuses to hold a single vote to spend \n10 minutes discussing why U.S. citizens are being detained in Egypt.\n  One might excuse the Egyptians for not believing we will cut their \naid. You cannot lead from behind. Senate leadership appears unwilling \nto address this issue head-on, so the Senate won't act to help our \ncitizens this week.\n  I hope that when Senators return home and talk to their constituents \nin their States, their constituents will ask these questions: Senator, \nwhy do you continue to send our taxpayer money to Egypt? Why do you \ncontinue to send our money to Egypt when they detain our citizens? \nSenator, why do you continue to send billions of dollars to Egypt when \n12 million Americans are out of work? Senator, why do you continue to \nsend welfare to foreign countries when our bridges are falling down and \nin desperate need of repair? Senator, how can you continue to flush our \ntaxpayer money down a foreign drain when we are borrowing $40,000 a \nsecond? The money we send to Egypt we must first borrow from China. \nThat is insanity, and it must end. Finally, Mr. Senator, I hope your \nconstituents ask you this when you go home: When working families are \nsuffering under\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nrising food prices, when working families are suffering because gas \nprices have doubled, how can you justify sending our hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars to Egypt, to countries that openly show their disdain \nfor us?\n  When will we learn? You can't buy friendship, and you can't convince \nauthoritarians to love freedom with welfare checks.\n  America needs to send a clear and unequivocal message to Egypt that \nwe will not tolerate the detention of U.S. citizens on trumped-up \npolitical charges or otherwise and that we will not continue to send \nwelfare checks to Egypt, to a country that commits an injustice to \nAmerican citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent today to set aside the pending amendment and \ncall up my amendment on Egypt that would end all foreign aid to Egypt \nif our U.S. citizens are not released within 30 days. I think this is \nan important amendment which deserves discussion, and Egypt deserves to \nhear a message from the Senate that we will not tolerate this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to bring up amendment No. 1541.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nbe very clear here that Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans \nand Democrats, have very strong feelings that this amendment should not \nbe brought up at this time. We need to be smart and strategic when we \nhave people in harm's way in other countries.\n  Further, I think it is important to note what Senator Leahy has said \nseveral times, which is already in law--we have certain conditions \nplaced upon aid to Egypt, and I think that needs to be understood and \nexplored.\n  So because there is so much objection to this amendment being brought \nup at this time, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If it is appropriate, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business for about 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If a Republican like this Senator says that the \nPresident's 2013 budget doesn't pass the smell test, I would probably \nhave half the country questioning my judgment. But I would like to \nquote the Washington Post's Dana Milbank's comments on the President's \nbudget. This was recently in the Washington Post, these words by a \ncolumnist who I think is generally pretty favorable toward President \nObama as a person and his administration, but there is great \ndisagreement by this columnist about the President's budget.\n\n       The White House budget for fiscal 2013 begins with a broken \n     promise, adds some phony policy assumptions, throws in a few \n     rosy forecasts, and omits all kinds of painful decisions . . \n     . the proposal would add $1 trillion more to the national \n     debt than Obama contemplated a few months ago.\n\n  Dana Milbank added that the Obama budget ``is a nonstarter on Capitol \nHill, where even Senate Democrats have no plans to take it up. It is, \nin other words, exactly what it was supposed to be: a campaign \ndocument.''\n  So with that background from somebody who is not a Member of \nCongress, not a Republican or Democrat--I don't know how he might be \nregistered--I would like to give my views on the President's budget, \nbut just so that people know it isn't just Republicans who disagree \nwith the President's budget.\n  I think you could sum up the President's budget with three words that \nmight say you are giving it a D grade, and probably most people would \ngive it an F grade, but they would be debt, deficit, distrust, and \ndisaster--too much spending, too much taxing, and too much debt. This \ncomes from the fact that earlier this week the President submitted--as \nhe has to every year--a budget proposal, and this budget proposal was \nall too predictable. It was predictable because it follows the same \npath as his previous three budgets. With breathtaking irresponsibility, \nthe President's 2013 budget would expand the scope of government by \nspending more money, increase taxes on job creators, particularly small \nbusiness, and continue on the path of enormous deficits and record \ndebt--deja vu.\n  The President's budget proposal is supposed to be a serious document, \na document that lays out the President's priorities along with the \nPresident's ideas on how to address our national fiscal and economic \nchallenges. This budget fails those goals miserably.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I have heard from numerous \nexperts who come before that committee about the need for Congress and \nthe President to get serious about the fiscal cliff we are approaching. \nWe have had deficit commissions--you remember Simpson-Bowles, as an \nexample--we have had task forces, and we have had what we call gangs, \nthe Gang of 6, six Senators trying to work things out, and other \nMembers of Congress. All have put forward deficit reduction plans. It \nis going to take more than a commission, and the President didn't even \nback the recommendations of his own commission a year ago. It is going \nto take more than task forces, and it is going to take more than gangs \nof Senators because the single most important political and moral \nleader in America is whoever holds the Presidency of the United \nStates. In this particular instance of this executive budget, that \nperson and that document has failed to lead on this critical issue. It \ndoes not matter how many commissions, how many tasks forces, and how \nmany gangs of Senators we have, without Presidential participation a \nproblem as big as this country's national debt is never going to be \nsolved.\n\n  What President Obama put forward on Monday of this week is not a \nserious budget. As I said before, it is a political statement. The fact \nis Americans are going to pay a heavy price for the President's \nunwillingness and inability to lead.\n  While President Obama claims his budget will create an America built \nto last, his budget builds higher deficits and debt, a bigger, more \nintrusive government, and economic decline for future generations.\n  We want to remember that more important than the economic points of a \nbudget is, when we get a more intrusive government, the less economic \nand social freedom people have.\n  By nearly every fiscal measure, President Obama's budget makes \nmatters much worse. Not only has the President chosen to ignore the \nlooming fiscal catastrophe, he has chosen to continue the course and \neven step on the accelerator.\n  This year, the Federal Government will spend $3.8 trillion--equal to \n24.1 percent of our GDP. During the past 60 years, we have averaged \nabout 21 percent of GDP. So we quantify government growing dramatically \nfrom taking 21 percent out of the economy--that government spends, 535 \nMembers of Congress spend; instead of 300 million Americans--and that \nis raised to 24.3 percent.\n  Alarmingly, over the 10-year period ahead, in the 2013 budget, in \nthis budget, spending never gets below 22 percent. So forever they are \ngrowing government and detracting from individual freedom.\n  The President intends to lock in historically high levels of \nspending. Do not take it from me, but it is right here in these budget \ndocuments we have all been given this week. He is a big spender of \nother people's money.\n  In dollar terms, spending goes up from $3.8 trillion this year to \n$5.8 trillion 2022. Over a 10-year period of time, this budget spends \nabout $47 trillion, and during that period of time, it increases the \nnational debt by $11 trillion. So it is clear this document the \nPresident gives to Congress under law is built to spend.\n  President Obama's budget is also harmful to our fragile economy \nbecause it would impose a $1.9 trillion tax increase.\n  I always go back to what I thought was a very wise decision President \nObama made about 2 or 3 weeks before he actually took the oath of \noffice. During the campaign, he reminded everybody he wanted to raise \ntaxes. But when he got to being sworn in, he looked at how bad the \neconomy was, and he clearly said it is not too wise to raise taxes when \nwe are in recession.\n  Maybe technically we are not in a recession, but for the 8.3 percent \nof the American people who are unemployed, it is not just a recession, \nit is also a depression for each one of them.\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\n  So since the unemployment rate stands at 8.3 percent, and the \nPresident seems to be just fine this year, compared to 3 years ago when \nhe was sworn in, that hiking taxes is not going to be harmful to the \neconomy, it is not going to be harmful to those 8.3 percent of the \npeople who are unemployed and looking for jobs, it is going to be. So \nwhy has the President flip-flopped on this issue of whether you ought \nto increase taxes when people have such high unemployment rates?\n  This tax increase will harm the economy and result in fewer job \nopportunities, particularly among the small businesspeople who create \nor provide for 25 percent of the jobs in America and generally create \n70 percent of the new jobs in our economy. That is where it is going to \nbe very harmful.\n  I recently asked Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke about the \nprospects of a tax increase and the impact it would have on our \neconomy. He indicated a significant tax hike could slow the economy, \nslow the recovery. In my question to him before the Budget Committee, I \nquoted the Congressional Budget Office that says unemployment would go \nup and the economy would grow less if we had this big tax increase the \nPresident wants.\n  The President has spent many hours speaking about helping our \neconomy, investing in our future, and increasing economic opportunities \nfor all Americans. While he is saying all those things that he is \nprobably sincere about, at the same time he does not put his actions \nwhere his words are because he does not allow a pipeline to be built \nthat will create 20,000 jobs right now and 110,000 indirect jobs \nconnected with it.\n  If he gets his wish to hike taxes by $1.9 trillion, it will harm all \nAmericans, further prolong this already 3-year slowdown, while growing \nan even larger, more intrusive Federal Government impinging upon \npersonal liberties to a greater extent.\n  Maybe the President's purpose in imposing this huge tax increase is \nan effort to reduce the Nation's debt and that is probably what he \nwould tell us, and he may truly believe that. Unfortunately, that is \nnot what he has planned. He wants to spend every dollar. His budget \nleads to an additional, as I said before, $11 trillion increase in \ndebt--national debt--over the next 10 years. Debt held by the public \nincreases from 74 percent of our economy today to 76 percent of our \neconomy by the year 2022, at the end of this 10-year budget window.\n  We have to compare that to the historic average since World War II, \nand that was just 43 percent, compared to where it is right now: 74.2 \npercent, going up to 76 percent.\n  If people believe President Obama is putting us on a path to fiscal \nsustainability by taxing increases, I would suggest they look at the \nannual deficits over the next 10 years. These deficits never drop below \n$575 billion, and actually go up toward the end of his budget, rising \nto $704 billion by 2022. This budget puts America on the course of \ndeficits and debt as far as the eye can see into the future.\n  Additionally, the President took a pass on proposing any real changes \nto our entitlement programs, which are the real driver of future \ndeficits and debt. That is only part of it. The main part of it is, do \nwe want to preserve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for future \ngenerations? Because if we do not do something about it, it is not \ngoing to be preserved. Again, he is absent from the discussion when \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid comes up.\n\n  He has offered no solution in this budget, even though the Simpson-\nBowles Commission he appointed--he never endorsed their recommendations \n1 year ago; and why he did not endorse and trust the people he put in \nplace to get a solution to these problems I do not know, but even the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission has solutions for Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid. That is further evidence that the President has chosen \nnot to lead on these very difficult issues.\n  President Obama has spoken a lot lately about the issue of fairness. \nPresident Obama believes this type of budget, with higher taxes, more \nborrowing, and enormous deficits and debt will bring about fairness.\n  If the President is referring to sharing in our Nation's economic \ndecline, he is right. If he is talking about sharing in a Japanese-like \nprolonged period of stagflation, he is right. If he is talking about \nsharing in an economic collapse such as the one going on in Greece, he \nis right. It may not be tomorrow, but all signs point down the road in \nthose directions because based upon the national debts of those \nparticular countries, that is where we are headed.\n  The budget proposed by President Obama will have all Americans \nsharing in higher taxes, a larger, more intrusive government, less \nfreedom, and deficits and debt that will lead to economic decline for \nfuture generations.\n  We all know a large budget deficit reduces national savings, leading \nto higher interest rates, more borrowing from abroad, and less domestic \ninvestment, which, in turn, would lower income growth in our country.\n  This will hurt the lower and middle class the most. The gains \nPresident Obama touts in his budget that he is delivering to the middle \nclass will be dwarfed by the loss of economic activity caused by \ndeficits and debt.\n  This is not a serious document. It is a political document. As \nevidence of how out of touch this budget is, few of my Democratic \ncolleagues have even acknowledged President Obama submitted a budget, \nmuch less defend it.\n  I hope the Senate will have an opportunity to debate and vote upon \nPresident Obama's budget. Last year, we had such a vote. Last year, the \nPresident's budget was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 97 to 0. Not \na single member of the President's party supported his budget.\n  So when constituents ask me why we cannot do something in a \nbipartisan way in Congress--and we do a lot in a bipartisan way that \ndoes not get the attention of the press, so people are cynical about \nCongress being bipartisan--I quote a 97-to-0 vote about whether there \nis bipartisanship, and that was a vote against the President's budget. \nEvery Republican and every Democrat agreed. Once again this year, if we \never get this to a vote, I predict that very few, if any, will support \nthis budget.\n  Quite frankly, it would be humorous if the consequences of inaction \nwere not so serious. We have a moral obligation to offer serious \nsolutions for today and for future generations. The President's budget \nfails in this responsibility. He has chosen a politically expedient \npath rather than a responsible, forthright path.\n  Our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will suffer as a result of \nthis failure, and that suffering comes from this fact: that for nine \ngenerations of Americans, each succeeding generation has lived better \nthan the previous generation, and a lot of Americans feel that is not \ngoing to happen with the next generation. That would be a sad \ncommentary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              China Trade\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I was presiding earlier today \nbefore the Senator from North Carolina. I listened to Senator Boxer \ntalk about the importance of this Transportation bill, this highway \nbill, which I underscore.\n  This week we have seen movement on extension of the payroll tax and \ntax cuts and unemployment benefits, two very important things--with the \ndoctors fix too--very important things to keep our economy moving. It \nmade me think back what has happened in the last couple of years.\n  In 2009, when Senator Obama became President Obama, we were losing \n800,000 jobs a month in the United States. We know what was happening, \nespecially to manufacturing and especially in States such as the \nPresiding Officer's, North Carolina, and my State of Ohio. In fact, we \nhad for 12 years--\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nevery single year for 12 years--from 1997 to 2009, we had lost \nmanufacturing jobs every single year in Ohio and in the United States.\n  But after President Obama took office, we passed the Recovery Act, we \ndid some other things, the health care bill, all of that. We have begun \nto see, month after month after month, job growth. Not job growth that \nwe want yet, not the kind of strong job growth we want. But for 21, 22 \nconsecutive months we have seen more manufacturing jobs than the month \nbefore, including my State of Ohio--more manufacturing jobs every \nsingle month than the preceding month for 20, 21, 22 months in a row.\n  Why is that? There are a lot of reasons. No. 1 is we have begun to \nput the economy on track--no longer losing 800,000 jobs a month; \ninstead, gaining manufacturing jobs every month.\n  The auto rescue has made a huge difference in States such as Ohio, \nbut really across the country as we have seen manufacturing take off.\n  Coming out of every recession, what leads out of the recession? \nTypically it is the auto industry. And in the Midwest and throughout \nthe country, people are making cars, they are buying cars, all the \neconomic activities generated from making a car and buying a car and \nrunning a car.\n  One of the untold stories, in Toledo, OH, in northwest Ohio, near the \nMichigan border, the Jeep plant, the Chrysler-Jeep plant--Chrysler, a \ncompany that was saved by the auto rescue. They went into bankruptcy. \nThe restructuring and the financing by U.S. taxpayers got that company \nback on its feet, back into business making cars. But prior to the auto \nrescue in 2008, the Jeep plant in Toledo--only 50 percent of the \nproducts going into a Jeep, the components assembled in Toledo, only 50 \npercent were American made. Do you know what happened after the auto \nrescue? Now 75 percent of those products are American made, those \ncomponents. That is exactly the point. Because it is not just the \ncompanies you hear about--Honda has a big operation in Ohio, Chrysler, \nGM, Ford, all big operations in Ohio, all expanding, all investing--\njust in the last 6 months, each of those four companies has announced \nmajor investment dollars going into Ohio operations.\n  It is not just those auto plants, it is the supply chain. So if a \nChrysler Jeep is made out of 75-percent American parts rather than 50-\npercent American parts, think of the jobs that creates: tires, steering \nwheels, blocks, transmissions, the engine, the fenders, all of the \nsteel, all of the electronics, all of the products that go into those \nautomobiles and trucks. That is in many ways the untold story.\n  The problem, though, with that is we are still seeing China, the \nPeople's Republic of China, Communist China, cheating when it comes to \nauto parts. The auto parts trade deficit a decade ago was about $1 \nbillion, meaning that the U.S. companies bought $1 billion in Chinese-\nmade auto parts more than we sold to China--auto parts made in this \ncountry. We had a $1 billion deficit in auto parts. Today, that deficit \nis about 800 percent bigger than that. It is around $10 billion, that \nauto parts trade deficit. So the point of that is if we can turn that \naround, if we can force the Chinese to play fair and stand up and \npractice trade according to our national interests, not according to \nsome economic textbook that is 20 years out of print, if we can do \nthat, it will mean way more American jobs making auto components in \nsteel, in rubber, and all of those things that go into the creation of \nan automobile, the assembly of an automobile and a truck.\n  Yesterday, 100 feet from here, a group of us met with the Vice \nPresident of China, who will soon be the leader of that country, people \nwho know China well predict. I asked him a question about that, that \nChina does not play fair, they do not play fair on currency, they do \nnot play fair when it comes to subsidizing energy and water and capital \nand land. Of course, he deflected the question. He did not answer. I \ndid not expect him to. But I wanted him to know as eight or nine of us \nwere sitting around the table, I was the only one who directly brought \nup the issue of jobs and this economic relationship, leveling the \nplaying field.\n  But that is why it is so important that the House of Representatives \npass my China currency bill. This is legislation the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mrs. Hagan, has cosponsored. It is legislation that Lindsey \nGraham from South Carolina, a Republican, has cosponsored. It is \nlegislation that Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat, has \ncosponsored, along with Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, and \nDebbie Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan, and Senator Sessions, a \nRepublican from Alabama, all of us who have come together.\n  My currency bill was the largest bipartisan jobs bill that the Senate \npassed in 2011. Unfortunately, Speaker Boehner in the House of \nRepresentatives is blocking it. It is important that he move on that. \nIt will have a strong bipartisan vote out of the House of \nRepresentatives, as it did--far in excess of 60 votes in the Senate.\n  It works like this, briefly: With China cheating on currency, it \nmeans that a product made in Cleveland, OH, and sold in Wuhan, China \nhas a minimum 25 percent--some former Reagan administration officials \nsay 40 or 50 percent--but at least a 25-percent currency tariff or tax, \nthat every one of our products is taxed that way. That cost is added to \nit when it is sold in China.\n  Conversely, if the Chinese make something and sell it into Akron or \nLima or Mansfield, OH, that product is 25 percent less expensive, which \nmeans that American companies cannot compete. There was a company in \nBrunswick. I was talking to two brothers who run this company. They \nwere about to make a million-dollar sale. All of a sudden the Chinese \ncompetitor came in, with that 25-percent bonus that they get because \nChina games and cheats on the currency system, and they were \nunderpriced by 20 percent. So that clearly does not work.\n\n  That is why I said that to the Vice President of China about the \nimportance of currency. That is why the House of Representatives needs \nto pass my legislation. It will mean we can keep this recovery going. \nThe 21 months in a row of manufacturing job growth, coupled with the \nextension of the payroll tax cut, coupled with the extension of \nunemployment benefits, coupled with the Transportation bill, the \nhighway bill that Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe bipartisanly are \nworking on, coupled with standing up to the Chinese on trade \nenforcement and on this currency bill, will mean we are going to get \nthis recovery, we are going to sustain it, we are going to grow it. It \nis going to mean significant new jobs in my State of Ohio and across \nthe country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Fiscal Responsibility\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the dire \nfinances of this great Nation and the policies and laws of this \ngovernment that are only weakening our fiscal standing for future \ngenerations.\n  A year ago, I was in a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and \nthen-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mike Mullen was asked: \nWhat is the greatest threat to our Nation and our national security? I \nwould have thought he would have said terrorism, the terrorists, al-\nQaida, North Africa, could have been Iran, it could have been another \nrising military power, but he didn't hesitate in responding that the \nnational debt is the greatest threat to our country.\n  That was one of the most sobering moments I have experienced since \nbecoming a Senator. I thought more people would hear what he said and \ntake this situation more seriously, but things have only gotten worse \nsince then. Our debt ceiling is at a record here, $16.4 trillion. By \n2022, according to the President's newly proposed budget, we will be \n$25.9 trillion in debt. That means every man, woman, and child will be \nresponsible for more than $79,000 of debt. Our children and \ngrandchildren will be paying more in interest on that debt than we \nspend on education, energy, and defense--combined. Our elected leaders \nshould be negotiating solutions but instead everyone is\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\ncooking up short-term Band-Aids that create long-term obligations that \nwill take years for future generations to repay. They are trying to \nfigure out how to point fingers at the other side.\n\n  There is not a person in West Virginia who can understand why \npolitics is trumping our future fiscal stability. I don't think there \nis a person in America who understands why in Washington we cannot come \ntogether on a long-term fix to the problems we have. And for the life \nof me, I cannot imagine why our elected leaders from both sides of the \naisle continue to play political football with our spending, our debt, \nand our children's future. This isn't how we reach a solution.\n  When I was Governor of the State of West Virginia, I didn't blame \nprevious administrations for our problems. I took the responsibility \nfor fixing them. And I didn't come here to blame anyone for our \nproblems either. I came here to fix them. I didn't come here to put the \nnext generation into more debt; I came here to get them out of it. I \ncame here to serve my State and Washington because my parents and \ngrandparents left me a country that was in very sound fiscal shape and \nI want to do the same for the next generation. I came here because in \nWest Virginia, even during a recession, we lived within our means and \nhad a surplus every year that I was Governor. The people of my State \nare proud of what our little State accomplished, and I know Americans \ncan again feel that same pride in this great Nation of ours. I know we \ncan put our fiscal house back in order.\n  I had those priorities in mind when I looked at the President's \nproposed budget, the projected deficits, the accumulated debt over the \nnext decade and wondered, what in the world are we doing? This budget \nclaims to be balanced, but only if we don't count the exploding \ninterest we must pay on our ever-increasing debt. Including interest, \nthere is not a single year that this budget is balanced. At the end of \nthe decade, this budget puts an additional $6.7 trillion more on the \ndebt. And I would ask anybody, how does that make sense?\n  This is not the first time I have shared my concerns about this \ncountry going down the wrong fiscal track, and I can already hear some \nfolks saying: Oh, there goes Joe Manchin again blaming President Obama. \nWell, let me tell you, I am a proud Democrat, but I am a proud West \nVirginian and American first, and I will stand and speak my mind \nwhether our President is a Democrat or Republican. I am trying to be as \nunderstanding and respectful as possible in my critique, but what we \nare doing doesn't make any sense at all to me, and I certainly cannot \nin good conscience tell the people of West Virginia any differently. \nAnd if we don't do anything to address this fiscal mess, the priorities \nof both Democrats and Republicans will face the consequences.\n  Standing here, I tell my Democratic friends that we must face the \ntruth that the very programs we care so dearly about and fight so hard \nfor will be destroyed unless we do something about this exploding debt. \nStanding here, I also tell my Republican friends that they too must \nface the truth or not only will the programs they care about be \ndestroyed, they may be forced to one day support a massive tax increase \nto simply keep this country solvent. Both scenarios are unacceptable \nand preventable.\n  There is a commonsense solution to our Nation's dire fiscal woes \nwithin our grasp. We already have a template with substantial \nbipartisan support, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans in \nboth the House and the Senate, that gives us a starting point with \nwhich to move forward. As I have said before, the Bowles-Simpson \nframework might not be perfect, but it has more support from both sides \nof the aisle than anything else I have seen since I came here. Not only \nthat, it withstood the test of time better than any other proposal I \nhave seen. It is a framework that cuts trillions from our debt, makes \nour tax system more fair, and raises revenue without raising tax rates. \nThe only problem is that our country's leaders from both parties won't \nmove forward with the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson Commission. \nSo instead of real solutions where we choose our priorities based on \nour values, we see political proposals that will only send this country \nfurther into a death spiral of debt.\n  Take for example the fact that this body will soon debate extending \nthe so-called payroll tax cut for the remainder of this year, 10 more \nmonths. Let's call that what it really is: It truly is cutting funding \nto Social Security. This Congress has voted twice since I have been \nhere to tell Americans that they don't have to pay their share as far \nas their obligation to Social Security. I voted for the idea the first \ntime around because I thought, as it was proposed to me, it might \ncreate jobs or save jobs. But I don't think we have seen much evidence \nthat that happened, so I decided to stop throwing good money after bad \nand stop jeopardizing Social Security. But, as I warned this fall, \nalong with my dear friend Senator Mark Kirk, whom all of our prayers \nare with, now we are talking about extending this policy indefinitely \nbecause once something like this is enacted, even an act of Congress \ncan't reverse it. It might take an act of God to reverse it.\n  I know going back home and saying we voted for tax cuts is popular. \nEveryone wants to be popular in this arena. But this is not a tax cut, \nthis is a Social Security cut, plain and simple, and you cannot make it \nlook any different. Knowing that we are adding 10,000 beneficiaries \nturning 65 years of age every day--and when you look at last year, \nSocial Security was the first time we paid out more than we took in--it \ndoesn't make any sense. Just what exactly will continuing this policy \ndo to the long-term solvency of Social Security? The answer is very \nsimple: It will be a disaster.\n  The so-called experts will tell you that everything will be right \nbecause we will backfill those contributions with revenue from the \ngeneral fund. Let me remind you that this is the fourth straight year \nthe general fund has operated with a deficit of more than $4 trillion. \nThat has never happened in the life of this great country. We have \naccumulated $15.36 trillion of debt as of today, and the President just \nallowed that to grow to $16.4 trillion with a new debt ceiling. These \nare the same experts who tell us we can balance a budget if we simply \nignore the fundamentals of math. Does that make sense?\n  When this body votes on whether to extend the so-called payroll tax \ncut or, as it should be more accurately described, the defunding of \nSocial Security's revenue stream, I cannot in good conscience vote to \nundermine Social Security. I have taken this position because at the \nend of the day the people of West Virginia and this Nation must be told \nthe truth, which is why the budget proposal the President offered this \nweek is so disappointing and maddening.\n  Let's be clear. Both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for \nour budget problems. Everybody is responsible for where we are today. \nIn fairness, this administration inherited a tremendous debt, falling \nrevenues, and a terrible economy. Everyone was at fault, and the public \nspoke loudly and clearly. They changed things with the 2008 election, \nand they said: Fix it. But we haven't done it, and this budget doesn't \ndo it either.\n  If we are going to address our fiscal nightmare and stop digging a \ndeeper debt hole, we must have meaningful tax reform that not only \nensures that everybody pays their fair share but that also strengthens \nour economy and creates jobs--good jobs. Instead, this budget is not \nbalanced even once. Over the next decade, it would actually add an \nadditional $6.7 trillion more debt on top of the $16.4 trillion debt \nceiling we have now that the President just authorized. That is more \nthan $23 trillion of debt by 2022. That is simply unsustainable.\n  This proposed budget relies too much on phantom accounting from so-\ncalled war savings from a war that should have been over when its \npurpose changed to what I call nation building.\n  In terms of energy investment--one area that business and labor both \nbelieve is critical to not only creating more jobs but keeping the good \njobs we have--this administration continues to pick winners and losers. \nTake the role of coal, for example. As I just pointed out in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, the administration's own Department of \nEnergy forecasts that coal will play a major role in\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nthe energy portfolio well into the coming decades, up through 2035. But \nthis budget slashes funding for the research that would allow us to use \ncoal more efficiently and cleanly with environmental standards for \nwhich we must be responsible. This doesn't make sense, and it puts the \nlivelihoods of an awful lot of West Virginians and Americans in \njeopardy. Those priorities defy common sense, especially when millions \nof people rely on coal for their jobs and the affordable, reliable \nelectricity it produces.\n  We are spending more where we don't need to and less where we do. We \nare extending programs that do not work and going into debt to pay for \nthem, and then we wonder why this great Nation faces such a dire fiscal \nfuture. So if and when the President's budget proposal comes up for a \nvote, I simply cannot support it. As always, though, I will continue to \nwork diligently with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to push \nfor a more commonsense fiscal approach based on the bipartisan Bowles-\nSimpson template so we can finally and responsibly address the fiscal \nproblems our Nation and our families face. I urge the President and my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, allow me to close by saying I do travel my State, \nlike most of my colleagues, and I am sure you do in Missouri. I meet \nwith my constituents, as you do also, and I can tell you what I find \nout from them. There are a lot of issues they are worried about. There \nare some places where they disagree, but there is one issue that gets \nuniversal agreement and brings everybody together when they tell us, to \na person, they are concerned that those of us in Washington are not \nlistening to their cries to put the country ahead of our politics. They \nurge all of us to stand and do what is right for this country.\n  We must not let selfish ambitions about the next election cloud what \nmust be done for the Nation that I know we all love. The challenge \nbefore us is a simple one. Over the course of our history, this Nation \nhas succeeded because our parents and grandparents left our country \nbetter off than what they inherited from their parents and \ngrandparents. We cannot be the first generation to fail to leave the \nUnited States in better shape for the next generation. I don't want to \nbe a part of that. I do not intend to stand by and let a party or \npolitics destroy the hopes of the next generation for this great \ncountry, and I urge all of our congressional leaders and our President \nto put politics aside and realize one simple fact: Whether we are \nDemocrats or Republicans or Independents, we all belong to the same \nparty, and that party is called America, and we will rise or fall \ntogether.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, we voted 85 to 11 to start work on the \nhighway bill, which is an essential piece of legislation to reauthorize \nour highway and transit programs.\n  Eight hundred sixty-eight days have passed since our last Federal \nTransportation bill expired. If you cannot do the math very fast, just \nto put a little more emphasis on that, that is 2 years, 4 months, and \n18 days since the last Federal Transportation bill expired.\n  We need new legislation to help streamline Federal programs, spur job \ncreation, and move our transportation system into the 21st century.\n  This Transportation bill before us is about infrastructure. We call \nit infrastructure because ``infra'' means ``below.'' So it is the \nfoundation beneath everything else on which our civilized country is \nbuilt. As we think about the buildings and operating our municipalities \nand our States and our Federal Government, our country, it is about \nmaking sure we have a sound infrastructure.\n  Our businesses, our workers, our innovators, all of them rely on a \nsystem of quality infrastructure to succeed. More funding for \ntransportation in this bill means we can do critical roads and bridges, \nand we can do repairs to the existing roads and bridges. It means we \nhave more transit for buses and railroads, and it means we can put \npeople back to work. More jobs for construction and manufacturing \nworkers, more jobs for workers means more consumer spending and a \nstronger overall economy.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that for every $1 we \nspend on highways, that spending supports more than 27,000 jobs. \nEconomists at Moody's estimate that for every $1 we invest in \ninfrastructure, our gross domestic product goes up by $1.59. That is \nbecause of the ripple effect those investments have on our economy.\n  The bill before us would help create about 1 million American jobs, \nmany of them in the construction industry, which has been one of the \nhardest hit by the recession. In New Hampshire, the number of people \nwho were working in the construction industry in 2010 was the lowest it \nhad been in a decade--25 percent lower than it was in 2006, 5 years \nago. We need to pass this bill to help put those people back to work.\n  One of the most important efforts we have in New Hampshire right now \nis the long overdue and badly needed widening of Interstate 93, which \nis in the southern part of New Hampshire. I 93 is our State's most \nimportant highway. It connects New Hampshire citizens to their jobs, \nbusinesses to global markets, and communities to each other.\n  Right now this vital artery is badly clogged. Every day 100,000 cars \ntravel on a road designed for 60,000. This congestion wastes time and \nwastes money. Crowding so many vehicles on Interstate 93 is not only an \ninconvenience to the thousands who use it every day, but it also \ncompromises the safety of drivers traveling at regular highway speed in \nheavy traffic.\n  The Interstate 93 project was budgeted and planned based on the idea \nthat the Federal Government would provide a consistent level of \nfunding. But the uncertainty created by the lack of a long-term highway \nbill has made the project difficult to finance. Right now New Hampshire \ntransportation officials have $115 million worth of bonding for this \nproject that is sitting on the sidelines until the Federal Government \nmakes good on its commitment. We need to move these Federal funds off \nthe sidelines and get this project going.\n  Laura Scott, who is the economic development director for the town of \nWindham, near the Massachusetts border, summed it up best:\n\n       The I 93 project is critical to the future economic \n     vitality of Windham and all of southern New Hampshire. Our \n     businesses want it, our citizens want it, and we need to get \n     it done.\n\n  The bill before us today can help complete this vital project and \nothers like it. We need to work on this bill in a bipartisan fashion \njust as it has come out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThere was strong bipartisan support coming out of that committee. We \nneed to set aside the partisanship now, the election year comments, and \ncome together to do what is right for our economy and our country. I \nhope in the end all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about a \ntopic I spoke a little bit about yesterday.\n  I know all the focus right now is working on a solution to some of \nthe things going on between the House and the Senate. I know that is \nwhat people are focused on today. I understand that probably sometime \ntomorrow there will be a vote on the highway bill, which is expected to \nfail, and then it is my understanding there will be some amendments \nbrought forth to bring a finance bill, an EPW bill, a commerce bill, \nand a banking bill together that will actually be debated and, it is my \nsense, will ultimately pass, but that after the recess is over we will \ncome back and deal with that.\n  I wish to speak to that topic now. I know I am beginning to sound a \nlittle\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nbit like a broken record on this, but we have had so many people down \nhere on both sides of the aisle who have actually worked together, for \na year and a half after the Bowles-Simpson report came out, on long-\nterm deficit reduction, progrowth tax reform, and entitlement reform, \nand there seems to be a real seriousness about that issue. I think all \nthose who have signed letters in support of it were very sincere. Yet I \nthink what we are finding with this highway bill, in spite of the \nchanges that are likely to take place with the finance component, is \nthat what we are ending up with is a situation where we have 2 years' \nworth of spending that is taking place and we are using 10 years' worth \nof pay-fors.\n  I can tell you there is no one in this body who likes infrastructure \nmore than me or has spent more time on the back of a paving machine or \non a screed. Those are the kind of things I love to see happening. I \nknow they create jobs and tremendous economic growth over the long \nhaul. But I know the Presiding Officer remembers the debate we had for \na long time in this body over health care, and I know he remembers the \ntremendous discussions that took place on the floor over the financing \nmechanisms. I don't think there is any question that people on my side \nof the aisle railed strongly--I might say as they should have--over the \nfact we had a pay-for formula where basically we were spending money \nover a 6-year period and paying for it over 10.\n  Ultimately, the bill passed, but there was tremendous divide in this \nbody over mostly just the budget gimmickry that took place. Yet what I \nsee getting ready to happen, in a large bipartisan way, is we are going \nto vote for a highway bill, possibly--I am not going to do that--that \nspends money over a 2-year period and recoups it over 10.\n  I am actually stunned by this. We talk about all the things we need \nto do in this body regarding Medicare and how we need to focus on \nreforms that make sure seniors in Vermont and seniors in Tennessee have \nthese programs down the road, and we talk about Medicare in the same \nlight. I think all of us want to make sure Social Security is here for \nfuture generations--for these young people in front of us. All of us \nknow we have to figure out a way to solve that problem. The highway \nbill is simple. It is just math. It is unlike Medicare, it is unlike \nMedicaid, and it is unlike so many of the things we deal with around \nhere that are so complex to get it just right. We have a highway bill \nthat is not complicated. It is just math. There aren't all kinds of \nmoving parts, as far as people providing health care and the incentives \nthat are in place. But it feels to me like what we are getting ready to \ndo as a body--and I hope this is not the case--is to pass a highway \nbill where we are going to do exactly what we have done with the \nsustainable growth rate for physicians in Medicare.\n  Back in 1997, we passed a bill here--I wasn't here at the time--that \nbasically created a mechanism for paying physicians who dealt with \nseniors, and the formula was flawed. So what we have done every 18 \nmonths or every year is cause the medical community to be panicked and \nseniors to be panicked over whether this is going to be extended \nbecause the sustainable growth rate, as it was put forth, was going to \ncall for huge reductions in payments to physicians.\n  We are actually dealing with that right now. It is one of the issues \nwe are trying to work out with the House. What we did was to create a \ncliff. So every time we deal with this issue it gets more and more \ndifficult to deal with it because we will not just sit down and do the \nlong-term reforms on that one component that need to happen. We keep \ntaking from Peter to pay Paul. We keep wrestling with this issue but we \nwill not deal with it.\n  What we are getting ready to do with the highway bill is basically \ninject that same poisonous formula into the highway bill. What we are \ngetting ready to do is to pass a highway bill that will fund highways \nthrough 2013, but at the end of that period of time we will have the \nsame kind of cliff that we deal with regarding the SGR. We will have a \n$10 billion shortfall, instead of just dealing with a funding formula. \nIf we don't think we are spending enough on infrastructure and people \nwant to offer that in some way, now is the time to do it. Otherwise, if \npeople don't want to go into a deficit situation, what we ought to do \nis spend the amount of money that is coming in.\n  But it feels to me as if we are getting ready, in a very bipartisan \nway, when we get back from recess, to show the country it is ridiculous \nto think this Congress will deal with the kind of reforms to Medicare \nto make it solvent, to do the kinds of things we need to do with Social \nSecurity--both of which are more complex--because this Congress will \nnot even deal with this little program. It is a very important program, \nvery important to my State and I am sure to Vermont. But we will not \neven deal with the reforms to it, in this time of great concern about \nour fiscal situation.\n  Again, I strongly support infrastructure funding. But I think what we \nwill show the country, if we pass a bill like this, in a strong \nbipartisan way, is that there is very little hope Congress will ever \ndeal with the more complex issues that challenge this country and which \ncause many seniors in our country to be concerned, which cause \ntaxpayers to be very concerned, and certainly cause future generations \nto wonder whether this body is ever going to deal with the issues they \nknow will haunt them down the road.\n  I came down to speak on this. I have done it daily in the lunch \nmeetings we have with our own side. I just hope that sometime over the \nrecess period, prior to coming to the floor, the Finance Committee will \ncome up with a different package that actually either pays for this \nbill by offering funding formulas--which, by the way, is just math, it \nis not very difficult--or where we spend the amount of money that is \nactually coming in.\n\n  I will say that if we spent just the base moneys that are coming in, \nStates such as Vermont and Tennessee and other places have the ability, \nif they choose, to generate gasoline taxes in their own States and do \nthings with road money. Candidly, the way this program works, I think \nmost people know that citizens send up $1 and they get back 98 cents. \nSo it actually could be a more efficient way for this to work than \nsending it up to us and letting us get our hands on part of the money \nand figuring out what we are going to do with it.\n  I do believe this is one of the most irresponsible things we can do, \nespecially when there may have been some criticisms over the \nPresident's budget. I haven't heard a lot of people speak on it because \nI don't think it has been taken up as a document that we will debate on \nthis floor in a real way. But it is difficult to criticize the \nPresident's budget. I know the vote on last year's budget was 97 to 0 \nagainst it. But it is very difficult for people on either side of the \naisle to criticize the President's budget if, in fact, there is a large \nbipartisan desire to pass a highway bill that does exactly the same \nthing.\n  I hope the Finance Committee will meet again and come up with a \nsolution to this. It is not urgent. We have a recess period that is \ncoming up. Surely, this Congress, this Senate, can show the ability to \ndeal with an issue such as this, which, again, is so simple, and \ndemonstrate to the American people, in a bipartisan way, that we have \nthe ability to begin looking at these programs that are so important to \npeople across our country in a way that doesn't take us down the fiscal \ntube.\n  I thank the Chair for listening. I know it is tough when there is not \nmuch happening down here.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Elizabeth Peratrovich Day\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great civil \nrights leader in Alaska and to join all Alaskans in celebrating \nElizabeth Peratrovich Day.\n  Almost 25 years ago, the Alaska State legislature designated today as \nElizabeth Peratrovich Day to commemorate the signing of the Alaska \nAnti-Discrimination Act of 1945, and to honor Ms. Peratrovich.\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich is a Tlingit Alaska Native who fought for equal \nrights for all Alaskans long before her now famous address to the \nAlaska legislature. She was grand president of the Alaska Native \nSisterhood and fought against the very public discrimination taking \nplace against the first people of Alaska.\n  In many places in southeast Alaska just 60 years ago, public signs \nread: No Dogs, No Natives or Filipinos. Others simply said: No Natives \nAllowed.\n  There were separate drinking fountains and separate doors in public \nbuildings. As Tlingits, the Peratrovichs could only purchase property \nin Native neighborhoods, could only be seated in segregated portions of \nthe theater, and could only send their children to missionary schools--\nnot the public schools for which they paid a school tax. In the face of \nthis discrimination, Ms. Peratrovich demonstrated courage in her \nconvictions--a courage which changed the course of civil rights \ntreatment for Alaska Natives.\n  In 1941, Elizabeth and her husband Roy wrote a joint letter to \nTerritorial Governor Ernest Gruening about their concerns. In part, \nthey wrote:\n\n       My attention has been called to a business establishment . \n     . . which has a sign on the door which reads, ``No Natives \n     Allowed.'' In view of the present emergency when unity is \n     being stressed, don't you think that it is very un-American?\n       We have always contended that we are entitled to every \n     benefit that is accorded our so-called White Brothers. We pay \n     the required taxes, taxes in some instances that we feel are \n     unjust, such as the School tax. Our Native people pay the \n     school tax each year to educate the White Children, yet they \n     try to exclude our children from these schools. Although \n     antidiscrimination legislation had been floating around \n     the territorial legislature for years, it had not gained \n     any traction.\n\n  Again, I want you to put your mind in this time. This was the 1940s. \nMany legislators believed Alaskan Natives were second-class citizens. \nDespite the fact they paid taxes and bore arms in defense of this \nNation, they were not endowed with the same rights as others.\n  In 1945, however, hope emerged. Antidiscrimination legislation had \npassed the Alaska statehouse but was stalled in the State senate. One \nsenator made a speech stating that Natives had only recently emerged \nfrom savagery and were not fit for society. He argued that they had not \nhad the experience of 5,000 years of civilization.\n  With great courage and composure and poise, Elizabeth Peratrovich \nconfronted the senator who had just belittled her and her people. Not \nonly was she a Native addressing the mostly White Alaskan audience, she \nwas also the first woman ever to address the Alaska State senate. In a \nquiet, steady, but bold voice, Elizabeth Peratrovich opened her \ntestimony with the following words:\n\n       I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of \n     savagery, would have to remind the gentlemen with 5,000 years \n     of recorded civilization behind them, of our Bill of Rights.\n\n  She then recounted her experiences with discrimination--how she and \nher husband had not been allowed to lease a house in a White \nneighborhood; how she was prohibited from enrolling her children in the \nsame schools as everyone else, the schools for which she paid a school \ntax. She talked about the embarrassment her children felt when they \nwere not allowed to sit with their friends in the theater.\n  Following Elizabeth Peratrovich's speech, the senate exploded in \napplause. Her plea had been effective. The opposition that had been so \nabsolute shrank to a mere whisper.\n  On February 8, 1945--again, I underline the date, thinking of our \nnational history--on February 8, 1945, a bill to end discrimination in \nAlaska passed the senate by a vote of 11 to 5. Elizabeth Peratrovich \nhad been instrumental in making Alaska the first organized government \nunder the U.S. flag to condemn discrimination.\n  Today in Alaska we celebrate Elizabeth Peratrovich Day and affirm our \nbeliefs in equality. With each passing year we move closer to truly \nrealizing the quote that all men are created equal and all are endowed \nwith certain unalienable rights.\n  Thank you for allowing me to embrace the memory of one woman who \nfought for those fundamental principles, Alaskan Elizabeth Peratrovich.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Ben Lujan\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I come to the floor, along with my \ncolleague Senator Udall, to honor Ben Lujan, who is the longtime \nspeaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives. After tirelessly \nrepresenting District 46 in our State legislature for 37 years--the \nlast 12 years of that 37 years as speaker of the house--Ben is \nretiring. He is doing so to pursue his fight against lung cancer. I am \ncertain he will bring the same strength and tenacity and courage to \nthat battle that he has brought to every other endeavor he has taken on \nthroughout his life.\n  Throughout his long career, he has fought fiercely to ensure that the \nneeds of his fellow New Mexicans were being addressed. He has worked \nhard to improve the quality of New Mexico's school system. He has \nfought for the rights of our workers, and he has worked hard at \nstrengthening our economy.\n  I know I speak for all of his colleagues in our State legislature \nwhen I say that his service and strength throughout his recent personal \ndifficulties have been an inspiration to all, and his fighting spirit \nwill be missed once he leaves our legislature. His exemplary work ethic \nis something to which we should all aspire.\n  He was born into a family of nine children, the son of a sheepherder \nin the small town of Nambe in northern New Mexico. In 1957 he began \nworking as an ironworker at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It was from \nthese experiences that he learned the importance of always striving to \ndo better, to do more, not only for his family but for his community \nand for his beloved State. In 1970 he began his extraordinary public \nservice when he was elected to Santa Fe's County Commission. He aspired \nto have a wider impact, and he ran for the New Mexico House of \nRepresentatives in 1975. After nearly a quarter of a century in the \nhouse, he was elected by his colleagues as the speaker of the house in \n2001.\n  His devotion is a characteristic that is reflected in all aspects of \nhis life, public and private. He and his wife Carmen have been married \nfor 52 years. His children--Shirley, Jackie, Jerome, and Ben Ray--are a \ntestament to the values with which they were raised. In fact, we are \nfortunate to have his son Ben Ray as a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives representing the Third District of New Mexico. Tom and \nI have had the good fortune to serve with Ben Ray in the New Mexico \ndelegation, and he represents our State extremely well.\n  All of us whose lives have been enriched by Ben Lujan's work in \nbettering our State owe him a debt of gratitude for his service. His \nillness has not hindered his dedication and hard work for our State, as \nhe continued running the house of representatives in our State \nthroughout the current session of our legislature, which is expected to \nend today.\n  I am joined with all New Mexicans and Senator Udall in extending my \ngratitude to the speaker for his extraordinary work for the people of \nNew Mexico. We are, indeed, fortunate to have had a man of his \ncharacter serving our State in such an exemplary way and in such an \nimportant position for so many years.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I also rise today to join \nNew Mexico's senior Senator, who has served New Mexico so well. It is a \nreal honor to join Senator Bingaman in paying tribute to one of our \ngreat New Mexico citizens, Speaker Ben Lujan. Ben, as Senator Bingaman \nsaid, is retiring this month. He is an esteemed colleague of ours, and \nhe is also our friend--a good friend at that. Indeed, Ben Lujan is a \nfriend to all New Mexicans. Ben recently said:\n\n       Let us make our time on Earth . . . worthwhile, and do what \n     is right, and make a difference for the children, our working \n     families, and our elderly.\n\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n\n  He has lived up to that challenge throughout his career, fighting for \neducation, for workers, for middle-class families, for Native \nAmericans, for health care, and for jobs. In a world that grows ever \nmore cynical, Ben Lujan has always been the real deal.\n  Ben was born in 1935 in the small community of Nambe, NM, one of nine \nchildren. His family, like so many, struggled through the Great \nDepression. He used to relate tales of his father as a sheepherder \nherding sheep from the Valley Grande to the Chama in New Mexico. Ben \nstill lives on the property that has been in his family for three \ngenerations.\n  Ben is that rare combination--humble but tenacious in what he \nbelieves. He has never forgotten from where he came, and he has always \nbeen a champion for the less fortunate among us. Even in his youth, Ben \nshowed a remarkable talent for teamwork, for playing by the rules, for \njust plain hard work, and for determination.\n  He loves basketball. In high school he was the captain of his high \nschool varsity basketball squad, and the gymnasium where the Pojoaque \nElks play today is named in his honor. Ben Lujan has been leading teams \never since.\n  He attended the College of Santa Fe but had to disenroll for lack of \nmoney. For the next couple of years, he sought work wherever he could \nfind it in California and in New Mexico, wherever he had to go to get a \njob. He understands hard times. He knows what it is like to try to make \nends meet. And in all of his years of public service, a sense of \njustice and fair play has always been at his core.\n  Ben worked as an iron man in Los Alamos. He joined the International \nAssociation of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Iron \nWorkers. In 1959 Ben married his high school sweetheart, the love of \nhis life, Carmen, his devoted partner for over half a century. They \nbegan a family that would grow to include four children: Shirley, \nJackie, Jerome, and Congressman Ben Ray Lujan. As Jeff said, we are \nfortunate to have Ben Ray serving in our delegation, and we have worked \nwith him on many occasions on a daily basis. Ben began his \nextraordinary career in public service when he was elected to the Santa \nFe County Commission in 1970. Four years later he was elected to the \nNew Mexico House of Representatives. After a quarter of a century of \nservice in that body, he was elected speaker of the New Mexico House of \nRepresentatives.\n  He has always called attention to the needs of others and not to \nhimself. Ben is an inspiration not just to those who aspire to a life \nof public service but also to a life of personal integrity. His word is \nhis bond to his family and to the people of New Mexico. His principles \nhave illuminated his life and brightened the lives of all who know him. \nI count myself among that number. I am proud to call Ben Lujan my \nfriend.\n  I was present at the opening of the New Mexico State Legislature last \nmonth when Ben informed us of his illness--an illness that left him \nweakened but not defeated. Like everyone in that room, I was deeply \nsaddened at the news of Ben's illness, but that sorrow is tempered by \nadmiration--admiration for Ben, for Carmen, for the entire Lujan family \nand for the incredible strength they have shown. He would not allow a \nterrible illness to distract from his duties as speaker of the house. \nHe remains steadfast in his services to the people of New Mexico. Even \nwhile undergoing chemotherapy, he continued to work as speaker. Even a \ndevastating illness could not deter Ben Lujan from the job he had \ncommitted to do, and his family supported him every step of the way. \nThat is honor, that is integrity, and that is courage.\n\n  None of us will ever forget Ben's brave words the day last month when \nhe said, ``While this has taken a toll on me physically, it has not \nbroken my spirit, my will, my faith and my commitment to New Mexico.''\n  So to Ben, I want to say thank you. Thank you for your service, thank \nyou for your sacrifice, and thank you for your friendship.\n  As we celebrate this great son of New Mexico, I will close with these \nlines from the poet, Lord Alfred Tennyson:\n\n       Though much is taken, much abides, and though we are not \n     now that strength which in the old days moved earth and \n     heaven, that which we are, we are--one equal temper of heroic \n     hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will to \n     strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\n  That, my friends, is Ben Lujan--to serve, to strive, and not to \nyield.\n  It is a real honor to be on the floor with Senator Bingaman to talk \nabout our good friend Ben Lujan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                          Sergeant Adam J. Ray\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have the sad and solemn task today \nto speak of one brave and honorable Kentuckian who was lost in the \nperformance of his duties while wearing his country's uniform. SGT Adam \nJ. Ray of Louisville, KY, was killed on February 9, 2010, in \nAfghanistan when an improvised explosive device set by the enemy \ndetonated near his patrol. He was 23 years old.\n  For his heroic service, Sergeant Ray received many medals, awards, \nand decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Army Service \nRibbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat \nInfantryman Badge, the Weapons Qualification Badge, and the Overseas \nService Bar.\n  Sergeant Ray knew the risks of Army service and faced them squarely \nwithout flinching. In fact, a reporter imbedded with Sergeant Ray's \nunit has written of how his patrol's assignment on the day he was \nkilled was to find and deactivate explosives hidden by the enemy in \nculverts under the main road heading west from Kandahar connecting to \nmajor cities such as Kabul.\n  ``People ask me if I regret letting Adam join,'' says his mother, \nDonna Ray.\n\n       Well, I don't. Adam died doing what he loved more than \n     anything else in the world. No, Adam did not go into this \n     wanting to die for his country, but he was more than willing \n     to do it. I am so very honored to be his mother and to tell \n     everyone about him.\n\n  Adam Ray was born March 9, 1986, to Jim and Donna Ray. When Adam was \nin the third grade, he went on a school field trip to a military \nmuseum. From that moment on, he wanted to be a soldier.\n  ``He would play army with his little toy solders in the bath tub,'' \nremembers Donna.\n\n       He lined them up around the edge of the tub and prepared \n     for the attack of his dinosaurs. At night, when I tucked him \n     in his bed, I would have to pry the toy soldiers out of his \n     clenched fist.\n\n  Adam's father Jim attended West Point, and Adam wanted to follow in \nhis footsteps and also go there. However, after the terrorist attacks \nof 9/11, Adam felt an urgency to serve his country that could not wait, \nso he entered military service in April of 2005 and graduated basic \ncombat training at Fort Benning, GA.\n  Adam then attended advanced individual training at Fort Sam Houston, \nTX, where he was trained as a patient administrative specialist. His \nfirst deployment was to Camp Casey, Korea. After 1 year in Korea, Adam \nreenlisted and was transferred to an infantry unit. By the time he was \ndeployed to Afghanistan, he was assigned to C Company, 4th Battalion, \n23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division based out of Joint Base \nLewis-McChord, WA.\n  In early 2009, Adam was deployed to Afghanistan. He visited his \nfamily while on leave in September of that year and returned to \nAfghanistan in October. By Christmas, his family was hearing less from \nhim because he was preparing for a dangerous mission.\n  ``The Friday before he was killed, he called about 2 a.m. our time--\nhe always forgot about the time difference,'' Donna remembers. ``He \ntold me that his unit was moving and that I may not hear from him for a \nwhile, and not to worry.''\n  A few days later came the fateful Tuesday that was February 9. Adam's\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nunit was conducting ``culvert denial'' in an area where an Afghanistan \nsoldier had recently been killed by a bomb hidden in a culvert \nunderneath a road.\n  At approximately 9:30 a.m., the explosion went off, and as one \ncontemporary news report puts it, ``Adam Ray, the third of five \nchildren, beloved son of a minister and a devoted mother, a soccer \nplayer and a flirt, who tutored dyslexic kids and was known to ask less \npopular girls to dance at school events, died.''\n  We are thinking of Sergeant Ray's loved ones today as I recount his \nstory for my colleagues here in the Senate. We are thinking of his \nparents Jim and Donna Ray; his grandparents John and Doris Ray and \nBobby and Marilyn Sumner; his brothers Zachary and Seth Ray; his \nsisters Betsy and Amanda Ray; his nephew Christopher Mitchem; and many \nother beloved family members and friends.\n  I know my colleagues join me in extending the sincere and profound \ngratitude of the Senate to the family of SGT Adam J. Ray. We have set \naside this moment to recognize his service, service proudly and freely \ngiven, for the country he so loved. And we pay tribute to his supreme \nsacrifice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Payroll Tax Conference Report\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me rise today to speak about the \nconference report that it appears we will be voting on tomorrow \nregarding the issues of the payroll tax, unemployment benefits, and the \nso-called doc fix. Let me first of all acknowledge that I know that \nmany of my colleagues have worked long hours on the payroll tax deal \nthat was apparently reached late last night.\n  I have been briefed on pieces of this deal and I've also seen many of \nthe press reports that have described this deal as a new sign of \nbipartisanship. As a new Member of the Senate, I know, like the \nPresiding Officer, we believe that we do our best work here in Congress \nwhen we can have bipartisan solutions, when we can find ways to reach \ncommon ground.\n  All of those factors make it doubly difficult for me to now rise and \nsay I will be voting against the conference report when it comes before \nthis body tomorrow.\n  Now, let me acknowledge on the front end that I think there are \nworthy reasons in this recovering economy we have got right now, it \nmakes some sense to maintain some form of payroll tax holiday for a \nlimited period of time.\n  I know the Presiding Officer feels that one of the most important \nissues our country confronts right now--I would say the most important \nissue and the one that overhangs everything else we debate here--is our \ninability to come to grips with our debt and deficit.\n  I know, as we try to nurture this growing recovery, one of the ways \nwe take on that debt and deficit is by having a growing economy.\n  But I also believe it is terribly important that we show progress on \nthis issue. Our national debt now exceeds $15 trillion. Every day that \nwe fail to act, we add $4 billion to that total. None of this becomes \nself-correcting. It will not correct itself until and unless we act.\n  I, for one, believe there is no action this body could take that \nwould be more stimulative to our economy, that would be a better jobs \nprogram, that would do more to restore the trust of the business \ncommunity and the public than to show bipartisan collaboration and \ncooperation on a long-term debt and deficit deal. So let me share with \nmy colleagues the five reasons I will be voting against the conference \nreport tomorrow.\n  First and foremost, the payroll tax cut that has been proposed isn't \nbeing paid for. It will add $100 billion to the debt.\n  Second, I think the compromise that has been put together turns some \nof our traditional policies on their head. By taking this action of \nsaying tax cuts somehow don't have to be paid for, we are advancing a \npolicy I believe will come back to haunt us later this year when the \nBush tax cuts expire.\n  As a matter of fact, while I have only been a Member of this body for \n3 years, I know it has been a tradition that in moments of economic \ncrisis, the Congress will sometimes extend unemployment benefits, \nparticularly for those States that have been hardest hit. In those \nmoments of crisis, the unemployment benefits sometimes go unpaid for. \nWell, in the compromise in this conference report, we turn that policy \non its head in that there was a requirement to pay for the extension of \nunemployment benefits but no requirement to pay for the $100 billion of \nadditional debt taken on by the payroll tax cut.\n  I know in this body, as we have had debates about debt and deficits \nand economics, we have discussed the economic theories of a whole host \nof thinkers and economists--John Maynard Keynes, Frederick Von Hayek, \nMilton Friedman, Paul Krugman. I somehow feel as though this conference \nreport we will be voting on tomorrow may reflect the thinking of a more \nobscure individual, but someone I recall as a child growing up, and \nthat was Wimpy, who was a cartoon character--Popeye's hungry pal. Wimpy \nused to always say, ``I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger \ntoday.''\n  Well, it seems on this economic policy we are talking about today, of \ndeferring payment for this payroll tax policy, that Wimpy once again \nhas won out.\n  Let me cite the third reason I will be voting against the conference \nreport tomorrow. As I acknowledged at the beginning of my comments, I \nbelieve extension of the payroll tax holiday makes sense in this \nrecovery, but it just needs to be paid for. So I could have very easily \nsupported a number of the proposals put forward by my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, including a 1-percent increase of the taxes on those \nof us who make more than $1 million a year--a defined benefit for the \ndefined pay-for.\n  If we couldn't breach the gap on that, I could have looked at means-\ntesting the payroll tax holiday.\n  If we are trying to make sure these dollars get into the economy as \nquickly as possible over this coming year, then clearly a payroll tax \nholiday for folks who make less than $150,000 a year or $250,000 a year \nor $500,000 a year or $1 million or less a year--it didn't make sense \nto say that regardless of one's income. This payroll tax holiday--going \nto folks like me, who are doing pretty well--is not going to have a \nstimulative effect, I just don't think economic theory bears that out. \nSo if we had paid for this or put some restraints on it, I would have \nbeen happy to support this conference report.\n  The fourth reason I can't support the conference report is because I \nam concerned this payroll tax holiday--which goes into the Social \nSecurity trust fund, is supposed to end at the end of this year. But we \nhave no metrics placed on it. It scares me greatly that we will \napproach the end of the year and there will be some other reason it \nneeds to be extended again.\n  I believe we should have put in place a requirement that this payroll \ntax holiday would start to ratchet back if we continued to see growth \nin the economy--perhaps ratcheted back one-third if we had seen GDP \ngrowth for the next 3 months or employment growth for the next 3 \nmonths, ratcheted back another one-third, ratcheted back another one-\nthird--so we wouldn't have the cliff effect that is being proposed at \nthe end of the year, again, a cliff effect that will come at the same \ntime as the end of the Bush tax cuts, the imposition of the so-called \n$1.2 trillion sequester cuts, and the proverbial train wreck that is \nalready being talked about.\n  So while I believe this payroll tax holiday is important, the price, \nthe fact we are not paying for it, the fact we have put no restrictions \nor parameters around it and the fact that there's no guarantee it will \nactually expire because we have no metrics of how much economic \nprogress we need to have before it expires are reasons I will be voting \nno.\n  Let me raise one other concern I have about the conference report. \nThis\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\nis one more example of particularly our colleagues in the House saying \nthe first place they go for any pay-for for any project seems to be our \nFederal workers--the same Federal workers, close to 2 million strong, \nwho keep our streets safe, make sure we get those Social Security \nchecks, try to take out terrorists, drug dealers, you name it. They are \nthe same Federal workers who have had their pay frozen for the last 2 \nyears and who have had to endure the prospects of two or three \npotential shutdowns over the last year and a half. To say we are going \nto come back to the well time after time on this group I don't think is \nfair or right.\n  As someone who has looked at the Federal pay and benefits, when we \nget to that issue of a comprehensive tax reform, entitlement reform, \nbig deficit deal, all these items will need to be reviewed. But the \nnotion the first place to come back to for any pay-for is our Federal \nemployees, to me, doesn't seem fair nor does it seem right. So for \nthese five reasons, I will reluctantly be voting against the conference \nreport tomorrow. I believe it was, again, in the context of the debt \nand deficit particularly, Will Rogers who said: When you find yourself \nin a hole and you want to get out, stop digging. Well, in some small \nway, by voting no tomorrow, I hope I will send a signal that I--and I \nhope others will join me--will stop digging.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n36 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk a \nlittle bit about our economy and something that I think is very \nimportant that has been left unaddressed in this payroll tax compromise \nthat I think is a real tragedy for our country and for my State, the \nState of Colorado, and, most importantly, for people who are suffering \nthrough this incredibly difficult economy.\n  It is not well understood by people--I think maybe even in this \nChamber--that our country's gross domestic product--the economic output \nof our country--is actually higher today than it was before we went \ninto this recession. We saw it rising all the way in the 1990s and \n2000s, and then we had the worst recession since the Great Depression. \nNow we are seeing economic output that is actually at a level that is \nhigher than it was before we went into the recession.\n  Our productivity is higher today than it has been at any time in the \nhistory of the United States of America. It has become fashionable to \ntalk about what has happened or not happened since the founding of our \ncountry. Since the founding of our country, our economy has never been \nmore productive than it is today, and there are several reasons for \nthat. Competition from abroad that has become a daily occurrence--\nsomething we have to fight hard every day to stay ahead of--has driven \nproductivity. That is a good result. Technology has driven \nproductivity. That is a good result. And the recession itself drove \nproductivity straight up. As our business men and women of this country \ndid what they had to do to get through this incredibly tough economic \ntime to keep their businesses alive, to keep their doors open, to keep \na promise to the next generation of Americans, productivity went ever \nskyward. That is a good result. That is progress. And we are only going \nto become more productive over time as we face competitive threats from \naround the world.\n  But we can see what else has happened over this period of time. \nMedian family income has fallen over the last decade for the first time \nin our country's history. The middle class is earning less today in \nreal dollars than in the early 1990s. And, as the President knows, we \nare producing this economic output with 23 or 24 million people who \ntoday are unemployed or underemployed in this economy. There are no \njobs for these Americans in this economy even though our output is as \nhigh as it was before we went into this recession.\n  There are a lot of people smarter than I am who could figure out the \nanswers to this, but there are at least two big ones we have to keep in \nmind. The first one is education because the worst the unemployment \nrate ever got for people with a college degree during this recession \nwas 4.5 percent. That is the worst it got for people who had a college \ndegree, who could compete in the 21st century, even in the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  As I have said on the floor of this Chamber that has 100 seats, 100 \ndesks, if we were poor children living in the United States of America \ntoday, only 9 of these 100 seats would represent college graduates \nbecause 91 of 100 poor children in the United States in the 21st \ncentury cannot get access to a college degree. So that is job No. 1, to \nkeep a promise to the next generation of Americans.\n  I think job No. 2 needs to be driving innovation and job growth in \nthis economy, which is what has brought me to the floor today because \nwe are failing in this package, among other things, to extend the wind \nproduction tax credit which cuts right to the core of whether and how \nwe want to compete in the 21st century in this global economy.\n  For people here or elsewhere who think these jobs aren't real in the \nwind industry, I brought some pictures. I brought some pictures of a \nmanufacturing plant made in America--made in America--in this case, in \nBrighton, CO--a manufacturing plant, the towers from which wind \nturbines are going to be hung, driving electricity and jobs in the \nUnited States. So we are not talking about some fly-by-night, \nexperimental industry. This credit has triggered enormous economic \ngrowth in Colorado and across the country.\n  Congressman Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, wrote today in an op-\ned that he published that ``the production tax credit has driven as \nmuch as $20 billion in private investing.'' This isn't some Bolshevik \ntrick, some Socialist trick; it is $20 billion in private investment in \nreal American manufacturing jobs.\n  Wind power accounts for more than one-third of all new U.S. electric \ngeneration in recent years. In Colorado alone, I can tell you it has \ncreated 6,000 jobs in my State. It has moved our State toward a more \ndiversified and cleaner energy portfolio, so that Colorado today is a \nleader among the 50 States in diversifying our portfolio.\n  Let's be clear. We have oil and we have coal and we have natural gas. \nWe have abundant wind and abundant sun and entrepreneurial horsepower \nall across the Front Range. What we don't have is Washington's \ncooperation. What we don't have is the decency of people coming \ntogether and doing better than just keeping the flickering lights on in \nthis place.\n  It is because they can't get any certainty out of Washington that \ndevelopers and manufacturers are starting layoffs already in \nanticipation of the credit expiring at the end of this year. This is \nthe result of nothing other than our political dysfunction in \nWashington.\n  Vestas, which has a huge manufacturing footprint in Colorado--from \nWindsor all the way south to Pueblo--is poised to lay off 1,600 workers \nif we fail to act. Iberdrola Renewables, also doing business in \nColorado, has already laid off 50 employees for no reason other than \nour inability to get our work done. Nationally, 37,000 jobs are at \nrisk, not to mention the ones we could have created after 2012 but \nwon't if we let this credit expire.\n  I brought a couple of other pictures just to make sure people know \nthis is distributed all over the United States.\n  This is Pennsylvania and Texas.\n  I know I sound like a broken record when I say this because I have \nsaid it over and over on this floor, but we should not be confused that \nthe rest of the world is somehow waiting for us to get our act \ntogether, that they are somehow waiting for us to cure our politics and \ndo something that will actually solve those curves that I mentioned \nearlier and put Americans back to work manufacturing in jobs that are \nactually driving middle-class family\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nincome up, rather than down, which is what we are doing today.\n  Our largest single export from the United States of America is \naircraft. We export $30 billion a year. China's export of solar panels \nlast year was $15 billion--half our largest single export. They didn't \nexport one solar panel 10 years ago, and we invented the technology \nhere in the United States. In fact, some of us believe we invented that \ntechnology in the State of Colorado. I am sure the Chinese would love \nto have this business as well. And my concern is not that this is a \ntemporary interruption in our wind industry but that this will become a \npermanent shutdown of our ability to drive economic growth across the \nUnited States. This is a perfect example of an industry that can move \nthis employment level back up, an industry that we don't have today, \none that is in its infancy but 50 years from now or 20 years from now \nmay be driving significant employment growth across the United States \nof America. This is an industry that, by the way, would drive this \ncurve up as well.\n\n  I met a young man in Logan County not long ago. He was working--he \nwas giving me a tour on the top of a wind turbine. I was standing on \nthe very top of the box. It was about 10,000 feet in the air--or it \nfelt that way to me. I was wearing the shoes I am wearing right now on \nthe floor of the Senate, which is not what you should wear when you are \non the top of a wind turbine, swaying in the wind. He told me he would \nbe unable to live in his home community and raise his family in his \nhome community if it had not been for that job, a job he could not even \nhave imagined there being 5 years ago. And there it is today.\n  These are high-quality, high-paying jobs in the United States of \nAmerica. It would seem to me the Congress ought to figure out a way to \nsupport these industries. I actually do not believe any of these kinds \nof credits should be permanent. I want to be clear about that. I think \nwe would be doing ourselves and the country a service if we designed \nthem in a way that phased them out over time, because at a certain \npoint every business has to sink or swim based on its merits. We are \n``this close'' to being there with wind production and we are ``this \nclose'' to turning it over to the rest of the world.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is not a partisan issue. Last week \nRepublicans and Democrats from the Colorado delegation came together in \nthe House and the Senate to urge a quick extension as part of the \npayroll deal. I know my colleagues Senators Harkin and Grassley did the \nsame with the delegation from Iowa.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, Longworth House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Chairman Camp: The undersigned \n     Members of the Colorado delegation urgently request inclusion \n     of a provision to extend the wind energy production tax \n     credit (PTC) as your conference negotiates the payroll tax \n     reduction package. In passing this extension, we would urge \n     the conference committee to include a pay for as well.\n       The PTC has been very effective in facilitating new market \n     penetration of wind energy and moving us toward a more \n     diversified and cleaner energy portfolio. A delay in this \n     extension would do enormous damage to that progress. Since \n     its inception, the wind PTC has driven economic growth across \n     the nation, including substantial growth in Colorado. Our \n     state is a wind energy leader, currently generating the third \n     highest percentage of power from wind of any state in the \n     nation. Colorado is home to several major wind energy \n     developers and wind turbine manufacturing facilities, \n     employing upwards of 6,000 workers statewide. We're also home \n     to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a \n     critical government lab and the world's premier renewable \n     energy research facility.\n       Unless the wind PTC is renewed in the first quarter of this \n     year, new wind energy development projects and the thousands \n     of jobs associated with those projects are predicted to drop \n     off precipitously after 2012. This dire situation will be \n     especially pronounced in Colorado, where we manufacture many \n     of the components for wind turbines. Wind-related \n     manufacturing workers will be the first to lose their jobs as \n     developers stop ordering turbines for installation after the \n     PTC ends. Companies with a footprint in Colorado have already \n     started layoffs and several thousand Colorado jobs could be \n     lost if the PTC isn't extended in the near future.\n       While the PTC is vital to the near-term future of wind \n     energy production in Colorado and across the nation, the \n     credit should not exist in perpetuity, particularly as the \n     wind industry matures. Following a prompt extension, we \n     believe that Congress should engage in a broader conversation \n     about an incremental phase-down of the credit over the long-\n     term.\n       In a difficult economy, with thousands of high-quality jobs \n     at stake across our state and the entire country, we urge the \n     Conference Committee to extend the wind PTC as part of your \n     upcoming package.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael F. Bennet.\n     Mark Udall.\n     Diana DeGette.\n     Ed Perlmutter.\n     Jared Polis.\n     Cory Gardner.\n     Scott R. Tipton.\n     Mike Coffman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Speaker John Boehner,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. David Camp,\n     Chairman, Conference Committee on H.R. 3630, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Co-Chairman, Conference Committee on H.R. 3630, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, Speaker Boehner, \n     Representative Pelosi, Representative Camp, Senator Baucus, \n     and Members of the Conference Committee on H.R. 3630: The \n     undersigned Members of the Iowa delegation respectfully urge \n     you to include a short term Production Tax Credit (PTC) \n     extension for wind energy as part of any payroll tax cut \n     extension you are currently negotiating.\n       Our state and the whole nation have benefited tremendously \n     from the economic development, new manufacturing jobs, and \n     increased domestic energy supply that wind energy has \n     provided. And the PIC has been a major factor behind this \n     success. Iowa is now receiving 20% of our electricity from \n     wind at stable and dependable rates. There are over 215 wind \n     related businesses operating in 55 counties across our state, \n     employing over 5000 people. While Iowa has been a leader, we \n     are seeing these results multiplying across the country.\n       However, with the PTC for wind due to expire at the end of \n     2012, the expansion, jobs and manufacturing of the industry \n     is put in serious jeopardy--not just in Iowa, but across the \n     country. We must provide some certainty to allow this \n     industry to keep growing. If the PTC is not extended \n     immediately, our communities back home stand to lose \n     thousands of jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure and private \n     investment. The manufacturing workers, in particular, are the \n     first to lose their jobs as developers have already stopped \n     ordering turbines for installation after 2012 because of \n     uncertainty about the continuation of the credit.\n       Clearly, no energy incentive should be in place forever, \n     but now is not the time to pull the rug out from under the \n     wind energy industry, as it is putting in place the domestic \n     manufacturing, the private investment and the technological \n     advancements that will allow it to prosper without the PTC in \n     the near future. We appreciate your consideration of our \n     request to include language in the upcoming payroll tax cut \n     legislation to immediately extend the wind energy PTC.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Tom Harkin.\n     Senator Charles Grassley.\n     Representative Bruce Braley.\n     Representative Tom Latham.\n     Representative Dave Loebsack.\n     Representative Leonard Boswell.\n     Representative Steve King.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. As I recall, Senator Grassley actually was the one who \nwrote this to begin with. We have also recently filed an amendment, a \nbipartisan, fully paid for, 1-year extension of the credit to the \nsurface transportation\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\nbill. I thank Senator Moran, a Republican from Kansas, for joining me \nto lead on that amendment.\n  There is plenty of support out there for us to get this done. More \nimportant than that, if we do not act, there are thousands of people \nwho are going to have to go home to their families and say they were \nlaid off from their job for no reason other than the political \ndysfunction here in Washington, DC.\n  I think enough is enough. I cannot tell you how much I look forward \nto a time when we have a thoughtful, bipartisan, fact-based tax reform \nin this country; when we are thinking about our Tax Code and our \nregulatory code and asking ourselves: Are we driving job growth here in \nthe United States with these policies? Are we driving up middle-class \nfamily income with these policies? Are we addressing the income \ninequality gap by having an economy that truly does lift all ships and, \nas the President would make the point, are we dealing with the fiscal \nchallenges this country faces so we do not strap our kids with this \nmountain of debt?\n  I know there are people on both sides of the aisle who are anxious to \nwork on this, but we have failed that test in this compromise measure. \nIt is my hope that at some point in the near future we can get a vote \non this amendment, Senator Moran's amendment, and we can put Americans \nback to work in these industries before we lose them forever.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \nreimbursement issue that impacts the lives of millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries and providers. The sustainable growth rate, SGR, \noriginally implemented in 1997 through the Balanced Budget Act, was \nintended to constrain overall Medicare spending growth in physician \nservices. However, since 2002, actual expenditures for physician \nservices have exceeded allowed targets, yielding negative updates in \nprospective years. As a result, Congress intervened 13 times to preempt \na physician payment cut. In doing so, they failed to address the \nunderlying issue and sustained a flawed reimbursement mechanism. With \neach year that passes, the cost of `fixing' the SGR grows, amounting to \nan albatross of several hundred billion dollars. Consequently, on March \n1, 2012, Medicare physicians will face a 27.4 percent cut to their \nreimbursement. Our budget baseline perpetuates an illusory premise that \nthese cuts will occur. However, it's widely acknowledged that if \nimplemented, these cuts would have a debilitative effect on medical \npractices and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As Congress looks to yet again preempt a physician payment cut, I \nbelieve it is imperative that we identify a viable pathway to replacing \nthe SGR. We can begin by utilizing Overseas Contingency Operations, \nOCO, funding to pay for the $195 billion in accrued SGR retrospective \ndebt. OCO funds, deemed to be budgetary savings from the drawdown of \nmilitary engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan, can be appropriately \nreallocated against accrued SGR debt that will not be collected. This \nwould not constitute new spending, but rather amount to a down payment \non an SGR fix. I urge conferees to give strong consideration to \nutilizing OCO funding to offset SGR's retrospective debt. It's time \nthat Congress use honest budgeting and provide Pennsylvania's 2.2 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries and 155,776 employees of medical \npractices, with some certainty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, are we in morning business or do I have to \nask consent to speak as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the bill.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Recess Appointments\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I came to the floor previously to speak \nabout President Obama's unconstitutional appointments of Richard \nCordray as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and of \nthree new members to the National Labor Relations Board. I spoke about \nwhy this blatant overstep of executive authority violates the \nPresident's right to make recess appointments under article II, section \n2 of the Constitution. I described its unequivocal reversal of years of \nprecedent which the Obama Justice Department's Office of Legal Council \nhas since defended, essentially stating that pro forma sessions no \nlonger matter.\n  This issue is far from over. We cannot allow it simply to go away and \nthe illegal appointments must eventually be set aside.\n  The 23-page Justice Department opinion, written by Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Virginia A. Seitz, wrongly advises that, despite the convening \nof pro forma sessions, the President ``has discretion to conclude that \nthe Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function \nand to exercise his power to make recess appointments.'' Under this \nmisguided opinion, the Obama administration is suggesting that the \nexecutive branch--not Congress--can determine when the legislative \nbranch is in session. The egregious overreach undermines the checks and \nbalances at the very heart of our Constitution.\n  I am deeply concerned that this presumptuous action by the President \nposes profound and dangerous implications. As others have suggested, \nPresident Obama's abuse of his recess appointment power could lead to \nunilateral ``recess'' appointments anytime, such as during lunch or in \nthe middle of the night. This is not that far fetched.\n  As I said before, it is my hope that both parties will rise to defend \nthe separated powers our Founders put in place to prevent tyranny and \nthe misuse of authority.\n  It is worth repeating that the controversy surrounding the \nPresident's non-recess appointments has nothing to do with the personal \ncharacter of Mr. Cordray or of those named to the National Labor \nRelations Board. Nor is the debate over appointments when the Senate is \nin recess. What the President has done transcends party issues and \nideological divides.\n  A day after the appointments were made, former attorney general Edwin \nMeese III and former Office of Legal Counsel lawyer Todd Gaziano wrote \nin the Washington Post that President Obama's move is ``a \nconstitutional abuse of a high order.'' It challenges 225 years of \nexecutive practice.\n  The Constitution is very clear in its delegation of powers. It \nexplicitly grants the Senate the exclusive responsibility to give \n``advice and consent'' on treaties and nominations. It endows the \nPresident with the right to fill vacancies when the Senate is not in \nsession--a provision conceived by the Framers as a way to keep the \ngovernment operational when the ability of Senators to communicate with \nthe executive branch and travel back to the Capitol took much longer \nthan today.\n  Of course, it is disappointing that President Obama has dismissed the \nwill of the Senate, which rejected Mr. Cordray's nomination in \nDecember.\n  But never before has a President assumed the authority to issue \nrecess appointments when the Senate is not in recess. In doing so, the \nPresident is violating the Constitution plain and simple, and \ninvalidating the legitimacy of his appointees. It stands to reason that \nany decisions of the CFPB or NLRB will be subject to the same shroud of \nunconstitutionality and legal contest.\n  The Constitution and nearly a century of legal opinion provide a \nsolid basis for determining the parameters of what qualifies as a \nlegislative ``recess,'' which is required for the President to invoke \nhis appointment privileges.\n  Under Article section 5, clause 4 of the Constitution, the House of \nRepresentatives must grant its consent in order for the Senate to \nadjourn longer than 3 days. The Senate must do the same for the House.\n  It is an undisputed fact that the House of Representatives did not \ngive this chamber that consent and, in keeping with the Constitution, \nthis Senate did not adjourn for more than 3 days.\n  The President's claim that a brief adjournment can be called a \n``recess'' goes against 90 years of legal opinion. In 1921, President \nHarding's Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty had this to say about \nwhat defines a recess: ``[N]o one, I venture to say, would for a moment \ncontend that the Senate is not in session when an adjournment [of two \ndays] is taken. Nor do I think an adjournment for 5 or even 10 days can \nbe\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nsaid to constitute the recess intended by the Constitution.''\n  Since then, Attorneys General and Presidents of both parties have \nagreed that at least 10 days should pass before a recess is \nacknowledged.\n  And yet, as we are aware, there were not 10 days of adjournment when \nPresident Obama made his four appointments. We were holding pro forma \nsessions--proceeding just as the Senate did in 2007, when Majority \nLeader Reid wanted to block President Bush from making recess \nappointments--and succeeded in doing so. As Edwin Meese and Todd \nGaziano acknowledged in their op-ed, ``Reid was right, whether or not \nhis tactics were justified.''\n  Michael McConnell, a former Federal judge and director of the \nConstitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, came to the same \nconclusion. Last month, he wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Several years ago--under the leadership of Harry Reid and \n     with the vote of then-Sen. Obama--the Senate adopted a \n     practice of holding pro forma sessions every three days \n     during its holidays with the expressed purpose of preventing \n     President George W. Bush from making recess appointments \n     during intrasession adjournments. This administration must \n     think the rules made to hamstring President Bush do not apply \n     to President Obama. But an essential bedrock of any \n     functioning democratic republic is that the same rules apply \n     regardless of who holds office.\n\n  It is appalling that the Obama administration would call into \nquestion the entire legitimacy of pro forma sessions when, less than \ntwo weeks before the appointments, the President signed into law the \npayroll tax extension that the Senate had passed in such a session.\n  What makes the business conducted during the pro forma session on \nDec. 23 any different from the pro forma sessions that came just days \nafter? Based on this case, it appears the validity of a Senate session \nis subject to the President's whim. He signs legislation passed in one \npro forma session. He concludes that another pro forma session did not \nexist at all.\n  In the same op-ed to the Washington Post, Edwin Meese and Todd \nGaziano concluded:\n\n       If Congress does not resist, the injury is not just to its \n     branch but ultimately to the people. [And that is what is \n     important.] James Madison made clear that the separation of \n     powers was not to protect government officials' power for \n     their sake but as a vital check on behalf of individual \n     liberty.\n\n  Indeed, the forefathers of this country were candid about the crucial \nlink between the separation of powers and freedom itself.\n  As Madison wrote in essay No. 48 of The Federalist:\n\n       It is agreed on all sides, that the powers properly \n     belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly \n     and completely administered by either of the other \n     departments. It is equally evident, that none of them ought \n     to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence \n     over the others, in the administration of their respective \n     powers. It will not be denied, that power is of an \n     encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually \n     restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.\n\n  As elected public servants, we are bound by our oath of office to \nuphold and preserve the principles of the Constitution.\n  To do that, we must guard the sanctity of the decisions made and \nprivileges held by this chamber. Our government's separation of powers \nis not an antiquated idea but a timeless safeguard to liberty.\n  In 1985, Sen. Byrd, the Democratic Majority Leader from West \nVirginia, wrote in a letter to President Reagan:\n\n       Recess appointments should be limited to circumstances when \n     the Senate, by reason of a protracted recess, is incapable of \n     confirming a vitally needed public officer. Any other \n     interpretation of the Recess Appointments clause could be \n     seen as a deliberate effort to circumvent the Constitutional \n     responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent to such \n     appointments.\n\n  Where are the Robert Byrds today?\n  Those who served before us provided precedent and wisdom to address \nour problems today. They defended the constitutional duties we are now \nentrusted to protect. Is there not one Democratic Senator who will step \nforward to defend the constitutional principle of separation of powers?\n  The President has made no secret of his contempt for Congress in \nrecent months. His campaign rhetoric is heavy with ``do-nothing'' \naccusations.\n  The President is certainly free to engage in election-year hyperbole. \nBut he is not free to overstep the constitutional limits of his \noffice. I can think of a number of other priorities demanding our \nundivided attention right now--fixing the economy and putting Americans \nback to work are top among them. Yet in order to address these \nchallenges, we need a working relationship between the legislative and \nexecutive branches. The President's power grab undermines the very \nconstitutional foundation of this relationship.\n\n  I urge Members from both sides of the aisle to call for President \nObama to rescind these appointments. Regardless of our party \nallegiances, we are united by a pledge to serve the American people. \nThat is what motivated Robert Byrd earlier, and it is what ought to \nmotivate us today. Keeping that promise means standing for the sanctity \nof our country's founding document and the integrity of this \ninstitution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take the time now to talk about \nthe conference report that has been filed in regard to the extension of \nthe payroll tax holiday, the Medicare physician issues so our seniors \ncan continue to have access to their doctors, and the extension of the \nunemployment insurance.\n  I was appointed to that conference, and the conference has been \nmeeting now for the better part of the last 6 to 8 weeks. We were able \nto reach an agreement that was filed. I first wish to compliment \nSenator Baucus, the Senate chair of the conference committee. There was \na real effort made that this conference would operate the way a \nconference should operate; that is, the House and Senate Members \nmeeting, discussing the differences between the two bodies and trying \nto reconcile their differences in a somewhat open process. We had \nseveral open discussions where we talked about some of the issues.\n  Each Member of the conference had a chance to express themselves on \nthe issues, and we had a good exchange. I think during that exchange we \nwere able to reach some consensus. Almost immediately we reached a \nconsensus that all of us wanted to make sure the payroll tax holiday \nwas extended. The payroll tax holiday provides tax relief for 160 \nmillion Americans. This is not the time for paychecks to actually go \ndown for American workers. We are trying to build a confidence in the \nworkplace, in the marketplace. The more money in the paychecks allows \npeople the opportunity to be better consumers, helping to create jobs.\n  There was general consensus that we needed to extend the unemployment \ninsurance, that we are still in the recovery where unemployment rates \nare so high that it is important we use this countercyclical program to \nhelp people but to also build our economy. It helps create jobs, again \nhaving more money available for the consumers to help our small \nbusinesses and to help our economy.\n  Lastly, we all understood we could not allow a 27-percent cut in \nMedicare rates for physicians, that that would deny many of our seniors \naccess to health care. So very early in the conference process we \nreached consensus that those three issues should be extended, at least \nthrough the end of this calendar year. For the payroll tax holiday, \nthat was our understanding, to extend it through the end of the year.\n  We know the Medicare issues need to be extended for a longer period \nof time. We worked together. I thought it was very important that we \nallow the full Senate, the full House to consider that conference \nreport. We have had too much gridlock. We have had too much of \nindividual Members trying to block the consideration of important \nlegislation, particularly in the Senate. So I think it is very \nimportant that we were able to bring this issue to the full Senate, and \nwe are going to have, I hope, a good debate, and sometime tomorrow we \nare going to have a chance to vote\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\non whether to accept the conference report.\n  There is some good news. I do applaud again Senator Baucus and my \ncolleagues Senator Casey and Senator Reed on the work that was done by \nthe Democrats on the committee. We took a very strong position against \nadding these extraneous positions that came over from the House, the \nso-called Boiler MACT, which was a provision that would have affected \nthe health of people in our community. There is no question that if we \nwould have accepted the House position, it would have weakened our \nClean Air Act, it would have led to more premature deaths, more \nhospital admissions, more lost days from work. The cost-benefit ratio \nof this rule is well documented, that it will help our economy, help \nsave the health and workdays for American workers.\n  We also removed a provision from the House bill that dealt with the \nKeystone issue. This has to go through a regular regulatory process. It \nshould have no place in this conference. We were able to remove that \nprovision.\n  On the unemployment insurance front, let me mention that we were able \nto reserve the extension of unemployment insurance benefits. Under the \ncurrent law, there is a maximum available of 99 weeks. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that because of the way the extended benefit program is \ncalculated, that at least in my State by April, those 20 weeks are \nlikely to be not available for new people who become unemployed, and \nthroughout the rest of our Nation, we are finding that extended benefit \nprogram will not be providing those extra weeks.\n  So the conference committee recommendation is to try to use better \ntriggers as it relates to the different tiers of benefits in the \nextended benefit program, so the high unemployment States have a \ngreater number of weeks than those States that are doing better and to \ntransition us to a more regular unemployment system as we go through \nthe year.\n  In regard to the Medicare provisions in this bill, we were able not \nonly to extend the sustainable growth rate, the SGR system, so we do \nnot get the automatic cuts that would occur against physicians, we were \nable to extend that through the end of the year. But we also extended \nthe therapy caps. If we did not do that, those who are the victims of \nstroke or who have had a hip replacement would have run into an \narbitrary cap which would provide them the therapy they need for their \nrecovery. We were able to get that done.\n  On the payroll tax, as I said earlier, there was an agreement we \nwould extend that. The payroll tax is all about helping 160 million \nAmericans. It is about creating jobs.\n  That is where we were able to come to an agreement that I think was \nin the best interest of the conference. Let me talk about some serious \nproblems I have with the conference report. It deals with how we \ndecided to fund or offset the cost of unemployment insurance \nextensions. Let me remind my colleagues that this is a short-term \nextension, where we are phasing out the extra benefits through the end \nof this year. It is calculated to cost about $30 billion. Historically, \nwe have extended unemployment insurance benefits during tough economic \ntimes without having offsets.\n  Why? Because unemployment insurance is countercyclical. It is there \nto help people during tough times. During good times we pay money into \nthe system. We are trying to put more money into the economy. It does \nnot make sense to take money out of the economy when we are trying to \ncreate jobs and get our economy back on track.\n  Unfortunately, that principle was violated in this conference report. \nThe $30 billion is offset. Let me compare that to the payroll tax \nholiday, which is $100 billion, which many of us think should be \noffset, which is not offset. As you know, we came in with \nrecommendations where we could fairly offset the extension of the \npayroll tax holiday without adversely affecting our economy. We had \nsuggested we would have a surtax on income, exempting $1 million of \ntaxable income from the surtax--a little bit of fairness in our Tax \nCode--in order to make sure we do not add to the deficit, do not hurt \nthe economy but allow middle-income taxpayers to continue to get their \ntax relief.\n  To me, that would have been the responsible thing for us to do. But \nwe do not do that in this conference. Instead, we did not pay for the \n$100 billion for extending the payroll tax, but we paid for the \nunemployment insurance benefits, $30 billion, which I would suggest is \nan emergency. That truly is a matter that historically we have not paid \nfor.\n  All right. Here is the problem. In order to pay for that $30 billion, \nwe picked on our Federal workforce. I tell you, I find that wrong. We \nput a provision in this bill that will require new Federal employees, \nthose who start work after January of 2013, to pay more for their \ndefined retirement benefit. That is how we funded about half the cost \nof extending the unemployment insurance. I think that is wrong.\n\n  Let me also say that the extension of the unemployment benefits is \ntemporary--only until the end of this year. The extra costs for the \nretirement benefits are permanent. It stays in the law. That doesn't \nseem like a good deal for what we are trying to do.\n  We also are saying that one group of workers, and only one group, \nmakes a contribution toward this. These are middle-income workers who \nwill be paying for this, a large part of the unemployment insurance \ncost. I don't think that is right. I don't think we should have done \nthat.\n  Let me also point out, as we talk about the Federal workforce, that \nthe additional cost the new workers will pay will be 2.3 percent of \ntheir payroll, which will go to a retirement trust fund that is already \nfully funded. So this is not to address a problem with the funding of \nthe retirement plans for our Federal employees; I think this is \nstrictly a punitive hit at the Federal workforce.\n  Public servants have already given $60 billion toward deficit \nreduction in the form of a 2-year pay freeze and will give at least \nanother $30 billion if the base pay adjustment for 2013 is .5 percent \ninstead of the 1.2 percent, which is what the adjustment should be \nunder the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. Add it all together, \nand present and future Federal workers are providing over $100 billion \nin deficit reduction. That is $100 billion in deficit reduction coming \nout of our Federal workforce. Yet the Republicans continue to defend \nthe most affluent Americans who won't pay one extra penny for funding \nthis payroll tax package. I don't think that is right, I don't think \nthat is fair, and I don't think we should have done it in that manner.\n  Now, I want to say some positive things. You can always look at \nthings and say it could have been a lot worse. And that is true, it \ncould have been a lot worse. When you look at the House bill that \nincluded these provisions, it included a pay freeze for our Federal \nworkers. That is not in this. We got that out.\n  I worked very hard with my colleague, Congressman Chris Van Hollen \nfrom Maryland. We worked together. In the original package, all Federal \nworkers would have had to pay more, including current Federal workers. \nThis package does not affect current Federal workers. They will not \nhave to pay extra for their pension plans. That is fair. When they \nsigned up as a Federal employee, they knew what the ground rules were \nand they knew what the pension contributions would have to be and what \nthe benefits were. It is right that we live up to that commitment. So \nthis agreement will not affect current workers. Their pension \ncontributions will remain the same.\n  The bill that came over to us from the House also reduced pension \nbenefits. We took that out of the bill. That is not in the bill. And \nthe rate they would have had new hires pay is higher than what we \nagreed to in this package.\n  Congressman Van Hollen and I worked very hard to try to accommodate \nthe parameters of the conference and what was being required of our \nFederal workforce in a way that it would not penalize our existing \nworkers and would not be anywhere near as punitive as the provisions \nthat were put in the House bill. So we are at least grateful that the \nconference includes that, but I can't help but be disappointed that the \nunemployment insurance is being financed at least in half by a \npermanent change in the contribution rates to defined benefit plans\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nby those who join the Federal workforce after January 1, 2013. They are \nthe only ones who are affected by that proposal.\n  Let me conclude by saying that we all should be pleased that the \nconference worked, that we took a difficult issue in which there are \nstrong fundamental differences between the House and the Senate and we \nwere able to come to an agreement to at least be presented to the \nMembers of the House and Senate for an up-or-down vote where each of us \ncan make our own judgment as to whether we think this is the right \npackage for the American people. I might have a different view than the \nPresiding Officer, and we will both be able to express our views by our \nvotes tomorrow.\n  I hope that process will be used to get more work done for the \nAmerican people. They want us to work together. They want Democrats and \nRepublicans to say: OK, we know we differ on issues. Now let's get \ntogether and get things done.\n  We have the Transportation bill that is on the floor and that we are \ntalking about today. That Transportation bill should end up on the \nPresident's desk. That Transportation bill came out of our committees \nwith bipartisan votes. So now let's not clutter that bill with issues \nthat will divide us. Let's work in the spirit the conference committee \ndid--a committee on which I was privileged to serve--and try to keep it \nrelevant to the issues at hand so that at the end of the day we can not \nonly pass the Transportation bill in the Senate, but we can get it \npassed in the House of Representatives--or work out our differences--\nand get it to the President for his signature. That bill will create \njobs.\n  By the way, I think the American people will applaud us for moving \nforward with the people's business. That is what we need to do. If we \ncould get that bill done, maybe--just maybe--we can get other issues \ndone.\n  I have talked to my Republican colleagues, and they all agree we \ncan't allow sequestration to take place. That is these automatic cuts, \nif we can't do another $1.2 trillion of deficit reduction over the 10 \nyears. We should be able to get that done. We shouldn't have to wait \nuntil after the November elections. Let's take a lesson from the \nconference committee on which I served. Let's sit down and work out our \ndifferences and not just say ``it has to be my way or it is not going \nto get done.'' That is what is in the best interests of the Senate, and \nthat is in the best interests of our Nation.\n  I hope we will have a robust debate on the conference report. I hope \neach Member will have an opportunity to review it, and at the end of \nthe day we will have a chance to see how the votes turn out. Again, I \nam sorry I have certain reservations about it, and I needed to express \nthem, but, quite frankly, I think we need to stand for our Federal \nworkforce out there every day providing services to our people. Whether \nit is guarding our borders, whether it is finding the answers to the \nmost dread diseases, whether it is helping us develop the technology \nthat will make America competitive, or providing public safety as a \ncorrectional officer or helping us make sure we get our Social Security \nchecks or get our disability checks, these are the people on the front \nlines. We are asking them to do more with less, and they deserve not \njust the respect of this body but they deserve our support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 37 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and would also ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, my colleague in this effort to fund transportation projects, \nSenator Hoeven, follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we all understand that our country faces an \narray of major economic challenges, and I made the judgment quite some \ntime ago that it was simply impossible to have big league economic \nwealth with little league transportation systems. All across the \ncountry--I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has seen this in \nMinnesota, where he has been doing good work on infrastructure and \nbridges--we have seen this in every corner.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota came to the Senate, I had the good \nfortune to begin to have discussions with him with respect to some new \nways to address the question of how to generate funds for the critical \ntransportation work that needs to be done and to generate those funds \nin a fashion that would be acceptable to the American people.\n  I think we all understand that with this kind of an economy and with \nskyrocketing gasoline prices, it is not very likely that folks will be \nmarching outside our Senate offices anytime soon carrying signs saying: \nSenator, please raise the gas tax; that is what I hope you will spend \nyour time doing. So we have this challenge given the fact that the \ntraditional system of funding transportation--user fees--of course, in \na tough economy, is going to be hard to suggest as a route to generate \nadditional funds.\n  So for quite some time I have been devoted to the cause of trying to \nfind a way to secure the possibility of getting additional funds \nthrough transportation bonds. They, of course, have been used at a \nvariety of levels of government, particularly State and local, over the \nyears.\n  About 8 years ago, I put forward the first proposal for looking at \npaying for transportation projects with our former colleague, Senator \nJim Talent, a Republican from Missouri, and we called them Build \nAmerica Bonds. Senator Talent and I thought at that time that this was \nan opportunity to come up with a fresh and attractive way to pay for \ntransportation projects. We sought to work with the private sector to \nfind some way to use Federal tax credit bonding for these projects, and \nover the years Senator Talent and I were able to attract a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle for this cause. To give an idea of \njust how bipartisan this effort has been over the years, Senator Thune, \nSenator Vitter, our former colleague Senator Dole, Senator Collins, \nSenator Wicker, and our former colleague Senator Coleman are just a few \non the Republican side who were part of the effort. And on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Klobuchar, our former colleague Senator \nDayton, Senator Cardin, and Senator Rockefeller have been just a few of \nthose who have supported the bonding efforts.\n  In 2009 the Congress decided to test a version of Build America \nBonds. In effect, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I had \nbrought it up so many times with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, \nwho was then the ranking member, I think the two of them said: Well, \nlet's give this a try as part of the Recovery Act. In effect, it would \nessentially go from the middle of 2009 until the end of 2010.\n  Late in the evening, as Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley were \nworking to put together the details on the Recovery Act, I was asked \nwhat I thought might be the results of the Build America Bonds program, \nand I said: Well, it is not going to last all that long. It is going to \ntake the Internal Revenue Service a period of time to put together the \nrules. And I said: I am just making this up, but why don't we just \nestimate that it might generate $6 billion to $10 billion worth of \ntransportation and infrastructure investments.\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\n  Everybody said: It is an experimental program, sounds promising, go \nahead. Let's give it a try.\n  Well, between April 2009 and the end of the program at the end of \n2010, there was more than $181 billion worth of Build America Bonds \nissued. It was just a little bit more than 18 times what was predicted.\n  You don't often have this kind of challenge, but, in effect, one of \nthe issues we had to deal with was Build America Bonds became so \npopular that there was an effort to use them for a variety of other \nkinds of projects, many of them very laudable but they were not \nprojects that focused specifically on transportation, and, of course, \nthat was the original intent of Build America Bonds. Also, there was no \ncap on them. Nobody realized they would be so popular.\n  So there was a concern that this was more than colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle had bargained for.\n  We do want to note that the Treasury Department issued their final \nreport on Build America Bonds earlier this year, and they said that \nBuild America Bonds issuers saved well over $20 billion in borrowing \ncosts on a present value basis as compared to tax-exempt bonds.\n  So clearly there was something to work with in terms of trying to \ntake the next step, and when the Senator from North Dakota arrived \nhere, I said: It would be great to have an opportunity to work with a \npartner and look specifically at trying to rebuild the concept of \nfocusing specifically on transportation in a way that would generate a \nsubstantial amount of new revenue and would be acceptable to colleagues \nacross the political spectrum and those who follow these issues.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota knows, we have now come up with a \nnew approach called Transportation and Regional Infrastructure Project \nBonds. Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch have been good enough to \ninclude them in the finance title of this year's Transportation Funding \nProgram, and we wanted to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about \nhow this would work.\n  Given the fact that we have been able to attract a number of folks on \nthe progressive side of the political spectrum--folks in labor, for \nexample--Doug Holtz-Eakin has issued a very helpful paper that I hope \nwill also bring conservatives to this cause. We have shared that paper \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  The way the TRIP bonds would work is, first, they are tax credit \nbonds created specifically for transportation projects. We would allow \ninfrastructure banks that already exist in nearly every State to issue \nthese bonds. This time we are looking to really focus on the States. \nThe States are the primary vehicle for ensuring that these projects \nwould have local support and would really meet the long-term needs the \nStates have identified.\n  We would pay for the bonds with a sinking fund comprised of State \nmatching contributions and Customs user fees. In the proposal that was \naccepted by the Finance Committee, we would cap the total amount of \nbonds issued at $50 billion, giving each State 2 percent of the total. \nIn effect, what the Finance Committee has done is put a placeholder in \ntheir bill for us to go forward with this effort.\n  Each State would get at least $1 billion in bonds to issue on \nprojects at their discretion. States can also band together to bond for \nlarger projects or ones that would have the benefit of addressing a \nconcern of States in a region. This would give the States the incentive \nand the ability to invest in their own transportation and does so in a \nway that leverages private investment and costs little to our \ngovernment in lost revenue.\n  We would give private investors who show a willingness to help build \nour roads, bridges, and rail systems a tax credit for their commitment. \nWhat Build America Bonds taught us is that there is a real market out \nthere, and what we would like to do is look at a different approach \nnow, focusing on the States, focusing on an approach that would drive \nthese projects, not in Washington, DC but at the local level.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has told us this is an approach that \nwould produce a particularly good deal for American taxpayers.\n  We can get a transportation bill done. We can put folks back to work. \nBut we are going to have to find a way to come up with more creative \napproaches to generate additional revenue. If we do not, I think we are \ngoing to continue to see, in every corner of the country, critically \nneeded projects simply go unaddressed. We are going to continue to see \ntraffic jams in areas of the country nobody could have even dreamt a \ntraffic jam would be.\n  I hope Senators, as we go forward with this debate, particularly \nafter the President's Day break, will join my colleagues. Senator \nBegich has been very supportive of this approach as well. We think this \nis an approach with a proven track record given what we saw with Build \nAmerica Bonds. We believe this is a chance to take the lessons we \nlearned from that experience and, by changing the focus so it zeros in \nmore directly, one, on transportation, two, on the States, and looks to \nsome creative features--it is possible, for example, for someone to \nstrip the credit from the underlying bond and to sell the credit--so \nthis provides a lot more flexibility in terms of finding a way to get \nthe private sector into the transportation area.\n  I hope my colleagues, when we come back, will be supportive of this \neffort. It has won, as I have indicated, support from across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  I want to thank my partner from the State of North Dakota. I have \nvery much enjoyed working with him both on the Energy Committee and on \nthis issue. As a former Governor, I think he understands particularly \nwell the role of the States in terms of infrastructure.\n  We will be talking to colleagues between now and the time the \nTransportation bill comes up, and I thank my friend from North Dakota \nfor his support.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed colleague from the \ngreat State of Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this \nimportant issue, for his work on the highway bill, and specifically for \nhis work on the TRIP bonds, as he said, the Transportation and Regional \nInfrastructure Project bonds. It is a creative concept, and I think it \nis very timely.\n  Senator Wyden approached me and said: As we are working on this \nhighway bill, can we work together on this concept of something like a \nTRIP bond concept? I expressed my appreciation for his creativity and \nthe offer to work together and said, one, I absolutely wanted to do it \nbecause it is so important to our country right now--we need the jobs, \nwe need the economic activity, we need the infrastructure, that is \nclear--and, as the good Senator said, we have to be creative in \nfiguring out how to do this.\n  I said: We are going to have to do it within the framework of making \nsure it is paid for and making sure it does not add to the deficit or \nthe debt. He said: Agreed. And we went to work on it.\n  So this truly is bipartisan, and I thank him for taking the \ninitiative and for all the work both and he his staff have put into \nwhat I think is a very creative idea and a real opportunity for us, as \nI say, in infrastructure and in job creation and economic activity for \nour country.\n  I also extend my thanks to two Members of the House of \nRepresentatives as well, both Ed Whitfield, Congressman from Kentucky, \nRepublican, and Congressman Leonard Boswell, Democrat from the State of \nIowa.\n  So in both the Senate and the House this has been a bipartisan \neffort. That is important because at the end of the day, if we are \ngoing to get this passed, that is what it is going to take, bipartisan \nsupport. So this is about addressing something that is vitally \nimportant: our infrastructure needs, job creation. It is something we \npay for, so it does not increase the deficit or the debt, and it is \nabsolutely bipartisan.\n  Again, as my esteemed colleague just mentioned, I bring a perspective \nas a Governor. We are talking about $25 billion in addition to the \nnormal highway funding. So this is for projects in infrastructure that \nState departments of transportation and Governors--people at the State \nlevel, at the local level--decide what infrastructure projects need to \nbe done, and they can then use\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nthese funds accordingly. That is of tremendous value to them. Without \nexception, go across the States, ask any of the Governors or directors \nof transportation, and they will tell you: That is exactly the kind of \nfunding we want and need to do the very best job for the people we \nserve in our respective States.\n  Mr. President, $25 billion--$10 billion the first year, $15 billion \nin year 2--will make an incredible difference for every single State in \nthe country.\n  Now, the other thing to keep in mind is--Senator Wyden went through \nfor just a minute how we have structured the bonds--essentially, it \nresults in a 4-to-1 leveraging of funds for every State. They put their \ndollars into the sinking fund. They select the projects. Then, on a \nproject-by-project basis, they put forward dollars in the sinking fund, \nand we provide them a 4-to-1 match.\n  So, for example, $\\1/2\\ billion goes to a State. As they select \nprojects, that $\\1/2\\ billion funds those projects. They put up $100 \nmillion as they select and advance those projects. For their $100 \nmillion, they are doing $500 million in projects.\n  Again, this is exactly what the States are looking for. This is \nexactly what they need to meet their infrastructure needs. Anyone \ndriving around the country--whether it is in the District or anywhere \nelse--is going to tell you: Look, we have to address our infrastructure \nneeds. And this is absolutely something that will make a big difference \nin doing that.\n  Again, in addition to being truly a bipartisan effort, and a \nbicameral effort, at this point we have received tremendous support and \nencouragement from across the country and from truly a diverse range of \ngroups--from labor, from business, from mayors, from county \ncommissioners. It truly has not only bipartisan support but incredibly \nstrong support across the country.\n\n  Just some of the various groups that have come out and already \nendorsed the project include the American Association of Road and \nTransportation Builders, the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American \nHighway Users Alliance, the Associated General Contractors of America, \nthe International Union of Operating Engineers, the Labors' \nInternational Union of North America, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n  Again, mayors, commissioners--this truly has broad, strong support at \nthe grassroots level. That is reflective of the fact that it is exactly \nthe kind of project we need to advance.\n  So as we work on this highway bill, I see this as a tremendous \nopportunity--really an opportunity, and not just in terms of the \ninfrastructure we so badly need but to put people to work in good jobs, \nin good-paying jobs. Think of the ramifications that has, the secondary \nramifications that has for our economy right now. It is incredibly \nimportant. It makes a huge difference, and then we have the lasting \ninfrastructure, we are meeting the lasting infrastructure needs of this \ncountry.\n  Before I yield the floor, just a final comment and that is to ask our \ncolleagues to join us in this effort. If they have good ideas, we are \nabsolutely open to those ideas. But this is a concept whose time has \ncome. We need to make sure, as we work forward on this highway bill, we \ninclude the TRIP bonds as part of that package.\n  With that, I yield the floor back to my esteemed colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for just \n2 additional minutes. I see our friend from Iowa is in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nhis statement. This is bipartisan. It is a bicameral effort. My \ncolleague's point at the end, in terms of our being open to additional \nideas and suggestions, is particularly appropriate.\n  What the challenge is going to be on this transportation issue for \nyears to come is to try to find a way to generate the additional money \nfor the work that needs to be done in a fashion that is acceptable to \nthe American people. If it was so easy, everybody would be just ripping \nthrough one idea after another.\n  The two of us have spent many months trying to take the lessons we \nhave learned from the Build America bonds effort to try to come up with \na fresh approach, a fresh bipartisan approach, that would be acceptable \nto colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We think we have done it. We \ndo not think this is the only way. We are certainly open to ideas and \nsuggestions. But the model of trying to focus on the States, to build \non the support we have from folks in business and labor unions, and a \nwhole host of groups at the local level--mayors and county \ncommissioners--strikes us as the way to go.\n  We are open to additional ideas and suggestions. Our staffs will be \nworking all through this week, the period of the President's Day \nrecess, to refine our proposal, to deal with the various issues related \nto scoring. But this is a genuinely new approach to generating revenue. \nIt is bipartisan; it is bicameral, with the support of folks in labor \nand business. We hope colleagues will be supportive, and we are \ninterested in their ideas and suggestions over this period between now \nand when we start voting on the Transportation bill.\n  So, again, I thank my friend from North Dakota. It has been great to \nwork with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the cloture vote with respect \nto the Reid amendment No. 1633; that if cloture is invoked on the Reid \namendment, the second-degree amendment be withdrawn, the Reid amendment \nbe agreed to and the bill, as amended, be considered original text for \nthe purposes of further amendment; that if cloture is not invoked, the \nmotion to recommit and the Reid amendment No. 1633 be withdrawn; that \nimmediately following the cloture vote and the actions listed above, \ndepending on the result of the cloture vote, the Senate then proceed to \nexecutive session and the cloture motion on the Furman nomination be \nvitiated; that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the chair and \nranking members of the Judiciary Committee prior to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the Furman nomination; that if the nomination is \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction; that following the vote on confirmation of the Furman \nnomination, the Senate then resume legislative session and the majority \nleader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                     Payroll Tax Conference Report\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to state my vehement \nopposition to the agreement to extend the payroll tax cut and to slash \nthe Public Health and Prevention Fund to help pay for the continuation \nof unemployment benefits.\n  Let me preface my remarks by stressing that the No. 1 priority in \nWashington today must be creating jobs, growing the economy, and \nrestoring the middle class. In recent months, we have seen modestly \ngood news on the jobs front, including the manufacturing sector, and we \nmust do everything possible to keep our economy moving in the right \ndirection.\n  To this end, nothing is more effective than continuing unemployment \ninsurance benefits for those hardest hit by the great recession. \nDetails on the unemployment insurance portion of this agreement are not \navailable. But what I am hearing sounds less and less like a good or \nfair deal for workers.\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\n  Federal unemployment benefits will be dramatically scaled back over \nthe year, especially in Iowa, my own State, and some other States in \nthe Midwest. I do not understand that. It seems to me, if you are \nunemployed, you are unemployed. If you are out of work and your family \nneeds help, I do not care whether you live in Iowa or Minnesota or New \nYork or New Jersey or anywhere else.\n  The payroll tax provisions are also seriously flawed. This Congress \nwill be making a grave mistake--a grave mistake--and reinforcing a \ndangerous precedent by extending the payroll tax cuts and adding \nanother negative, without paying for it. I am dismayed that Democrats, \nincluding a Democratic President and a Democratic Vice President, have \nproposed this and are willing to sign off on a deal that could begin \nthe unraveling of Social Security.\n  Two of the critical strengths of Social Security are that it is \nuniversal and it is self-funded. Not one dollar in benefits ever came \nfrom any source other than the payroll tax on future Social Security \nbeneficiaries. Moreover, the program has never contributed even one \ndime to the deficit or the national debt. How often have we, those who \nsupport Social Security in its entirety--how many times have we come to \nthis floor and argued against those who would invade Social Security \nand say, well, we have to reduce the deficit, so we will cut Social \nSecurity. What do we say, with all honesty, with all the evidence \nbacking us up? Social Security has never contributed one dime to the \ndeficit.\n  So cutting Social Security will never reduce the deficit. With this \nbill, we can no longer say that. We can no longer say Social Security \ndoes not contribute to the deficit. This argument, this fact, that \nSocial Security has never contributed a dime to the deficit has given \nSocial Security a unique, even an almost sacrosanct, status in our \nsociety.\n  It was one of the strongest arguments, I repeat, for those of us \ndefending Social Security from misguided attempts to cut it in the name \nof deficit reduction. Some might say, well, people are out of work; \nwith the fragile economy, we need to put some spending in the pockets \nof our middle-class Americans.\n  I could not agree more. The biggest job creator in America is not \nsomeone who is rich and has billions of dollars. The biggest job \ncreator in America is a working American with money in his or her \npocket to spend. That is the biggest job creator.\n  So, yes, we have to get money in the pockets of working Americans, \nand we have done that in the past in a good way. In the 2009 Recovery \nAct, working Americans received a 6.2-percent credit of their taxes, \nrefundable up to $400, to increase their spending power and boost the \neconomy. This in no way impacted the Social Security trust fund. I \nsupported that, wholeheartedly supported that.\n  However, in late 2010, Congress voted to replace that tax credit with \na 2-percent reduction in payroll taxes which are dedicated to the \nSocial Security trust fund. This was done on a temporary basis to \nprovide added income for working families, and it was not offset. It \nwas not paid for. So for the first time--for the first time--general \nrevenues were transferred to the Social Security trust fund to replace \nlost revenue.\n  While this ensured that no financial harm was done to the trust fund \nitself, what it did is it created a dangerous precedent by calling into \nquestion Social Security's dedicated funding. I voted against that \nbill. So in late 2010, we transferred general revenues to replace lost \nrevenue.\n  In December of 2011, just a couple months ago, we were persuaded to \nsupport the 2-month extension of the payroll tax cut. Some may look at \nthe record and say: Harkin, you voted for that. I did with misgivings. \nBut a critical factor was that it was at least fully paid for and would \nnot negatively impact the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  However, we are being offered an agreement that extends the payroll \ntax cut through the end of this calendar year. Bad enough, doubly \nnegative, it does not pay for it. This is terrible public policy, with \ngrave consequences for Social Security. With this new agreement, we \nwill be taking $100 billion from the general fund, which is in deficit, \nby the way. So we are going to add $100 billion to the deficit, to \nsubstitute for the $100 billion in revenues lost due to the payroll tax \ncut. As I said and I repeat, we will be adding $100 billion to the \ndeficit and the debt.\n  This compounds the mistake Congress made in late 2010 by passing the \noriginal payroll tax cut without paying for it. No longer--no longer--\ncan we say Social Security is a program that pays for itself without \nadding to the deficit. Mixing general revenues into the system will \nmake it easier for those who have long wished to dismantle Social \nSecurity to do so in the future.\n  Worse--worse--since this tax cut is not being paid for, there is a \nmuch greater likelihood it will be extended yet again in the future \nbecause, you see, there is another precedent here: Tax cuts do not have \nto be paid for. Only spending has to be paid for, not tax cuts.\n  Does this not open the door to even further extending payroll tax \ncuts because we do not have to pay for it? I choose my words carefully. \nMake no mistake about it, American people, make no mistake about it. \nThis is the beginning of the end of the sanctity of Social Security. \nThe very real risk is that Social Security will become just another \nprogram to be paid for with deficit spending and then in the future \nperhaps raided to help reduce the deficit.\n  I never thought I would live to see the day when a Democratic \nPresident and a Democratic Vice President would agree to put Social \nSecurity in this kind of jeopardy. Never did I ever imagine a \nDemocratic President beginning the unraveling of Social Security. I \nwarn my colleagues to consider the long-term ramifications of these \nactions.\n  While we need to maintain temporary supports for middle-class \nfamilies in these tough economic times, this assistance should not come \nat the expense of American's retirement security. As traditional \npensions have fallen by the wayside, as the value of peoples' \nretirements in 401(k)s has plummeted, Social Security remains the one \nessential program preventing millions of seniors from plunging into \npoverty in their retirement years, a program started by a Democratic \nPresident and a Democratic Congress, further enhanced by future \nDemocratic Presidents, others, Truman, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, of \ncourse, the Great Society.\n  This, I believe, has been the hallmark and the underpinning of the \nparty I have been proud to belong to. Now this party--this party--the \nDemocratic Party, with a Democratic President, is now beginning the \nunraveling of Social Security. That is what is happening, the \nunraveling of Social Security. Never again can any one of us come to \nthe floor and say: No. No, we cannot cut Social Security to reduce the \ndeficit because it does not add to the deficit.\n  With this agreement, Social Security will add to the deficit by $100 \nbillion. Think about it. I urge my colleagues to look at excellent \nalternative ways of providing temporary support to our middle class. \nOne proven approach would be to enlarge the Making Work Pay tax credit \nI talked about that was in the Recovery Act. Again, this tax credit, as \nI said, put an additional $800 in both 2009 and 2010. It could be \nenlarged to provide the similar level of benefits to median-income \nworking families as compared to the payroll tax cut.\n  So instead of cutting the payroll tax, let's do the tax credit that \nwe had in 2009 and 2010, just bump it up a little bit. How do we pay \nfor it? The same way we are paying for the cut in the Social Security \ntaxes. Put it on the deficit. Put it on the deficit. But at least we \nare not invading the Social Security trust fund. Cutting the payroll \ntax is a bad idea, a terrible idea. I am embarrassed it is being \nproposed by a Democratic President and a Democratic Vice President.\n  We could fully pay for a tax credit, a refundable tax credit, do it \nover a 10-year period of time so it does not negatively impact the \nfragile economic recovery. It would support middle-class families, give \nthem the support they need and deserve, but it would not harm Social \nSecurity.\n  I said there were a couple reasons I am opposed to this. That is one. \nThat\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nis a big one, what we are doing to the Social Security trust fund. But \nI must also state my strenuous opposition to the cuts in this agreement \nto the Public Health and Prevention Fund that is in the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  My Republican friends and colleagues have been trying to get at the \nhealth care reform bill ever since we passed it: Cut it here, nick it \nthere. We have fought that off. The health care act is now making a big \nimpact in Americans' lives. Need I mention the fact that kids are \ncovered now, even though they may have a preexisting condition. Young \npeople can stay on their parents' policy until they are age 26. But we \nput into that affordable care act a Prevention and Public Health Fund, \nwith the aim of transforming America's sick care system into a true \nhealth care system, emphasizing wellness and prevention and public \nhealth, keeping people out of the hospital in the first place.\n  So this last October things started kicking into effect. Beginning \nlast October, for example, women over age 40 could get a mammogram \nevery year with no copays, no deductibles, no cost. It has to be \nabsorbed in the insurance program. Seniors on Medicare get a free \nscreening of their health and a health assessment every year so they \nknow what to do in the future to keep themselves healthy. No copays, no \ndeductibles. Colonoscopies over age 50, no copays, no deductibles. We \nalso started investing in proven programs to promote health and \nwellness, decreasing obesity, for example, across the country, through \nthis fund.\n  Earlier this month, the Trust for America's Health released a \nremarkable study showing that a 5-percent reduction in the obesity rate \ncould yield more than $600 billion in savings on health care in the \nnext 20 years. This study is the latest confirmation of what common \nsense tells us: Prevention is the best medicine both for our bodies and \nfor our budgets.\n  Now think about it. We currently spend more than $2 trillion on \nhealth care each year. An estimated 75 percent of that is accounted for \nby preventable chronic diseases and conditions. Chronic disease is a \nprime culprit in the relentless rise in health insurance premiums, and \nit contributes to the overall poor health that places our Nation's \neconomic security and competitiveness in jeopardy.\n  This is shameful and, frankly, exasperating because we know how to \nprevent many of these diseases and conditions from developing in the \nfirst place. We know a lot about the power of prevention through the \nkinds of evidence-based clinical and community prevention programs and \nthings that are funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. For \nexample, for every $1 we spend on the full course of childhood \nvaccines, we can save $16.60 in future health care costs. Not a bad \nreturn on a dollar, not to mention the quality of the lives of kids who \ndon't get measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and a whole bunch of other \ndiseases.\n  Given the relentless rise in health care costs, it is a classic case \nof penny wise and pound foolish to take money from the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund. Americans get it. Americans get it when it comes to \ndisease prevention. They understand that prevention saves lives, saves \nmoney, and is the commonsense thing to do. In this bill--again, for the \nfirst time--$5 billion is taken out of the Prevention and Public Health \nFund--$5 billion. This is outrageous and unacceptable.\n  As I said, Americans get it. Here is a letter from the American \nCollege of Preventive Medicine urging us to oppose taking any money, to \ndiverting any money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Here is \nthe Coalition for Health Funding, opposed to taking money from the \nprevention fund. The American Heart Association is opposed taking money \nfrom the prevention fund; the Campaign to End Obesity Action Fund, \nopposed to taking money from that fund; the Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest, opposed to taking money from the prevention fund; the \nHeartland Alliance, opposed to taking money from the prevention fund; \nthe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, opposed to \ntaking money from this fund; the Prevention Institute, opposed to \ntaking money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund; the American \nHeart Association, the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS \nDirectors, the American Public City Health Officials, the American Lung \nAssociation, the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, the Association \nof Maternal & Child Health Programs, the American Association of \nColleges of Pharmacy--722 groups across this country--opposed to taking \nmoney from the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks some letters in opposition to this taking. \nThere are over 700 organizations in opposition to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. So who do we listen to, Mr. President? Do we listen to \npublic health officials--the American Heart Association, the American \nLung Association, people all across America saying don't do this?\n  This is what is going to save us in the future. Yet they are taking \n$5 billion out of it. It is totally unacceptable and it is outrageous--\noutrageous--outrageous. And again, this wasn't in either the House or \nthe Senate bill. If I'm not mistaken, maybe a point of order lies \nagainst things in a conference report that were not considered either \nin the House or the Senate.\n  This agreement is being presented as a done deal, nothing we can do \nabout it. Well, I urge Senators to think about the dangerous \nconsequences and precedence of passing this bill in its current form. \nThis bill ends Social Security's historic status as a program that pays \nfor itself. Think about it. The bill validates the absurd idea that tax \ncuts have a special status--they do not need to be offset, but spending \ndoes. Think about it. And this bill foolishly slashes funding for the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund, cuts that will significantly add to \nthe deficit in future years.\n  I repeat: We need to continue to bolster the economy and boost the \nincome of ordinary Americans. This bill is not the way to do it. It is \na devil's deal. It is a bad deal. There are better ways to accomplish \nthese goals. I urge my colleagues to vote against this terribly \nmisguided bill in its current form.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                          Preventive Medicine,\n\n                                                 February 9, 2012.\n       On behalf of the American College of Preventive Medicine \n     (ACPM), I urge you to oppose any effort to divert funds from \n     the Prevention and Public Health Fund to finance an extended \n     ``doc fix'' in the Medicare physician fee schedule as part of \n     the negotiations on H.R. 3630, the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut \n     Continuation Act of 2011. ACPM is the national professional \n     society for over 2,500 physicians who dedicate their careers \n     to prevention and health promotion at the individual and \n     population levels. As such, ACPM has a primary interest in \n     expanding our nation's investment in prevention to improve \n     the health of communities across the country while adding \n     greater value to our health care system.\n       While ACPM has been a staunch supporter of efforts to fix \n     the broken sustainable growth rate formula used to calculate \n     Medicare physician reimbursement levels, the College will not \n     support any proposal that diverts funds away from disease \n     prevention programs in order to increase payments for disease \n     treatment. The Prevention and Public Health Fund, established \n     through the Affordable Care Act, represents a critical \n     investment in public health and a historic commitment towards \n     efforts that will help shift the focus of our health care \n     system from disease treatment to disease prevention and \n     health promotion.\n       Already, states are using Prevention Fund dollars to \n     bolster our public health infrastructure and to build a \n     stronger foundation for prevention in communities and \n     neighborhoods that are most in need. To drain the fund of its \n     important resources just when communities are now putting \n     prevention to work represents a shortsighted approach to fund \n     increased reimbursements for Medicare providers.\n       There has long been strong bipartisan support for efforts \n     that improve health, reduce costs, and enhance the value of \n     our health care system. Now is not the time to abandon these \n     goals. ACPM will continue to strongly oppose any efforts to \n     decrease the federal commitment to prevention and public \n     health and we ask that you join us in these efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Miriam A.

The Coalition's 75 national organizations--\n     representing more than 100 million patients and families, \n     health care providers, public health professionals, and \n     scientists--feels strongly that it is penny-wise and pound \n     foolish to cut public health and prevention funding. We urge \n     you to oppose these proposed cuts to the Fund, and instead \n     consider the return on investment the Fund will show in the \n     long-term by keeping people healthy.\n       Prevention and public health are vital to securing \n     America's position as a global leader in prosperity, \n     discovery, and military capability. The Prevention and Public \n     Health Fund, established through the Affordable Care Act, \n     represents a critical investment and an unprecedented \n     commitment to improving America's health.\n       Already, states and communities are using the Fund to \n     combat chronic diseases, which account for 70 percent of all \n     deaths and 75 percent of all Medicare spending. Specifically, \n     the Fund is bringing communities together to reverse the \n     obesity epidemic. A new analysis by Trust for America's \n     Health shows that reducing the average body mass index by \n     just five percent could lead to nearly $30 billion in health \n     care savings in just five years.\n       Evidence abounds--from the Department of Defense to the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce--that healthy Americans are stronger \n     on the battlefield, have higher academic achievement, and are \n     more productive in school and on the job. Healthy Americans \n     drive our economic engine, and cost our nation less in health \n     care spending. It is shortsighted to drain the Fund just as \n     communities are now putting prevention to work. We need to \n     improve health, reign in health care spending, and reduce our \n     nation's deficit and debt. The Fund will help us achieve \n     these goals.\n       There has long been strong bipartisan support for efforts \n     that improve health, reduce costs, and enhance the value of \n     our health care system. Now is not the time to abandon these \n     goals by ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.'' The Coalition \n     strongly opposes any efforts to reduce the federal commitment \n     to prevention and public health. We hope you will join us in \n     our opposition.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judy Sherman,\n       President.\n     Emily J. Holubowich,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2012.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: The American Heart Association (AHA), \n     on behalf of its more than 22 million volunteers and \n     supporters, urges you to protect the Prevention and Public \n     Health Fund (Fund) and oppose any efforts to reduce, \n     eliminate, or divert its funding as you consider options for \n     paying for an extension of the payroll tax reduction, for \n     unemployment insurance benefits, and for Medicare payments to \n     physicians.\n       The programs supported by the Fund are essential if we are \n     to reduce the growth of chronic diseases, such as heart \n     disease and obesity, and decrease tobacco use rates, which \n     are primary drivers of rising health care costs. \n     Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart disease and \n     stroke, is the leading cause of death and disability in the \n     United States and our nation's costliest illness. Based on \n     recent projections, prevalence and costs of CVD will increase \n     dramatically in the next two decades, leaving 40 percent of \n     the population with some form of the disease.\n       We know that prevention works and is one of the best ways \n     to avert this cardiovascular crisis. In a 2008 study, the AHA \n     used a model to evaluate the impact of 11 widely recognized \n     measures for cardiovascular prevention. We found that if all \n     11 measures were addressed, heart attacks would be reduced by \n     36 percent and strokes by 20 percent. These measures could \n     add 200 million life-years over the next three decades and \n     increase life expectancy by 1.3 years.\n       However, only 18 percent of U.S. adults follow three \n     important measures recommended by the AHA for optimal health: \n     not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, and \n     exercising at moderate-vigorous intensity for at least 30 \n     minutes, five days per week. Programs supported by the Fund \n     can help Americans adopt healthier lifestyles and we know \n     that the earlier in life they develop these habits, the \n     better. Studies estimate that when people practice these \n     healthy habits reach middle age, they have only a six to \n     eight percent chance of developing CVD in their lifetimes.\n       Investing in prevention is a smart move during these \n     fiscally challenging times to maintain both a healthy economy \n     and a healthy society. We urge you to protect the Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Nancy A. Brown,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   President's Budget Presents Dangerous, Costly Setback to Obesity \n                        Epidemic, Campaign Warns\n\n       Washington, DC.--In the face of staggering costs--both in \n     lives and in billions of taxpayer dollars spent because of \n     the nation's obesity epidemic--the President's budget cuts \n     vital obesity prevention programs by $4 billion over the next \n     ten years, the Campaign to End Obesity Action Fund warned \n     today.\n       The President's budget recommends drastic reductions to \n     programs that the White House championed a little more than \n     18 months ago designed to promote prevention and wellness \n     through ``an unprecedented funding commitment to these \n     areas.'' At that time, the President specifically proposed \n     ``the creation of a national prevention and health promotion \n     strategy that incorporates the most effective and achievable \n     methods to improve the health status of Americans and reduce \n     the incidence of preventable illness and disability in the \n     United States.''\n       These programs were largely contained in the Affordable \n     Care Act, which established the Prevention and Public Health \n     Fund in significant part to reverse the obesity epidemic and \n     help the nation secure a healthier future. The Fund--the \n     whose budget the President now proposes to cut by more than \n     20 percent over the next 10 years--enables work by state and \n     local governmental agencies and community organizations to \n     increase healthy food options in schools, create physical \n     activity programs and promote incentives for workplace \n     wellness.\n       In a statement, Stephanie Silverman, cofounder of the \n     Campaign to End Obesity Action Fund, said:\n       ``The President must know that there is little good news \n     about obesity--the epidemic continues, and with it the long \n     term costs to our nation increase. The First Lady has done \n     exemplary work highlighting some of the successes of \n     prevention efforts, but obesity remains one of the country's \n     costliest medical conditions. We respectfully urge the \n     President to reconsider his recommendation, which would \n     undermine vital obesity prevention and reversal initiatives \n     already in place around the country.''\n       ``The initiatives supported by the Prevention Fund can help \n     our communities to get on track to a healthy weight and \n     achieve more manageable long-term health care costs. Standing \n     pat will not get us there. If we are serious about reigning \n     in health care costs, we must have strategies to change our \n     nation's current course. No easy fixes exist to balancing our \n     budget, but failing to put all of our muscle behind tackling \n     the obesity epidemic will only lead to greater illness for \n     patients and greater expenses for taxpayers in the long run. \n     Reducing the Prevention and Public Health Fund is \n     economically backwards.''\n       Ultimately, slashing obesity prevention programs will not \n     help the U.S. to reduce its deficit, particularly in light of \n     a recent study from the Trust for America's Health, which \n     finds that if obesity rates were reduced by five percent in \n     the U.S. the country could save $29.8 billion in five years, \n     $158.1 billion in 10 years and $611.7 billion in 20 years in \n     health care costs.\n       Currently, the annual health costs related to obesity in \n     the U.S. are as high as $168 billion and obesity drives \n     nearly 17 percent of U.S. medical costs, according to \n     research released by the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research. By 2018--just six years from now, researchers at \n     Emory University estimate that obesity could account for 21 \n     percent of all health care spending. Employers alone \n     experience a more than $73 billion loss each year due to \n     losses in productivity, absenteeism and medical costs \n     attributed to obesity, according to researchers at Duke \n     University.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Center for Science\n\n\n                                       in the Public Interest,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Senator Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus: On behalf of the Center for Science \n     in the Public Interest, I urge you to support the Prevention \n     and Public Health Fund and oppose any efforts to reduce, \n     eliminate, or divert its funding. At a time when today's \n     children are in danger of becoming the first generation in \n     American history to live shorter, less healthy lives than \n     their parents, we need to do more--not less--to reduce the \n     burden of heart disease, cancer, and other preventable \n     diseases.\n       The Prevention Fund, supported by nearly 720 organizations, \n     is a much-needed investment in national, state, and local \n     efforts to prevent disease, save lives, and reduce long-term \n     health costs. Due to the growing burden of chronic disease, \n     our country faces exploding health-care costs that diminish \n     our economic productivity and limit businesses' ability to \n     compete in a global economy. Right now, 75 percent of all \n     health care costs are spent on the treatment of chronic \n     diseases, many of which could be prevented.\n       States are also using Prevention Fund dollars to mount \n     campaigns to reduce obesity and tobacco use, promote healthy \n     eating and physical activity, expand mental health services, \n     provide flu and other immunizations, and fight infectious \n     diseases. If we are serious about reducing health care costs \n     and the deficit, decreasing funding for prevention would be \n     counterproductive. With your support, we can ensure that \n     vital programs aimed at preventing illness and promoting \n     health and wellness continue through the next decade. Please \n     let me know what you\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\n     will do to protect this important health funding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Margo G. Wootan,\n     Director of Nutrition Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, State of Illinois, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Your support is needed to maintain \n     funding for critical preventive health work made possible by \n     the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Recent proposals to \n     reduce, eliminate or divert its funding ignore the long-term \n     fiscal and health benefits of investing in prevention.\n       We urge you to oppose any reduction in funding to the \n     Prevention Fund. The fund is an unprecedented investment in \n     national, state and local efforts to prevent disease, save \n     lives and reduce long-term health costs. More than 700 \n     national, state and local organizations support the \n     Prevention Fund.\n       Last year, Illinois received almost $21 million to invest \n     in effective and proven prevention efforts. That money is \n     going to communities making changes to improve long-term \n     health, the state's public health infrastructure and training \n     centers, HIV prevention efforts, tobacco prevention, and \n     primary care and behavioral health services.\n       Overall, the Prevention Fund will provide communities \n     across the U.S. with more than $16 billion over the next 10 \n     years. Slashing this funding would be an enormous step \n     backward in our progress on cost containment, public health \n     modernization and wellness promotion.\n       By and large, our health care system is based on treating \n     illness rather than preventing it: Billions of dollars are \n     spent each year through Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal \n     health care programs to pay for health care services once \n     patients get sick. Before the Prevention Fund, there was no \n     corresponding, reliable investment in efforts to promote \n     wellness, prevent disease, and protect against public health \n     or bioterrorism emergencies.\n       Prevention is the key to lowering health care costs and \n     creating a long-term path to a healthier and economically \n     sound America. I urge you to continue our investment in the \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Joseph A.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I have submitted an amendment to \nthe pending surface transportation reauthorization bill.\n  Community colleges are a critical source of education and job \ntraining for many individuals. Nationwide, we have 1,655 community \ncolleges, which enroll nearly 6 million students. These community \ncolleges will play a big role in helping Americans develop the skills \nto be competitive in our 21st century economy.\n  In light of the President's call for job training assistance, it is \nimperative that we support programs that help workers meet the new \ndemands of our economy. My amendment does just that.\n  This amendment ensures that transit agencies that partner with \ncommunity colleges on job training programs are eligible for Federal \ngrants.\n  By supporting collaborative job-training programs between community \ncolleges and transit agencies, we support our workforce in gaining \nvaluable technical skills, while also supporting industries that are \nfacing a workforce shortage.\n  I will urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to ensure that \nwe are supporting our workers in getting a valuable education and \nsupporting an industry that is facing a critical workforce shortage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S842-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of the \n26th Public Printer of the United States. Bill Boarman led the \nGovernment Printing Office, GPO, with distinction over the past year. \nHe has been a tremendous asset to the organization, and we will miss \nhis service.\n  President Obama nominated Bill to serve as the Public Printer in \nApril 2010, and his nomination was reported favorably by the Senate \nRules Committee in July of that year. Because the Senate was unable to \nconfirm Bill in the 111th Congress, President Obama used a recess \nappointment to install Bill as the Public Printer in December 2010.\n  Once in office Bill found that the GPO faced serious financial \nproblems. Bill immediately took steps to put GPO on solid financial \nfooting by cutting spending overhead and other nonessential costs. He \nsuccessfully implemented a buyout to adjust the size of GPO's \nworkforce. Perhaps most important, Bill set up a special task force to \ncollect millions in outstanding payments owed to the GPO by other \nFederal agencies. These actions saved the GPO and the taxpayers \nmillions of dollars.\n  Bill did more than just cut costs. To help Congress reduce its use of \nprinted documents, Bill ordered the first-ever survey of all Senate and \nHouse offices that allowed them to opt out of receiving printed copies \nof the Congressional Record and other publications. He put the GPO on \nFacebook, oversaw the release of the GPO's first mobile Web app, and \ndrafted a strategic investment plan to modernize the GPO's technology. \nHe also presided over the observance of the GPO's 150th anniversary and \nmade history himself by appointing as his deputy a seasoned GPO \nofficial who is the first woman ever to hold that position.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate did not confirm Bill before the 112th \nCongress adjourned, and Bill's recess appointment expired. He leaves \nthe agency in sound condition and in the good hands of Acting Public \nPrinter Davita Vance-Cooks. During his brief tenure, Bill compiled a \nremarkable record of accomplishments. I know I speak for the Senate \nfamily when we thank Bill for his service as our Nation's Public \nPrinter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S842-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S842-S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING MIDWAY COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \neducational institution that has been determined to create job \nopportunities and more easily accessible pathways to attaining \nprofessional degrees for Kentuckians, Midway College.\n  Midway College is a private school in Midway, KY, located in between \nLexington and Frankfort. The school, established in 1847, has since \ncreated not only a rich tradition but a bright future for itself as \nwell. Grounded in the golden rule, the school's motto is ``ama vicinum \nacte,'' Latin for ``love your neighbor in deed.'' And Midway College \nand its faculty are dedicated to living just so. The college has opened \n14 different branches across the State offering numerous disciplines \nstudents can choose to study and thereby diversifying the type of \nstudent who could potentially enroll by constructing schools in an \narray of unique locations.\n  In 2009, Midway College president Dr. William B. Drake, Jr., along \nwith attorney G. Chad Perry III, and his wife Judy Perry, had a vision \nto create a 15th branch of the college in a small Kentucky town. This \nnew branch would be expected to not only strengthen the Commonwealth \nbut the entire Nation as well. Their dream soon became a reality in \nJanuary of 2010 when Midway College's board of trustees announced plans \nto open the Midway College School of Pharmacy in Paintsville, KY.\n  The small community of Paintsville is located in Johnson County, and, \naccording to President Drake, they could not have asked for a more \nperfect location for the school. The town's citizens, who strongly care \nabout education, got involved early with the project and stepped \nforward to ensure that Paintsville would be the right home for the \nschool. The new institute of learning will not only offer over 100 jobs \nto an area that is suffering from high unemployment rates but will \ngenerate around $30 million in revenue each year.\n  The climate of our Nation is rapidly changing. As baby boomers age \nand are now in more medical need than ever before, Midway College is \nbreaking new grounds in its attempt to combat the problem. Only four \nStates have greater need of pharmacists than Kentucky, a State which \ncurrently has only two pharmaceutical schools. Midway seeks to provide \nan opportunity to students in the Appalachian regions of eastern \nKentucky, in hopes that they will take their professional degree and \nreturn to\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\ntheir hometowns across the Commonwealth and make a difference for those \nin need.\n  Eighty percent of Kentuckians are still without a college degree. The \nfight to educate citizens of Kentucky wages on, and with the help of \nforward-thinking institutions like Midway College, the future looks \nbrighter than ever before. So today I would like to ask my colleagues \nin the U.S. Senate if they would join me in recognizing the faculty and \nstaff of Kentucky's own Midway College.\n  Mr. President, the Kentucky publication ``Discover the Power of \nSoutheast Kentucky,'' published by the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of \nCommerce, recently printed an article extolling Midway College and its \npresident, Dr. William B. Drake, Jr. I ask unanimous consent that said \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From Discover the Power of Southeast Kentucky, Summer 2011]\n\n           Midway College President Dr. William B. Drake, Jr.\n\n       Anticipation is in the air as the new Midway College School \n     of Pharmacy prepares to greet its inaugural class. The City \n     of Paintsville, Johnson County, and people throughout the \n     region are excited about the arrival of students aspiring to \n     earn the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree.\n       Five years ago, the vision of bringing a pharmacy school to \n     eastern Kentucky began taking shape in the minds of \n     Paintsville attorney G. Chad Perry III, his wife, Judy, and \n     the administration of Midway College led by Midway College \n     President Dr. William B. Drake, Jr. One by one, the people \n     whose support was needed recognized the merit of the idea and \n     got behind it. One by one the obstacles to such an ambitious \n     plan were overcome.\n       In January 2010, Midway College Board of Trustees Chairman \n     James J. O'Brien, Chairman and CEO of Ashland, Inc., \n     officially announced that the Midway College School of \n     Pharmacy would open in Paintsville. Local and state \n     government officials were on hand along with a large crowd \n     gathered for the announcement. U.S. Representative Hal Rogers \n     said, ``This project will bring a hundred good paying jobs to \n     the region during a time of high unemployment rates. It also \n     builds educational resources at home to continue the mission \n     of providing quality opportunities so our best and brightest \n     students don't have to leave Kentucky for professional \n     degrees and careers.''\n       In explaining why Midway College chose Paintsville as the \n     site, President Drake said, ``The citizens of this community \n     care about education and these citizens, as well as the local \n     public officials, have stepped forward at this unique time to \n     make this school happen.'' A two-million dollar campaign took \n     place in Paintsville to assist with the capital expenses of \n     building the new school. The school is expected to generate \n     more than $30 million in economic activity annually in the \n     Paintsville area.\n       President Drake said the college could not ask for a more \n     enthusiastic or dedicated community than Paintsville. ``They \n     understand the value of education,'' he said. ``And it is an \n     incredibly attractive place to work, live, and earn your \n     professional degree.''\n       Dr. Drake has been making weekly trips to Johnson County to \n     oversee the process which he says has been taxing but \n     worthwhile. ``It's like building a whole new culture,'' he \n     said, describing the many facets of expanding the college's \n     already sizable system of location. He called the projected \n     $20-million startup venture one of the biggest decisions ever \n     for the private college, whose roots predate the Civil War.\n       Founded in 1847, Midway College has a main campus in \n     Midway, Kentucky, which is located between Frankfort and \n     Lexington, and offers coursework in 14 different locations \n     across the Commonwealth. In addition to offering in-seat \n     coursework in both the traditional and accelerated setting, \n     Midway offers classes in an online format, providing \n     additional flexibility for students to have the opportunity \n     to obtain their degree. One program unique to Midway includes \n     an online bachelor's degree in Mining Management and Safety. \n     This is one of the only programs in the country designed for \n     those working in the mining industry. Midway College also \n     offers a Masters of Business Administration and will launch a \n     Master of Arts in Teaching this fall, both of which are \n     offered in an online format.\n       The new school is expected to fill a need for pharmacists \n     all across the nation. With the baby-boomer generation coming \n     into its retirement years, there is a call for pharmacists \n     not only to care for the aging populace but to replace those \n     ``boomers'' who are retiring from behind the drug counters \n     themselves. According to industry data, there are \n     approximately five applications for each opening at pharmacy \n     schools in the U.S., with even greater need in Appalachia. \n     Only four states have more difficulty than Kentucky in \n     filling pharmacists positions, and there are only two other \n     pharmacy schools in Kentucky--the University of Kentucky in \n     Lexington and the Sullivan School in Louisville.\n       ``Because of the number of students that apply to pharmacy \n     schools, we could fill enrollment with students from \n     California, there are that many,'' Dr. Drake said. But, he \n     explained, there is a special emphasis on drawing students \n     from the immediate area. ``It has been the intent of those \n     who care about the school that we look first and foremost at \n     the students from Appalachia'' he said.\n       ``As students graduate from our school they will meet the \n     pressing need that exists in Kentucky today for \n     pharmacists.''\n       Within a year of the official announcement about the \n     opening of the school, the process was underway to select the \n     80 students who would make up the enrollment of the first \n     class. More than 430 applications were received for the \n     coveted 80 spots. To date, 25 faculty and staff members have \n     been hired with an anticipated total of approximately 100. \n     The school's faculty salaries will be in the 60th percentile \n     of pharmaceutical faculty salaries in the United States.\n       When asked about the contributions of his staff, President \n     Drake said, ``Having a staff like mine, with such an \n     entrepreneurial spirit, has been like gold to me.'' The staff \n     includes Martha Jean McKenzie Wells (PhD, MsS) and Emily L. \n     Coleman (PhD, MEd) who are natives to the area. The school is \n     also honored to have Dr. Barry Bleidt taking the helm as its \n     Dean. Dr. Bleidt, who earned his undergraduate degrees in \n     Pharmacy and Environmental Geography from the University of \n     Kentucky, was formerly a founding member of Texas A's \n     Health Science Center College and left there as the school's \n     Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Associate Dean of \n     Academic Affairs. He has also held prestigious positions at \n     other pharmacy schools in California, Virginia, and \n     Louisiana.\n       The School of Pharmacy has a vision of expanding the scope \n     of pharmacy practice and elevating the level of care to \n     patients in all practice settings, with special emphasis on \n     eastern Kentucky and Appalachia. With that goal in mind, \n     Midway College has signed an agreement with the University of \n     Pikeville guaranteeing interviews to the top 10 students who \n     meet the academic qualifications. Similar agreements have \n     been penned between Midway and Eastern Kentucky University, \n     Big Sandy Community and Technical College, and Morehead State \n     University. These agreements not only benefit the students \n     through specific pharmaceutical instruction, but they will \n     allow all schools to share their academic resources. Hand in \n     hand with the University of Pikeville's School of Osteopathic \n     Medicine and other post-secondary institutions in the area, \n     Midway is looking to show the mountain communities the \n     diverse options that are available to them. With 80 percent \n     of Kentuckians without college degrees, the new institution \n     will offer a fresh new route, a route that's already proving \n     popular with students from the area. Fifty-five to 60 percent \n     of the incoming class is from the state, and even more from \n     adjacent mountain communities.\n       In keeping with the original vision of Midway and its \n     donors, the new pharmacy school is by Kentuckians for \n     Kentuckians, strengthening the region through strong ties to \n     surrounding communities and its renewed outlook to higher \n     education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S843-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S843-S844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMBASSADOR SHERRY REHMAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to welcome Pakistan's new Ambassador \nto the United States, Sherry Rehman. Ambassador Rehman has rightly been \ndescribed as representing ``the traditional values of Jinnah's \nPakistan.'' As a journalist, politician, and diplomat, she has fought \ntirelessly in defense of tolerance and moderation and has been a \nleading voice for women's equality and protection of minority rights.\n  The United States-Pakistan relationship has been tested this past \nyear, and while the problems we face are daunting, the basic fact is \nthat stability in Pakistan remains vital to our national security. \nAmbassador Rehman has arrived in Washington at a time of deep mistrust \non both sides. A series of tactical disputes have strained our \nstrategic partnership. Progress on bedrock national interests has \nstalled, and Pakistan's internal politics seems exceptionally turbulent \nat this time.\n  Pakistan faces major challenges today, including an economic and \nfiscal crisis, a growing insurgency within its borders and cities, and \nchronic energy shortages. There is increasing anxiety in Pakistan about \nhow the war ends in Afghanistan and what implications this will have \nfor regional stability. Many on both sides are questioning the value \nand meaning of our strategic partnership.\n  The truth is we have a lot of work to do to rebuild a productive \nrelationship. Despite our many frustrations and setbacks, we still have \nmore to gain by finding common ground. Whether it is finding a \npolitical solution in Afghanistan, reducing militancy, supporting \ndemocracy and civil society, or promoting economic and development \nreforms, the basic fact is that our interests do converge. The \nchallenge for all\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nof us now is to find ways to act together in common purpose, when and \nwhere possible.\n  For instance, on Afghanistan, we need to make our goals and strategy \nabsolutely clear. Pakistan has a constructive role to play in forging a \ndurable political settlement that will bring an end to this war. And \nwhile we have often been frustrated by the divergence of policies on \nAfghanistan, it remains important that we work together to further a \nreconciliation process that is Afghan led and supported by the region's \nkey players. This is a time for us to be careful, to be thoughtful, and \nto proceed deliberately but determinately--as I believe we are--to \nstrengthen our relationship and confront our common challenges.\n  Moreover, I want to emphasize that this relationship is not only \nabout the threats we face. It is not only about defeating militant \nextremists who threaten the security of both our countries. It is also \nabout building a deeper, broader, and long term strategic engagement \nwith the people of Pakistan. As I have said before, Pakistan's \nprosperity and its security--as well as our own--depend on it. And I am \ndetermined to make sure that the kinds of projects supported by Kerry-\nLugar-Berman funds remain on track and demonstrate our long term \ncommitment to the stability of Pakistan and to the region itself.\n  Make no mistake: our ability to influence events in Pakistan is \nlimited, and we should be realistic about what we can achieve. But we \ncannot allow events that might divide us in a small way to distract \nfrom the shared interests that unite us in a big way. Mohammad Ali \nJinnah said it best in his address to Pakistan's Constituent Assembly \nin 1947. His words are as relevant in today's context as they were \nthen:\n\n       If you will work in cooperation, forgetting the past, \n     burying the hatchet, you are bound to succeed.\n\n  The road ahead will be difficult no doubt. But I look forward to \nworking with Ambassador Rehman as a partner in these efforts in the \nmonths and years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S844-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE SALT LAKE COUNCIL OF WOMEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Salt \nLake Council of Women on the upcoming 100th anniversary of its \nfounding.\n  In the ranks of those who greatly admire this wonderful organization \nand its exemplary members, I stand front and center today to salute \nthem for their accomplishments and outstanding public service. As I do \nso, I am humbled by the magnitude of the task. It is difficult to find \nthe right words that will do justice to their extraordinary \ncontributions to Utah.\n  A century after its founding, this remarkable group has more than \nlived up to its motto: ``Community Service for Civic Improvement.'' \nEvidence of its good works is found throughout the Wasatch Front, \nincluding the International Peace Gardens the group was instrumental in \nmaking a reality in 1947 and has helped preside over ever since.\n  That alone is sufficient to ensure that the Salt Lake Council of \nWomen's legacy will long endure in the heads and hearts of its legions \nof admirers. But this service organization's legacy neither begins nor \nends there.\n  Its service began on February 26, 1912, when it organized with the \naim of bettering the ``social, civic and moral'' environment of the \nSalt Lake City area, and that service has continued unabated and on an \never-increasing scale ever since.\n  Over the years, members of the Council have been a tireless advocate \nfor Utah's youth, supporting child labor laws, visiting nurse and \nteacher programs for children who are ill, respect for the American \nflag, and the installation of the first drinking fountains in public \nschools.\n  They have further assisted with the Boy and Girl Scouts programs and \nhelped found a home for troubled girls, which has evolved into what is \nnow known as the Utah Youth Village. The organization has also helped \nthe Utah State Development Center, Alcoholics Anonymous, Ronald \nMcDonald House, and numerous hospitals, nursing homes, and homeless \nshelters and animal shelters, just to name a few.\n  And Utahns have not been the only beneficiaries. During World War I, \nthe group provided relief to the embattled and starving Finnish people. \nWhen World War II erupted, the council gave generously to the USO, \nAmerican Red Cross, and War Bond Drives. The council also has been a \nstrong advocate for the arts, supporting the Utah Symphony, Ballet West \nand the Days of '47, Utah's annual July celebration to commemorate the \n1847 arrival of the Mormon Pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley.\n  Today, as the Salt Lake Council of Women's centennial anniversary \nnears, its 200 members--representing 40 organizations and 5,000 women--\nare as engaging and anxiously engaged in the community as ever. Along \nwith their continued commitment to the International Peace Gardens and \nUtah Youth Village, council members are involved with the YWCA, \nUniversity Hospital Project, Wasatch Youth Center, and with an ever-\nwidening variety of special projects. This month, for instance, the \ncouncil will award a college scholarship to a victim of domestic \nviolence, who will be chosen from mothers in the YWCA's long-term \ntransitional housing program.\n  No matter what they do or who they serve, members of the Salt Lake \nCouncil of Women are the embodiment of what Mahatma Gandhi called ``the \nspirit of service and sacrifice.'' As the council gathers February 25th \nto celebrate its 100th anniversary, I add my voice to the chorus of \npraise in saluting its visionary and selfless members, both past and \npresent, who have done so much for so many to make Utah the great place \nit is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S844-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S844-S845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING WHITNEY ELIZABETH HOUSTON\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on Saturday, February 11, 2012, New \nJersey lost one of its proudest daughters and our country lost one of \nits brightest stars when Whitney Houston died at the untimely age of \n48.\n  Whitney Houston's New Jersey roots run deep. She was born in Newark \nin 1963. She moved to East Orange at age 4 and attended high school at \nMount Saint Dominic Academy in Caldwell.\n  The daughter of noted gospel singer Cissy Houston, Whitney spent her \nyoung life singing in the choir of the New Hope Baptist Church in \nNewark. She never forgot her roots, and even after she became a star, \nshe sometimes returned to New Hope Baptist Church to sing on Easter \nSunday. Fittingly, it is at New Hope Baptist Church that Whitney's \nfamily and friends will mourn her loss and celebrate her life this \nSaturday, February 18.\n  Virtually from the moment of the release of her debut album, \n``Whitney Houston,'' Whitney was an international superstar. The album \nspent a record 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, and it was \nthe first album by a female artist to yield three No. 1 hits. One of \nthose hits, ``The Greatest Love of All,'' became an anthem and a symbol \nof hope. For all of us who work to make a better world for our children \nand grandchildren, the song's opening line, ``I believe the children \nare our future,'' is a constant reminder of our mission.\n  Much more than just a great singer and performer, Whitney was a great \npatriot and humanitarian. Her performance of the ``Star Spangled \nBanner'' for Super Bowl XXV in 1991--during the first gulf war--has \nbeen hailed as the yardstick for other singers performing our national \nanthem. Whitney donated her proceeds from that performance to the \nAmerican Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the Junior League of Baltimore. Mary Goodwillie founded \nthe Junior League of Baltimore in 1912 with the goal of engaging \neducated young ladies to help alleviate the ills of the city. The \nleague members began working with underprivileged women and children in \nBaltimore. Their early advocacy efforts helped bring about reduced work \nhours for women and better living conditions for children. Throughout \nits 100-year history, the league has harnessed the spirit of \nvolunteerism to help countless families in Baltimore with projects \nranging from a nursery school for blind and deaf children in the 1940s, \na drug abuse education program in the 1970s, and the Kids in the \nKitchen nutrition education program today.\n  Once, the league was a volunteer activity for well-to-do women; \ntoday, it is a training ground where women interested in nonprofit \nmanagement, social work, and public service professions receive hands-\non experience. Volunteer activities are designed to empower diverse \nwomen from all walks of life to make a difference in their community.\n  The Junior League of Baltimore is part of the Association of Junior \nLeagues International and continues its foremothers' legacy of service \nand advocacy, emphasizing collaboration, coalition building, and \nresponsiveness to community needs. The Junior League of Baltimore's \nrecent projects include art programs, family support services, and \npartnerships with various organizations such as Read Across America, in \naddition to its innovative nutrition education program designed to \nfight childhood obesity.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Junior \nLeague of Baltimore on 100 years of service to Baltimore, and in \nthanking league members past and present for all that they have done \nand are doing to enrich the lives of the citizens of Baltimore and \nMaryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S845-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. KENNETH HALL\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I would like to commend the \nextraordinary career of Buckner International CEO Dr. Kenneth Hall, who \nwill soon be retiring from the Dallas-based organization after 19 years \nof dedicated service. Throughout his tenure, he has promoted founder \nR.C. Buckner's mission of bringing unconditional Christian love to \nneedy children. Hall has been instrumental in expanding the scope of \nBuckner's activities, which are inspired by the biblical principles of \nJames 1:27: ``Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and \nfaultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress \nand to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.''\n  A Baptist minister by training, R.C. Buckner devoted his life to \nhelping children whose families had been displaced or broken by war, \npoverty, and other hardships. The mustard seed of Buckner International \nwas planted on a hot July day in 1877, when Dr. Buckner gathered \nconcerned citizens around an old oak tree in Paris, TX, and asked for \ntheir assistance in building a home for orphans. From a humble \ncollection that day of $27, Dr. Buckner created Buckner Orphans' Home \nin Dallas in 1879. Now known as Buckner Children's Home, it is one of \nthe oldest orphanages west of the Mississippi River.\n  One hundred and thirty-five years after the famous oak tree meeting, \nBuckner International is aiding more than 400,000 people in countries \nacross the world. Dr. Hall became its fifth President and CEO in 1994. \nUnder his leadership, the endowment surpassed $200 million, and the \norganization established a new global ministry program. It now does \ncharitable work in China, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, \nGhana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Sierra \nLeone, South Korea, and Vietnam. Buckner also runs several retirement \ncommunities in Texas, and provides an extensive array of services to \nassist and empower families in crisis.\n  I am grateful for all that Dr. Hall has done to improve the lives of \nthe vulnerable and underprivileged, both at home and abroad. I join my \ncolleagues in saluting him for his tireless efforts, which have brought \njoy and comfort to so many. He deserves recognition as a true \nhumanitarian and a true American patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S845-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S845-S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN E. FRAMPTON\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing John E. Frampton on the occasion of his retirement as \ndirector of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, SCDNR.\n  John has dedicated the past 35 years to advancing and improving the \nState of South Carolina's natural resources and quality of life. He has \nbeen a tireless advocate of wildlife preservation in South Carolina and \nacross the United States. As director of SCDNR, he served as the chief \nadministrator for natural resources in the State and was responsible \nfor management and supervision of the agency's five divisions.\n  Leading with passion, determination, and humility, John has worked to \nprotect and promote South Carolina's natural resources at every level \naround the State. John joined SCDNR in 1974 as an assistant district \nbiologist. Prior to his appointment as director, he served as a \nregional wildlife biologist, chief of wildlife, and assistant director \nfor development and national affairs. On April 2, 2003, Mr. Frampton \nwas selected as the agency's director by the SCDNR Board.\n  John is an active member of multiple regional, national, and \ninternational wildlife organizations and served as a past president of \nboth the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Because of his dedicated \nleadership and commitment to conservation, John was appointed to the \nNational Marine Protected Area Federal Advisory Committee by the \nSecretary of Commerce and appointed to the prestigious Wildlife and \nHunting Heritage Conservation Council by the Secretary of Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture in 2010.\n  John's well-deserved acknowledgments and recognitions highlight the \nimpact he has had on the conservation community at the State and \nnational level. John has received numerous honors and awards over his \ncareer, including the International Canvasback Award from the North \nAmerican Waterfowl Management Plan Committee, the Clarence W. Watson \nAward from the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, \nthe Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trades', SHOT, Business Person of the \nYear Award, the Henry S. Mosby Award from the National Wild Turkey \nFederation, the Captain David Hart Award by the Atlantic States Marine \nFisheries Commission, and the Seth Gordon Award by the Association of \nFish and Wildlife Agencies. Additionally, John is recognized for \ninitiating South Carolina's\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nAshepoo, Combahee, and South Edisto, ACE, Basin Project in 1988 and \ncontinues to serve on the ACE Basin Task Force. He is an invaluable \nasset to the conservation community and as a leader has set an example \nfor future SCDNR directors to follow.\n  Born in Summerville, SC, John holds a bachelor of science degree in \nmarine biology from the College of Charleston. He later received a \nmaster of arts in teaching degree in biology from the Citadel and a \nmaster of science degree in wildlife biology from Clemson University. \nHe is a certified wildlife biologist through the Wildlife Society.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in celebrating John Frampton's lifelong \ndedication to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, the \nState of South Carolina, and our Nation. I wish John the very best in \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S846-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BRIAN DONNELLY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Debbie Stabenow \nand I would like to pay tribute to Brian Donnelly. The measure of a man \nis seen from many vantage points, from the family he loves, to the good \nwork he has done, to the lives he has positively influenced along the \nway. By this measure, Brian Donnelly lived a full and prosperous life. \nWe see that in the words of his adoring and devoted wife and family; we \nsee that in the seemingly endless outpouring of affection from his \ncolleagues, friends, and associates; and we see that even from those he \nprosecuted.\n  Brian Donnelly, who died suddenly last month, was a dedicated civil \nservant from my home State of Michigan. He devoted his life to \nupholding the law and serving the citizens of Michigan. This devotion \nand commitment can be seen through Brian's 25 years of service as a \nprosecutor, most recently for Kalkaska County. Brian was a skilled and \nhighly respected litigator who was known to work long days, often \nreturning to the office after dinner. Brian was admired not only by his \ncolleagues but by those on both sides of the bench. His commitment both \nto his work and to his family was evident to all who knew him.\n  Brian graduated from Michigan State University and received his law \ndegree from the University of Michigan School of Law. He married his \nwife Ruthann in July of 1987, and they remained partners for the rest \nof his life. While Brian's life was full of many successes, he also \nexperienced tragedy. Brian's brother, Mac J. Donnelly, Jr., was killed \nin the line of duty while working as a police officer in Lansing, MI, \nin 1977. His brother's death helped encourage Brian to pursue a \nsuccessful career as a prosecutor. It also led to his continued support \nof Michigan Concerns of Police Survivors, MI C.O.P.S, an organization \ndedicated to supporting the families of fallen officers. He took what \nwas a personal tragedy and transformed it into a lifelong, positive \npursuit that filled a void for many across Michigan.\n  After his death last month, Ruthann was inundated with letters of \ncondolence from across our State. Some of these condolence letters even \ncame from people Brian had prosecuted, who praised his fairness and \ndecency and expressed sorrow for his loss. To be respected by one's \ncolleagues is a sign of a job well done, but to be respected by one's \nadversaries is the mark of a truly unique man. Posthumously, Brian was \nhonored by the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan for his \noutstanding service as a prosecutor in Kalkaska County, an honor he \nrichly deserved.\n  Brian Donnelly left a legacy of nobility and dedicated public service \nfor Michigan and for the legal profession. He will be missed, but his \nmany efforts and the good he has done will be remembered for years to \ncome. Senator Stabenow and I are proud to honor him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S846-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JEFFREY J. DORKO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to MG \nJeffrey J. Dorko, deputy commanding general for military and \ninternational operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who is \nretiring from Active Duty service on Friday, February 10, 2012. As we \nreflect on the career of this exemplary public servant, I express \nappreciation for his distinguished and selfless service on behalf of a \ngrateful nation. It is his sacrifice, along with the sacrifices of \ncountless others in uniform around the world, which helps to keep our \nNation strong and secure.\n  Major General Dorko has accumulated more than 33 years of service to \nour country, and, more important, has amassed an impressive record of \naccomplishments. His military career began in 1978 as a platoon leader, \ncompany executive officer, and assistant battalion operations officer \nfor the 299th Engineer Battalion at Fort Sill, OK. Over the next three \ndecades, he served three tours of duty with the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers in Germany and was deployed in support of Operations Joint \nEndeavor and Joint Guard in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  From 2007 to 2008, Major General Dorko assumed command of the U.S. \nArmy Engineer Division, Gulf Region, headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq, in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. And currently, as the deputy \ncommanding general for military and international operations for the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Major General Dorko is responsible for \nthe successful execution of more than $28 billion in design, \nconstruction, and environmental projects.\n  I know Major General Dorko would want us to also recognize his \nfamily's many sacrifices throughout his exemplary career. Major General \nDorko's dedicated service and sound leadership have served as useful \nexamples to our men and women in uniform. I know my Senate colleagues \njoin me in congratulating Major General Dorko and honoring his \ndistinguished record of service to our country. I wish him the best as \nhe embarks on the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S846-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING DELOITTE LLC\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, last week I had the privilege of \nspeaking at the LATINA Style 50 Awards Ceremony and Diversity Leaders \nConference, which is held each year to recognize leaders in corporate \ndiversity. A premier and well-respected publication, LATINA Style 50 \nhonored Deloitte LLC with its Company of the Year award, in recognition \nof its commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace for Latinas and \nprofessionals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I would like \nto congratulate Deloitte for receiving this honor.\n  Deloitte has a long legacy of developing leaders and giving back to \nits communities. From establishing the accounting industry's first \nwomen's initiative in 1993, to operating an external advisory council, \nchaired by Dr. Sally Ride, that oversees its women's initiatives, \nDeloitte has been a leader in promoting diversity in the workplace. \nDeloitte also focuses its efforts externally through its support of a \nbroad range of community groups, including several that serve \nHispanics.\n  Deloitte's CEO, Joe Echevarria, personifies the career and \ndevelopment opportunities available at the organization. Of Puerto \nRican heritage, Mr. Echevarria began working at Deloitte as an audit \nrecruit from the University of Miami. Today, he oversees 45,000 \nprofessionals who specialize in multiple industries, in nearly 90 U.S. \ncities. He understands inclusive and empowering policies aren't just \ngood for his employees--they are good for business.\n  It is a pleasure to congratulate Deloitte, its employees, and \nDeloitte CEO, Mr. Joseph Echevarria, on being named Company of the Year \nby LATINA Style 50, and I encourage other companies to follow the lead \nof Deloitte in growing and developing diverse talent in their executive \nsuites and boardrooms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S846-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S846-S847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DOYLE ROGERS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, for over 50 years, Doyle W. Rogers \nhas been a proud resident of the city of Batesville, AR. Next month, \nBatesville will honor him by designating March 6, 2012, as Doyle Rogers \nDay. Through his many endeavors, Doyle has found success through \nvisionary leadership and hard work. It is in that spirit that I rise \ntoday to recognize a man I consider a great businessman and an even \ngreater Arkansan.\n  Doyle Rogers was born in Diaz, AR, in 1918, and raised in Newport. \nAfter attending Arkansas State University in\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nJonesboro, Doyle enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force to fight in \nWorld War II before the United States had entered the war. He then went \non to serve in Burma with the U.S. Army Air Corps. His return from the \nwar and transition into civilian life brought him to Batesville, where \nhe started his professional career. Doyle tried his hand in several \nbusinesses in those early years, even traveling southern States selling \nMasonic Bibles, until establishing the Doyle Rogers Realty and \nInsurance Agency in 1953.\n  This company would later become the Doyle Rogers Company. This \ncompany's real estate projects have shaped the Arkansas landscape and \nthe Little Rock skyline. In 1982, Doyle's vision led to the development \nand opening of the Statehouse Convention Center and Excelsior Hotel, a \nworld-class facility now known as the Peabody Hotel. A few years later, \nDoyle added the Rogers Building, a 25-story office tower now called the \nStephens Building. These projects still stand proud along the Arkansas \nRiver in downtown Little Rock and assisted in the rejuvenation of \nbusiness development in downtown Little Rock.\n  Doyle would go on to purchase Metropolitan National Bank in 1983 and \nrelocate its headquarters to downtown Little Rock. He serves as \nchairman of the board, and during his tenure the bank has grown to one \nof the largest in the State. His success with Metropolitan National \nBank and his other projects led to his induction into the Arkansas \nBusiness Hall of Fame in 2006. With this induction, Doyle joined a \nprestigious group that includes Sam Walton, William Dillard, and Don \nTyson.\n  Many of Doyle's friends speak of his relentless work effort and \ndedication to the causes he holds dear. Education has been one of those \nissues over the years. He has served on the board of trustees of \nHendrix College as well as advisory boards for the School of Business \nand School of Law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He \nholds honorary degrees from Lyon College and Philander Smith College. I \nknow these institutions and countless students have benefited from \nDoyle's business acumen and visionary leadership.\n  Doyle attributes much of his success to the love and support of his \ngreat family. He married the love of his life, the former Josephine \nRaye Jackson, in 1941. Together they have been blessed with two \nchildren, Barbara Rogers Hoover and Doyle W. ``Rog'' Rogers, Jr., and \nsix grandchildren. He noted in an interview with Arkansas Business:\n\n       The way you enjoy your life is through your family. \n     Material things are good, but being with your family, \n     watching them grow and prosper is probably the greatest \n     reward.\n\n  Batesville is one of my State's oldest cities. Situated along the \nWhite River, it was used as a shipping point decades before Arkansas \nwas granted statehood. With this history, Batesville has been home to \nmany notable residents, from professional athletes and NASCAR drivers \nto several former Governors. Doyle Rogers has certainly earned the \nhonor of being listed as a great resident of Batesville. Even with \nDoyle's business success, he has remained humble to his roots, always \nbelieving in the value of hard work and loving the great city of \nBatesville. In 2004, my good friend and former Congressman Marion Berry \nsaid this of Doyle:\n\n       In a day and age when the presiding belief is in order to \n     grow up and succeed you must escape Rural America, Doyle \n     Rogers and his family lived in Batesville, Arkansas for more \n     than 50 years, proving success comes with hard work, not a \n     change of zip code.\n\n  I agree with my former colleague. Doyle's life and work are worthy of \npraise, and I am proud of the legacy he has built. I know that whatever \nendeavor Doyle chooses to pursue in the future, he will continue to \nhave a positive impact on Batesville and Arkansas. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Doyle Rogers for this honor bestowed on \nhim by the city of Batesville and thank him for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S847-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S847-S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING MAYOR EMORY McCORD FOLMAR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a friend \nand the former mayor of Montgomery, AL, Emory McCord Folmar. He passed \non from this life on November 11, 2011, and I wish to honor Mayor \nFolmar's courage and service to his country, the State of Alabama, and \nthe city of Montgomery.\n  Mayor Folmar was born in Troy, AL on June 3, 1930, to Marshall Bibb \nFolmar and Miriam Woods Pearson Folmar. At the age of 14, the Folmar \nfamily moved to Montgomery, AL, where he graduated from Sidney Lanier \nHigh School in 1948. Mayor Folmar attended the University of Alabama, \nwhere he earned a B.S. in business in just 3 years. During his time at \nthe Capstone, he served as a cadet colonel in the Army ROTC and was a \nmember of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Upon graduation, Mayor \nFolmar received a regular Army commission and was assigned to the \nparachute training and instructors' school for the 11th Airborne \nDivision of the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Benning, GA.\n  He married Anita Pierce in February 1952, immediately prior to his \ndeployment to the Korean war theatre later that summer. During that \nintense conflict, Mayor Folmar was wounded in combat and received the \nSilver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. He also received the French \nCroix de Guerre for his actions with the 23rd Regiment of the 2nd \nInfantry Division and French troops. Following the Korean war, he was \nassigned to Fort Campbell, KY, as an airborne jump master until 1954. \nMayor Folmar was then and until his last breath a true American patriot \nwho loved, respected, and defended the men and women who serve our \nNation in uniform. As everyone knew, this was a part of his very being.\n  Emory and Anita then moved to Montgomery, where he joined his \nbrother, James Folmar, to run a successful construction and shopping \ncenter development company. In 1975 Mayor Folmar was urged to enter \npolitical life and run for the District 8 seat on the Montgomery City \nCouncil. He was elected president of the city council and became mayor \nof Montgomery in 1977 in a most remarkable election. He was elected \nmayor with 65 percent of the vote, despite having 57 competitors. Mayor \nFolmar went on to serve as mayor for 22 years until 1999. Mayor Folmar \nwas a fiscal conservative who was most proud of the financial health of \nthe city. He was famous for maintaining a balanced budget and \nestablishing a healthy reserve fund. Mayor Folmar was also known to \nwalk municipal ditches and visit public property in order to ensure \nthat municipal services were operating at peak performance. He would \noften say, ``It's not what you expect, it's what you inspect.'' He was \nperhaps one of the greatest mayors in the history of Alabama and one of \nthe best in America. He was honest, courageous, a superb manager, and, \nquite noticeably, direct and plain spoken.\n  In 1980, Mayor Folmar served as State chairman of President Ronald \nReagan's finance committee, and in 1984, he served as Reagan's State \ncampaign chairman. In 1982, Mayor Folmar ran a competitive race as the \nRepublican candidate for the Governor's office in Alabama. Mayor Folmar \nalso served as the State campaign chairman for Bush-Quayle in 1988 and \nagain in 1992. After retiring from politics, Mayor Folmar worked as a \nbusiness consultant and then was appointed commissioner of the \nimportant Alabama Beverage Control Board in 2003 by Gov. Bob Riley. He \nserved the State in this role until 2011, doing superb work making the \ndepartment leaner and more productive.\n  On a personal note, I had the pleasure of working closely with Mayor \nFolmar when he served as campaign chairman for my first campaign for \nthe Senate in 1996. I will always appreciate and remember his support \nthroughout the years and his leadership in Alabama. Those of us who \nknew Mayor Folmar know also that he was a man of faith who was an elder \nat Trinity Presbyterian Church in Montgomery, AL. Governor Riley noted \nhow impressed he was with Mayor Folmar's wisdom and scriptural \nknowledge. Emory Folmar had the reputation in Alabama as an extremely \nintelligent, hard-working, honest, and headstrong leader.

Mr. President, I wish to remember Mr. James \nLucien ``Jimmy'' Hinton, who passed away on December 3, 2011, in \nTuscaloosa, AL, at the age of 88. He was one of Alabama's best known \nand respected citizens.\n  Mr. Jimmy was born in Tuscaloosa on April 8, 1923. He grew up in the \nLittle Sandy community, attended the University of Alabama in the \n1940s, and served in the U.S. Army. In 1958, he married Jean Jolly and \nthey had three children: Jimmy, Jr., Mary Katherine, and Elizabeth. He \nloved his family and enjoyed spending time at his farm, Sedgefield \nPlantation, in Dallas County.\n  Mr. Jimmy was a highly successful businessman and involved in many \nbusinesses during his lifetime, starting his own sawmill company at the \nage of 16. He was engaged in the lumber business, real estate \ndevelopment, a box and pallet factory, automobile business, asphalt \nbusiness, and the family owned a meat-packing company, R. L. Zeigler \nCo., Inc., where he served as chairman of the board. He also served as \na board member for the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa and Southern \nUnited Life Insurance Company. In 1999, he was inducted into the \nAlabama Business Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Jimmy loved his family very much and particularly enjoyed hunting \nand fishing with them and his many friends at Sedgefield. He often \nopened Sedgefield for national and State field trials and also allowed \nhunts for persons with disabilities and terminal illness. He began the \nfirst Life Hunts for such hunters over 25 years ago, and many have \nbenefited from his care and concern. He supported a host of worthy \ncauses over his life.\n  In 1998, Jimmy received the Governor's Award and was named \nConservationist of the Year for his dedication to conservation in \nAlabama.\n  He was a passionate supporter of the University of Alabama and its \nathletics program. Paul W. ``Bear'' Bryant and he were famous friends. \nHe served on the University of Alabama Presidents Cabinet and the Board \nof Visitors of the Culverhouse College of Commerce and Business \nAdministration.\n  I knew Mr. Jimmy for a number of years. It was easy to see why he \nengendered such affection and respect. A decisive and strong man, \ncertainly, he nevertheless was totally unassuming. That background of \ncountry living, his love of hunting and the outdoors, his success in \nbusiness, and his association with athletics at the iconic University \nof Alabama combined in a special way to shape who he was. People saw \nhim for who he was. There was a rare combination of strength, modesty, \nand loyalty deep in his character. And to a very unusual degree, this \nremarkable businessman, who never sought the limelight, was well known \nand loved throughout our State.\n  Alabama and the Nation have lost one of its finest citizen. My \nsympathy is extended to his family upon this loss, but they have been \ngiven a wonderful heritage of industry, humility, and public \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S848-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE LANSING REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Carl Levin \nand I would like to pay tribute to the Lansing Regional Chamber of \nCommerce on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its annual dinner.\n  From the very first dinner held in 1912 to the present, the Lansing \nRegional Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner has played a significant \nrole in bringing business and community leaders together to celebrate \nexciting developments in the region. Although the format of the evening \nmay have changed over the years, the mission remains the same: to serve \nas the premier business networking event of the year and to celebrate \nthe contributions of individuals and organizations that make the region \ngreat.\n  The group of Lansing area business leaders who formed the Lansing \nBusiness Men's Association certainly paved the way for the tradition \nthat is celebrated today. After changing their name to the Lansing \nChamber of Commerce, Ransom E. Olds, founder of Oldsmobile, addressed \nthe first annual meeting at the Masonic Temple. The association had \nencouraged him to come back to Lansing from Detroit and build a \nfactory, which he did. This clearly established the chamber as the \ncommunity leader in fostering economic growth and creating jobs.\n  I am very proud that the Lansing Chamber founded the now \ninternationally known ATHENA Award in 1982. What started as a visionary \nway to support, develop and honor local women leaders, has now become a \nglobal movement with more than 6000 awards presented in 500 communities \nin the United States, Canada, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  It is exciting that on February 22, 2012, the 100th Annual Dinner \nwill be celebrated at the Lansing Center. This event will not only \ncelebrate the chamber's history and the many people who made things \nhappen over the past 100 years, it will include updates from current \nbusiness leaders and the presentation of the 2011 Community Service, \nOutstanding Small Business and Legacy Awards.\n  More than just a dinner, this event showcases the businesses and \npeople who have helped make this region into what it is today and shape \nits future. We are pleased to congratulate the Lansing Regional Chamber \nof Commerce on this special occasion and wish them many more years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S848-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S848-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S848-5", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2079.

A bill to increase access to adult education to provide for \neconomic growth; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Adult Education \nand Economic Growth Act of 2012. This bill will address the critical \nneeds in our workforce by investing in adult education, job training \nand other workforce programs needed to build a strong and competitive \n21st century workforce. I am pleased to be joined in this initiative by \nSenators Jack Reed and Sherrod Brown. An identical bill has been \nreintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Hinojosa.\n  By almost any measure, our Nation faces a critical need to strengthen \nexisting programs of adult education. Our current adult education \nsystem falls short in preparing our people to compete globally. In \nfact, fewer than 3 million of the 93 million people who could benefit \nfrom these services actually receive them.\n  The U.S. labor market has changed dramatically with the advent of new \ntechnology and with the loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector. The \nneed for well-trained and highly skilled workers has increased. At the \nsame time, our adult education system, which should effectively prepare \nour low-skill workers to meet the demands of this shifting economy, has \nnot kept pace with this changing workforce.\n  Since 2002, the Federal Government has consistently decreased funding \nfor adult education. In addition, the Nation's primary Federal resource \nfor adult education, job training and employment services, the \nWorkforce Investment Act, has not been reauthorized for more than 10 \nyears. Only about one in four adults with less than a high school \neducation participates in any kind of further education or training.\n  There are other signs pointing to the need for a better approach to \nadult education. Consider adult education enrollment rates. In 1998 \nthere were more than 4 million individuals enrolled in adult education \nprograms. In 2007, enrollments had dropped to just 2 million. This is a \n40 percent drop from when the Workforce Investment Act was originally \nenacted in 1998.\n  A growing number of U.S. skilled workers are facing retirement age \nand the growth in skilled labor force has stagnated. Addressing the \nlooming skills shortage in many sectors and regions in the U.S., \nthrough reinvestment in our adult education system, will result in an \neducated and literate adult population.\n  According to the Workforce Alliance, 80 percent of jobs in today's \neconomy require some education beyond a high school degree. Yet there \nare 8 million adults in the workforce who have low literacy, limited \nEnglish proficiency, or lack educational credentials beyond high \nschool.\n  With so many workers who are unemployed or underemployed, it is clear \nthat we should invest in the training or re-training of U.S. workers to \nfill this growing gap.\n  Our legislation begins the vital task of addressing these problems.\n  Today, we are proposing a four-pronged approach to strengthen the \nNation's workforce. First, we want to build ``on ramps'' for American \nworkers who need new skills and a better education in order to improve \ntheir lives. Currently our adult education programs are operating in \nsilos and it is critical that we improve the adult education system \nthrough partnerships with businesses and workforce development groups. \nJust as importantly, we want to encourage employers to help them, by \noffering tax credits to businesses that invest in their employees. This \ngovernment has long provided employers with limited tax credits when \nthey help their employees go to college or graduate school. It is basic \nlogic and to the national good, that we should provide similar \nincentives for basic adult education.\n  Second, we must modernize the delivery system of adult education by \nharnessing the increased use of technology in workforce skills training \nand adult education. The bill provides incentives to states and local \nservice providers to increase their use of technology and distance \nlearning in adult education. Many adult learners cannot afford the time \nor money to travel to a classroom and deploying technology will help \nmeet this need.\n  Third, our bill establishes stronger assessment and accountability \nmeasures.\n  This bill authorizes a rather modest $500 million increase in funding \nto invigorate state and local adult education programs nationwide to \nincrease the number of adults with a high school diploma. As a result, \nthe bill will inevitably increase the number of high school graduates \nwho go on to college, and update and expand the job skills of the U.S. \nworkforce. All of this is relevant to my longstanding personal goal of \npromoting basic economic fairness in our society.\n  Other provisions of the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act will \nimprove workers' readiness to meet the demands of a global workforce by \nproviding pathways to obtain basic skills, job training, and adult \neducation.\n  The act will provide workers with greater access to on-the-job \ntraining and adult education by encouraging public-private partnerships \nbetween government, business and labor.\n  The act will improve access to correctional education programs to \nchannel former offenders into productive endeavors and reduce \nrecidivism.\n  The act will encourage investment in lower skilled workers by \nproviding employers with a tax credit if they invest in their \nemployee's education. This tax credit is aimed at encouraging general \nand transferable skills development that may be in the long term \ninterest of most employers but are not always so clearly rewarded by \nthe market.\n  This act focuses on addressing the unique needs of adults with \nlimited basic skills, with no high school diploma, or with limited \nEnglish proficiency. Those individuals who may have taken a different \npath earlier in life, and who now find themselves eager to go back to \nschool and receive additional job training and skills, should be \nprovided opportunities to get back on track.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important endeavor. Our \nNation's workforce and local communities will be stronger for it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Coons, Mr. \n        Franken, and Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 2119. A bill to establish a pilot program to address overweight/\nobesity among children from birth to age 5 in child care settings and \nto encourage parental engagement; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nHealthy Kids from Day One Act--a bill that will add another tool to our \ntoolbox for tackling the national epidemic of childhood obesity. Today, \nabout one in three children is either overweight or obese, and nearly \n21 percent of our littlest ones--those in preschool--are obese or \noverweight. This problem has become an epidemic, and I want to thank \nSenators Coons, Carper, Franken, and Tom Udall for joining me in \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  The Healthy Kids from Day One Act seeks to focus on the childcare \nsetting as a part of our strategy to combat childhood obesity and get \nkids healthy and moving again. This bill recognizes that in order to \nreduce the prevalence\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nof childhood obesity, we must reach children in as many settings as \npossible and particularly in the places where they live, learn, and \nplay. With 75 percent of U.S. children aged 3 to 5 years in childcare \nand 56 percent in centers, including nursery schools, preschools, and \nfull-day centers, it makes sense to focus on the preschool and \nchildcare environment. Experts are increasingly acknowledging this \nsetting as critical to obesity prevention. For example, this past \nOctober the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released a research \nsynthesis on how childcare settings can promote healthy eating and \nphysical activity. Furthermore, an article in the January 2012 issue of \nPediatrics examined barriers to children's physical activity in \nchildcare.\n  Childcare providers want to create healthy environments for children \nbut vary in the expertise or resources needed to achieve this goal. \nThis legislation builds on a bill I introduced with Senator Franken in \n2010 by supporting the establishment of childcare collaborative \nworkshops at the local level to offer childcare providers the tools, \ntraining, and assistance they need to encourage healthy eating and \nphysical activity. This bill supplements some of the work being done \nright now by the First Lady in her Let's Move Child Care initiative, as \nit would bring together, in interactive collaborative learning \nsessions, relevant entities needed for meaningful childhood-obesity \nprevention.\n  Obesity has serious health and economic consequences. It puts our \nchildren at greater risk of costly but preventable chronic illnesses, \nsuch as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Obesity also comes at a \ntremendous cost to our society. The total economic cost is estimated at \n$300 billion annually, and, as the Nation's youth continues to age, \nfurther costs will be added to the national health care system if these \ntrends continue. Obesity also has impacted our ability to recruit \nhealthy, young servicemembers into the military and maintain a strong \nnational defense.\n  My childhood and much of my adult life has been spent in the great \noutdoors, and I have tried to bring my enthusiasm for being active and \nexploring the world around us here to the U.S. Congress as a cochair of \nthe Senate Outdoor Recreation Caucus. I firmly believe that we need to \nreconnect folks with the idea that being active is fun and rewarding, \nand it can help us lower health care costs and improve the quality of \nlife here in America.\n  I would like to thank Nemours, Trust for America's Health, the YMCA \nof the USA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Heart \nAssociation for working with me to develop this legislation. This bill \nbuilds upon their expertise with obesity prevention.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the fight against childhood \nobesity by supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Enzi (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \n        Barrasso, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Corker, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Heller, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Lee, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Moran, Mr. Paul, \n        Mr. Portman, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Vitter, and \n        Mr. Wicker):\n  S.J. Res. 36. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the National Labor Relations Board relating to \nrepresentation election procedures; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today after introducing a \nCongressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval to stop the National \nLabor Relations Board's unfair and unnecessary ambush elections rule. I \nam pleased that 43 fellow Senators have cosponsored this resolution. I \nknow it will draw more support on the Senate floor as people learn the \ndetails of the new rule.\n  This administration's National Labor Relations Board has done a lot \nof controversial things, but the ambush elections rule stands out \nbecause it is a politicized and unjustified effort to make a fair \nsystem less fair, and it is being rushed into effect over tremendous \nobjection.\n  The National Labor Relations Act, which the National Labor Relations \nBoard enforces, is a carefully balanced law that protects the rights of \nemployees to join or not join a union and also protects the rights of \nemployers to free speech and unrestricted flow of commerce.\n  Since it was enacted in 1935, changes to this statute have been rare. \nWhen they do occur, it is the result of careful negotiations with all \nthe stakeholders. Most of the questions that come up under the law are \nhandled through decisions of the board. Board decisions often do change \nthe enforcement of the law significantly, but they are issued in \nresponse to an actual dispute and an actual question of law. In \ncontrast, the ambush elections rule is not a response to a real issue \nbecause the current election process for certifying whether employees \nwant to form a union is not broken.\n  This rule was not carefully negotiated by stakeholders. Instead, it \nwas rushed into place over just 6 months, despite the fact that it drew \nover 65,000 comments in the 2-month period after it was first proposed.\n  Had the board held the comment period open longer to allow more input \nfrom the regulated community, which was clearly quite engaged on the \nproposal, it would certainly have received even more comments. Yet this \nrelatively small agency reported that it gone through all 65,957 \ncomments in just the 7 weeks they took to release a modified rule, \nwhich was then finalized. The rule was finalized just days before the \nboard lost its quorum with the expiration of Member Becker's recess \nappointment term. Under any circumstances, a rulemaking this hasty \nlooks suspicious. In this case, there is simply no justification for \nthe rush.\n  Today's secret ballot elections occur in a median timeframe of 38 \ndays. Unions win more than 71 percent of elections--their highest win \nrate on record. The current system does not disadvantage labor unions \nat all. But it does ensure there is fairness for the employees whose \nright it is to make the decision of whether or not to form a union, to \npay union dues, and to have some of their dues go into political \ncampaigns and have the full opportunity to hear from both sides about \nthe ramifications of that decision--to have the time to get full \ndisclosure.\n  There is supposed to be a poster that notifies employees of their \nright not to have their money go into political campaigns, but this \nadministration has taken that off of the poster so they are no longer \ninformed of that right.\n  This principle of law has been upheld over nearly seven decades. It \nwas Senator John F. Kennedy who argued during the debate over the 1959 \namendments to the law, saying:\n\n       There should be at least a 30-day interval between the \n     request for an election and the holding of an election . . . \n     in which both parties can present their viewpoints.\n\n  Frankly, whenever I hear a government decision that aims to limit \ninformation available to citizens and depress free speech, I am very \nconcerned. It was that sort of agenda that was behind the card check \nlegislation which was defeated in the Senate. Let me repeat that. It \nwas that sort of agenda that was behind the card check legislation that \nwas defeated in the Senate. I am afraid this rule has been hatched in \nthe same laboratory, and I hope it will meet the same fate.\n  The ambush elections rule eliminates the 25-day waiting period to \nconduct elections in cases where a party has filed a preelection \nrequest for review. It effectively eliminates the opportunity for \nparties to voice objections and settle issues before the elections and \nlimits the ability to address them after elections as well.\n  What are we trying to hide? The effect of these changes will be union \ncertification elections held in as few as 10 days. Union organizers \nwill hand-select members of the bargaining unit, and any review of the \nappropriateness of the unit makeup or status of employees who may \nqualify as supervisors will be postponed until after the election--\nsomething always done before the election. Employees will be voting on\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nwhether to form a union without any idea of who will actually be in the \nbargaining unit.\n  Employers will be caught off guard and potentially flying blind with \nregard to their rights under the law, particularly small businesses. \nUnion organizers spend months, if not years, organizing and spreading \ntheir message to the employees, unbeknownst to the employer. So when a \nunion files a representation petition, employers are already at a \nsignificant disadvantage in educating employees about their views on \nunionization. Employers also use this time to consult with their \nattorneys to ensure their actions are permissible under the law. \nShortening the time period will increase the likelihood that employers \nwill act hastily, opening themselves to unfair labor practice charges \nthat have very severe consequences.\n  I am particularly concerned about the small businesses that will be \nambushed under this rule. Instead of focusing on growing and creating \nmore jobs, they will be swamped with legal issues, with bargaining \nobligations, a less flexible workforce, and increased costs across the \nboard. Most small businesses likely have no idea about the changes \nbeing made by the National Labor Relations Board because the rule was \nrushed into place so hastily.\n  Instead of directing the National Labor Relations Board to focus on \nenforcing current law rather than ambushing small business job creators \nand their employees, President Obama has stacked the Board with \nunconstitutional recess appointees and requested a $15 million increase \nin their budget. He simply doesn't understand. He doesn't get it.\n  By passing this resolution through both the House and Senate, we will \nstrike a victory for those on the side of job creation and fairness to \nemployees. It will also send a very important message to a runaway \nagency. Under this administration, the National Labor Relations Board \nhas been more controversial than most observers can ever remember. They \nhave flouted the intentions of Congress repeatedly.\n  The President has redefined a recess appointment in order to keep it \ngoing. There is no law that allowed that. There is no change that has \nbeen made that would allow a President to do something different than \nhas ever been done before. But he did it. He redefined the recess \nappointment in order to keep the Board going.\n  A few weeks ago, National Labor Relations Board Chairman Pearce \nannounced that he intends to push through even more controversial \nchanges to the elections rules before the end of the year. He is \nplanning to require a mandatory hearing 7 days after a petition is \nfiled. Employers would be forced to file a position statement on \nimportant legal questions at the hearing or lose the right to \nsubsequently argue those issues. He plans to require employers to \nprovide personal employee information to union organizers, such as e-\nmail addresses, within 2 days. Do you think the employees want to be \nharassed with e-mails? I doubt it. These changes would completely \ncripple any employer's ability to have a voice in the decisionmaking \nprocess, let alone a small employer's.\n  Enacting a resolution of disapproval of the ambush elections rule \nwould prevent Chairman Pearce from promulgating these destruction \nchanges. It would not roll back any rights or privileges, it would \nsimply return these workplace rules to current law. Current law. Not \ncurrent rule, current law. It just returns it to the workplace rules we \nhave under current law. I will remind my colleagues that current law is \na fair system under which employees retain the right to decide by \nsecret ballot election whether to form a union. Elections occur in a \nmedian of 38 days, and unions win 71 percent of the elections.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport from a number of groups.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2012.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), I am writing to express manufacturers' \n     strong support for S.J. Res. 36, the ``Resolution of \n     Disapproval'' of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) \n     rule relating to representation election procedures.\n       The NAM is the nation's largest industrial trade \n     association, representing small and large manufacturers in \n     every industrial sector and in all 50 states. The NAM's \n     mission is to enhance the competitiveness of the \n     manufacturing economy by advocating policies that are \n     conducive to U.S. economic growth.\n       The NLRB's rule relating to representation election \n     procedures, finalized in December, represents one of many \n     recent actions and decisions made by the NLRB, stifling \n     economic growth and job creation. These actions would burden \n     manufacturers with harsh rules, making it harder to do \n     business in the United States. The rule would limit what \n     issues and evidence can be presented at a pre-election \n     hearing, potentially leaving important questions unresolved \n     until after an election has taken place, making these \n     questions moot.\n       Furthermore, the rule would also eliminate the current 25 \n     day ``grace period,'' compressing the time frame for \n     elections to occur in approximately 20 days. Business owners \n     would effectively be stripped of legal rights ensuring a fair \n     election and those who lack resources, or in house legal \n     expertise, will be left scrambling to navigate and understand \n     complex labor processes with too little time. Moreover, \n     employees will be denied the ability to make fully informed \n     decisions about whether they want to join a union. Finally, \n     the NLRB has not provided any evidence such a rule is needed \n     in order to address a systematic problem of representation \n     election delays. Absent any justification, the NAM believes \n     the rule is unnecessary and will create problems where none \n     currently exist.\n       S.J. Res. 36 would send a strong message to the NLRB and \n     rein in the agency, whose actions have resulted in the most \n     dramatic changes to labor law in 75 years, threatening the \n     ability of business owners to create and retain jobs. We look \n     forward to continuing to work with you on our shared goals \n     for a strong economy, job creation and promoting fair and \n     balanced labor laws.\n\n                              NLRB REPRESENTATION ELECTION STATUS THROUGH THE YEARS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    Election\n                  Fiscal year                        Cases         agreement %      Median days      56-day %\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2011..........................................  ..............  ................  ..............  ..............\n2010..........................................            1790              92.1              38            95.1\n2009..........................................            1690              91.9              37            95.5\n2008..........................................            2085              91.8              38            95.1\n2007..........................................            2080              91.2              39            93.9\n2006..........................................            2296              91.1              38            94.2\n2005..........................................            2715              89                39            93.6\n2004..........................................            2537              89                39            93.6\n2003..........................................            2659              88.5              40            92.5\n2002..........................................            2871              86.1              41              91\n2001..........................................            2842              88.2              40             N/A\n10 year Average...............................            2356              89.9            38.9            93.8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                                February 15, 2012.\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor, & \n         Pensions,Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: We write on behalf of the National \n     Restaurant Association to commend you on your leadership \n     urging the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to \n     challenge the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) \n     decision to issue ``ambush election'' regulations. These \n     regulations make it more difficult for small businesses to \n     respond and educate their employees during union election \n     campaigns.\n       The ambush election regulations would, in practice, deny \n     employees' proper access to information on unions, while \n     restricting employers' rights of free speech and due process. \n     Specifically, the ambush election regulations restrict an \n     employer's ability to raise substantive issues and concerns \n     prior to a union election, such as allowing the NLRB\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n     to limit the issues raised at a pre-election hearing and \n     preventing an employer from raising objections to the size \n     and scope of a unit.\n       The ambush election regulations would also eliminate the \n     requirement that a union election not be held within 25 days \n     after a hearing judge rules on pre-election matters. As NLRB \n     Board Member Brian Hayes points out, the intent of the ambush \n     election regulations is to ``eviscerate an employer's \n     legitimate opportunity to express its views about collective \n     bargaining.''\n       We praise your leadership on this issue and look forward to \n     assisting you as this matter moves toward a floor vote in the \n     US Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Angelo I. Amador, Esq.,\n       Vice President Director, Labor & Workforce Policy.\n     Michelle Reinke Neblett,\n       Director, Labor & Workforce Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Associated Builders\n\n\n                                        and Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                                February 16, 2012.\n     The Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of Associated Builders and \n     Contractors (ABC), a national association with 74 chapters \n     representing more than 22,000 merit shop construction and \n     construction-related firms, I am writing to thank you for \n     introducing S.J. Res. 36, which provides for congressional \n     disapproval and nullification of the National Labor Relations \n     Board's (NLRB) rule related to representation election \n     procedures. ABC supports S.J. Res. 36 and urges Congress to \n     immediately pass this much-needed resolution, which will \n     nullify the ambush election proposal.\n       The ambush election rule is nothing more than the Board's \n     attempt to promote the interests of organized labor by \n     effectively denying employees access to critical information \n     about the pros and cons of union representation. Stripping \n     employers of free speech and the ability to educate their \n     employees, the rule poses a threat to both employees and \n     employers.\n       In August, ABC criticized the NLRB proposed ambush rule \n     that could dramatically shorten the time frame for union \n     organizing elections from the current average of 38 days to \n     as few as 10 days between when a petition is filed and the \n     election occurs. ABC submitted comments to the NLRB stating \n     the proposed rule would significantly impede the ability of \n     construction industry employers to protect their rights in \n     the pre-election hearing process; hinder construction \n     employers ability to share facts and information regarding \n     union representation with their employees; and impose \n     numerous burdens without any reasoned justification on small \n     merit shop businesses and their employees, which constitute \n     the majority of the construction industry. In the largest \n     response on record, the NLRB received more than 70,000 \n     comments regarding the proposal, many of which strongly \n     opposed the changes.\n       The Board published a final rule on December 22, 2011, with \n     an April 30, 2012 effective date. While it somewhat modified \n     the original proposal, disposing of the rigid seven- and two-\n     day requirements, the final rule is identical in purpose and \n     similar in effect to the August proposal.\n       At this time of economic challenges, it is unfortunate that \n     the NLRB continues to move forward with policies that \n     threaten to paralyze the construction industry and stifle job \n     growth. If left unchecked, the actions of the NLRB will fuel \n     economic uncertainty and have serious negative ramifications \n     for millions of American workers. We applaud you for \n     introducing S.J. Res. 36 and urge Congress to immediately \n     pass this much-needed resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Geoffrey G. Burr,\n     Vice President, Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       National Retail Federation,\n                                                February 16, 2012.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, 379A Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Retail \n     Federation (NRF), I am writing to you urge your support for \n     the Joint Resolution of Disapproval challenging the National \n     Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) rule on ambush elections. \n     Senator Mike Enzi has introduced this resolution, and NRF \n     urges you to support this legislation.\n       As the world's largest retail trade association and the \n     voice of retail worldwide, NRF's global membership includes \n     retailers of all sizes, formats and channels of distribution \n     as well as chain restaurants and industry partners from the \n     United States and more than 45 countries abroad. In the U.S., \n     NRF represents an industry that includes more than 3.6 \n     million establishments and which directly and indirectly \n     accounts for 42 million jobs--one in four U.S. jobs. The \n     total U.S. GDP impact of retail is $2.5 trillion annually, \n     and retail is a daily barometer of the health of the nation's \n     economy.\n       Senator Enzi's resolution will relieve the serious threat \n     to both employees and employers posed by a recently finalized \n     NLRB rule regarding election timing. The rule, announced \n     December 21, 2011, would drastically change the process for \n     union representation elections and would severely limit \n     worker access to information needed to make an informed \n     decision about whether or not to vote in favor of a union.\n       The average amount of time that elapses in a NLRB election \n     is presently 37 days. Under the new rule, a vote could happen \n     in as few as fourteen days, leaving an employer little time \n     to prepare for an election. Moreover, since a union can be \n     organizing for an election and talking to employees for up to \n     a year before a formal petition for an election is submitted \n     to the NLRB, the new rule severely tilts the playing field \n     against employers. As a result, the quality and quantity of \n     information available to employees in consideration of the \n     issue will be severely unbalanced; and the rights of \n     employees who do not favor the union position will be \n     undermined.\n       This action by the NLRB, taken along with a series of other \n     extraordinary rulings over the course of the last nine \n     months, are nothing more than an attempt to impose the \n     Employee Free Choice Act (card-check) on employees and \n     employers through regulation. We urge you to strongly reject \n     this ``backdoor'' card check agenda by a board of unelected \n     bureaucrats and restore balance to the organizing process so \n     that we can start removing the economic uncertainty facing \n     both employers and employees.\n       NRF is fully behind Senator Enzi's effort, and we urge you \n     to support the Joint Resolution of Disapproval. We look \n     forward to working with the Senate to move this Resolution \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David French,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Coalition for a\n\n\n                                         Democratic Workplace,\n\n                                                February 16, 2012.\n       Dear Senators Enzi and Isakson and Representatives Kline, \n     Roe and Gingrey: On behalf of millions of job creators \n     concerned with mounting threats to the basic tenets of free \n     enterprise, the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace thanks \n     you for introducing S.J. Res. 36 and its companion resolution \n     in the House of Representatives, which provide for \n     congressional disapproval and nullification of the National \n     Labor Relations Board's (NLRB or Board) rule related to \n     representation election procedures. This ``ambush'' election \n     rule is nothing more than the Board's attempt to placate \n     organized labor by effectively denying employees' access to \n     critical information about unions and stripping employers of \n     free speech and dues process rights. The rule poses a threat \n     to both employees and employers. We support S.J. Res. 36 and \n     its House companion and urge Congress to immediately pass \n     these much-needed resolutions, which will nullify the ambush \n     election proposal.\n       The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, a group of more \n     than 600 organizations, has been united in its opposition to \n     the so-called ``Employee Free Choice Act'' (EFCA) and EFCA \n     alternatives that pose a similar threat to workers, \n     businesses and the U.S. economy. Thanks to the bipartisan \n     group of elected officials who stood firm against this \n     damaging legislation, the threat of EFCA is less immediate \n     this Congress. Politically powerful labor unions, other EFCA \n     supporters, and their allies in government are not backing \n     down, however. Having failed to achieve their goals through \n     legislation, they are now coordinating with the Board and the \n     Department of Labor (DOL) in what appears to be an all-out \n     attack on job-creators and employees in an effort to enact \n     EFCA through administrative rulings and regulations.\n       On June 21, 2011, the Board proposed its ambush election \n     rule, which was designed to significantly speed up the \n     existing union election process and limit employer \n     participation in elections. At the time, Board Member Hayes \n     warned that ``the proposed rules will (1) shorten the time \n     between filing of the petition and the election date, and (2) \n     substantially limit the opportunity for full evidentiary \n     hearing or Board review on contested issues involving, among \n     other things, appropriate unit, voter eligibility, and \n     election misconduct.'' Hayes noted the effect would be to \n     ``stifle debate on matters that demand it.'' The Board \n     published a final rule on December 22, 2011, with an April \n     30, 2012 effective date. While it somewhat modified the \n     original proposal, the final rule is identical in purpose and \n     similar in effect to the proposal.\n       The NLRB's own statistics reveal the average time from \n     petition to election was 31 days, with over 90% of elections \n     occurring within 56 days. There is no indication that \n     Congress intended a shorter election time frame, and indeed, \n     based on the legislative history of the 1959 amendments to \n     the National Labor Relations Act, it is clear Congress \n     believed that an election period of at least 30 days was \n     necessary to adequately assure employees the ``fullest \n     freedom'' in exercising their right to choose whether they \n     wish to be represented by a union. As then Senator John F. \n     Kennedy Jr. explained, a 30-day period before any election \n     was a necessary ``safeguard against rushing employees into an \n     election where they are unfamiliar with the issues.'' Senator \n     Kennedy stated ``there should be at least a 30-day interval \n     between the request for an election and the holding of the \n     election'' and he opposed an amendment that failed to provide \n     ``at least 30 days in which both parties can present their \n     viewpoints.''\n       The current election time frames are not only reasonable, \n     but permit employees time to hear from both the union and the \n     employer and make an informed decision, which\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n     would not be possible under the ambush election rule. In \n     fact, in other situations involving ``group'' employee \n     issues, Congress requires that employees be given at least 45 \n     days to review relevant information in order to make a \n     ``knowing and voluntary'' decision. (This is required under \n     the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act when employees \n     evaluate whether to sign an age discrimination release in the \n     context of a program offered to a group or class of \n     employees.) Also, in many cases, employers, particularly \n     small ones, will not have enough time under the rule's time \n     frames to secure legal counsel, let alone an opportunity to \n     speak with employees about union representation or respond to \n     promises union organizers may have made to secure union \n     support, even though many of those promises may be completely \n     unrealistic. Given that union organizers typically lobby \n     employees for months outside the workplace without an \n     employer's knowledge, these ``ambush'' elections would often \n     result in employees' receiving only half the story. They \n     would hear promises of raises and benefits that unions have \n     no way of guaranteeing, without an opportunity for the \n     employer to explain its position and the possible \n     inaccuracies put forward by the union.\n       For these reasons, we thank you for introducing S.J. Res. \n     36 and its House companion and urge Congress to immediately \n     pass these much-needed resolutions. If left unchecked, the \n     actions of the NLRB will fuel economic uncertainty and have \n     serious negative ramifications for millions of employers, \n     U.S. workers they have hired or would like to hire, and \n     consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Geoffrey Burr,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I look forward to the opportunity to debate \nthis resolution on the floor, and I thank the Senators who have joined \nme as original cosponsors.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S.J. Res. 37. A joint resolution to disapprove a rule promulgated by \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency relating to \nemission standards for certain steam generating units; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to announce that I introduced a \nresolution of disapproval just a few minutes ago under the \nCongressional Review Act.\n  A lot of people don't know what the Congressional Review Act is, but \nit is an act that will allow Congress to look at some of the \nregulations. If there is something they don't believe is in the best \ninterest of the country, they are able to introduce something to \nrescind that. It would call for a vote, and the vote would be a 51-\nvote. So it is one that has not been used very much, but it is a \nmeasure that would prevent, in this case the Obama EPA, from going \nthrough with its Utility MACT.\n  MACT is the maximum achievable control technology. That is used quite \noften because there are sometimes requirements in these EPA rules that \nrequire different industries to do things where there is no technology \navailable to allow them to get that done. So the Utility MACT is one of \nthe most expensive environmental rules in American history, second only \nto President Obama's cap-and-trade rules, which he was unable to \nachieve legislatively. Left untouched, the Utility MACT would destroy \nover 1 million jobs and cost the American economy billions of dollars.\n  My CRA, the Congressional Review Act, will be the moment of truth for \na majority in this body who understand how harmful the Obama EPA \nregulatory agenda will be for their constituents. Remember, last year \nat this time 64 Senators voted in different ways to rein in the EPA's \ndestructive greenhouse gas regulations. I had a bill to take away the \njurisdiction from the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate \ngreenhouse gases. It was called the Energy Tax Prevention Act. At the \nsame time, there was another I call a cover vote. Sometimes when you \nwant to tell people at home that you are against something, you can \nhave a less maybe severe vote, and there happens to be a cover vote \nthat takes place.\n  The bottom line is 64 of the 100 Senators voted to do something about \nthe overregulation that is coming out of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. That particular one was on the regulation that would be the \nmost expensive of all.\n  The Utility MACT I am offering the CRA on now is probably the second \nmost expensive. But to refresh your memory, in order to have the EPA \nhave jurisdiction of the greenhouse gases, they had to somehow come up \nwith an endangerment finding. They did, and they based it on the IPCC \nscience that gave rise to the concern that was exposed in climategate. \nI think everyone understands that was flawed science. But, nonetheless, \nthat is what they used. That is why we were able to get two-thirds of \nthis body to object to the EPA regulating greenhouse gases.\n  I think the bottom line now is that there are more than a dozen \nSenate Democrats who have claimed they want to rein in the EPA because \nthey know the devastating impact the Agency's regulatory train wreck \nwill have at home. The Senators understand if their constituents lose \ntheir jobs as a result of these overregulations, they might lose their \njobs.\n  So today the Senate can look forward to having one more opportunity \nto stand up to President Obama's war on affordable energy. They can \nvote for this CRA which will put a halt to one of the Obama EPA's most \nexpensive and economically destructive rules.\n  Under the Utility MACT, it would cost American families--and nobody \ndisagrees with this--the range is between $11 billion and $18 billion \nin electricity rate increases. That is over an 11-percent rate increase \non average that it would cost if we were to pass this Utility MACT \nunder the regulations of the utilities. This would send ripple effects \nthroughout the economy, causing approximately 1.4 million net job \nlosses by 2020. And it is not just jobs in the coal industry that would \nbe affected.\n  Dr. Bernard Weinstein of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern \nMethodist University has estimated EPA's air rules could endanger 1 \nmillion manufacturing jobs outside of the coal and utility industry \nlosses. Workers recently laid off in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia \nare feeling the devastating impacts of the rule. Sadly, these lost jobs \nare all part of Obama's wider war on coal and fossil fuels.\n  You might remember that he admitted this was his goal in the campaign \nof 2008 when he said:\n\n       If somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant they can. \n     It's just that it will bankrupt them. And under my plan of a \n     cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily \n     skyrocket.\n\n  When the cap-and-trade failed, Obama began aggressively pursuing \nthese goals through an executive regulatory barrage of unelected \nbureaucrats. So companies such as Solyndra got big cash payoffs while a \nregulatory train wreck was unleashed by the EPA to destroy America's \nfossil fuel industry.\n  The political climate is much different now than it was in the days \nwhen global warming alarmists could bask in their historical gloom-and-\ndoom predictions about the end of the world. Now, President Obama \nwouldn't dare say anything like that because the American people no \nlonger are buying it. Instead, he has begun touting oil and gas \ndevelopment and saying he is for an all-out, all-of-the-above energy \nstrategy. In an election year, he knows the American people want the \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and affordable energy prices that come \nwith domestic oil and gas.\n  But he is clearly still determined to achieve his global warming \nagenda. His war on affordable energy is moving underneath the radar and \nwrapped in lies about protecting public health. Make no mistake, the \ntrain wreck will achieve all of Obama's global warming objectives, and \nit will severely undermine our Nation's economy in the process. So I \nwill spend just a moment on that.\n  When President Obama could not achieve cap-and-trade through \nlegislation, he said he would just do it through regulations. EPA's \ngreenhouse gas regime will cost American families between $300 billion \nand $400 billion a year. This is important because no one has refuted \nthis. We have gone through the Kyoto convention, and that was a range \nthat was given to us by the Wharton econometrics survey at that time. \nAnd several others chimed in--MIT chimed in, CRA chimed in. So the cost \nof regulating greenhouse gas\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nwould be about $300 billion to $400 billion a year.\n  When we talk about billions and trillions of dollars, I am like \neverybody else. I have a hard time seeing how that really affects us. \nIn my State of Oklahoma, I regularly determine each year how many \nfamilies in my State of Oklahoma are going to file a tax return, and \nthen I do the math. This particular one, at $300 billion a year, would \ncost each family filing a tax return in my State of Oklahoma about \n$3,000 a year. Now, that is not just once, that would be every year.\n\n  What do you get for it? And this is the thing that I think is \nimportant, and the American people finally have caught on. They have \nadmitted that through the EPA, when you ask them if we were to pass one \nof these things regulating CO2 through the cap-and-trade \nlegislation that we have defeated, would this reduce greenhouse gases, \nthe answer from the Administrator of the EPA is, no, it wouldn't \nbecause this only would affect the United States of America. This isn't \nwhere the problem is. China would still be doing its thing, India would \nbe doing its thing, and Mexico.\n  I have contended if we are regulating these in the United States, it \ncould actually have the effect of increasing the emissions because, as \nwe chase our manufacturing base overseas to find energy, they would be \ngoing to countries such as China and India where they don't have the \nregulatory restrictions we have in this country.\n  So the Utility MACT is second only to the greenhouse gas regulations \nin terms of what it would cost, in terms of costing the people in terms \nof jobs and money. Actually, the regulatory thing would be worse when \nwe are talking about greenhouse gases because under the bills that were \nintroduced starting in 2003--that was the McCain-Lieberman bill, going \nall the way forward to the Waxman-Markey bill--the assumption has been \nthat they would regulate industries and emitters that were over the \n25,000 tons a year.\n  Now, if we do it through regulation, as they are trying to do it \nright now, the Clean Air Act has a limit of 250 tons. So we would be \ntalking about regulating virtually every church, school, and hospital \nin America and not just the very large utilities. So that is where we \nwere on that issue.\n  On oil, President Obama has been congratulating himself on decreasing \nthe imports of oil from the Middle East, but he fails to mention his \npolicies have been consistently against oil and gas. In fact, he and \npeople in his administration have said they want to do away with fossil \nfuels. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said they wanted to ``boost the \nprice of gasoline to the levels in Europe.''\n  Well, that is $7 or $8 a gallon. Right now we are looking at $4 a \ngallon, and that is what they want to do. What is their motive? To do \naway with fossil fuels. He claims to care about energy security, yet he \nstopped the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I am very proud of a lot of Senators in here who have talked about \nit. Senator Hoeven, for example, is very familiar with it because of \nthe production in his State. We are talking about the sands up in \nAlberta and bringing them down through the United States. I am \ninterested in this because Cushing, OK, happens to be one of the \nintersections that is there for the pipeline.\n  So here is something there is absolutely no reason to do away with \nexcept to kill oil because we know the pipeline is going to bring oil \ndown into the United States through, I might say, my State of Oklahoma \ndown to the coast where it can be used. A lot of people don't \nunderstand this because they have been told things that, quite frankly, \nare not true.\n  In terms of oil, gas, and coal, the United States of America has the \nlargest recoverable reserves in the world. People keep saying over and \nover again: Well, we only have 3 percent of the reserves. Yet we use 25 \npercent. Quite frankly, they are talking about proven reserves. You \ncan't get a recoverable reserve until you drill. If they don't let us \ndrill because of the policies of this administration, then, obviously, \nwe would be stuck with just the very small amount we could produce. \nNonetheless, it is out there. We are the only country in the world that \nour politicians don't allow us to explore and recover our own \nreserves--the only country in the world.\n  Natural gas. We know it is happening right now. We know in areas like \nNew York and Pennsylvania with the Marcellus debate, we have \nopportunities we have never had in this country. We have the \nopportunity to recover more natural gas. When the President made a \nstatement in the State of the Union Message about being supportive of \n``all the above,'' talking about natural gas, he slipped in one little \nstatement: Well, we don't want to poison the Earth--or something like \nthat.\n  What he is talking about is they have spent countless hours trying to \nregulate a process called hydraulic fracturing--a process that started \nin my State of Oklahoma in 1949. There has never been a documented case \nof ground water contamination since they have been using hydraulic \nfracturing. And we can't get into these tight formations without \nhydraulic fracturing. It can't be done.\n  So the President can get by with saying he wants to produce the \nnatural gas we have locally, and at the same time take over the \nregulation of hydraulic fracturing by the Federal Government. We know \nwhat that would mean. I think the best evidence of that is President \nObama in his current budget is doubling the funding for the \nantifracking agenda in the 2013 budget. Nuclear? That is agreed. If we \nbelieve in ``all of the above,'' you have to have fossil fuel as coal, \noil, and gas, but also nuclear. It is a very important component. It is \ninteresting that only yesterday President Obama sent his Energy \nSecretary, Steven Chu, to Georgia, to take credit for the 5,800 jobs \nthat will be created when two new nuclear reactors are built there. As \nSecretary Chu said yesterday:\n\n       In his State of the Union Address, President Obama outlined \n     a blueprint for an American economy that is built to last and \n     develops every available source of American energy. Nuclear \n     power is an important part of that blueprint.\n\n  Yes, nuclear power is so important that President Obama forgot to \nmention it in his very long State of the Union message. To send \nSecretary Chu to Georgia is kind of ironic, given that Chu is the one \nwho said that nuclear power is the ``lesser of two evils.'' It was the \nPresident himself who designated a Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission who had been leading the antinuclear energy group for quite \nsome time. In fact, Chairman Jaczko tried to delay the progress on \nlicensing the very reactors in Georgia that they went up to try to take \ncredit for.\n  We see this over and over again.\n  What does this all mean? President Obama knows he needs to talk the \ntalk on domestic energy because people have caught on. I think people \nknow now that we have the recoverable reserves to be completely free \nfrom the Middle East. All we have to do in a short period of time is \ndevelop our own resources. I know my environmental friends are already \nsaying, about the CRA on the Utility MACT--the NRDC jumped on the story \ntoday with the headline ``Let Loose the Defenders of Mercury \nPoisoning.'' Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I remember in 2003 and 2005 when we had the Clear Skies bill. The \nClear Skies bill would have had mandatory reductions--keep in mind we \nare talking about 2003--mandatory reductions on mercury emissions by 70 \npercent by 2018. It was a matter of a few years from now, that would be \nreality. Think about it, 6 years from now we would already have a 70-\npercent reduction if the Democrats had not stopped the bill. The reason \nthey did is because we refused--we want to have SOX, \nNOX, and mercury, which are the real pollutants, reduced and \nreduced in a rapid fashion, faster than President Clinton or anybody \nelse has tried to do it. They held it hostage because they also wanted \nCO2 included in it, so we got none of the above as a result \nof it.\n  The EPA's Utility MACT is designed to destroy jobs by killing off the \ncoal industry. EPA admits itself that the Utility MACT rule would cost \nan unprecedented $11 billion to implement. Of course these costs will \ncome in the form of higher electricity rates for every American. \nImportantly, the EPA also admits that the $11 billion in costs will \nyield a mere $6 billion in direct benefits.\n  Do the math. It means the agency has by its own admission completely\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nfailed the cost-benefit test. It has the advantage of reducing \nemissions without killing jobs and the Utility MACT would do little for \nthe environment but destroy millions of jobs. Why did Clear Skies fail? \nAs I said, it was held hostage because they didn't want us to just lose \nSOX, NOX, and mercury, the real pollutants. They \nwanted to include CO2.\n  Before Obama's decision to halt the ozone rule, which would have put \nhundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, then-White House Chief of Staff \nBill Daley asked: What are the health impacts of unemployment?\n  That is a good question. What are the health impacts of skyrocketing \nelectricity rates which hurt the poor the most? What are the health \nimpacts on children whose parents will lose one of the 1.4 million jobs \nthat will be destroyed by the EPA's rules on powerplants?\n  The Senate needs to focus on promoting policies that improve our \nenvironment without harming our economy. The EPA's Utility MACT does \nthe opposite. My CRA, I think, is one of the things about which they \nsay: You will never get it done. I have criticized people for bringing \na Congressional Review Act up against regulations where I know the \nvotes are not there. It takes just 51 votes. The reason I think the \nvotes should be here now is if the people at home care enough to put \nthe pressure on. That is exactly what happened on the ozone \nrequirements. They said the President was committed to ozone changes. \nHe changed his mind because of that.\n  Remember the farm dust rule? The President was going to have a farm \ndust rule on emissions that would hit the air. I always remember, I had \na news conference in my State of Oklahoma, in the western part of the \nState. We had a couple of people there from Washington who had never \nbeen west of the Mississippi. We got down there in this area of \nOklahoma. We were talking about farm dust. I said: You see this brown \nstuff down here? That is dirt. You see that round green thing? That is \ncotton. Hold your finger up in the air--that is wind. Are there any \nquestions?\n  There is no technology to do that, yet the expense to each of my \nfarmers in a farm State like Oklahoma would have been hundreds of \nthousands of dollars a year and not accomplishing anything. We were \nable to get the public to write in to complain about that. As a result \nof that, the President pulled back.\n  I hope enough people are concerned about Utility MACT and its \ndevastating effect on our economy and on jobs in America that they will \njoin in and apply the pressure necessary to help the people in this \nChamber understand that we should pass this Congressional Review Act \nand do away with this particular, very harmful regulation that is \nbefore us.\n  I have often said--a lot of people do not understand this--but \nPresidents are the ones who put the budgets down every year. A lot of \ntimes they try to blame the House or Senate, Democrats or Republicans. \nNo. It doesn't matter. Who is in the White House, they are the ones who \ndetermine what the budget is. During the Bush years there was a total \nof $2 trillion of deficits in 8 years. However, after this budget came \nout last week, in the Obama 4 years the increase has been, in deficits, \n$5.3 trillion. That is $5.3 trillion in 4 years as opposed to $2 \ntrillion in 8 years.\n  As bad as that is, I contend that the regulations of this \nadministration are actually more expensive to the American people than \nservicing this debt. So I think it is important that we talk about \nthis, talk about not just Utility MACT but all of these. Utility MACT \nis where we should draw the line, however, because that is one that \ndirectly affects our ability to provide energy for America, for our \nmanufacturing jobs. We are right now a little bit under 50 percent \ndependent upon coal for our ability to run this machine called America. \nIf you do this, we would lose, it is anticipated, 20 percent of our \ngeneration capacity and that translates into a lot of money, as I have \nnoted.\n  That is what we have introduced today. I encourage my Democratic and \nRepublican colleagues to join us in passing the CRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S858-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S858-S859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 379--CONDEMNING VIOLENCE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA \n                       AGAINST THE SYRIAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nForeign Relations; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                              S.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 380\n\n       Whereas since at least the late 1980s, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and \n     well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities \n     to acquire nuclear capability;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding the full and \n     sustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities by the Iranian Government and its \n     full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     (IAEA) on all outstanding issues related to its nuclear \n     activities, particularly those concerning the possible \n     military dimensions of its nuclear program;\n       Whereas on November 8, 2011, the IAEA issued an extensive \n     report that--\n       (1) documents ``serious concerns regarding possible \n     military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'';\n       (2) states that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant \n     to the development of a nuclear device''; and\n       (3) states that the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) may be ongoing;\n       Whereas as of November 2008, Iran had produced, according \n     to the IAEA--\n       (1) approximately 630 kilograms of uranium-235 enriched to \n     3.5 percent; and\n       (2) no uranium-235 enriched to 20 percent;\n       Whereas as of November 2011, Iran had produced, according \n     to the IAEA--\n       (1) nearly 5,000 kilograms of uranium-235 enriched to 3.5 \n     percent; and\n       (2) 79.7 kilograms of uranium-235 enriched to 20 percent;\n       Whereas on January 9, 2011, IAEA inspectors confirmed that \n     the Iranian government had begun enrichment activities at the \n     Fordow site, including possibly enrichment of uranium-235 to \n     20 percent;\n       Whereas if Iran were successful in acquiring a nuclear \n     weapon capability, it would likely spur other countries in \n     the region to consider developing their own nuclear weapons \n     capabilities;\n       Whereas on December 6, 2011, Prince Turki al-Faisal of \n     Saudi Arabia stated that if international efforts to prevent \n     Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons fail, ``we must, as a \n     duty to our country and people, look into all options we are \n     given, including obtaining these weapons ourselves'';\n       Whereas top Iranian leaders have repeatedly threatened the \n     existence of the State of Israel, pledging to ``wipe Israel \n     off the map'';\n       Whereas the Department of State--\n       (1) has designated Iran as a ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' \n     since 1984; and\n       (2) has characterized Iran as the ``most active state \n     sponsor of terrorism'';\n       Whereas Iran has provided weapons, training, funding, and \n     direction to terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, \n     and Shiite militias in Iraq that are responsible for the \n     murders of hundreds of American forces and innocent \n     civilians;\n       Whereas on July 28, 2011, the Department of the Treasury \n     charged that the Government of Iran had forged a ``secret \n     deal'' with al Qaeda to facilitate the movement of al Qaeda \n     fighters and funding through Iranian territory;\n       Whereas in October 2011, senior leaders of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force were implicated \n     in a terrorist plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Ambassador \n     to the United States on United States soil;\n       Whereas on December 26, 2011, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the serious human \n     rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     including torture, cruel and degrading treatment in \n     detention, the targeting of human rights defenders, violence \n     against women, and ``the systematic and serious restrictions \n     on freedom of peaceful assembly'' as well as severe \n     restrictions on the rights to ``freedom of thought, \n     conscience, religion or belief'';\n       Whereas President Obama, through the P5+1 process, has made \n     repeated efforts to engage the Iranian Government in dialogue \n     about Iran's nuclear program and its international \n     commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n       Whereas on March 31, 2010, President Obama stated that the \n     ``consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran are unacceptable'';\n       Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, \n     2012, President Obama stated: ``Let there be no doubt: \n     America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \n     weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve \n     that goal'';\n       Whereas Secretary of Defense Panetta stated, in December \n     2011, that it was unacceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear \n     weapons, reaffirmed that all options were on the table to \n     thwart Iran's nuclear weapons efforts, and vowed that if the \n     United States gets ``intelligence that they are proceeding \n     with developing a nuclear weapon then we will take whatever \n     steps necessary to stop it'';\n       Whereas the Defense Department's January 2012 Strategic \n     Guidance stated that U.S. defense efforts in the Middle East \n     would be aimed ``to prevent Iran's development of a nuclear \n     weapons capability and counter its destabilizing policies'';\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that it is a vital national interest of the \n     United States to prevent the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability;\n       (2) warns that time is limited to prevent the Iranian \n     government from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability;\n       (3) urges continued and increasing economic and diplomatic \n     pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran to secure an \n     agreement from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     that includes--\n       (A) the full and sustained suspension of all uranium \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities;\n       (B) complete cooperation with the IAEA on all outstanding \n     questions related to Iran's nuclear activities, including--\n       (i) the implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     Additional Protocol; and\n       (ii) the verified end of Iran's ballistic missile programs; \n     and\n       (C) a permanent agreement that verifiably assures that \n     Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful;\n       (4) expresses support for the universal rights and \n     democratic aspirations of the Iranian people;\n       (5) strongly supports United States policy to prevent the \n     Iranian Government from acquiring nuclear weapons capability;\n       (6) rejects any United States policy that would rely on \n     efforts to contain a nuclear weapons-capable Iran; and\n       (7) urges the President to reaffirm the unacceptability of \n     an Iran with nuclear-weapons capability and oppose any policy \n     that would rely on containment as an option in response to \n     the Iranian nuclear threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/16/senate-section/article/S859-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1663.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate \n     System connecting all States is near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what \n     is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any fiscal year \n     that the aggregate amount required to carry out \n     transportation programs and projects under this Act and \n     amendments made by this Act exceeds the estimated aggregate \n     amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for those programs \n     and projects for the fiscal year, each amount made available \n     for such a program or project shall be reduced by the pro \n     rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate amount \n     required to carry out those programs and projects to an \n     amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 4.
