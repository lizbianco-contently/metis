The objection having been heard, \nthe bills will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                       Commemorating September 11\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just a short way from this Chamber, in S-\n209, we have been meeting for many years as a Senate Democratic \nleadership to discuss the issues of the week. We just finished a \nmeeting there, and part of the discussion today in that meeting was \nwhat happened 11 years ago at the exact same time we were meeting \nthere. I can remember that so clearly. I will never, ever forget that. \nIt is implanted in my mind so clearly. I was the first one to get to \nthat meeting, and Senator Breaux from Louisiana came in and said: There \nis something going on in New York. Let's turn on the TV. And we did. \nSenators started coming in. It appeared an airplane hit one of the \ntowers, and we were wondering why it would have done that. Something \nwas obviously wrong.\n  Senator Daschle was the leader at the time. He started the meeting, \nand the TV was off. The meeting was just getting started, and someone \ncame in to take Senator Daschle out of that meeting. He came back very \nquickly and said: There is a plane headed for the Capitol, and we all \nhave to evacuate the Capitol--everybody. The alarm went out and people \nwere rushing down these halls leaving. I can remember leaving that room \nover here and looking out the window and seeing the smoke billowing \nfrom what we\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\nlearned is now the Pentagon. It was on fire; a plane had hit it. There \nwas still one plane in the air, and that was headed for the Capitol. As \nI have indicated, even though that was 11 years ago, I remember the \nsight as if it were yesterday. We have many meetings in that room, and \nI often think of what transpired that morning as I looked out toward \nthe Pentagon.\n  Over the last decade, our country has begun to heal from the wounds \nof that terrible, terrible attack. It was attacks by terrorists. The \nscars remain. The scars are deeper with some than others, but no matter \nhow many years pass, we will never forget the thousands of innocent \npeople who died in New York, Pennsylvania, and across the river here in \nVirginia. There were mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers \nand sisters, spouses and friends. All they were doing was their jobs, \nand others were just catching a plane to go visit loved ones or on a \nbusiness trip. It is good that we pause each year to pay tribute and to \nremember, and that will occur here on the Senate floor, as I previously \nannounced. There will also be a ceremony out in front of the Capitol.\n  The memories of that dark day in our shared history are painful, but \nthey give me hope as well. They give me hope because on September 11 \nand during the difficult months that followed, Americans showed the \nworld that our unified Nation can fight back against darkness and fear. \nDemocrats were not alone in fighting back. Republicans were not alone \nin fighting back. We were all fighting back together in the face of \ngreat evil, and that is what it was. There were so many who rushed \nforward to show great courage, enormous dignity, and kindness.\n  Today we pause to remember the firefighters who rushed into the World \nTrade Center knowing they might never come out, and a lot of them \ndidn't come out. We pause to remember the police officers and rescue \nworkers who hurried to the scene, combed through the debris, and \nshepherded New Yorkers to safety. Some of them gave their lives that \nday. We pause to remember the bravery of the members of our Nation's \nArmed Forces, our intelligence community, and Foreign Service, as well \nas the sacrifices of their families. They have borne the burdens of war \nfor more than a decade. They have given their blood, sweat, and too \noften their lives in the effort to crush al-Qaida, bring Osama bin \nLaden to justice, and keep America safe. We pause to remember the \nunbreakable spirit of those valiant people and certainly the United \nStates of America.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            9/11 Remembrance\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the course of a lifetime, one always \nremembers those moments of national grief and anxiety. They don't \nhappen very often. From my parents' generation, it was: Where were you \nwhen you heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor? When I was a \nyoung man and my friend the majority leader was a young man, it was: \nWhere were you when you heard about the assassination of President \nKennedy? For the current generation, it was, of course: Where were you \nwhen you heard about 9/11?\n  As the majority leader has indicated, it was for us here at the \nCapitol kind of close up and personal, if you will. I recall being late \nthat morning, and as a result of not yet having gotten to work, I saw, \nas millions of Americans did, the second plane go into the second \nbuilding in real time. As the majority leader has indicated, the \nbuilding was subsequently evacuated. People scattered around town, and \nat the end of this horrendous and frightening day, we all gathered on \nthe steps of the Capitol to sing ``God Bless America.'' It was one of \nthe most uplifting and unifying moments in the history of our country. \nI think it is safe to say that we are, as a nation, even though we have \nour political differences, together and stronger in the wake of what \nhappened.\n  In what is now a time-honored tradition, later this morning we will \ngather on the Capitol steps to mark a solemn anniversary of the 9/11 \nattacks. It is fitting that we remember the thousands of innocent men \nand women who died that morning 11 years ago and that despite our \npolitical differences, we remember the unity and resolve we all felt \nthat day. In the days and weeks that followed the horrific attacks on \nour homeland, we were united by a common grief and outrage. Some \nwondered what the future would bring, but 11 years later I think I can \nsay that America is stronger than it was on 9/11.\n  Today we honor the sacrifice of those who died that day and the \nmillions who have stepped forward to defend the Nation in the Armed \nForces and intelligence services in the years since, especially those \nwho have given their lives in that service. On 9/11 we showed the world \nthat America does not shrink from a challenge, and every day since \ncourageous men and women have humbled us through their courage and \nsacrifice on our behalf. Today is the day to show them our deep \ngratitude and to renew our commitment to live lives worthy of their \nsacrifice.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                            Morning Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the next hour will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is difficult to come to the floor of \nthe Senate on this anniversary of 9/11 and not reflect on your own \nexperience. I was in the same room as the majority leader, Harry Reid, \njust a few steps from the Senate Chamber when we witnessed the second \nplane on television crashing into the World Trade Center and realized \nit was no accident, and then the black smoke billowing over the Mall \nfrom the Pentagon suggested we were under attack.\n  As we evacuated this building and rushed outside, standing, the crowd \naround, not knowing which way to turn, was looking for a safe place to \ngo. No one knew. Some tourists came up to me and said: We are new here. \nWhere are we supposed to go next? There was no place to tell them to \ngo. We knew Union Station was nearby and the Metro station not far \naway, but there was no other place to turn.\n\n  I might add parenthetically that the decision was made shortly \nthereafter to build the Visitor Center. It took us years to do it. It \nis an underground facility which is safe and I am glad we have it. It \nhas been used every single day and is an important addition to the \nCapitol.\n  President George W. Bush faced that extraordinary challenge as \nCommander in Chief and President of the United States to deal with 9/\n11. There were some aspects of his response which I may have disagreed \nwith, but I certainly commend him still for his leadership in that \nanxious moment after the tragedy of 9/11. I especially wish to thank \nhim and commend him for reminding us time and time again when he was \nPresident that our enemies are not the people of the Islamic religion \nnor those of the Sikh religion; our enemies are those who corrupt \nreligion in the name of terrorism.\n  Many people of the Muslim faith in America--good, patriotic \nAmericans--face discrimination simply because those who were \nperpetrators of 9/11 claim to have shared that religion. It is a good \nday to be reminded of the thoughtful leadership of George W. Bush in \ntelling us our enemy is not Islam; our enemies are those who corrupt \nthe religion in the name of terrorism.\n  I also received a note over August from two friends of mine who live \nin New Bern, NC, Ed and Beth Edmundson. I met them several years ago in \nChicago when their son Eric, who is a veteran of the U.S. Army and \nserved in Iraq, was hospitalized in that city. What a story. Eric \nEdmundson had been serving our country and was injured. During the \ncourse of his injuries and subsequent treatment, he became \nquadriplegic. After months and months of effort, the Veterans' \nAdministration basically told his family there was no place to turn. \nThey said to his father: You are going to have to buy him a wheelchair \nand find a place for him in a nursing home facility. Eric was a young \nman, obviously, and married with a little baby at home. His dad and mom \nshowed the kind of courage and love which touches our hearts.\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\n  Ed Edmundson said: My son, in his twenties, is not going into a \nnursing home. I will not let it happen. I am going to find a place that \nwill treat him.\n  He ended up finding on his own the Rehabilitation Institute of \nChicago, which is one of the best hospitals in the world. Eric was a \npatient there, going through rehabilitation from his injuries he \nsuffered in Iraq. That is when I met his parents. They invited me to \ncome see him. I did, and I promised I would return. I did a few weeks \nlater just to visit, and they said: Eric has a gift for you. Eric, who \nwould smile but didn't speak, was sitting in his wheelchair. His father \nand mother came over to his side, each grabbed an elbow, stood him up, \nand Eric took three steps. It was an amazing, emotional moment without \na dry eye in that hospital room. They put him back in his wheelchair \nand his dad said: My son is going to walk out of this hospital in his \nfull dress uniform. He said: Can you make it? We would like to have you \nthere. I said: I wouldn't miss it. Many of us were there. The mayor of \nthe city of Chicago, many elected officials, and all the news cameras \nwere there to watch this heroic young man walk out of the Rehab \nInstitute of Chicago--just a few steps--but in his full dress uniform \nwith a smile on his face. He went home to New Bern, NC. His father \nliterally left his business, the father and mother moved in with Eric, \nhis wife, and baby and tried to make a life for him. The wonderful \norganizations and people in that community built a home that was \nwheelchair accessible for the whole family. I went to visit him there \nin North Carolina. They were taking Eric hunting. He was involved in \nmany things in rehabilitation. They sent a card, a family card with \npictures of all of them, and it is a joy to see it.\n  One of the last things Eric's father asked me to do was to look at a \npiece of legislation Hillary Clinton introduced but was not passed. It \nwas called the Caregivers Act. The Caregivers Act said if a disabled \nveteran comes home and has the loving care of a member of the family \nand can stay home, we should try to help that member of the family by \nproviding them with the training they need to take care of their \ndisabled vet at home, give them a respite with visiting nurses or \npeople from the VA so they can have some time to themselves, and if \nthere is an economic hardship on the family, give them a monthly \nstipend so they can continue in their home.\n  I called Senator Clinton and asked her if I could take up the bill \nnow that she was off to the State Department. She said: Please do. I \ndid. Thanks to the great support of Senator Danny Akaka and Senator Pat \nMurray, we passed it. The Caregivers Act is now helping literally \nhundreds of family caregivers across the United States care for their \ndisabled veteran at home. It is helping the Edmundson family and other \nfamilies I have met in Illinois.\n  I tell that story because when we talk of the real cost of 9/11, it \nis not only the massive tragedy of the lives that were lost on that day \nand the families affected by those lives and those wonderful first \nresponders who risked and gave their lives, but it is also the lives of \nthe men and women in uniform who served us well, many of whom are \ncarrying the scars of war for the rest of their lives--a lifetime--who \nstill will always need our commitment and further devotion to make sure \nthey are taken care of. The Edmundson family in North Carolina comes to \nmind immediately and so many others just like them as a reminder of \nwhat we need to do, the obligations we have as a government to the \npeople who have served us so well in the military.\n  We have a bill that is coming up and I hope we can, in that same \nspirit, consider it on a bipartisan basis and pass it. It is an effort \nto give returning veterans a better chance to get a job. It is a \ndisappointment--more than that, it is a disgrace--that many of these \nveterans come home and find themselves unemployed and sometimes even \nhomeless. This Veterans Job Corps Act, which is coming before the \nSenate this afternoon, should pass with an overwhelming vote. This bill \nis fully paid for, and it is a bill Senator Murray has brought to the \nfloor along with the leadership of Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who \nhas been especially dedicated to this proposal.\n  President Obama first mentioned it in his State of the Union Address. \nIt includes several veterans employment initiatives such as the \nimproved one-stop shop centers for job searching and smoother State \ncertification and licensing. It authorizes $1 billion for the Veterans \nJob Corps over 5 years and $900 million to employ 20,000 veterans in \nconservation resource management, historic preservation projects and \npublic lands, and $100 million for COPS and SAFER grants to hire \nveterans to serve in capacities as police and firemen. Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans are given preference for all these positions.\n\n  The bill creates a pilot program to improve veteran job searches by \nproviding veterans with access to the Internet and computers to assist \nthem. It also provides military transition assistance programs to \neligible veterans and their spouses at sites outside military \ninstallations to make it easier to find a job. Rather than the current \nuneven State-by-State approach, the bill requires all States, as a \ncondition for receiving veteran employment and training funding, to \nconsider military training and experience when granting State \ncertifications and licensing.\n  How many times have we heard about this? I sure have. Someone who \nserved in the military, driven vehicles, been involved in some \ntechnical capacity, and then they come out and have to start from \nscratch, all over again, in each of our States to qualify for \ncertification for a good-paying job. Let's take into account that they \nhave been trained by the best military in the world and give them \ncredit for the experience and training they have in the military and \nthis bill does that.\n  Also, the VA will ensure each State receives funding for at least one \ndisabled veterans outreach program specialist and one local veterans \nunemployment representative for every 5,000 square miles. That is not \ntoo much. It is too little, frankly, but it is an important start.\n  This bill is paid for and it is a good bill. I hope we can pass it \nthis afternoon in the spirit of 9/11, remembering, sadly, the victims \nwho lost their lives that day and the first responders who gave \neverything they could give to try to save them; but also remembering \nthose men and women, many of whom were inspired by 9/11 to enlist in \nour military, to risk their lives--and many gave their lives--over \n6,500 to date. It is a reminder that we have an ongoing moral \nobligation to stand behind those veterans.\n  I might also add there is a lot of talk about the deficit and cutting \nspending, and I know that has to happen. I was on the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission and I understood that if we are going to bring our deficit \nunder control, we have to cut spending, look to real entitlement \nreform, and raise revenue. If we don't do all three, then, frankly, we \nwill not achieve our goal.\n  We have seen a budget proposed by the House Republican budget leader, \nCongressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican nominee for Vice \nPresident, which, unfortunately, does not reach that goal because he \npreserves tax cuts for the highest income people in this country \ninstead of asking for some sacrifice, some effort that they pay their \nfair share. He extends spending in the Department of Defense at beyond \nwartime levels, despite the fact that President Obama has successfully \nbrought the war in Iraq to a close and is doing the same in \nAfghanistan. We can't do those two things and reach real deficit \nreduction in a meaningful way and in a timely way. Unfortunately, \nCongressman Ryan's budget does not pass the basic test of arithmetic.\n  When we consider important spending such as this veterans job corps \nbill, I hope we find ways to pay for them to offset, and that when we \ntalk about deficit reduction, we never do it at the expense of our \nveterans and we never do it at the expense of our national security. I \nhope we do it honestly, acknowledging the fact that when it comes to \nthe Pentagon, there are areas where we can save money and not \ncompromise our security in any way whatsoever.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for presiding at this historic moment. \nI will mention that at 11 o'clock the House and Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans will gather on the east front for the commemoration of the \n9/11 anniversary. We will be in session on the floor. I will be here \nasking for a moment of\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\nsilence as they will at the same time outside.\n  It is a somber day in Washington as we recall this great national \ntragedy, but it is a day of great hope because we saw how America \nresponded on a bipartisan basis and the great people who stepped \nforward and showed such extraordinary acts of courage since that day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I return to the Senate floor to \npick up where I left off when Congress adjourned 1 month ago and that \nis to continue with my daily efforts to urge this Congress, our \nCongress, the House and the Senate, to extend the wind production tax \ncredit. I rise before the Senate to discuss an industry that has \ncreated tens of thousands of good-paying jobs for American workers and \nhas contributed billions of dollars--literally billions of dollars--to \nour economy.\n  I think the Presiding Officer knows this, and all our colleagues \nshould know this: This is an industry that will be in grave trouble if \nwe in the Congress don't act soon--I actually mean immediately--to \nextend the wind production tax credit.\n  We return this week to Congress in the wake of really sobering news \nabout recent layoffs of American workers in our wind industry, largely \ndue to our congressional inaction on the wind production tax credit.\n  I want to be very clear: The wind industry has already begun firing \nAmerican workers because we have failed to extend the wind production \ntax credit. It is that simple. You ask: Why? Well, the PTC has been a \ndriver of the wind industry's enormous expansion in the United States, \nas well as the growing investment in American workers that we have seen \nin the last several years. This critical tax credit expires at the end \nof the year, and if we do not vote to extend it, manufacturing \nfacilities may shut down, thousands more Americans will lose their \njobs, and the negative economic ripple effect--this is not a positive \nripple effect; this is a negative ripple effect--will be felt in \ncommunities all across our Nation.\n  Now, let me be clear in a further way. It has already happened; this \nis not conjecture. In my home State of Colorado, workers who had good-\npaying jobs in the wind industry just a month ago when I stood here no \nlonger do. That is right. Over 100 Coloradans were let go of their jobs \nin the Colorado wind industry just in the last month. There are more \njob losses projected to follow. That is sobering to all of us.\n  On a more upbeat note, I come to the floor to talk about the \nproduction tax credit, and each time I have come to the floor I focus \non a particular State because there is good news all across our country \nwhen it comes to wind energy. Today I want to focus on Vermont where \nthe wind industry has grown faster than in many larger States. As a \nmatter of fact, Vermont has the second highest rate of new wind \ninstallations of any State in 2011, growing over 650 percent. That is \nright, 650 percent growth in Vermont.\n  Vermont has numerous installed wind projects and wind manufacturing \nsites throughout the State that currently power over 11,000 homes and \nenough wind power potential to provide 160 percent of the State's \ncurrent electricity needs.\n  One of America's leading wind energy production companies is NRG \nSystems, which is based in Chittenden County, which is up in the \nnorthwestern corner of Vermont. For 30 years, NRG Systems has been a \nfixture in Vermont's energy and technology industry, and it serves the \nwind industry in particular by providing developers, utilities, and \nturbine manufacturers with the tools they need to measure the wind. But \nwith the looming end of the PTC, NRG's future growth in Vermont is \nuncertain.\n  This is very clear because for the first time in their history, NRG \nhas had to lay off workers in Vermont, not once but twice this year. \nTheir very capable CEO, Jan Blittersdorf, described these firings as \n``deeply unfortunate, though necessary . . . to preserve our future in \nthe face of a deeply unstable wind-energy industry.''\n  NRG's orders are off 50 percent from just a few years ago because of \nour inaction. The uncertainty about wind energy's future has encouraged \nthem to look overseas for new opportunities, which then means we hasten \nthe departure of good-paying jobs for skilled American workers who \nalready are ready to go.\n  So the point I am trying to make--and I see my colleague from Vermont \nhas joined me; I look forward to hearing his remarks--the wind industry \nneeds certainty. NRG is an example of a company that needs certainty. \nWe can lead the world in sustainable, smart energy, but we have to \nextend the PTC to stay on track.\n  As I have said for all these weeks I have been coming to the floor, \nthis is not just about my home State of Colorado. I love my State of \nColorado. I think we are the best State in the Union. But our country \nat large is threatened by the broad losses of jobs if we do not extend \nthe production tax credit.\n  I am not going to stand by idly and observe the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. I do not want to cede the leadership in the clean energy \nfuture to any of our foreign competitors. That is why I keep coming \nback day after day to urge my colleagues to work with me to pass the \nproduction tax credit.\n  It is pretty simple. The production tax credit equals jobs. We ought \nto pass it as soon as possible. It is common sense. We have support \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  I mentioned my great friend, Senator Sanders. He has joined me. I \nalso want to mention the esteemed chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe senior Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders' colleague, was unable \nto join us this morning, but he is a strong supporter of the PTC, and \nhe will be making a statement as well.\n  So let me close by urging all of us, as soon as possible, to extend \nthe wind production tax credit. Let's not let party affiliation or \npartisan politics interfere with what is right. Without the wind PTC, \nmore Americans will be out of work, and we will have further neglected \nour duty to pass commonsense policies that help American workers build \na better future for themselves and their families. Every day we do not \nact is a day that more companies like NRG Systems in Vermont are forced \nto lay off workers in our country. These companies are then looking \noverseas for better opportunities. That is just flat-out unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I conclude. I want my colleagues to know I will be \nback on the floor tomorrow to talk further about this opportunity but \nalso this threat. I will be back to talk about jobs, our economy, the \nneed for America to lead in the clean energy space, and the need for \nCongress to take action today.\n  I thank the ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore for his attention.\n  Again, I want to acknowledge the great leadership of my friend from \nVermont. I look forward to hearing his remarks on this important \nproduction tax credit.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Mark \nUdall for his continued focus on ensuring that Congress extends the \nproduction tax credit. Senator Udall has been down on the Senate floor \ntime after time after time on this important issue, and we all owe him \na deep debt of gratitude. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I also want to thank him for his very kind words about the NRG \ncompany. We hope when the Senator visits us in Vermont, he will see it. \nThey are a cutting-edge company. They are an extraordinary company, and \nwe are very proud of the work they have done and are doing, and we are \ncognizant of the problems they are facing today, the layoffs they have \nhad to experience because Congress has not passed the production tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this important incentive, the production \ntax\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\ncredit, moves us forward in a direction that we must go in terms of \nproducing safe, sustainable energy by providing a 2.2-cent-per-\nkilowatt-hour incentive for wind energy produced.\n  Let's be very clear--and I think a lot of people, perhaps, in \nCongress and certainly all over the country do not fully grasp this. I \nthink some people still think wind is some kind of cute fringe \ntechnology which is not very significant in the United States of \nAmerica. So let's be very clear: Wind accounts for 35 percent of all \nnew electric-generating capacity installed in our country over the last \n5 years, more new electricity capacity during that time than nuclear \nand coal combined. Let me repeat that. Wind accounts for 35 percent of \nall new electric-generating capacity installed in our country over the \nlast 5 years. This is not some untested fringe technology; it is \nmainstream.\n  Wind today is producing electricity at very competitive rates. \nAccording to the Department of Energy, wind is producing electricity \nfrom between 4 to 7 cents per kilowatt hour. That happens to be far \ncheaper than electricity produced by new nuclear plants. Today the \nUnited States has over 48,000 megawatts of wind, and Texas alone has \nover 10,000 megawatts. Iowa and South Dakota have achieved the \nmilestone of getting 20 percent or more of their electricity from wind. \nOnce again, this is not a fringe technology. This is a technology that \nis growing and is cost effective.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are home to leading wind companies such as \nNorthern Power in Barre and NRG Systems in Hinesburg. These companies \nsell wind energy products globally and create good-paying jobs in the \nState of Vermont. The wind industry supports over 470 manufacturing \nplants nationally and some 78,000 jobs from one end of our country to \nthe other.\n  If Congress fails to act on the wind tax credit, we could see a \nhemorrhaging of some 37,000 wind energy jobs in the next year. We have \nalready seen wind job losses in Vermont due in part to the uncertainty. \nIf one opposes the production tax credit, this is what they are saying \nto construction workers who want to build wind farms next year: Sorry; \nyou are out of work. In the middle of this severe recession, we should \nnot be saying that.\n  Those opposing the wind credit say Congress should ``not pick winners \nand losers.'' Unfortunately, for many decades, for better or for worse, \nCongress has picked winners and losers. That is just the simple \nreality. One big winner is the fossil fuel industry, which is set to \nreceive over $113 billion in subsidies over the next 10 years. So when \nfolks come to the floor and say: We do not want to pick winners and \nlosers, we do not want to give tax breaks and tax credits for wind or \nsolar, the truth is that in a 10-year period, the fossil fuel industry \nwill receive over $113 billion in subsidies.\n  These subsidies include rather incredible loopholes, such as allowing \nBP to take a tax writeoff for the cost of cleaning up their disastrous \noilspill in the gulf. Many of these tax subsidies for Big Oil and coal \ncorporations never phase out and never expire.\n  Another big winner in terms of support from the Federal Government is \nthe nuclear power industry. They get tens of billions of dollars in \nFederal research and development. They get risky multibillion-dollar \nFederal loan guarantees for new plants, and they get the Federal Price-\nAnderson liability insurance program, which has been conveniently \nextended for over a half a century.\n  I raise these points to suggest that what we are asking for is fairly \nmodest compared to what the fossil fuel industry and the nuclear power \nindustry receive. It is absurd that Congress continues huge subsidies \nfor the fossil fuel industry, for the nuclear power industry, and yet \nis resisting providing support for safe and sustainable energy such as \nwind.\n  If we are serious about job creation and putting construction workers \nback to work, if we are serious about reversing global warming and \ncutting back on greenhouse gas emissions, we must be investing in the \ngrowing sustainable energy sector. At a modest cost compared to the \nhuge subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear, an extension of the \nproduction tax credit can provide wind energy companies the certainty \nthey need to invest in job creation in America.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Udall for his excellent work and his \nleadership on this issue. I look forward to working with him and all of \nmy colleagues so that we extend the production tax credit and create a \nmore level playing field for sustainable energy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, 11 years ago this morning, September 11, \n2001, nearly 3,000 of our citizens lost their lives in a senseless act \nof terrorism that would change the course of America forever. That \nfateful Tuesday morning changed the way we think about life in America. \nIt changed the way we travel. It changed the way we govern. It changed \nall of our lives, with some, of course, sacrificing much more than \nothers.\n  From the first responders who ran into the crumbling buildings and \nwreckage 11 years ago today to the Navy Seals who brought bin Laden to \njustice, to the thousands of men and women in uniform who continue to \ndefend our freedom, countless Americans and their loved ones have \nserved and sacrificed in the fight against terrorism for now more than \na decade.\n  The tragic events of September 11 have also resulted in a more \nvigilant Nation and a more prepared and proactive defense and security \noperation for the American people. The attack highlighted several \nvulnerabilities across State and Federal Government that had been \nignored for too long, and many of those have been addressed and \nremedied.\n  In the aftermath of this tragedy, Congress put aside political \npartisanship and worked together with the administration and its \ndepartments to strengthen our national security and intelligence \nefforts. Yet today we face another major potential attack on our \ncountry different from those we faced before, but just as dangerous and \nthreatening.\n  It is not a hijacked plane or a bomb, although that remains a \nsignificant threat, but it is rather a cyber attack, an attack using \nthe interconnected Internet that governs some of our most critical \ninfrastructure. This type of an attack comes across the wire or through \nthe air targeting a system and taking it down, which would have a \ndramatic impact on our country.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know that the \nthreat of a cyber attack is real and far reaching. A major attack on \nour cyber systems could shut down our critical infrastructure, our \nfinancial systems, our communications systems, our electric grids, \npowerplants, water treatment centers, transportation systems, \nrefineries, and other interconnected critical infrastructure that \nallows us to run our economy and protect the safety of Americans.\n  Every day American businesses are victims of cyber intrusions. The \nthreat and sophistication of these attacks is growing as we speak. \nEarlier this year FBI Director Robert Mueller warned that, in the near \nfuture, ``the cyber threat will pose the number one threat to our \ncountry.''\n  The reason I came here today, in addition to acknowledging the \nsacrifices of those that were made on September 11 and the sacrifices \nthat have been made by tens of thousands if not millions of Americans \nsince then and the kind of effort that has been put in place that will \nhopefully prevent us from such an attack in the future, is to address a \nfailure on the part of this Congress and administration to respond to \nthis most imminent and threatening attack through our cyber network.\n  The week before the August recess, particularly in an election year, \nwill, of course, be filled with partisanship here in Washington. But we \nhit a low point this year in adjourning for the August recess as we \nrushed to vote to consider a cyber bill, which did not convey the \nwishes of any of us who had worked for weeks and months to try to put \nsomething together that could gain bipartisanship and consensus.\n  I voted to move forward with the bill, despite my concerns with the \nlegislation, so we could keep it alive over the August recess and \nreturn here with this session reopening in September to address this \nthreat. With precious few weeks left before the election and the \nprecious few weeks left after the election and before the end of the \nyear, I\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\ndid not believe we could possibly leave here without putting the \nprotections in place that are necessary to provide adequate defenses \nagainst a cyber attack on our critical infrastructure.\n  One-fifth of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, met every \nday for weeks to iron out our differences on this cyber security \nlegislation. We recognized that our national security was at stake. And \ndespite some genuine disagreements, we all participated because we \nthought we could find--and had to find--common ground; not just common \nground among the two political parties, but common ground between \nindustry and government as well.\n  Industry plays a critical role in this effort. With the active \nparticipation of 20 Senators representing both parties and key \ncommittees of jurisdiction, we came close. Unfortunately, politics \nthrew a wrench in our plans before a negotiated settlement was reached. \nI remain hopeful, though, and I plan to keep working with my colleagues \nto find the right balance between government and industry, standards \nand incentives, free markets and national security.\n  I was frustrated to discover that after sitting on the sidelines \nrather than working with Congress on this critical debate, the \nPresident had signaled his desire to regulate cyber security by \nexecutive fiat. No one can do this alone--not one party, not \ngovernment, or industry, and certainly not by executive order, which on \nits best day cannot begin to provide the robust incentives and \ninformation sharing required to achieve sufficient collaboration.\n  Congress must act to add cyber to its to-do list. I recognize that \nCongress and this administration have a long list of remaining items to \naddress before the end of the year: the Defense authorization bill, the \nlooming so-called Taxmageddon, which includes the scheduled increase in \nthe current income tax rates, the alternative minimum tax patch, the \nestate tax, the research and development tax credit, other tax \nextenders, the fix for physician Medicare reimbursement, the impact of \nthe across-the-board cuts through sequestration, and another impending \ndebt ceiling. All of this is before us with just a little bit of time \nleft. But what needs to be near the top or at the top of this list is \ncyber security legislation that provides flexibility, preserves \npersonal liberties, and protects our country from a widespread cyber \nattack. Let's learn from the lessons of September 11 and not wait for a \nmajor strike before we act.\n  Let's work together, Democrats and Republicans, Congress and the \nWhite House, government and the private sector, to make our country a \nsafer, more prosperous place. I urge my colleagues to continue to work \nin a bipartisan manner to bring forward a responsible and balanced \ncyber security bill. The responsibility falls on all of us. We know \nthis threat is ongoing and real. We know we need to act. And rather \nthan acting alone, I call on the President to join with the Members of \nthis Chamber and work together to do the right thing, to cast aside \npartisanship and put the security of our country above political \nsecurity.\n  There is a lot of focus and emphasis on the election that lies before \nus. That is natural. But when we are facing a threat as imminent and as \npotential and as real as this, we must do everything we can to \ntranscend the politics of the day, and to look at the policy that needs \nto be put in place to make our country safer and protect our citizens.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nMoment of Silence to Observe the Eleventh Anniversary of the Attacks on \n                          September, 11, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nobserve a moment of silence in recognition of the 11th anniversary of \nthe attacks on September 11, 2001.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment, the majority leader, \nSenator Harry Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, \nare gathered on the east front steps of the U.S. Capitol along with \nMembers of the House of Representatives. It is a bipartisan gathering \nto commemorate the 11th anniversary of the terrible tragedy of 9/11.\n  On that date the gathering was more spontaneous but reflected a \nfeeling of unity, which all of us felt in light of that national \ntragedy. Toward the end of that gathering 11 years ago, Senator Barbara \nMikulski suggested that Members sing ``God Bless America,'' and they \ndid. Today, during the course of this ceremony, there will be a moment \nof silence, prayer, as well as the singing of ``God Bless America'' to \ncelebrate the great effort that has been made by so many to keep \nAmerica safe and to mourn the loss of those who lost their lives on 9/\n11.\n  We remember today all of those who were lost and all those who \nsuffered in the terrorist attacks on America. In their honor may we \nwork to keep alive that sense of unity we felt on that day, and may we \ndo our best to serve the loved ones they left and the Nation they \nloved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we come together on the floor of the \nSenate to remember and honor the victims of September 11, 2001.\n  Only 11 short years ago on this day, enemies of freedom and equality \nattacked the United States and murdered thousands of innocent people. \nFrom this attack, our Nation grew stronger. United by our flag and our \nbeliefs, America rose to defend the homeland and take the battle to our \nenemies. And it has not been easy. No, it has been a long 11 years of \ncombat in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  But our military and its leaders have brought the mastermind of the \n9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, to justice. And for a decade, America \nhas been safe from the next round of attacks that we all thought were \nimminent 11 years ago.\n  None of this could have been accomplished without the brave men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces.\n  On 9/11, the mission of our military changed overnight. Those already \nenlisted knew they would be heading for war, and many more joined our \nmilitary knowing that they too would be headed for combat.\n  From the events of 9/11, the best of America was reborn. A new \ngeneration of Americans dedicated to service and preservation of \nfreedom was called to action because of 9/11. These Americans were \namong the first on the ground in foreign countries. They toppled a \ndictator, liberated a nation of women and children from an oppressive \nregime, and brought to justice Osama bin Laden.\n  Today our overseas operations fighting the war on terror continue. \nBut for many of these soldiers, their tour of duty is over and they are \ncoming home. They are coming home to family and friends and those who \nlove them, but also to a stagnant economy and record high unemployment.\n  Today, unemployment amongst post-9/11 veterans is 9.8 percent; \n192,000 post-9/11 veterans are unemployed, and 443,000 9/11 veterans \nare not even participating in the labor force. The policy of this \nNation to grow the economy is failing these brave men and women who \nhave fought to protect our freedoms--including economic freedoms.\n  This week the Senate will take up a bill that will provide $1 billion \nover 5 years to hire 20,000 veterans. I am proud to support this \nmeasure and hope we will have the opportunity to debate it and other \njob-creating measures before we return home at the end of this work \nperiod.\n  Since coming to the Senate, job creation has been my No. 1 priority. \nI will\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nsupport taking up and debating any measure relating to this issue, \nespecially those that affect veterans. That is why I was proud to reach \nacross bipartisan lines to work to pass the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, and \nknow there is more work to be done. However, it is stunning that we are \nat this point.\n  After a $1 trillion stimulus, bailout after bailout, a new \ngovernment-run health care program that will raise taxes on all \nAmericans, it is time to look our veterans in the eyes and ask: Is this \nworking? Are this administration's policies working for thousands of \nunemployed Nevada veterans who have come back from their service to \nfind their homes underwater and their jobs lost in this great \nrecession?\n  It is not working. The bill we are taking up this week is an \nacknowledgement that the policies of the past 4 years have not worked. \nAs a result of the failed policies of this administration, Nevada \nveterans cannot find a job.\n  Our veterans deserve better. They deserve a good-paying job. That is \nwhy I will support this measure that we will hopefully take up this \nafternoon. But I also know there is much more we can do to provide \nveterans the opportunities they deserve. In addition to supporting \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this bill, I will also be filing my \nVeterans Small Business Protection Act as an amendment. I introduced \nthis legislation, along with Ranking Member Burr of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, to ensure that widows and dependents of \nservicemembers killed in action are not alone to run a small business \nwhile grieving over the loss of a loved one.\n  Congress has provided numerous benefits to our Nation's veterans who \nown a small business--sole-source contracting, low-interest loans, and \nother resources, in order to help these small businesses grow and to \ncreate jobs. My legislation closes a large gap in Federal law that does \nlittle for those who owned businesses before their activation and were \nkilled in the line of duty. As a Member of Congress, we must honor our \nNation's fallen as well as ensure that the loved ones they leave behind \nhave the same economic opportunities as afforded to that veteran. It is \na small token that we can provide to those who gave the ultimate \nsacrifice for liberty.\n  I hope we will have the opportunity to offer amendments this week as \nwe debate the veterans job corps legislation and encourage my \ncolleagues to support my veterans small business bill.\n  In closing, our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to our Nation's \nveterans, and Congress must fulfill the promises and commitments that \nhave been made to all of them. This week the Senate will continue to \nwork toward providing veterans with a good-paying job, and I support \nthat goal. But if we are going to help small businesses create jobs for \nveterans and all Americans, we must change the policies coming from \nWashington, DC, because it is not working.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to go ahead on this \nVeterans Jobs Corps bill. I had anticipated I would be speaking after \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Murray, but I will take the \nliberty of going ahead, and then with her comments coming as the \nchairman of the committee, which normally it would be the reverse. And \nI thank Senator Murray for her leadership in all of these veterans \nissues, but particularly the issue of unemployment among veterans when \nthey come home from the war. Especially among veterans who are age 24 \nand less, the unemployment figure is even higher.\n  It is appropriate on this particular day, September 11--11 years ago \ntoday--with the fact that those terrorists hijacked the four commercial \nairlines, causing the crashes at the World Trade Center, at the \nPentagon, and in a field in Pennsylvania. What was happening also that \nmorning was that police officers and firefighters and emergency \npersonnel rushed to respond, and many lost their lives in attempts to \nsave others.\n  The events of that morning mobilized American forces like we had not \nseen in years. One of the first mobilizations was our U.S. military. \nThey were called to serve bravely in remote corners of the globe.\n  Eleven years later, the mastermind of 9/11, Osama bin Laden, was \ntaken down, we now have an al-Qaida that is severely diminished, and we \nare bringing our troops home from that part of the world.\n  But for the troops, when they come home, the fight is not over. There \nis another fight when they get back home to America. It is a different \ntype of battle.\n  The unemployment rate among veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan was just under 11 percent in August. It is higher for those \nwho are younger. This problem is likely to continue to grow as we draw \ndown in Afghanistan, as we have already drawn down in Iraq.\n  It is worth noting that there have been steps made in the right \ndirection. This past summer we passed legislation that will help \nveterans get Federal occupational licenses when their military training \nmatches the civilian requirements. That was a bill I had the privilege \nof sponsoring. It passed the Senate unanimously. It was passed by the \nHouse overwhelmingly. It was sent down and it was signed into law. Last \nyear we passed the bill granting tax benefits to companies that hire \nwounded warriors. But we have to do more.\n  So we filed this legislation that the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Murray, will further explain. This legislation is to create a \nVeterans Jobs Corps. It is modeled after the Civilian Conservation \nCorps of the 1930s. The Veterans Jobs Corps would put veterans back to \nwork restoring and protecting America's public lands and waters. The \nbill would also create opportunities for veterans to serve as police \nand firefighters and first responders.\n  We have had some success on this with smaller scale projects, such as \nthe Veterans Fire Corps pilot program at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, which trains veterans to fight forest fires. In fact, it \nhas been so successful that folks who run these programs say they can \nhardly keep trainees in the program because they are picked up for \nfull-time employment so fast. So we are expanding this idea from this \npilot study that has been so successful. We are expanding it now in the \nVeterans Jobs Corps.\n  Ten percent of the money in this bill will go to hiring veterans with \nspecialties, such as those with the specialty of military police going \ninto civilian law enforcement and those with the specialty of medics to \nbe firefighters and first responders.\n  Not only will this bill help protect our communities, but the \nVeterans Jobs Corps will help address the Federal maintenance backlog. \nThe National Park Service has deferred maintenance totaling over $11 \nbillion. This backlog has been caused by the gradual shifting of \nfunding to the operations budgets of the Park Service at the expense of \neverything else.\n  For example, at the Civil War battlefield in Fredericksburg, VA, a \n$42 million backlog in maintenance is preventing the upkeep of that \nvital piece of American history.\n  I am happy to say that a number of organizations have stepped forward \nto support this bill. The American Legion, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nand the National Association of Police Organizations--all of them \nsupport this legislation.\n  One of the greatest honors I have in this job as Senator is getting \nout to meet and to greet current members of our military all over the \nglobe and to thank the veterans back here at home for their service to \nour country.\n  When you meet some of these folks, both young and old, they have \nalready done the tough, tough job, and then they come home and they \nhave tough times as well. These folks are hard working, they are highly \ntrained, highly disciplined, extremely skilled. We need to give them as \nmany opportunities as possible to succeed when they get back home here \nin America.\n  It is up to us to stand by our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, \nand coast\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\nguardsmen. I want to urge the Senate, when we vote today at 2:15, to \ngrant the motion for cloture so we can take up this bill and quickly \npass it so those who have fought bravely for our Nation can find \nemployment when they come home.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we just heard the Senator from Florida \ntalk about the very important piece of legislation that is in front of \nus. I wish to thank him for being the lead on this and all the work he \nhas put in it and the passion he has had to make sure our veterans in \nthis Nation have what they need when they come home from these wars.\n  Last Friday we were again reminded of the difficult employment \npicture our Nation's veterans continue to face. In the monthly \nunemployment rate for August, we saw across the country there were \n720,000 unemployed veterans. It is a number that includes over 225,000 \npost-9/11 veterans, many of them who have served multiple tours in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and have sacrificed time and again for our safety.\n  This should not be the case. Our veterans have what it takes to not \nonly go out and find work but to excel in the workforce of the 21st \ncentury. In fact, the characteristics that our veterans have and \nexemplify read like the job qualifications you might find at any major \ncompany or small business, and that is because they have leadership \nability, discipline, technical skills, team work, and the ability to \nperform under pressure--no question.\n  They have those skills because as a country we have invested in \ntraining them. We cannot and should not let that training or the \nmillions of dollars we have invested in these men and women go to \nwaste. In far too many instances, however, that is what is happening. \nToo often on the day our servicemembers are discharged, we as a nation \npat them on the back, thank them for their service, but we do not give \nthem a helping hand in the job market. That has to end.\n  The Senate has taken bipartisan action in the past to begin to change \nthe way our veterans do transition from the battlefield to the job \nmarket. We were able to pass the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which I \ncoauthored. That was signed into law last year. Importantly, that law \ntransforms the way we provide transition training to our servicemembers \nwhen they leave the military. It includes a provision that in my home \nState and across the country is providing thousands of dollars in tax \ncredits to businesses to hire our vets.\n  In addition to that bill, we have also worked to build partnerships \nwith the private sector in order to tap into the tremendous amount of \ngood will that our companies have for our returning heroes. Sometimes \nthis is as simple as working with a company to show them the easy steps \nthat can help bring veterans on board, such as ensuring that they are \nadvertising their job openings with local veterans service \norganizations and on their local military bases or having veterans in \ntheir own H.R. department with whom veterans can identify when they \napply for work or having someone on staff who can help translate the \nexperience of veterans into the work that company does.\n  Time and again, big companies such as Amazon and Microsoft or a lot \nof smaller businesses I have seen tell me these steps make an impact. \nBut beyond those steps, it is very clear more needs to be done, \nparticularly when the unemployment rate among young veterans who are \nages 18 to 24 continues to hover around 20 percent. Action has to be \ntaken because 20 percent is one in five of our veterans who cannot find \na job to support their family; one in five of them who does not have an \nincome to provide stability; one in five of them who does not have the \nwork to provide them with the self-esteem and pride that is so critical \nto their transition home.\n  This a problem that manifests itself in homelessness, in broken \nfamilies, and far too often in our veterans taking their own lives. It \nis a problem that neither the veterans themselves nor government alone \ncan solve. But it is also one that we have to do everything we can to \naddress.\n  Here in the Senate, that means a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck \nstrategy. That is exactly what the Senator from Florida is putting \nforward. Senator Nelson has put forward the veterans job corps bill. \nWhat this bill does is, over the next 5 years, it will increase \ntraining and hiring opportunities for all our veterans who are using \nsuccessful job training programs in the country.\n  It is going to help hire qualified veterans as police officers and \nfirefighters and first responders--by the way, at a time when 85 \npercent of law enforcement agencies had to reduce their budgets in the \nlast year. It is going to help train and hire veterans to help restore \nand protect our national, State and tribal forests, our parks and our \npublic lands--at a time, by the way, when we face a $10 billion \nmaintenance backlog for our public lands. It is a backlog I have seen \nat home personally in my home State of Washington.\n  Because training and hiring our veterans has never been seen and \nnever should be an effort that divides us along partisan lines, the \nveterans job corps bill takes good ideas from both sides of the aisle. \nIn fact, our bill will provide veterans with access to the Internet and \ncomputers to help conduct job searches at one-stop centers and other \nlocations. This is an idea championed by Senator Toomey. It is going to \nhelp guarantee that our rural and disabled veterans have access to \nveterans employment representatives. This is a bill that is championed \nby Senator Tester, who is presiding over the Senate this morning. It is \na good idea. We put it in this bill.\n  It is going to increase transition assistance for eligible veterans \nand their spouses. That is a bill that was introduced by Senator \nBoozman of our committee.\n  It will require consideration of a veteran's training or experience \ngained while they are serving on Active Duty when they seek \ncertifications and licenses. That is a bill that is cosponsored by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. This bill says all good ideas are \nwelcome.\n  Our veterans need all the help they can get. It is fully paid for in \na bipartisan way. It has been endorsed most recently by the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations. But there are also a lot of \nveterans service organizations that stand behind this bill as well. \nThey do so because they know that helping veterans find employment is \nabsolutely critical to meeting many of the challenges they face when \nthey come home.\n  Our veterans do not ask for a lot. Oftentimes, they come home and do \nnot even acknowledge their own sacrifice. My own father never talked \nabout his time fighting in World War II. In fact, I never saw his \nPurple Heart or knew he had a wallet with shrapnel in it or a diary \nthat detailed his time in combat until after he died and my family \ngathered to sort out his belongings.\n  But our veterans should not have to ask. We should know to provide \nfor them. When my father's generation came home from the war, they came \nhome to opportunity. My father came home to a community that supported \nhim. He came home to college and a job. It was a job that gave him \npride and a job that helped him start his family, and one that, of \ncourse, ultimately led me to starting my own. That is the legacy of \nopportunity this Senate, in a bipartisan way, has lived up to for \ntoday's veterans.\n  I urge our colleagues to build on the successes we have had in \npassing bipartisan veterans employment legislation. Veterans returning \nhome from across the country are watching us. They certainly do not \nhave time to let politics block their path to a job that will help them \nserve their community. Surely, this is a bill that is something we can \nshow them that we can come together on no matter how close or far away \nwe are from an election.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a military career is one of the \nmost honorable professions that our young men and women can pursue, and \neach of us is indebted to our veterans for their service.\n  In this challenging economic time, it is more important than ever \nthat we do what we can to connect well qualified veterans not just with \njobs, but with careers. Our veterans demonstrate the skills, knowledge, \nleadership and professionalism that allow them to excel in almost any \ncareer field if they are given the right opportunities.\n  How we treat this generation of military veterans who have served in \nIraq and Afghanistan will influence the next generation of young men \nand women who might consider a career in our military. Unfortunately, \nwe sometimes fall short when it comes to connecting veterans with jobs, \nand some veterans struggle to find careers that allow them to achieve \ntheir full potential.\n  That is why I have been involved for several months now in a unique \npartnership of U.S. utility industry leaders to actively recruit and \nemploy returning veterans. Troops to Energy helps our veterans \nsuccessfully transition from military service into civilian careers in \nthe utility and engineering industries.\n  Some reports show that a staggering 29 percent of veterans between \nthe ages of 18 and 24 who served in Iraq or Afghanistan were unemployed \nlast year. That is more than three times the national unemployment \nlevel and unacceptably high.\n  We must do better.\n  That is why I support the Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012, which will \ncreate additional opportunities for veterans to transition into career \nfields in which their military skills are readily transferrable.\n  I am not able to vote on this important legislation today because I \nam attending the funeral services for a dear friend, but I want the \nrecord to reflect my strong support for this legislation and for our \nmilitary men and women, their families, and our veterans.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Crisis\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there has been, appropriately enough, a \nlot of discussion about our $16 trillion national debt and our $1 \ntrillion Federal deficit. This is, in fact, an enormously important \nissue, and it is an issue that Congress must address. But it must \naddress this crisis in a way that is fair to the middle class and to \nworking families and our seniors and our kids. It is an issue that must \nbe addressed, but it must be addressed fairly.\n  When we talk about the deficit and the national debt, it is important \nto remember how we got to where we are today. We can simply go back 10 \nyears or so to January 2001 when President Clinton left office and \nPresident Bush assumed the Presidency. At that particular moment in \nhistory, in January 2001, I hope everybody remembers not only did this \ncountry have a $236 billion surplus, all of the projections for the \nfuture at that point were that that surplus was going to grow and grow \nand grow. In fact, at that point, this was one of the great debates \ntaking place in Congress: What do we do with all of that money? How \nmuch do we give back in tax breaks? How much do we put into Social \nSecurity? That was the debate in January 2001.\n  So before we discuss how we go forward in deficit reduction, with a \ntrillion-dollar deficit, it is important to remember that, and it is \nimportant to remember how we got to where we are today.\n  How we got to where we are today really, in a significant way, is not \ncomplicated. President Bush assumed office and within a few years we \nwere fighting not just one war in Afghanistan but another war in Iraq. \nI hope the American people appreciate that many of the ``deficit \nhawks''--the people who tell us: Oh, gee, we have to cut Social \nSecurity and Medicare and Medicaid and nutrition and education; we have \nto cut, cut, cut, cut--when asked to pay for those wars had nothing to \nsay.\n  Paul Ryan, Mr. Romney's Vice Presidential nominee, chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee, voted for the wars but forgot to pay for them. \nNobody knows exactly how much these two wars will end up costing, but \nthe guess is that by the time we take care of the last veteran 70 years \nfrom now, those wars may run up over $3 trillion, and we did not pay \nfor them to the tune of one penny, all put on the credit card, all \nadded to the deficit.\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n  I find it somewhat unusual that many of our Republican ``deficit \nhawks,'' who stand here on the floor of the Senate every day and tell \nus how deeply concerned they are about the deficit all voted for huge \ntax breaks for millionaires and billionaires to the tune of $1 trillion \nover a 10-year period.\n  Well, you do not give huge tax breaks to the rich and not offset it \nif you are serious about the deficit and not being hypocritical. Many \nof my Republican friends, during the Bush years, voted for the \ninsurance company-written Medicare Part D prescription drug program, \nwritten by the insurance companies and the drug companies. It is going \nto cost us about $400 billion over a 10-year period.\n  How did we pay for that program? Oh, I guess we did not pay for it at \nall. Our deficit hawk friends voted for that program, which was good \npolitics, I guess. They forgot to pay for it. Add another $400 billion \nto the deficit.\n  It is important to understand that today, in the midst of this \nhorrendous recession, the issue is not just cuts, cuts, cuts. The issue \nis that right now, today, at 15.2 percent, revenue as a percentage of \ngross domestic product is lower than at any time in the last 60 years. \nBecause we deregulated Wall Street--Republicans wanted that; some \nDemocrats wanted that--we allowed investor banks to merge with \ncommercial banks, to merge with insurance companies, and, as a result \nof the illegal behavior on Wall Street, we were driven into this \nrecession: mass unemployment, businesses go under, less tax revenue \ncomes in, and, at 15.2 percent, revenue today as a percentage of GDP is \nthe lowest it has been in 60 years.\n  So those are some of the reasons that today we are experiencing a \ntrillion-dollar deficit and a $16 trillion national debt. My Republican \nfriends will say: Well, you know, Bernie, be that as it may, yes, maybe \nwe should have paid for the wars; maybe we should not have given tax \nbreaks to billionaires when the rich are doing very well; maybe we \nshould have paid for Medicare Part D; maybe we should have not \nderegulated Wall Street. But be that as it may, that is water over the \ndam. We are where we are right now. We have got to go forward on \ndeficit reduction.\n  So what are their ideas? Well, Mitt Romney has not been as clear as I \nthink he should be about his ideas. But we do have a blueprint from our \nRepublican friends in the Ryan budget. As you know, Congressman Ryan is \nchairman of the Budget Committee. He presented a budget. It was passed \nby the Republican House. Here is some of what the Republican budget is \nabout.\n  What the Republicans want to do is to make cuts to Social Security \nand to raise the retirement age. I want to say a word about Social \nSecurity right now. It is an issue I feel very strongly about. I think \na lot of Americans do not know this. Social Security, because it is \nfunded by the payroll tax and not the general Treasury, has not \ncontributed one nickel to our deficits. Social Security today has a \n$2.7 trillion surplus and can pay out all benefits owed to all eligible \nAmericans for the next 21 years. In my view, it would be wrong, it \nwould be deeply wrong, to consider cuts in Social Security as part of \ndeficit reduction, because Social Security has not contributed a nickel \nto the deficit. But our Republican friends support cuts in Social \nSecurity. And many of them over a period of years want to move toward \nthe privatization of Social Security.\n  The Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it in a 10-year period. \nWhat does that mean? What that means is that in 10 years, if you are 70 \nyears of age, you would be given a voucher for $8,000, as I understand \nthe number. Let's assume that an individual, a 70-year-old, 75-year-old \nindividual walks into a doctor's office, and the doctor says: Joe, \nMary, I am sorry to tell you this, but you are dealing with cancer. We \nare going to have to send you to a hospital. There are a whole lot of \ntreatments you are going to have to undertake. Those treatments are \ngoing to cost you tens of thousands of dollars, if not more. That \nindividual then goes to his or her insurance company and says: I have \n$8,000 to buy an insurance policy.\n  What do you think that insurance agent is going to tell that \nindividual when that person is facing tens and tens of thousands of \ndollars of medical bills? That insurance company's function is to make \nmoney. They are not going to say: Oh, sure, give us the $8,000 so we \ncan spend $50,000 on health care costs for you. It is not going to \nhappen. That insurance company is going to say: There is the door. Try \nsomebody else. That is going to happen to a whole lot of people.\n  You can think of what the end of that story is. The end of the story \nis, if that family, that individual, does not have any money, he or she \nis going to go to their kids. If they do not have any money, the \noutcome is not going to be good, because that person simply will not \nhave the treatment he or she needs.\n  The Ryan budget proposes to cut $770 billion over a 10-year period \nfrom Medicaid. That would result in at least 14 million Americans \nlosing their health insurance and would also cut nursing home \nassistance in half, threatening the long-term care of some 10 million \nsenior citizens. Many people do not know that. Many people say: Well, \nyou know, Medicaid is for the poor. It is certainly true that millions \nof low-income kids, deservedly, through the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, get their health insurance with significant help from Medicaid \nand State money. But what people do not understand is that Medicaid is \nalso a major contributor toward nursing home care.\n  I want the average middle-class family to understand that if their \nmom or their pop develops Alzheimer's or some other very difficult \nsituation, cannot stay at home, cannot stay with their kids, has to be \nput in a nursing home, which is pretty expensive, understand that all \nover this country, Medicaid is putting money into making sure that \nelderly people can stay in nursing homes with some degree of dignity.\n  But it is not just Social Security or Medicare and Medicaid our \nRepublican friends are going after. In my State of Vermont, and I am \nsure in Minnesota, we have lower income working-class kids who no \nlonger can go to college because college is too expensive. We have \nother young people who are graduating college $25,000, $50,000 in debt, \nunable to find jobs which help them pay off that debt.\n  In my view, the Pell grant program, which is the major way in \nWashington we help low and moderate-income kids--I think that is too \nlow; we are not helping enough kids with enough resources. But the Ryan \nbudget would slash Pell grants by about 60 percent next year alone. So \nif you are a parent or you are a young person in college, that is how \nthey intend to balance the budget.\n  In the midst of this horrendous recession, older people, lower income \npeople are struggling. It is very easy to forget here in the confines \nof the Senate, but there are millions of Americans today wondering how \nthey are going to feed their kids tonight, who open the refrigerator, \nthere is no food in that refrigerator, who depend upon food stamps. \nHalf of the food stamp money goes to the elderly and children. They \nwant to make devastating cuts in food stamps.\n  My main point is pretty simple. The deficit is a serious issue and we \nhave got to address it. But it would not only be immoral, it would be \nbad economic policy to move toward deficit reduction, to move toward a \nbalanced budget, on the backs of millions and millions of seniors and \nchildren and working families who today, as a result of this terrible \nrecession, are already struggling to keep their heads above water. You \ndo not balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people in \nthis country. That is bad economic policy. That is immoral. There are \nways to move forward which can achieve the same goals but without \nhurting people who are already in pain.\n  What we do not talk about too much in Congress is who is winning and \nwho is losing in the current American economy. I want to bring forth a \nfew facts that I think the American people and my colleagues should be \nfamiliar with. That is, No. 1, in America today we have the most \nunequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth \nand worse in America today than at any time since the 1920s. We have in \nAmerica today--and people should check it out; they may not believe me \nwhen I say this. You have got one family, the Waltons of Wal-Mart fame, \none family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American \npeople. One family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent.\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n  And our Republican friends say: That is not enough. We have to give \nthose people, billionaires, even more tax breaks. Today the top 1 \npercent owns about 41 percent of the wealth of America. The bottom 60 \npercent--that is a significant majority of the American people added \nall together--own about 2.3 percent of the wealth of America: Top 1 \npercent, 41 percent; bottom 60 percent, 2.3 percent.\n  Common sense and decency would suggest that when a few people have \nincredible wealth, when a few people are seeing their incomes and their \nwealth grow rapidly while the middle class is shrinking and poverty is \nincreasing, common sense and common decency suggests that you ask the \npeople on top whose effective tax rate is the lowest in decades to \nstart paying their fair share of taxes before you cut Social Security, \nbefore you cut Medicare, Medicaid, education and nutrition programs.\n  Right now, about one out of four major profitable corporations is \npaying zero in taxes. We have had instances which I have portrayed here \non the floor of the Senate of some of the most profitable corporations \nin America in a given year paying nothing in Federal income taxes, and, \nin fact, getting a rebate from the IRS.\n  Well, before you tell the elderly and children that they have to \nexperience cuts when they cannot afford it, maybe you say to corporate \nAmerica: Sorry, we are going to end the loopholes you currently are \nenjoying. Every single year we are losing about $100 billion in tax \nrevenue because corporations and wealthy individuals are stashing their \nmoney in tax havens in the Cayman islands, Bermuda, and elsewhere. They \nare ``patriotic'' Americans who love this country so much they are \nstashing their money abroad in order to avoid paying taxes in this \ncountry.\n  Maybe before you cut education, maybe before you cut back on \ninfrastructure, we make sure that we do away with these tax havens and \nthese tax shelters for millionaires and billionaires and large \ncorporations.\n  Lastly, we have tripled military spending since 1997. Right now the \nUnited States is spending almost as much as the rest of the world \ncombined. We spend over 4 percent of our GDP on the military. Our \nfriends in Europe--many of the countries there provide health care to \nall of their people, educational opportunities stronger than we do to \nour people--are spending 2 percent. We are spending twice as much in \nGDP on defense. Maybe it is time to take a hard look at a lot of the \nwaste and inefficiency that currently exists in the Defense Department.\n  On my Web site, sanders.senate.gov, we have a whole list of ways that \nwe can bring in revenue, where we can make cuts which are fair, which \nprotect the middle class and working families and the most vulnerable \npeople in this country.\n  I am going to do everything I can to make sure we do not go forward \nin terms of deficit reduction by punishing people who are already \nhurting and then giving more tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires. That is bad economic policy. That is immoral. It is not \nsomething we should be doing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Missile Defense\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, several of us have talked about the tragic \nterrorist attack on America 11 years ago today. I think we all remember \nwhere we were and what we were doing at the time. I remember so well \ngoing up to New York to Ground Zero and seeing the people who were \ninvolved and talking to the families of some of the firemen who lost \ntheir lives. As tragic as that is, I have to ask the question: Is there \nany doubt that those terrorists, if they had the ability to send a \nweapon over to the United States, would do that?\n  I look back sometimes wistfully to the days of the Cold War when it \nwas the USSR and the United States. They were predictable and we were \npredictable. But it is different. Such concepts as mutually assured \ndestruction at that time were somewhat meaningful and were very \neffective. It is not effective now because we are dealing with people \nwho want to die. It is a different environment altogether.\n  On this 11th year, on this particular day, when I think about \nPresident Obama's first budget 4 years ago, he did a lot of things I \nthought were very destructive to our military, and I have talked about \nthat on the floor several times. He did away with the F-22, the only \nfifth-generation vehicle. He did away with our lift capacity of the C-\n17. He did away with the future combat system. I think people are aware \nof that, but something people may not be aware of that happened in that \nsame budget was doing away with the Poland site of the ground-based \ninterceptor.\n  Think back to the decision that was made in this country that we had \nto prepare ourselves for Iran having the capability of a weapon that \ncould be sent all the way over to the United States. We have ground-\nbased interceptors in Alaska, all the way down to southern California. \nSo anything coming from the west I feel very comfortable about, but \ncoming from the other direction, coming from Iran, that is not the \ncase. So we recognized some 6 or 7 years ago that we were going to have \nto have some kind of a ground-based interceptor that would take care of \na missile coming from the east. I was part of that. So we did that in \nboth the Czech Republic and in Poland. The Czech Republic had to be \nwilling to have a radar site and Poland had to be willing to take on \nRussia, which didn't want them to have this capability, and we put a \nground-based interceptor in Poland to take care of anything coming from \nthat direction. We did that, but in his first budget President Obama \ndid away with it. They tried to say that maybe that was not an accurate \nassessment, but the 2007 NIE--National Intelligence Estimate--concluded \nthat Iran could develop an intercontinental missile capability by \n2015. Less than a year later DOD stated in its April 2010 report on \nIran's military that they sent to Congress--and I remember this very \nwell:\n\n       With sufficient foreign assistance, Iran could probably \n     develop and test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) \n     capable of reaching the United States by 2015.\n\n  That is totally consistent with what they said back in 2007.\n  In place of the third site, the Obama administration pitched a new \nmissile defense plan, the European Phased Adaptive Approach with an \nincremental deployment of sea, land, and air versions, and so forth. \nOne thing we all agree on is that the SM-3 Block IB is a short- to \nmedium-range defense mechanism. The SM-3 Block IIA is short to medium \nrange. The one that would take the place and would have the capability \nof the ground-based interceptor in Poland is the SM-3 Block IIB. That \nis still a concept. It is on the drawing board. We know Iran is going \nto have that capability by 2015 and they say maybe a deployment date by \n2020. That leaves the United States of America and Europe unprotected \nfor 5 years.\n  Now, although I say unprotected, there is some level of protection \nthere. They talk about the AEGIS ships; however, in subsequent budgets \nthe President has cut the AEGIS ships in their capability and the \nnumber of missiles that they carry to the point where it leaves us \nstill unprotected--not just us but also Europe.\n  Fast-forward to today and DOD's April 2012 report, the report on \nIran, which, again, states:\n\n       Iran has boosted the lethality and effectiveness of \n     existing systems with accuracy and improvements and new \n     submunition payloads. Iran may be technically capable of \n     flight testing an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015.\n\n  Secretary Panetta confirmed this. He is the Secretary of Defense. He \nsaid earlier this year on ``60 Minutes'' that he believes Iran would be \nable to produce a nuclear weapon in about a year, and then it would \ntake them another 1 to 2 years in order to put it on a deliverable \nvehicle. Again, that is around 2015, leaving a 5-year gap between the \ndate when our interceptors become operational and the date that Iran \nfields a nuclear ballistic missile capable of threatening Europe and \nthe United States.\n  In this year's budget request President Obama cut $250 million from \nthe THAAD system procurement, procuring 36 interceptors instead of 42. \nHe\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\ncuts THAAD fire units from 9 to 6 and cut $175 million in AEGIS. Again, \nthat is part of the system that would replace the ground-based \ninterceptor in Poland that is already under construction. The SM-3 \nprocurement would be delayed, procuring 29 SM-3 Block IB interceptors \ninstead of 46; in other words, dramatically cutting down our capability \nat the same time that there could be no doubt in anyone's mind from \nwhat I said that 2015 is a realistic date when Iran would have the \ncapability of not just the weapon but a delivery system.\n  Additionally, the President has failed to plan or program enough \nAEGIS ships in the budget to provide full coverage. In other words, \nthey can move them around. They have a good rocket capability. I have \nbeen supportive of the AEGIS system, but he is cutting down on the \nnumber of them. Those should just be there for the protection of Europe \nand not the protection of the United States.\n  At the end of President Obama's now infamous meeting with Russian \nPresident Dmitri Medvedev on March 26 of this year, President Obama \nsaid--not knowing that the mic was open:\n\n       On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this \n     can be solved, but it's important for him [incoming Russian \n     President Vladimir Putin] to give me space.\n\n  That is President Obama's words. He continues:\n\n       This is my last election. After my election, I have more \n     flexibility.\n\n  Thinking back 11 years ago at the tragedy that immediately killed \n3,000 people in that horrible terrorist attack, again, I ask the same \nquestion I asked a few minutes ago: Is there any doubt in anyone's mind \nthat a person would hesitate to come over on a well-orchestrated \nterrorist attack on America and use a system delivered on some type of \nvehicle to the eastern part of the United States? I say no. I can't \nimagine anyone believes that is not a possibility.\n  As tragic as 3,000 people being killed was, it doesn't take much of \nan imagination to look at any type of missile hitting a major American \ncity. We wouldn't be talking about 3,000; we would be talking about \n300,000 or even 3 million.\n  I think this is the day, on the 11th anniversary, that we need to \ntake the warning we received 11 years ago and look into the future not \njust for ourselves--in my case, for my 20 kids and grandkids. We cannot \nsubject ourselves. We need to take care of this horrible gap in our \ndefense of an incoming missile coming from the east as quickly as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Watch the Helpers\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, since this is a day of remembrance of 9/\n11, when I started my day this morning, I picked up a book I read from \ntime to time. It is called ``One Simple Act'' by Debbie Macomber, and \nit is about gratitude and being generous. The very first paragraph I \npicked up happens to be about 9/11. It says:\n\n       Watch the Helpers\n       After the bombing of the twin towers at New York's Trade \n     Center, the nation was stunned. Parents didn't know what to \n     say to their children. They'd seen such evil things on \n     television that even adults couldn't put the events into any \n     kind of context. When a few parents wrote to Mr. Rogers, the \n     beloved children's television personality, to ask for advice, \n     Fred Rogers said, ``Tell them to watch the helpers.'' What \n     wise advice. I've thought about his answer many times. When \n     tragedy hits, don't focus on the faces of pain and horror. \n     Let your eyes follow those who are rescuing, feeding, \n     healing, sweeping, comforting, and rebuilding. On 9/11, it \n     was the selfless firefighters who took center stage. They \n     will be remembered long after the evildoers are forgotten.\n\n  What good advice: Watch the helpers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Congressional Review Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to speak to an issue that \nthreatens the very viability of the U.S. Senate.\n  Last July the Obama administration, using the flimsiest of arguments, \ngranted themselves the authority to waive the Federal welfare work \nrequirements. Whether or not what the Obama administration intends to \naccomplish with these waivers is good welfare policy has been the \nsubject of robust debate.\n  I am not here to argue the merits or lack thereof of the underlying \nwelfare policy goals of the Obama administration. What I am here to do \nis to make a plea to my fellow Senators: as Senators, we simply cannot \nlet this action stand.\n  If we fail to stand together as Senators in defense of our \nconstitutional duty to be the ones to draft legislation, we might as \nwell pack our bags and go home because we will have opened the door for \nthis administration and future administrations to unilaterally decide \nthey can waive precedent, congressional intent, and actual legislative \nlanguage on which Senators have scrupulously debated and compromised.\n  If we do not stand together as a Senate, we will be ceding our \nauthority to the executive branch. The longstanding implications of \nthis could possibly extend to welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, disability \npolicy, child welfare, and Social Security Programs. Allow me to \nelaborate.\n  According to the Obama administration, because section 1115 of the \nSocial Security Act allows them certain waiver authority over section \n402 of the Social Security Act, which deals with a State's welfare \nplan, and section 402 cites section 407, then the administration has \nwaiver authority over section 407, which enumerates State welfare work \nrequirements.\n  This doesn't make any sense.\n  I have been a leader in the Senate on welfare for nearly two decades. \nI helped draft and manage the floor during the 1996 overhaul of \nwelfare. Five years later, I worked across the aisle with John Breaux \nof Louisiana and others to craft the so-called tripartisan proposal for \nwelfare reauthorization. The Breaux-Hatch proposal became the basis for \nthe Senate Finance Committee bill that was marked up in the summer of \n2002.\n  Much of the work Senator Breaux and I accomplished made its way into \nthe Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone \nbill--the so-called PRIDE bill--that was reported twice out of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  In all that work on welfare, not once--not one time, not ever--was \nthere any discussion of allowing States to waive State work \nrequirements. If anyone had raised it, Republican or Democrat, they \nwould have been laughed out of the room--and for good reason. The crux \nof the deal and the most integral feature of the 1996 act was to give \nStates flexibility to design their own welfare programs but also \nrequire them to meet meaningful performance measures. The idea that \nanyone would contemplate allowing States to waive these performance \nmeasures would have been preposterous, even ludicrous.\n  So allowing the executive branch the authority to waive welfare work \nrequirements has never, ever been a part of any discussion of welfare \nreform.\n  The concept of the executive branch having the authority to waive the \n1996 welfare work requirements also did not occur during the previous \ntwo administrations. It just never came up because no one thought it \nwas possible.\n  The administration likes to point to a 2005 letter from Governors in \nsupport of the PRIDE bill as justification for their unprecedented \naction, but what they fail to note is that this letter was not sent to \nPresident Bush, it was sent to Members of Congress, who, the Governors \ncorrectly believed, were the only ones with the constitutional \nauthority to give the States flexibility.\n  This point bears repeating: Until the July 12 informational memo to \nStates, no one ever thought the executive branch could waive welfare \nwork requirements. I would even venture to speculate that the Obama \nadministration itself does not seriously think it\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nhad the authority to waive welfare work requirements, and here is why I \nsuspect this is the case.\n  One of the few bipartisan bills that was actually enacted during the \n112th session of Congress was legislation I wrote with my partner on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus. This legislation--the, \n``Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act''--included \na provision I drafted that allowed the Department of Health and Human \nServices the authority to grant certain child welfare waivers. It \nspecifically allowed HHS to waive provisions included in Title IV-E of \nthe Social Security Act. Congress gave HHS that authority because the \nCongress had been asked by States for flexibility to waive certain \nprovisions of Title IV-E and because, just as everyone assumed the \nexecutive branch could not waive section 407 of the Social Security \nAct, no one believed they could waive Title IV-E of the Social Security \nAct.\n  But if we go and look up section 402, just as there is a reference to \nsection 407 contained within that section, so, too, is there a \nreference to Title IV-E. If the administration really believes in their \nheart of hearts they have carte blanche to waive whatever is even \nmentioned in section 402, why did they have to wait around for Congress \nto give them that authority? The answer, of course, is the Obama \nAdministration never had the authority to begin with, and I believe \neven they know that to be true today.\n  The real issue, beyond the rhetoric, is that if the Senate lets this \naction stand unchallenged, if the Senate does not speak as one body, \nunited, then our inaction will embolden this administration--and future \nadministrations, I might add--to bypass the constitutionally mandated \njob of the Congress to enact laws whenever it suits their pleasure or \npolitical aims--in other words, to take over the legislative function.\n  The Congress does not have many tools in our toolkit to thwart \nadministrative overreach, but one of those tools is the Congressional \nReview Act. The CRA, as it is referred to, allows for Senate fast track \nauthority to disapprove a rule that is submitted from an agency in the \nevent an administration attempts to circumvent the CRA by issuing other \nforms of guidance that should have been submitted as a rule. The \nGovernment Accountability Office, which has standing with our Senate \nParliamentarians, can determine that an agency action meets the \ndefinition of a rule as established by the Administrative Procedures \nAct and that therefore the CRA applies.\n  Last July Congressman Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and I asked the GAO to determine whether the so-called \nguidance to States submitted by the Obama administration was a rule and \napplicable to the CRA. Last week Chairman Camp and I received word the \nGAO had determined that the welfare waiver policy was, in fact, a rule \nand subject to the CRA. This week both Chairman Camp and I will \nintroduce resolutions of disapproval under the CRA for the \nadministration's welfare waiver policies. The House will mark up and \npass their resolution this week. The Senate can act, under fast track \nprocedures which limit debate during the week of October 1, 2012.\n\n  I have taken the floor today to ask that the Senate pass my \nresolution of disapproval on a unanimous vote.\n  It is imperative that we send the executive branch the unambiguous \nsignal that the Senate's ability to craft legislation--to do the work \ntasked to us by the Constitution--will not be trifled with by this or \nany other administration. If the Senate does not speak with one unified \nvoice on this issue, then I firmly believe we will have forfeited our \nrelevance in future debates over welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, foster \ncare, and Social Security, just to mention a few.\n  If any administration can capriciously deem themselves to have \nunlimited waiver authority over anything mentioned in provisions \nreferred to in section 1115, then the Senate is, for all intents and \npurposes, irrelevant. Sure, we can have our debates and develop our \nexpertise and write our laws, but, colleagues, that won't mean a hill \nof beans if an administration can come along and just waive everything \nwe have worked so hard to get right. Colleagues and friends, we just \ncan't let that happen.\n  I know that many in this Chamber support President Obama. I know also \nthat many of these same Senators wish he had not taken this action. But \nas Members of what I still believe is the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world, we have to put partisanship aside for the greater good of \nthe Senate. If Senator Byrd were sitting here today, I cannot imagine \nhe would allow this to happen. And I can't imagine anybody on the other \nside will allow this to happen.\n  We have to send as strong a signal as possible that administrative \noverreach will not stand; that no matter what our political persuasion, \nthe Senate stands together and we will speak with one voice to say in \nno uncertain terms that we will not be ridden roughshod over, that our \nconstitutional rights as lawmakers will not be trampled on, and that we \nwill do everything in our power to preserve and defend these rights.\n  To that end, I urge colleagues to support my efforts to stop this \nunprecedented executive overreach. Support the resolution to \ndisapprove. Support the Senate. Let's stand up for this body. Whether \nyou are a Democrat or a Republican, we have to make it clear to the \nother two branches of government that we have certain rights and we \nhave certain powers that no President and no court can overrule. It is \nimportant that we stand up on this issue. If we don't, I hesitate to \nsay what could happen in the future. It ain't gonna be pretty. All I \ncan say is that this is an important issue, it is one every Senator in \nthe Senate ought to consider important, and we ought to set \npartisanship aside and do this in the best interest of the Senate and \nin the best interest of our legislative ability to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Romney-Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk again on the \ndevastating so-called Ryan budget--which, of course, is now the Romney-\nRyan budget. I will speak about that very shortly, but I also want to \nfocus some attention on how the Ryan budget is preventing us from \ngetting a farm bill this year. We have a farm bill we passed in the \nSenate, but the House can't get it done. Earlier this year the Senate \npassed a bipartisan farm bill. It had broad support from Republicans \nand Democrats, all the farm groups, consumer groups, and environmental \ngroups. With all of that support, one would think it would be easy for \nthe House, but the House has not followed suit. Unable or perhaps \nunwilling to bring the farm bill to the House floor, they similarly \nrefuse to take up the Senate bill. As a result, our farm policy has \nlanguished at a time when farm country is literally burning up because \nof a drought.\n\n  As I understand it, the House is going to adjourn this week and go \nhome without taking any action on a farm bill and leave our farmers and \nranchers in the lurch when all the House needs to do is take up the \nSenate-passed bill, pass it, send it to the President, and he will sign \nit. Again, we passed the bill here with Republicans, Democrats, all the \nfarm groups, consumer groups, and environmental groups supporting it. \nWe even made a $23 billion contribution to reducing the deficit in the \nfarm bill.\n  Well, it seems worth noting that one of the reasons the House can't \nact is seemingly because of the Ryan budget, which, of course, we know \nis just a proposal. The House has passed it. I think they voted on it \n34 times, if I am not mistaken.\n  The Ryan budget calls for draconian cuts to our Federal nutrition \nprograms; that is, the SNAP program, otherwise known as food stamps. It \nhelps low-income families and families with maybe a modest income. \nMaybe they lost a job and are in transition and need support for 1 or 2 \nmonths before they get back on their feet. It helps with summer feeding \nprograms for kids, feeding programs for low-income\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\nelderly, and feeding programs that go to daycare centers. In other \nwords, we have an abundance, and we are going to use this abundance to \nhelp make sure no one goes to bed hungry and people have adequate \nnutrition in our society.\n  Well, the Ryan budget made a draconian cut in the nutrition programs. \nMany of the House Republicans are saying they will not support a farm \nbill that doesn't have those draconian cuts, which I am proud to say \nthe Senate bill does not have.\n  I hasten to add, as the former chair of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I long advocated cutting wasteful agricultural spending. For \nyears I led the effort to get rid of direct payments, which the Senate \nbill does finally, and contributes, as I said, $23 billion in deficit \nreduction. So I think this situation shows what the Ryan budget is. It \nis emblematic of the Ryan budget.\n  Not only is the Ryan budget devastating for working and low-income \nAmericans, but its insistence on cutting benefits for low-income \nAmericans is getting in the way of setting commonsense policy for our \nfarmers and ranchers as well. It is remarkable that so many people in \nthe House in the middle of a drought would say: I am not going to vote \nfor a farm bill that is important to our farmers and ranchers; I will \nnot vote for it unless I can cut nutrition benefits for tens of \nmillions of struggling Americans.\n  That is what the House Republicans are saying: They will not vote for \na farm bill that will help our farmers and ranchers and is supported by \nevery major farm group, all the consumer groups, the environmental \ngroups, and it is supported in the Senate by a lot of Republicans. It \nis a bipartisan bill supported by the ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Roberts of Kansas, former chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee in the House. We passed that bill and yet the Republicans in \nthe House are saying unless we have these draconian cuts to nutrition \nprograms they will not pass the farm bill.\n  That is the kind of ``my way or the highway'' attitude of the tea \nparty Republicans in the House. If they can't have it their very narrow \nway, they will not let the rest of the House act. They will not take up \na bipartisan bill passed by the Senate.\n  Well, it is stunning what the House is refusing to do in refusing to \npass a farm bill. All I can hope is that someone over there comes to \ntheir senses and gets that farm bill through before they adjourn and go \nhome.\n  Now, since we recessed around the 1st of August and just came back \nyesterday, our colleague on the House side, Congressman Paul Ryan, has \nbecome the Vice Presidential nominee for the Republican ticket under, \nof course, Governor Romney, who has the nomination for President. \nCongressman Paul Ryan is not an unknown entity and not an unknown \nquantity. He has been around a long time. He has been chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee, and he has put forward the so-called Ryan \nbudget twice.\n  Well, what is a budget? A budget is a blueprint. It is like in order \nto build a house, one has to have a blueprint. Well, a budget for a \ncity council is a blueprint for what they want to do for the city. A \nState budget talks about how the State is going to move. It is forward \nlooking. What are we going to do in the future? The Federal budget is \nthe same way. It is our blueprint. It is a blueprint for how we are \ngoing to move our country forward.\n  We have the Ryan budget. I think it is fair for us to take a look at \nthat blueprint and let the American people know just what is in that \nbudget. We face a fundamental choice in this year's election: Are we \ngoing to restore, rescue, and rebuild a struggling middle class or are \nwe going to ship even more of our wealth and advantages to those at the \ntop at the expense of the middle class?\n  Well, Republicans made it clear where they stand. They did so when \nnearly every Republican in Congress voted for the Ryan budget plan, and \nGovernor Romney embraced the Ryan budget as ``marvelous.'' As I said \nyesterday, that is not exactly a word I think most Americans would use \nto describe something they liked, but I suppose if one is having tea at \nthe Ritz and they are in that class of Americans, well, they might use \nthe word to describe it as ``marvelous.''\n  At the very centerpiece of the Ryan budget is a dramatic shift of \nmore wealth to those at the top. It targets huge new tax cuts for those \nat the top. Here is what it would do: $265,000 more per year for \nsomeone making over $1 million a year in income. That is on top of the \n$129,000 they are already getting from the Bush tax cuts. The Ryan \nbudget would extend the Bush tax cuts and put $265,000 on top of that \n$129,000, which comes to around $400,000 a year if someone is making \nover $1 million a year.\n  We are going to hear a lot this fall about entitlements and cutting \nentitlements. Oh, we have to get a handle on entitlements. When they \ntalk about entitlements, mostly Republicans talk about those programs \nthat go to help people who are at the bottom rung of the ladder. They \nare talking about things such as the SNAP program, the nutrition \nassistance program or they are talking about job training programs or \nmaybe title I. I will talk about education in a minute.\n\n  What about this entitlement? This is an entitlement: If a person is \nmaking over $1 million a year, under the Ryan budget they will be \nentitled to over $400,000 a year in tax cuts. What about that \nentitlement? No one wants to talk about taking away that entitlement, \nbut that is an entitlement.\n  The Republican tax cuts would total $4.5 trillion over 10 years. \nWell, how do they pay for it? They don't want to say, but budget and \ntax experts understand this game very well. The Republican budget would \npartially offset these tax cuts by making deep and Draconian cuts that \nundergird the middle class and essentially the quality of life in the \ncountry--everything from education, student grants and loans, law \nenforcement, clean air and clean water, food safety, medical research, \nhighways, bridges, and other infrastructures.\n  Lastly, the Republicans offset these new big tax cuts for those at \nthe top by actually raising taxes on the middle class. You heard me \nright. The Ryan budget would actually raise taxes on the middle class. \nThe Nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that under the Republican \nplan middle-class families with children would see their taxes go up on \nan average of more than $2,000 a year.\n  The bottom line is the Ryan budget does not reduce the deficit. The \nRyan budget has a deficit for the next 28 years. The savings they gain \nis by cutting all of these programs that undergird the middle class and \nby raising taxes on the middle class. Basically, the lion's share of \nthat is going to go into tax cuts for the top wealthiest Americans.\n  The truth is Representative Ryan is not interested in balancing the \nbudget. Even under the best assumptions his budget would not balance \nuntil 2040, 28 years from now. As I have said, Mr. Ryan is obviously an \nacolyte of former Vice President Cheney who once said in a kind of \nunguarded moment that deficits don't matter. Remember that? Vice \nPresident Cheney said that. Obviously, George W. Bush and his \nadministration took that to heart because we had the biggest deficit in \nhistory for the 8 years George W. Bush was President.\n  Ryan doesn't care about deficits. He only cares about tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. They just believe if we give more and more to the top, it \nwill magically trickle down on everyone else. We know that doesn't \nwork.\n  The Romney-Ryan Republican plan is extreme and unbalanced. I am not \nmaking this up. You don't have to take it from me. Even former House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich criticized the House budget. He called it \n``rightwing social engineering.'' That is what Newt Gingrich called it, \n``rightwing social engineering.'' Newt got that one right.\n  The aim of Representative Ryan is to use the deficit crisis as a \npretext for degrading and dismantling everything from Medicare and \nMedicaid to education, environmental protection, workplace safety, \nmedical and scientific research, and on and on. Again, he doubles down \non the theory that if only we give more to those at the top, it will \nmagically trickle down.\n  Today I would like to focus specifically on the devastating impact of \nthe Romney-Ryan budget on education. It is an unprecedented assault on \neducation funding and a grave threat that this poses to school reform \nefforts across the United States.\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\n  I have the unusual perspective on this issue as both the chair of the \nappropriations subcommittee that funds our Federal education programs--\nand I might point out that for the last 23 years I have either been the \nchair of that appropriations subcommittee or a ranking member; I have \nbeen on that subcommittee since 1985--and I am also now the chair of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which authorizes \nthe education programs, and I have been on that committee since 1987. I \nhave served under distinguished chairmen such as, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Kassebaum, Senator Jeffords, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, \nand Senator Enzi. Now I chair it. So for all of these years I have been \non both the authorizing committee and on the appropriations \nsubcommittee.\n  I must say I have been heartened by the exciting work being done in \nschools across the country to improve the quality of instruction for \nour students to close the achievement gap and graduate more students \nwho are both college and career ready. Forty-five States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have collaborated to create high-quality, common \neducation standards, common core standards. The Obama administration's \nRace to the Top initiative has jump-started ambitious State-level \nreforms to turn around the Nation's lowest performing schools. In the \nHELP Committee, which I chair, working with Senator Enzi this year, we \nreauthorized on a bipartisan basis the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. Positive changes are happening in America's schools. \nHowever, it is wishful thinking to continue to expect improvements if \nwe continue to lay off tens of thousands of teachers, increase class \nsizes, and reduce instructional time.\n\n  As I said, Senator Enzi and I worked very hard to get a \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act through \nour committee on a bipartisan basis, but we have been unable to get it \non the floor, so we will have to do it again next year. But if we look \nto the Ryan budget, we will be laying off tens of thousands of teachers \nand we will increase class sizes and reduce instructional time. Is that \nwhere we want to go as a country?\n  As I said, this plan, which has been embraced by Governor Romney, \nwould cut nondefense discretionary spending by 18.9 percent in fiscal \nyear 2014--not this upcoming fiscal year but the next fiscal year. \nLet's take a look at what a cut that size would mean for Federal \neducation programs. Let's take a look at title I. People ask: What is \ntitle I? It is the cornerstone of the Federal Government's support for \nelementary and secondary education in this country. The purpose of \ntitle I--and, by the way, it has been in the law since 1965; a great \nsociety program, I might add, which has done a world of good for our \nschools all across America. The purpose of title I is to help all \nstudents, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, meet high \nacademic standards. Title I money goes to more than 90 percent of the \nNation's school districts. Schools have a lot of flexibility with title \nI funds, but they use the money mostly to pay the salaries of teachers \nand teachers' aides who are helping students in danger of falling \nbehind.\n  Under the Romney-Ryan budget, more than 10,000 schools across the \ncountry could lose their title I funding in fiscal year 2014. More than \n37,000 teachers could lose their jobs. Not only would this hurt \nstudents, it is going to put more people out of work.\n  This title I program is about $14.5 billion a year. It is a national \nprogram. What we basically said in 1965 and we have said every year \nsince is that elementary and secondary education is basically a local \nand State function. But we want to come in and help those areas that \nhave low tax bases, a high proportion of underprivileged kids and low-\nincome families. We want to come in and help them because there is one \nthing we know: A poorly educated child in one State will not \nnecessarily grow up to be a burden in that State; that child can move \nto another State. So as a national policy, we said in 1965 and we have \nevery year since, under Republican Presidents and under Democratic \nPresidents, Republican Congresses and Democratic Congresses, we have \nsaid title I is an important national program. Under the Ryan budget, \nif enacted, more than 10,000 schools would lose their title I funding.\n  Let's take a look at another important education program--one \nparticularly close to me--and that is the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. Again, this has been in the law since 1975. The funding \nfor this is about $11.6 billion a year. Again, under the Romney-Ryan \nbudget, States could lose funding for approximately 25,000 special \neducation teachers, aides, and other staff serving children with \ndisabilities, again, in the year 2014--25,000 just in 1 year, the year \n2014. This is special education teachers.\n  Again, I wish to remind everyone, and I have said many times here \nbefore, that States are required to provide a free and appropriate \npublic education to students with disabilities. A lot of people say \nthis is a Federal mandate. This is not a Federal mandate; it is a \nconstitutional mandate. Even if the Federal Government didn't provide \none nickel to any State for IDEA, the State would still have to provide \na free, appropriate public education because the courts have decided \nthat if a State provides a free public education for its students, it \ncannot discriminate. Before they said they couldn't discriminate on the \nbasis of sex, national origin, race--Brown v. Board of Education--and \nunder PARC v. Pennsylvania, another case, they said we can't \ndiscriminate on the basis of disability. We can't say we are going to \ncollect taxes from all these people, but this family with the kid with \na disability, they are out, and that kid doesn't get an education. We \nsaid that is unconstitutional, and I think all would recognize that. So \nStates have a constitutional requirement, if they provide a free public \neducation, to provide that free, appropriate public education to kids \nwith disabilities. Even if Federal funding was cut, the States would \nstill have to pay for it. They have to educate their students with \ndisabilities.\n  If the Romney-Ryan budget were to pass, then what would happen is we \nwould offload this cost of education to the States. What would happen? \nState and local taxes would go sky high. States and communities would \nstill have to pay their special education teachers. If they are not \ngetting enough from the Federal Government, they will have to find \ntheir own tax revenues to make up the difference. Just keep in mind, \nunder the Romney-Ryan budget, approximately 25,000 special education \nteachers would not be funded under IDEA in 2014. Think about that.\n  Let's turn to higher education. Since 1972, we have provided what has \nbeen known as Pell grants, named after former Senator Claiborne Pell. \nPell grants are for students who want to go to college. They qualify \nfor these grants because of low income. Another one of those terrible \nentitlements, right? If a person is low income and they want to go to \ncollege, they get a Pell grant. It has been a lifesaver for so many \nfamilies who otherwise could not afford to send their kids to college.\n  As we all know, a college education now is more important than ever. \nNew jobs in every industry from manufacturing, construction, health \ncare, and public health administration require workers who have the \nskill and the education. Look what happened in the recent recession. \nWorkers with a college education have led the economic recovery. People \nwith a bachelor's degree or better have gained 2 million jobs since the \nend of the recession. Meanwhile, workers with only a high school \ndiploma or less have lost more than 230,000 jobs. There are over--I \njust saw it printed today--about 2 million jobs in America that are \nthere but are not being filled because of lack of qualification for \nworkers. That is education. So one would hope the Romney-Ryan budget, \nwhich they tout as being for creating jobs, would put a high priority \non getting people into college, but it does just the opposite. In \nfiscal year 2014, nearly 10 million students could see their Pell \ngrants fall, on average, by more than $1,000. Again, under the Romney-\nRyan budget--this is an average, the current average award is $3,831. \nUnder the Romney-Ryan budget in 2014, in one fell swoop it would go \ndown to $2,599. For some students, that cut could mean the difference \nbetween whether they pursue higher education or not.\n\n  Let's go to the other end of the education spectrum. I started out \ntalking about elementary and secondary and\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\nhigh school and then I talked about college Pell grants. Let's look at \npreschool. Back in 1992, the Council on Education Funding, consisting \nof mostly CEOs from large corporations, came out with a study and a \nreport on education as to what did business in America need in the \nfuture looking at education. They spent 2 or 3 years having hearings, \ninvestigating, and doing all that kind of stuff. This is a report from \nthe business leaders of America. What did they say in that report? They \nsaid education begins at birth and the preparation for education begins \nbefore birth. The whole finding was we need to put more into preschool \neducation. That was 20 years ago.\n  Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--20 years later--came out \nwith another study. This is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These are not \nsocial scientists; these are businesspeople. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce report said we have to put more money into preschool \neducation. We, at the Federal level, have been doing that through a \nprogram called Head Start. We have had Head Start, I think, if I am not \nmistaken, since about 1968. High-quality, early childhood education has \nbeen proven to save taxpayer dollars in the long run by reducing the \ncost for welfare, special education and, might I add, criminal \njustice--read that ``jail time.'' One of the highest correlating \nfactors--in fact, if I am not mistaken, the highest correlating factor \nfor people who are incarcerated in our prisons is the lack of a high \nschool education.\n  Under the Romney-Ryan budget, up to 200,000 low-income children and \ntheir families could lose access to Head Start--again, in fiscal year \n2014. I am not talking about over the next 10 years, I am talking about \nin 1 year. We have about 970,000 children in Head Start today. In 2014, \n200,000 would leave if the Romney-Ryan budget were to happen. That is \ntheir blueprint. I have to keep reminding folks, that is their \nblueprint for where they want America to go. This is where they want \nAmerica to go.\n  Let me talk about a related topic, and it has a lot to do with \neducation; that is, childcare funding. The Child Care and Development \nblock grant provides subsidies to low-income families to help pay for \nchildcare. These are families who are working, who are looking for \nwork, and they depend on these subsidies to do so; otherwise, they \nwouldn't be able to work. By this point, it will come as no surprise \nthat the Romney-Ryan budget would force approximately 95,000 low-income \nchildren across the country to lose access to high-quality childcare in \nfiscal year 2014.\n  I think we get the picture. The Romney-Ryan budget is a devastating \nassault on education at all levels. Childcare--and a lot of these \ncomponents have education--Head Start, elementary education, secondary \neducation, title I, IDEA, special education, Pell grants for college, \nall devastatingly reduced--again, not over 10 years, in year 2014.\n  I am struck by the fact that this budget of Mr. Ryan's is being \nproposed at a time when America's competitors are surging forward. \nChina has tripled its investment in education and is building hundreds \nof new universities. Even in times of austerity and shrinking budgets, \nsmart countries don't turn a chainsaw on themselves. They continue to \ninvest in the future. And the most important investment in the future \nis an investment in education.\n\n  In the months ahead, Congress will likely focus on reducing the \ndeficit, and this is appropriate. Certainly any strategy for solving \nour fiscal crisis must include sensible spending cuts, but we should \nnot jeopardize our long-term economic growth and recovery by slashing \neducation. We have a saying out in farm country: You don't eat your \nseed corn. Our children today, they are our seed corn for the future. \nYou do not throw them on the trash heap.\n  On their own, the Romney-Ryan budget cuts to education defy common \nsense, but put in the broader context of their budget plan in its \nentirety, these cuts are not just ill-considered, they really smack of \nclass warfare. The Romney-Ryan budget demands nothing whatsoever--not \none dollar--from the wealthiest and most privileged people in America. \nEssentially, the Romney-Ryan budget is Robin Hood in reverse: It robs \nfrom the poor and gives it to the rich.\n  So let's get this straight. The American people need to know this. \nThis is their blueprint. Under the Romney-Ryan budget, we have \ndevastating assaults on education. Last night I covered health care. \nOthers will cover other topics. The Senator from California covered \ntransportation and infrastructure.\n  So again, under this plan, the United States--under Romney-Ryan--\nshould set aside $4.5 trillion over the next decade for tax cuts, with \nmost of it going to the wealthiest 2 percent, but under the Romney-Ryan \nbudget we cannot afford to sustain funding for public education.\n  In addition, congressional Republicans specifically want to take away \nthe $2,500 American opportunity tax credit used by so many middle-class \nand modest-income families to help cover college costs. Again, because \nof Republicans' determination to further lower tax rates for the \nwealthy, many other middle-class college tax benefits are at risk. This \nis outrageous. This approach does not remotely reflect the priorities \nand values of the American people. We cannot--we cannot--be dragged \nbackward into a winner-take-all society where the privileged and \npowerful seize an even greater share of the wealth even as our middle \nclass is struggling and declining. For nearly half a century, robust \nFederal investments in quality public schools and access to higher \neducation have been a critical pillar undergirding the American middle \nclass. The Romney-Ryan budget takes a jackhammer to that pillar.\n  Going back to the 1930s, the American people have supported and \nstrengthened a uniquely American social contract. That social contract \nsays that we will prepare our young and care for our elderly. That \ncontract says that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will be \nable to rise to the middle class and even beyond. That social contract \nsays that a cardinal role of government is to provide a ladder of \nopportunity so that every American can realistically aspire to the \nAmerican dream. In one fell swoop, the Romney-Ryan blueprint budget \nwould rip up that social contract. It would replace it with a survival-\nof-the-fittest, winner-take-all philosophy that tells struggling, \naspiring Americans and their communities: Tough luck, you are on your \nown.\n  As President Clinton said in his speech last week: There are two \nphilosophies at work here--the Romney-Ryan blueprint budget, which \nsays: Tough luck, you are on your own; if you win the lottery, you are \nOK; if you do not, too bad, or the philosophy being proposed by \nPresident Obama and so many of us here: that we are all in this \ntogether, the rising tide lifts all boats, that we have a social \ncontract that we have adhered to for nearly 80 years now. We will \ninvest in our young and care for our elderly. We will make sure there \nis a ladder, a ramp of opportunity for the middle class.\n  The ``tough luck, you are on your own'' philosophy of the Romney-Ryan \nbudget is not the kind of America that my parents wanted or that they \nbuilt for their children. It is not the kind of America that my \nneighbors in Iowa and across this country want to see.\n  So in the weeks ahead, our Nation faces an absolutely fundamental \nchoice. I repeat: Are we going to rescue, restore, and rebuild the \nmiddle class or are we going to continue to shift even more wealth and \nadvantages to those at the top, at the expense of the middle class?\n  Accumulation of riches by the wealthiest in our society is not the \nsame as wealth creation by a society. If we are truly interested in \ncreating wealth in our society, we should be investing in education, \nmaking sure there is a ladder or ramp of opportunity by making sure the \nbenefits of our society go to those with new ideas and new information, \nand those people may be kids from very low income families, they may be \nkids with disabilities. That is true wealth creation of a society--not \njust giving more to people at the top.\n  So, again, the Romney-Ryan budget makes exactly the wrong choice. I \ndisagree with that budget. America remains a tremendously wealthy and \nresourceful nation. Again, when you listen to what the Romney-Ryan \nbudget is, when you look at it, it is sort of premised on the fact that \nwe are busted,\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nwe are broke, we cannot afford childcare, we cannot afford title I, we \ncannot afford Pell grants, we cannot afford it, we are broke, but we \ncan find tax breaks for the wealthiest.\n  We are not broke. America remains the wealthiest society, the \nwealthiest country the world has ever seen. We have the highest per \ncapita income of any major nation. So it kind of begs the question, \ndoes it not: If we are so rich, why are we so poor, why are we so \nbroke? Because there has been a misallocation of capital, more and more \ngoing to fewer and fewer, not enough being used to educate our kids, \nprovide a good college education, make sure we have the highest \nqualified teachers in all of our schools, that we have the best \nprincipals, that we can have a school system that is second to none in \nthe world. That is the kind of America that we should have and that we \ncan afford to do. We can afford to do this if we have the right \nblueprint. The Romney-Ryan budget takes us down the wrong road.\n  The middle class is the backbone of this country. We have to rescue, \nrestore, and rebuild it, and we need leaders who have the backbone to \ndo that for our middle class. It is not the Romney-Ryan budget.\n  Last night I spoke about the devastation on health care. I discussed \nwhat would happen in education. Next I am going to come to the floor \nand talk about what is going to happen to working families, what is \ngoing to happen to people in America when we take away some of the \nprotections they have so they do not get injured, they do not get sick, \nso they can show up for work every day healthy. So we are going to look \nagain at that devastation. Others will come to the floor and talk about \nthe infrastructure and what that means for America.\n  Well, I do not often agree with Newt Gingrich, as people know, but he \nwas right. This is rightwing social engineering. We do not need that in \nAmerica. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have put their stamp of approval on \nit. The American people need to know what is in that budget, and we \nintend to tell them between now and the time we adjourn and go home.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi for his patience in \nallowing me to speak for a few minutes in regard to the 11th \nanniversary of September 11. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Eleventh Anniversary of 9/11\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the 11th anniversary of September 11, 2001. The tragedy \nof 9/11 is forever seared in our Nation's consciousness. The attacks in \nNew York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia were intended to crush the \nAmerican spirit but instead galvanized it to new strengths.\n  After 11 years, the memories are still raw and the pain is real. It \nis for the 3,000 people who perished that day that I stand here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and ask everyone: Never let go of those \nmemories.\n  On that day, terrorists showed their utter lack of humanity; we \nresponded by showing the best side of ours. We suffered a grievous loss \non that day, but we must remember that we are a strong and determined \nnation and we will defeat those who want to do us harm.\n  Many of those responsible have been hunted down and brought to \njustice. In the case of Osama bin Laden and many others, justice was \nbrought to them. Now there is no doubt that those who wish to do harm \nto America know they do so at their own peril.\n  Today, it is clear our men and women in uniform and our intelligence \ncommunity will never rest. They will never waiver. We have come a long \nway since September 11, and we owe so much to those men and women and \nthe families who support them. Today, we join to show the world that \nour Nation is united and resolved to defend our freedom and safeguard \nour liberty against any enemy.\n  We also take time to remember those who perished on September 11 and \nto remember their families with a special prayer. We reflect on the \nheroism of the firefighters, police officers, medical workers, city \nofficials, and ordinary citizens who gave their own lives trying to \nsave others.\n  Each of us has been affected by 9/11. On September 11 we showed the \nworld a brand of resilience that could only be made in America. In the \nminutes, hours, and days after the attacks, Americans showed their \namazing propensity for compassion, sacrifice, and selflessness. \nCharity, voluntarism, and a reawakening of the American spirit guided \nus through those weeks directly after the attacks. Men and women waited \nin lines for hours to give blood, children donated their savings to \nhelp with relief efforts, communities sponsored clothing drives, and \ndifferent faith groups held interfaith services. Our response showed \nthe world that Americans have an unquenchable love of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  Now, 11 years later, I stand before you, always remembering that \nstunningly clear day that was to be forever ingrained into our national \nidentity. My prayers are still with those who suffered, those still \nsuffering, and those we lost. But time has taught me that the way to \nhonor the victims of 9/11 is to come together as we did in the days and \nmonths after 9/11. On that day, we were truly united. September 11 was \nnot an attack on Blacks, Whites, Christians, Jews, or Muslims or on \nconservatives or liberals. It was an attack on all of us, and we came \ntogether accordingly. We helped our neighbors and we helped strangers. \nWe reaffirmed our commitment to justice and the rule of law. On that \nday we were reminded that the best parts of our American character will \nforever trump any opponent.\n  So as I stand before you today, I encourage all Americans to nurture \nthe best parts of our common American character. What is that \ncharacter? It was the selflessness and courage of a New York City \nfirefighter running into a smoking tower and up the stairs when \neveryone else was running down. It was the composure, confidence, and \ndecency of bystanders helping perfect strangers. It was the sense of \ncountry that caused many to answer the call of duty and enlist in the \nwar on terror.\n  It was the faith people showed in their fellow citizens that allowed \nfor empathy, not hate to define us afterwards. On this day, let's not \nonly mourn for those we lost but let's vow to them to be as good as \nthey would expect us to be.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was intended to bring this country to new lows \nbut instead we achieved new highs. Keep the memories of 9/11 in our \nhearts and let them guide our actions, actions that show each other and \nthe world how good we are and how good we can be.\n  Archibald MacLeish wrote, ``There are those who will say that the \nliberation of humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \ndream. They are right. It is the American dream.''\n  Surely 9/11 was a nightmare horrific. As horrific and cruel as it \nwas, it cannot extinguish the dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Wendy Gnehm\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have often said how blessed I am to have \nfound a group of people who are strongly committed to the future of \nWyoming, the West, and the United States to serve on my staff. If being \na Senate staff were an Olympic event, I have no doubt I would be the \ncoach of one of the Senate dream teams. I believe they would be the \ngold medal winners. I am that proud of them.\n  Today I wish to express my appreciation to one of my long-time \nstaffers who will be returning home to run a business in Wyoming. She \nis Wendy Gnehm, and although we are going to miss her, we are also \nproud of her decision to return home to raise her family with her \nhusband Ed, because there is no better place for families and children \nthan Wyoming. We wish them both the best and we are confident as she is \nthat they have made the right decision.\n  Although Wendy has been part of my staff for quite some time, her \nfamily, her husband's family, and my own family have been close for a \nlot longer than that. Wendy's mother Sharon was\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nthe one who first introduced me to Diana, now my wife, on a blind date \nin Denver when Sharon was in town looking for a bridal gown.\n  It was not long thereafter that Diana was looking for one too, which \nmeans we knew Wendy's parents long before she was born. So we have \nknown Wendy for all of her life. I remember when Wendy was in high \nschool. She set her sights on coming to Washington to serve as a page \nin the House of Representatives. It was a difficult goal, but with her \ndetermination, her abilities, and her good grades she was able to make \nit happen.\n  Wendy's time in Washington as a page must have given her the idea of \ncoming to college here, which she then began to pursue in earnest. So \nwhen the time was right, I agreed to write her a letter of \nrecommendation to the George Washington University, as an alum and \nWyoming liaison for the school. I was glad to be of help, but Wendy's \ncredentials spoke for themselves and soon she was headed back to \nWashington, DC, to attend one of the finest schools in the country.\n  Later, when I came to Washington to serve in the Senate, I had a \nswearing-in reception for friends and extended family to mark the \nbeginning of this new and great adventure in my life. And of course \nWendy was there. It was at that reception that she met the son of my \ncollege roommate, Skip Gnehm, and they started to date. Their romance \nblossomed while she served as an intern for me, and it started to occur \nto them and to Diana and me how all three of our families could soon be \npermanently intertwined. What a great gift for all of us. Soon Wendy \nwas looking for a wedding gown of her own and she and Ed were married.\n  Not long after their marriage, Ed and Wendy moved to Kuwait to work. \nThey absorbed a great deal of knowledge about the culture and the way \nof life in the Middle East. When they returned to the United States and \nmade their way back to Washington, DC, I learned that Wendy was looking \nfor a job. At the time I happened to be looking for someone who could \nhelp me handle constituent mail and services. She was quickly promoted \nto legislative assistant specializing in the foreign relations field. I \ncould not think of a better individual to take on those \nresponsibilities than Wendy. I was right. Wendy has been a great help \nwith those difficult issues ever since. She did so well, in fact, that \nI did not hesitate to expand her responsibilities to include defense, \nveterans affairs, transportation, and the Judiciary Committee agenda \nwhen the opportunity presented itself. Wendy has worked on so many \nissues of importance over the years--defense, with the focus on the \nUnited States Air Force and missile communities, to helping start the \nAir Force Caucus, veterans health, United Nations reform, Cuba travel, \nimmigration, gun rights, to name a few.\n  She is now my senior legislative assistant, a title and post she has \nearned with her hard work and determination to make a difference. As my \nsenior legislative assistant, she has been a captain in the legislative \noffice and she has always made herself available to help guide and \ndirect our efforts as a legislative team. She is also there to provide \nsome good advice on the issues that are coming up and how we can best \nfocus our efforts to obtain the results we are working together to \nachieve.\n  Now she and her husband are packing up and moving to Sheridan, WY, \nwhere Wendy grew up. They will be running a business there and \nproviding some good jobs to the community and some support to the local \ncommunity economy. It is a restaurant, so they will be providing some \ngood food to people in the area too. Although we are sorry to see them \ngo, we could not be happier that they are returning to Wyoming. I \nalways tell the people from Wyoming who come to work for me: Enjoy your \nWashington experience and learn all you can every day you are here. \nTomorrow, when you find yourself married with children, do not hesitate \nto start looking for a way to get back home.\n\n  As I said, and it bears repeating because it is one of life's great \ntruths: There is no better place to raise your family than Wyoming, \nwhere you were born, where your roots are strong, and your family is \nnearby to give you the love, guidance, and support that helped to make \nyou the person you are today. Of course, it is no surprise that the \nplace that is calling Wendy home is one of the most beautiful on \nEarth--Wyoming.\n  In the years to come, Wyoming will teach Wendy's children all about \nbeing individuals, trusting in your instincts, about facing the future \nwith confidence and faith. It is a great lesson to be learned, and \nthere is no better place to learn it than the great outdoors and open \nspaces and magnificent mountains of Wyoming, where life is centered \naround being a part of the great splendor and creation of God, and with \na strong sense of community.\n  For team Enzi, this was a good-news, bad-news moment. The bad news is \nwe are losing a very special staffer, a good friend, and a member of \nour extended family, someone who has given so much to everyone she has \nknown or worked with here in my office. The good news is we are not \nonly gaining a constituent who knows us and understands the work we do \nevery day, Wyoming is gaining another family that will forever define \nfor others what is so great about being from the West.\n  Diana and I send our best wishes to Wendy, Ed, and their children, \nwho must be looking forward to the opportunity to live the life that \nmade Wendy what she is today.\n  Wendy, we could not be more excited for you and for the great \nopportunities that lie ahead as you begin the new chapter in your life, \nthe great adventure of coming home to Wyoming. We know we will miss \nseeing you every day, but when we are back home and traveling around in \nyour area, we will expect to see you at our official functions and when \nwe stop by your new business. May God bless you and be with you and \nyour family. Good luck, Wendy.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today marks a time in America that \nmust always in the future be remembered. It cannot be forgotten, \nbecause it was the worst day on American soil in modern times. The \nworst day. It was the attack on the World Trade Center in New York, \nShanksville, PA, and the Pentagon.\n  These attacks put together such a horrific toll, we must constantly \nbe reminded. And we are every day of the year. We are reminded how \nterrible this attack was. It was unimaginable, the pictures that we saw \non TV. If anyone turned on the TV, on almost every station there was a \npicture of the strike at the World Trade Center, an airplane running \ninto it. And the first thing that was thought--and unfortunately I was \nout of the country when this took place; I heard about it on the radio, \nand saw people in the country I was in weeping for this great America. \nWe thought it was an accidental thing. We are not far from an airport, \nTeterboro Airport in New Jersey--maybe that it was an errant pilot, \nprobably a single-engine airplane. Nothing could have been further from \nthe truth. This was a designed attack on this building with all of the \nparticulars that the terrorists had to have: How long would it take for \nthe steel to melt, where is the best place to strike, what can the \nconsequences of an attack such as this be? Unimaginable, as I earlier \nsaid.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we lost the second highest number of \nlives of any State in the country. More than 700 people from New Jersey \nperished in this terrible onslaught. September 11, 2001, changed our \ncountry forever. We see it and we are reminded about it every day of \nthe year. If you want to enter many buildings, you have to identify \nyourself; you want to get in an airplane, you have to identify \nyourself; you want to get in these buildings, you have to identify \nyourself. This is a habit that grew out of the fear of terrorism. We \nhave over 200,000 people employed to protect us against a terrorist \nattack. Alhough it was 11 years ago,\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\nfew Americans will forget how that peaceful Tuesday turned into one of \nthe most unpleasant days, most painful days, most heartfelt days on \nAmerican soil. We still feel the pain and the sadness of that day. And \nwhen we think about it, the biggest price, of course, was paid by the \nfamilies, the families who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a \nwife or a grandparent or a friend or a neighbor. The loss was with \nexcruciating pain. We lost nearly 3,000 American lives at the World \nTrade Center and in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon--3,000 American \nlives in a single day. I am reminded, since I served in the Army during \nWorld War II, that Pearl Harbor had fewer casualties than did the \nattack that day; that it outdid the number killed immediately at D-day. \nIt was a terrible tragedy that struck our country.\n\n  Forty-one States and territories and more than 90 countries lost at \nleast a member, a person from that tragedy. Imagine, over 90 countries, \n41 States and territories; and 343 firefighters and 60 police officers \nwere among those who died as they answered desperate calls for help. \nThese people were not present in the building, typically. They came to \nthe building while the flames were there and the soot and the dirt was \nfalling and the building collapsing. They went into those buildings to \nhelp people who were screaming and pleading for help. It has been 11 \nyears, but many Americans are still sick and more than 71,000 Americans \nare still having their health monitored because of exposure to the \ndust, the asbestos, and to the chemicals that filled the air.\n  As we remember those we have lost, we have to let our grief serve as \na reminder of our resilience and to rebuild our strength. While the \nscars of 9/11 may never fully heal, we take some comfort in knowing \nthat in our fight back, we have, in some ways, confirmed our fight \nagainst terrorism. Osama bin Laden will never take another innocent \nAmerican life. But we have to remember that although bin Laden's \ninfluence has been eliminated, there are lots of people who want to \nfollow in his footsteps in plotting against America.\n  The everyday lives of all Americans have changed forever. We now live \nin a state of constant vigilance to prevent another attack. I remember \nnot too long ago, we used to have announcements that this is an orange \ncolor day or a green day or whatever, denoting the risk of an attack \nfrom a terrorist organization or an individual. Because of 9/11, over \n200,000 Americans go to work every day at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to protect us at airports or at buildings or gatherings where \nwe have to show an ID to gain entry. So that day made a huge difference \nin the way we function. It costs time, it costs money, and it costs \ninconvenience. Nothing, however, as I earlier said, compares to the \nloss of a loved one.\n  We are determined now to remain diligent and strong, despite the face \nof terrorism that is frequently depicted these days. As Americans \ngather today in tribute to those we lost, we have to remember to keep \nalive the memories of these Americans who perished for being in the \nplace they were in and not for anything they did wrong. So we have to \nresolve to continue the work of keeping our families safe, our \ncommunities strong, and to be reminded about that, we still see the \ndirect result from that attack, with 71,000 people, including more than \n8,000 from New Jersey, who are currently being monitored for health \nconditions that resulted from the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. That \nis 70,000 people who are having their health monitored and more than \n14,000 responders and 2,500 community residents who are currently sick \nand receiving treatment from the World Trade Center Health Program. \nMany have perished, and we passed a law to offer compensation and \nhealth care for those who are still suffering from the results of that \nterrible day.\n  With that, let me just say I think we have to remember we must stay \nstrong. Unfortunately, there cannot be any relaxation. When we see the \nOlympic games or the Super Bowl or days that mark pleasant competition \nand bonding and youth and energy, we remember those days over 11 years \nago.\n  It is hard to take much consolation, except we know one thing; that \nwe cannot stop protecting our citizens, our people, wherever they are \nin the world--wherever they are in the world. We have seen attacks take \nplace on foreign soil from people who don't know who they are; perhaps \nsome knowing they are American travelers or American diplomats. But \nthere is, again, little satisfaction until one day the world turns more \nsensible and respects human life. We hope that is a situation that is \nforever reflected upon and never forgotten.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I came over earlier to speak and talk about \na dedicated staff person of mine who is moving back to Wyoming, but I \nhad to wait about 30 minutes while I listened to the Senator from Iowa \ntalk about a Romney-Ryan budget. There is no such thing. Governor \nRomney hasn't put forward a budget for this group. Congressman Ryan, of \ncourse, was the chairman of the Budget Committee in the House, and he \nwas obligated to do a budget. He did a budget--something the Senate \nhasn't done.\n  I don't think we can complain about a budget when we have gone 3 \nyears without a budget. There is a timeline for a budget around here. \nWe are supposed to have a budget finished by April 15 of each year, but \nwe have gone 3 years with no budget.\n  The President submitted his budget to us, and that is what we are \nsupposed to work from in the Budget Committee. I am on the Budget \nCommittee, and we have had a little discussion in the Budget Committee. \nWe haven't gotten to do the budget debate on the floor, which is one \nwith unlimited amendments, but we have gotten to vote on the \nPresident's budget. At least Congressman Ryan got some votes for his \nbudget. The President's last two budgets have been voted on by this \nbody and there hasn't even been a single Democrat who was willing to \nvote for that budget--not a single one. The President couldn't persuade \none person from his party to go along with the plan he had for this \ncountry.\n\n  You know what would happen in a corporation if the chairman of the \nboard or the president presented a budget to his board of directors and \nthey rejected it unanimously. He would be looking for a new job. I \nthink I have heard some suggestions along that line.\n  Do we want to continue with out-of-control spending? That is what a \nbudget controls. That is where the caps are put on and it lays out what \nis the most we can spend. We actually ought to be doing that, as we \nused to do it, where there were multiple-year caps, and we would be \nstuck with the far-out caps we projected. It is time we had a balanced \nbudget around here.\n  I applauded the President when he named a deficit commission. That \nwas a great thing. I was a cosponsor on a bill that came before us, and \nwe didn't have enough votes to pass that bill, but the President went \nahead and did a deficit commission and he appointed two outstanding \npeople to chair that budget commission--Erskine Bowles, who was the \nChief of Staff for President Clinton, and Alan Simpson, who was a long-\ntime Senator from the West, a member of the revenue committee--and they \ndid some diligent work with the commission and came up with a plan. \nThey actually came up with a plan for how we could save America.\n  I heard the Senator from Iowa say: Some of these people who are \ntalking are talking like we are broke. You know what. We are pretty \nclose to broke. When the national debt is the same as the gross \nnational product, we are in trouble. In the United States, every man, \nwoman, and child owes a shade over $50,000. We have been seeing the \nriots in Greece and Italy. In Italy, they only owe $40,000 per person. \nIn Greece, they only owe $39,000 per person. Yes, we are the most \nresilient country in the world, and that is why we have a little bit of \nbreathing room. But it is not inhaling time. It is time to figure out \nwhat we are going to do about it.\n  I did expect, after the President appointed this deficit commission \nand when they came back with a report--\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\nand it didn't have enough to force us to have a vote, but it was a \nreport that would solve the situation--I thought for sure at the State \nof the Union speech the President would paint the same bleak picture \nthey painted in order to get the deficit report they got. But instead, \nhe promoted another stimulus.\n  Had he painted that same bleak picture and at the end of his speech \nsaid, I am not telling you tonight how to solve it, but in 2 weeks, \nwhen my budget is delivered to the Senate, you will see what the \ndeficit commission said we ought to be doing and we will do it. I think \nthat by about May of that year, we would have hassled through that \nsituation, and we would have adopted most of what they had in that. It \nwould not have been easy. There would have been a little bit of pain, \nbut it would have had a lot of gain. I think, by this point in time, \nthe President would have been a hero--instead of hearing the question: \nAre you better off now than you were 4 years ago?\n  We can't continue the out-of-control spending we have had. Let me \ngive an example of what we are doing. We are doing it without a budget, \nbut here is what we are doing. The highway bill, that is one of the \nmost important bills--everybody admits--for America. We have to have \ntransportation in this country, and the highway bill is one of the \nmajor ways we do that. It creates jobs because people go out and build \nthe roads or repair the roads, and it makes a difference.\n  But here is how we funded the highway bill: In the Finance Committee, \nI suggested we needed to increase the tax on gasoline. That is the tax \nthat funds the highway trust fund, which is the sole source of money \nfor building the highways before. But we haven't raised that since \n1993, and it ran out of money.\n  The deficit commission President Obama appointed suggested we needed \nto raise the gas tax 5 cents a year for three consecutive years if we \nwanted to build highways. In the Finance Committee I said, I am going \nto put in something a little bit more modest to see if we have any \nsupport for it. I am going to put in something that just deals with \ninflation on the gas tax.\n  I was told we wouldn't have a vote in the Finance Committee on it--\nand we didn't have a vote in the Finance Committee on it. And when it \ncame to the floor, we did not have a vote on that on the floor because \nwe weren't going to raise any taxes. Well, let me tell you what the \nbill does: There is a tax increase in the bill. We just didn't talk \nabout it. I talked about it, but not many people talked about it. There \nis a tax increase in the bill. There is a tax on any private pension \nfund in America. That goes into a trust fund, supposedly.\n  I have a little problem with what we call trust funds around here, \nbecause I don't have trust any of them. That is going into a trust fund \nso that if a company goes out of business, the people who were promised \na pension will get at least 60 percent of what they were promised. That \nis what that tax is for. That is why we do the tax on private pensions. \nThe Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation guarantees that people will \nget a portion of what they were promised in a private pension, and so \nwe raised the tax to make sure that would be there. Then, before it got \nthere, we diverted it, we stole it, we stripped it, and we put it in \nthe highway bill. And we didn't just take 2 years' worth. That is how \nlong the bill covers highway construction. It says in the next 2 years \nall the highways that we will build and how much they will cost. But \nfrom the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation tax that we increased, \nwe took all of that for 10 years to build 2 years' worth of highways. I \ndon't know of anybody who would consider that to be good financial \nmanagement. Highways are essential, but that is not good financial \nmanagement. We have to stop this trend. And we particularly have to \nstop stealing from trust funds.\n  There is one other source of trust fund in there I am particularly \nsensitive to. There is an abandoned mine land fund. This is a fund that \nwas set up where coal mines in the West would get an additional tax--\nwhich we agreed to and the companies agreed to. Half of that tax would \nstay with the State where the coal was mined, and the other half would \ngo to the eastern States to reclaim abandoned mines. It is a good idea. \nWell, Wyoming mines most of the coal in the United States, so Wyoming \ngets most of that money. There is a little provision that they stuck in \nthere to affect Wyoming--and I don't think ought to be the sole source \nof revenue for funding all the highways in the United States, but they \ntook that abandoned mine land money and said that would go into this \nhighway fund. That is a trust fund too. We heard about it at 2:00 in \nthe morning the day before we voted on this bill, and it was a total \nshock to us that they were giving this to the trust fund that was \nbilled as a massive coalition between the East and the West, between \ncompanies and between miners who relied on the companies that went out \nof business for their health care. And abandoned mine land money takes \ncare of that, too. But they said, Well, for Wyoming we think you get \ntoo much money, so we are going to strip out the half that you were \npromised and didn't get for years and years and years while they took \ncare of their own problems. That is in there too and that is in there \nfor a 10-year period for 2 years' worth of highway construction.\n  So when we say that America is not broke, America is not broke. But \nit isn't fixed either. It needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed \nlegitimately, upfront, telling the people exactly what we are doing. \nThere is going to have to be a lot of things that have to be done in \norder to do it.\n  I have suggested one way it can be done--and I have tried to cut \nthings before, and I know that if we try to cut a single program, any \nsingle program--and we have to cut a lot of programs--that program will \ninundate Washington with a few good examples of what that program has \ndone, even though audits of it say that is not what happened. But those \npeople will flood here, they will talk to their Senators, we will feel \nsorry for them, we will approve the program, and we will continue the \nprogram. It is almost impossible to cut a program around here. It is \nhard to cut the amount of increase that program gets, let alone make an \nactual cut to a program or--Lord help us--eliminate a program \naltogether.\n  So what are we going to do? I have a 1-percent solution. That is to \ntake 1 penny out of every dollar the American government spends and \neliminate that, cut that, save that--1 penny out of every dollar. \nPeople across America, when I talk to them about this, say, I have \npersonally had to make a bigger cut than that. I could make 1 percent; \nthe government ought to be able to take 1 percent. And if the \ngovernment made 1 percent for between 5 and 7 years, our budget would \nbalance. That is a lot of discipline, but it is a little pain for a lot \nof gain. And I am pretty sure if we were able to do that, at the end of \n1 year people would say, You know, that didn't hurt that badly, and we \nought to go for 2 and speed this thing up. Because I don't know how \nmuch time we have before interest rates go up, and when interest rates \ngo up, they can use up all of the revenue we have from taxes to pay the \ninterest on the loans we have out there. We have tremendous debt out \nthere, and we had better start taking care of it. I have looked at some \nways to do that, and I will share those at another time.\n  But I hope I don't hear a lot about the Romney-Ryan budget here on \nthe floor when there hasn't been a budget presented and voted on by the \nother side. You have got to have the courage to make some cuts. You \nhave got to have the courage to put forward a budget that is on a \ntrack--a track somehow to getting us back to solvency. And it better \nhappen pretty fast.\n  So I think I am going to feel sorry for whomever gets elected \nPresident, and perhaps whomever is going to be in this body and in the \nHouse next year, because it is not going to be a pleasant task. We are \ngoing to have to buckle down and do the right thing.\n  I got to meet earlier with the new Prime Minister of Italy, and I was \nvery impressed with him. He was talking about what he has to do right \nnow to pull them out of their deficit. Remember, we owe $50,000 per \nperson. They owe $40,000 per person. They are taking the hard steps. He \nhas laid out a plan, he has talked to the people involved. Over there \nthey have strikes whenever they get upset with the government. He had \nto talk to some of the labor\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\nunions. He said, I talked to them and they went out on strike for 2 \nhours. Of course, usually a minimum strike is 3 days over there, so he \nfelt pretty good about that. But he said with the changes that he has \nto make--and it was a reflection on what we are looking at too--\nprobably none of the people will be there next year. Those in the \ncabinet who were sitting next to him were a little bit shocked to hear \nthat. I think if he does the plan, people will appreciate the way he is \nsaving their country and they will put him back in again.\n  But we are looking at some difficult times and we need good \nsolutions. It is going to mean working across the aisle to make sure \nthat gets done. Our time is short. But this is the most resilient \ncountry in the world, and the rest of the world is relying on America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I came to the floor to \ncommemorate the events of 11 years ago on September 11. But I want to \nrespond to my friend and fellow westerner Senator Enzi from Wyoming. I \nappreciate the sentiments and the tone of his remarks. I respect \ngreatly his financial acumen. We know the training Senator Enzi has, \nand I appreciate his call to action hopefully as soon as possible.\n  I would like to stay in Washington and continue to work on the \nSimpson-Bowles architecture. I know my colleague from Colorado, Senator \nBennet, has spent a great deal of time as a member of the Gang of Six \nplus two crafting legislative language to put the Simpson-Bowles \nrecommendations into effect.\n  I did, however, want to set the record straight as I read it and as I \nunderstand it, which is that we have had a Budget Control Act that many \nof us voted for last year which in effect is a budget for 2012 and \n2013.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the documentation of the Budget \nControl Act printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Budget Control Act Contained Budget for 2012 and 2013\n\n     SEC. 106. SENATE BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) For the purpose of enforcing the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 through April 15, 2012, including section 300 of \n     that Act, and enforcing budgetary points of order in prior \n     concurrent resolutions on the budget, the allocations, \n     aggregates, and levels set in subsection (b)(1) shall apply \n     in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012 with \n     appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2011 and 2013 \n     through 2021.\n       (2) For the purpose of enforcing the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 after April 15, 2012, including section 300 of \n     that Act, and enforcing budgetary points of order in prior \n     concurrent resolutions on the budget, the allocations, \n     aggregates, and levels set in subsection (b)(2) shall apply \n     in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2013 with \n     appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2012 and 2014 \n     through 2022.\n       PUBLIC LAW 112-25--AUG. 2, 2011\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The language reads:\n\n       . . . the allocations, aggregates, and levels set in \n     subsection (b)(1) shall apply in the Senate in the same \n     manner as for a current resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2012 . . .\n\n  That language is duplicated below in the next paragraph for 2013.\n  I think I hear my friend from Wyoming suggesting that the process the \nSenate periodically uses to determine a budget is helpful and follows \nregular order, and I agree. But the Congress in the last 2 years has \nbeen at loggerheads. There have been more impasses in the last 2 years \nthan I remember in my 12 previous years. But we do have a budget in \nplace. It is a budget that reduces Federal spending and is a \ndownpayment on the hard work we have to do going forward.\n  The Ryan budget was promulgated by Congressman Ryan. I was elected \nthe same year as Congressman Ryan to the House. I have respect for \nCongressman Ryan and his constituents; I just happen to disagree with \nhis priorities. His budget proposal sets priorities; it is a template. \nAnd if you really study what Congressman Ryan includes, there are \nconcerns that I have that I think are reflected by not just members of \nmy caucus but many Americans: The plan lacks balance, and it doesn't \nbalance at least until 2040, which is not how it is advertised.\n  Why? There is no contribution from revenue. There is an increase in \ndefense spending. And in my opinion, it requires extraordinary and \nunsustainable cuts to government services. In fact, the Federal \nGovernment would be cut in half. I don't think there is anybody who \nthinks that is a realistic goal.\n  President Reagan's economic adviser Bruce Bartlett was pretty tough \non the Ryan plan. He called it a monstrosity, and pointed out that the \nRyan plan is backed up by make-believe numbers and unreasonable \nassumptions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statements \nof Mr. Bartlett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Former Reagan Economic Advisor Bartlett on Ryan Budget Plan\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them. Even as an opening bid to begin \n     budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot \n     be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list than a fairy \n     tale utterly disconnected from the real world, backed up by \n     make-believe numbers and unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's \n     plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just pandering to the \n     Tea Party. A real act of courage would have been for him to \n     admit, as all serious budget analysts know, that revenues \n     will have to rise well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize \n     the debt.\n       Former Reagan Administration Economic Advisor, Bruce \n     Bartlett, Capital Gains and Games Blog, Imbalanced Budget: \n     Ryan Gives Wealthy a Free Pass, April 11, 2011.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. In conclusion, I want to again underline that \nI find, as always, in Senator Enzi someone who is thoughtful, \npractical, and pragmatic. And I heard in his comments a call to action \nwhere everything would be on the table, including providing for greater \nsolvency of Social Security and Medicare, for cutting spending and \nending duplication, but also for looking for additional revenue, which \nI think we all agree we can start to do by simplifying the Tax Code, \nreducing rates, and then taking a look at individual tax rates.\n  Mr. President, I was here 11 years ago. It was a very similar day to \ntoday; a beautiful fall day, low humidity. For us Coloradans, low \nhumidity is something we expect in all cases, with bluebird skies. But \nit turned into a terrible day with terrible events, and I thought I \nwould reflect on what they mean for our country 11 years later.\n  These attacks are forever etched in our collective memory. We lost \n3,000 fellow Americans. It was a diverse cohort of Americans. Every \nreligion was represented, every race, and every region. It was \nsomething that even as I try and think about it again, I am almost \noverwhelmed.\n  But we also have another memory associated with that day; and that \nwas the amazing, beyond belief, selflessness and bravery of our first \nresponders and the men and women of uniform as well as the resolve of \nwhole communities who came together to help and comfort one another. \nLate in that day, lawmakers came together on the U.S. Capitol steps, as \nwe did today, to say, We stand united.\n  During this time, Americans seeking some good to come out of these \nacts of sheer evil looked to each other and to their leaders in \nWashington to contribute to a greater cause of unity. At such a dark \ntime, we saw the very best of America: a Nation, a community, and a \npeople willing to stand together in the face of adversity that we \ndidn't initially understand or comprehend. That strength of unity \nbrought us together, and over the last decade we have made great \nstrides in combating the evil of terrorism.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude, a deep debt of gratitude to those on the \nfront lines of that battle. Intelligence officers, our men and women in \nuniform, and countless others have relentlessly pursued our enemies who \nseek to do us harm. We must honor their sacrifices.\n  That brings me to this point. Every time a veteran is unemployed or \nhas injuries that are not well treated or finds himself or herself in a \nplace so dark that suicide seems like the only way out, we failed in \nour most solemn duty. We must provide the best possible health care, \nservices, and benefits\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\nto those few Americans who are willing to risk anything and everything \nfor us. We should be ashamed of anything less.\n  That is why it is fitting today, on the anniversary of 9/11, that the \nSenate voted to move forward on legislation to help post-9/11 veterans \nfind jobs. Congress and the administration have been focused on helping \nthese vulnerable veterans find jobs. We passed legislation. The \nPresident has championed initiatives providing tax incentives and \ngrants to businesses hiring veterans and offering veterans job training \nprograms, but still the unemployment rate for veterans of the \nAfghanistan and Iraq wars remains higher than for the general \npopulation and much higher for veterans age 18 to 24. That simply is \nnot acceptable. We can and we must do better.\n  The bill we are going to consider, the Veterans Job Corps Act of \n2012, is a solid step in the right direction. We all recognize the \nobstacles that veterans face in translating their military experience \ninto civilian jobs. We know that is the case. This commonsense \nlegislation will attempt to smooth this transition by connecting \nveterans with good-paying jobs that fit their skill sets and provide \nour communities with opportunities to hire veterans as firefighters, \npolice officers, to work in the public safety sector--to work in any \nsector. When our veterans believe in themselves, they are up to any \ncharge; they are up for any mission.\n  I have the great privilege--as does, I know, the Presiding Officer--\nto serve on the Armed Services Committee. I also serve on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. As a member of those committees I urge all of \nus to pass this bill as soon as possible. There is still time. We could \nperhaps offer it tonight. I could offer a unanimous consent request. We \nneed to do this--and I am completely serious, Mr. President--to provide \nour heroes with a small measure of what we owe them for their \nincredible service and sacrifice.\n  As I think more widely, as I consider what I have heard at home from \nColoradans far and wide, passing this bill alone is not enough. Looking \nback at the days and months after September 11, I cannot help but \nadmire our Nation's resolve and the sense of togetherness we had in \nfacing a shared challenge. But I also cannot help but be well aware \nthat 11 years on we are now a nation at odds. Partisanship is at an \nall-time high, congressional gridlock prevents even commonsense ideas \nfrom winning the day, and middle-class Americans just wonder when \nbusinesses will have the certainty they need to begin hiring again.\n  For me, it seems a powerful argument and a powerful insight that a \nbetter future for our country can be and is, if we will hear it, \ngrounded in our Nation's deep-seated respect for the courageous feats \nand sacrifices of those who answer the call of duty. Our military men \nand women have done their job. The public safety officers in the city \nof Aurora, back in July when we experienced such a terrible shooting, \nhave done their job. Now it is, here in the Congress, time for us to do \nour job. It is not too late for us to harness the gratitude and the \nadmiration that we have for those who have given everything for the \nUnited States and come together once again to do right by the Nation \nthey have fought so hard to secure.\n  As we remember the events of September 11 and honor those men and \nwomen in uniform who fought so hard to keep America safe, we must \nrecognize that our actions, not just our words, in the months ahead may \nbe the greatest way to show our appreciation for their sacrifice.\n  Let's employ the doggedness of our military men and women, that \ndoggedness that they exhibit on a daily basis in order to address the \nshared challenges of our time, to work together and to cast aside the \npartisan differences that stand in the way of our future prosperity. \nThe American people deserve no less.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nrecently filed with Senator Leahy to the Veterans Jobs Corps Act of \n2012. We filed this amendment to ensure that veterans service \norganizations are provided access to Federal surplus property as we \nintended when we introduced the FORVETS Act of 2010. This law provides \nthat veterans service organizations should be categorized as eligible \nnonprofit, tax-exempt organizations that may acquire surplus personal \nproperty for the purposes of education or public health.\n  Unfortunately, the General Services Administration has interpreted \nthis law in the strictest of terms. In its published guidelines, \nveterans service organizations may acquire the surplus property for the \npurposes of education or public health but with minimal flexibility in \nwhat an educational or public health service may be. For example, \nacquiring a van to transport a disabled veteran to a doctor's \nappointment may not be considered an eligible use for a veterans \norganization under current guidelines.\n  This amendment makes the legislative modification necessary for GSA \nto carry out the original intent of the FORVETS Act of 2010.\n  The National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property, \nNASASP, has identified the need for this legislative modification to \nensure that veterans service organizations are able to receive surplus \nequipment to enable them to better provide the critical services they \noffer for our Nation's veterans.\n  Veterans groups whose work enhances the lives of countless veterans \nevery day benefit from access to these goods just as other service \norganizations do. Many veterans organizations offer career development \nand job training assistance to our Nation's veterans, yet often lack \nthe computer equipment needed to best assist our veterans in the often \ndifficult transition from military service to the civilian work force.\n  These are just a few examples of the needs that veterans service \norganizations have. This amendment is one way to say ``thank you'' to \nthose Americans who have worn the uniform and to the families that \nsupported them. In these challenging fiscal times, the need for excess \nfederal property to be used for job training, rehabilitation, and other \nimportant assistance to our veterans is greater now more than ever.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of this amendment to \nthe Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012.\n  Mr. President, since 2004, active duty military suicides have more \nthan doubled, and the problem only continues to get worse. The Army \nrecently reported that in July of this year 38 of its soldiers took \ntheir lives, a rate of more than one per day. This is a tragedy of the \nhighest magnitude and it is something that the Congress and the \nAmerican people must not ignore. Action is needed now, and we must take \nevery practical step that we can to help the military reverse this \ndisturbing trend. Not only are we losing dozens of America's finest \neach month, squandering precious talent that our Nation needs, but \ntoday's soldiers are tomorrow's veterans, and the crisis of mental and \nbehavioral health that the epidemic of suicides represents foreshadows \na troubling prospect for the future.\n  In Afghanistan, we have invested billions of dollars and devoted some \nof the military's best minds to protect our soldiers and give them the \ntools they need to reduce the threat of an improvised explosive devise \nattack. Unfortunately, we have only devoted a fraction of the same \nresources or creativity to suicide prevention, even though through \nearly June 2012 military suicides had outpaced the number of combat \ndeaths in Afghanistan. It is estimated that more than 250 soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines have taken their own lives this year.\n  There is substantial evidence that prescription drug abuse is a major \nfactor in military suicides. In its January 2012 report Army 2020: \nGenerating Health and Discipline in the Force, the Army found that 29 \npercent of suicides had a known history of psychotropic medication use \nincluding anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medicine, anti-psychotics, and \nother controlled substances such as opioids.\n  Active-duty drug use was a factor in more than a third of suicides \nwhere drug use could be determined and a factor in two-thirds of \nsuicide attempts. The Army's report recommends the establishment of a \nmilitary drug take-back program to help combat prescription drug abuse \nin the ranks. Given that more than 49,000 soldiers were issued three or \nmore psychotropic or controlled substance prescriptions last year and \nan estimated 3,500 soldiers illicitly used prescription drugs, it's \ntime we act on this recommendation.\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\n  At present, only the Drug Enforcement Administration has the inherent \nauthority to conduct a drug take-back program. The Secure and \nResponsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, however, provided the Attorney \nGeneral the flexibility necessary to delegate similar authority to \nother agencies to conduct a drug take-back program. Thus far, however, \nthe Attorney General has declined to act, and neither the Attorney \nGeneral nor the DEA has provided mechanisms or authority to the \nmilitary to establish its own drug take-back program.\n  Senator Lieberman and I, building on work done by Senator Murray, \nwrote the Attorney General in July of this year to request his support \nfor efforts to reduce military suicides by allowing military treatment \nfacilities to conduct controlled substance take-back and destruction \nprograms.\n  Senator Lieberman and I understand that accountability of drugs must \nbe strictly maintained and that these drugs must be prevented from \nbeing misused, abused, or from entering the black market. We are \nconfident, however, that an accountable drug take-back program could be \nestablished at military treatment facilities with sufficient safeguards \nput in place to prevent diversion, misuse, theft, or loss of returned \ndrugs. Military treatment facilities are unique, and the military has \nestablished successful accountability programs for handling nuclear \nweapons, conventional weapons, and classified materials. We have no \nreason to doubt that an appropriate degree of accountability could be \nestablished in a drug take-back program.\n  Excluding the military from conducting drug take-back programs has a \ndetrimental effect on the military's ability to reduce controlled \nsubstance abuse in the Force, decrease non-medical use of prescription \ndrugs, prevent diversion of controlled substances, and limit the \npossibility for accidental overdose and death for our servicemembers or \ntheir family members. Providing this authority will give the military \none more tool in its efforts to reduce suicides.\n  The loss of even one servicemember to a potentially preventable \nsuicide involving controlled substance abuse or misuse is unacceptable. \nFor that reason, Senator Lieberman and I filed this amendment to the \nVeterans Jobs Corps Act. I urge my colleagues to support inclusion of \nthis amendment in this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, today we remember September 11, \n2001, 11 years ago, a Tuesday like today was, a beautiful day like \ntoday was, but a day of horror incited by a hateful ideology. We, of \ncourse, cannot afford to forget what happened, but let's remember what \ncan happen when Americans come together.\n  On this national day of remembrance we honor those who lost their \nlives 11 years ago, the daughters and sons, mothers and fathers, \nsisters and brothers from various walks of life and avenues of faith. \nWe honor the families of the victims. We honor the survivors. We honor \nthe courageous civil servants and first responders, most of them union \nmembers, who lost their lives and suffered illnesses because of their \nselflessness. We salute the servicemembers and their families who \nsacrificed so much since these tragic events.\n  More than a decade later we all remember where we were on that clear \nTuesday morning. I remember feeling the fear and uncertainty when \ngathering my staff at a location near the Capitol. Regardless of where \nwe were on that fateful day, whether speaking English with a Brooklyn \naccent or as a first generation American learning English as a second \nlanguage or those of you from the Midwest who perhaps speak with a bit \nof a Midwestern accent--although Midwesterners do not have an accent--\nwe all came together. Regardless of where we worked--in a manufacturing \nplant in Cleveland or a farm near Lima--we came together. This is this \nspirit or solidarity we reaffirm today.\n  Today we must come together again and focus on moving forward as one \nnation in spite of our differences.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense \nwith the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Second Anniversary of the Chevrolet Cruze\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. This weekend, I believe it was Saturday, I was in \nLordstown, OH, celebrating the 2-year anniversary of the first Chevy \nCruze that came off the Lordstown GM Chevy plant line. I was there the \nday the first Cruze came out. The first three cars--painted red, white, \nand blue--represented the determination of workers and that company and \nthe Nation to succeed to bounce back, despite national naysayers who \nwere willing to stand idly by while our economy stalled.\n  We read it in newspapers, saw it on television, heard it on the radio \nhow some elected officials not only wanted to turn their back on an \nindustry that has provided middle-class wages, college educations, \nhomes, and cars to millions of Americans, but a number of elected \nofficials wanted to bet against the American automotive industry.\n  During the height of the economic crisis, when American manufacturing \nwas sputtering--and the Presiding Officer knows the statistics because \nhe paid attention in his State of Alaska, which is not so much a \nmanufacturing State but a State that contributes a lot to \nmanufacturing. The Presiding Officer knows what has happened in this \ncountry. From 2000 to 2010, we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs. That \nwas one-third of all the manufacturing jobs in this country. Six \nthousand plants closed in the United States in that decade. Since \n2010--and more on that in a moment--because of the auto rescue and \nbecause we have a Federal Government that is willing to enforce trade \nlaws, we have seen a growth of 500,000 manufacturing jobs, the first \ntime we have seen month-to-month manufacturing job growth for almost \nevery month for 2-plus years. It is the first time since 1999 this \ncountry has actually seen any manufacturing job growth.\n  Some said: Let the industry go bankrupt. A Presidential candidate \nsaid--I believe his words to Detroit were along the lines of drop dead; \nthat wasn't something we wanted to do, to do anything to help that \nindustry. They were willing to let the auto industry go bankrupt and \nthen see what happened.\n  Some of these naysayers thought it was OK to bail out Wall Street. \nThey thought it was OK to pad the salaries of reckless bankers who \ndrove our economy off the cliff. It wasn't the nonunion autoworker in \nMarysville who built the Honda, it wasn't the Chrysler autoworker in \nToledo who built the Wrangler or the Liberty, it wasn't the Chevy \nautoworker in Lordstown who built the Cruze, it wasn't the autoworker \nin Defiance who built the engine or the glass worker in Crestline who \nmade the glass for the Chevy Cruze or the aluminum worker in Cleveland \nor the steelworker in Middletown who caused the collapse of the economy \nand the problems with the banks. In many ways, they were blamed by the \npeople who bet against America, who were willing to say it is OK to pad \nthe salary of reckless bankers, even though they are the ones who drove \nthe economy off the cliff.\n  They railed against rescuing autoworkers in places such as \nHolmesville, Waverly, Middletown, and Youngstown. The easy road--and it \nwasn't the easy road by a long shot--isn't always the right path, not \nwhen this many jobs are at stake, paying these kind of wages, \nstrengthening this middle-class.\n  The Chevy Cruze represents what was at stake. Three days ago, when I \nwas in Lordstown, we marked the day of the 2-year anniversary, how \nresilient we can be when we make decisions not based on politics but \nwhat is best for the country. Plain and simple, the auto rescue was the \nright choice.\n  Last year, the Cruze was elected the Car of the Year by the North \nAmerican Dealer Association. Now it is the best-selling compact car in \nAmerica. My\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\ndaughter drives one. My wife traded in her 6-year-old Pontiac Vibe and \nbought a Chevy Cruze. Just a few short years ago, 1,000 workers in \nLordstown were laid off. Today, nearly 5,000 workers build one of the \nfastest selling small cars in the country.\n  For people such as Glenn Johnson, who is the local President in the \nLordstown assembly plant, the politically unpopular decision to save \nthe auto industry was about saving the livelihood for hard-working \nfamilies in Ohio and in the Midwest. Two years later, we are moving \nforward. GM profits are up. GM has been profitable for 10 consecutive \nquarters. None of the naysayers thought it could possibly happen. None \nof the naysayers were willing to invest in GM and to find private \ncapital. It only happened because taxpayers stepped forward because the \ngovernment was willing to understand and recognize that this mattered \nfor our country.\n  GM has announced plans to make a $200 million additional investment \nin Lordstown, where they have added a third shift to produce the Chevy \nCruze. Chrysler has invested tens of millions of dollars in Toledo. \nHonda has invested tens of millions of dollars in a new model in \nMarysville. Ford has invested tens of millions of dollars in Cleveland. \nAll three American auto companies and the major U.S. auto transplant \nHonda have all made major investments in Ohio since the auto rescue. \nThe Cruze epitomizes how essential the auto industry is in Ohio.\n  The engine for the Cruze is made in Defiance, the transmission for \nthe Cruze is made in Toledo, the brackets are made in Brunswick, the \nglass for the Wrangler is made in Crestline, the sound system for the \nCruze is made in Springboro, the underneath steel for the Cruze comes \nfrom Middletown, the exposed steel comes from Cleveland, the seat frame \ncomes from Lorain, the seats are made in Warren, and the aluminum for \nthe Chevy Cruze Eco comes from Cleveland. The car is assembled by 5,000 \nworkers in Lordstown, OH.\n  This success story goes far beyond one State. In my State alone, \nhundreds of thousands of jobs are associated with the auto industry. \nThere are 120,000 Ohioans who are directly employed by automakers, \ndealers, and supply chain parts manufacturers. We know even with that \nsuccess and even with the success of enforcing trade laws, which have \nturned into--as a result of enforcing trade rules, we have a new steel \nmill in Youngstown. More tires are made in Findlay and more aluminum is \nmade in Heath and Sidney, OH. More steel is made in Lorain and \nCleveland.\n  Because we have enforced trade rules, that doesn't mean we don't need \nto do more. The economy is still not what it should be. Our \nunemployment rate from 2 years ago went from over 10.5 percent to under \n7.5 percent, but it is clearly still not enough because far too many \nworkers in Ohio, Alaska and America and all over are underemployed or \nunemployed.\n  We are moving in the right direction. Since January of 2010, after a \nfull decade of manufacturing job loss from 2000 to 2010, where 5 \nmillion manufacturing jobs were lost, we have gained 500,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in those 2 years.\n  Supporting America means valuing workers. It is patriotic to support \nAmerica's middle class. When it comes to protecting American workers \nand supporting American manufacturers and boasting America's middle \nclass, we still have much to do. We have made major progress in the \nlast years. We have much to do. We have no choice but to move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6098-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I rise in memory of an unspeakable tragedy \nthat shook our great Nation free of the belief that we are an \nuntouchable force in the modern world, 11 years ago today.\n  Eleven years ago today an unspeakable tragedy shook our great Nation \nfree of the belief that we are an untouchable force in the modern \nworld.\n  Today, as we honor the nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children \nwho lost their lives at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in a \nfield in Shanksville, PA, we must remember more than the pain and rage \nthat followed the events of that Tuesday morning.\n  I cannot help but compare that day to the morning of December 7, \n1941, when Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, killing more than \n2,400 sailors, soldiers, and civilians, and plunging our Nation into \nWorld War II.\n  The bombing of Pearl Harbor moved me to put on the uniform and join \nthousands of my brothers in a fight that spanned across Europe and the \nAsia Pacific.\n  Like Pearl Harbor, the events of September 11 forced our Nation to \nsend troops into Afghanistan, and later it was used to help justify the \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  More than 6,000 of our brave men and women have died fighting in \nthose countries, and, like World War II, the loss of life and American \nresources is staggering.\n  These attacks on America, the wars that followed, and the aftermath \nwhere we searched for hope and dealt with the pain of loss, altered our \nnational consciousness and fortified us for the future that we continue \nto work hard to build.\n  To move forward, we must recognize that September 11 was a painful \nreminder that America must remain ever vigilant to the threats posed by \nforeign forces and those who abhor the freedom and equality that \ndefines our great Nation.\n  But most importantly, we have to understand the role America plays in \nthe global community, and we must be respectful of our place and work \nhard to use what we have been blessed with to ensure that peace and \ngood will reign, regardless of our differences.\n  I speak from experience when I say that no matter the justification \nand no matter the final outcome, no nation, no people, escape from war \nunscathed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, eleven years ago today, on a crisp early \nautumn morning much like today's, I was at the Supreme Court for the \nsemiannual meeting of the Judicial Conference when I got word of the \nfirst attack of 9/11. I quietly informed Chief Justice William \nRehnquist, who was presiding over our meeting. Soon afterward we heard \na muffled ``bump,'' followed by a report that a car bomb may have gone \noff across town at the State Department. Of course, we later learned \nthat this had been the sound of another plane, as it slammed into the \nPentagon.\n  I remember later that day, evacuating my staff from the Russell \nSenate Building. I remember crossing along the West Front of the \nCapitol as two fighter jets streaked up the Mall. I remember the \nunnatural stillness of a big city in shock, similar only to what I saw \nas a law student at Georgetown, when a pall descended over Washington \nafter the news that President John F. Kennedy had been killed.\n  At this morning's meeting of the Judicial Conference in that same \nroom where we met 11 years ago on this date, several participants \noffered reflections about this somber anniversary.\n  I noted that much of what holds our country together in times of \ncrisis is the integrity of the three branches of our constitutional \ngovernment. In recent times, for temporary political gain, there too \noften has been the temptation to tear down our foundational \ninstitutions, undermining the public's faith and confidence in our \nsystem. Over time, that cannot help but erode that foundation. I \npointed out that this was why, the day after the attacks 11 years ago, \neach and every Senator made the effort to be in his or her seat in an \nunmistakable gesture of unity of purpose. We knew that we had to reopen \nthis emblem and pillar of American democracy, and I was proud to be in \nmy seat representing Vermont when the Senate convened for business that \nnext morning.\n  Over this past decade, as Americans we have gathered each year on \nthis date to remember the thousands of innocent lives that were taken \nso casually and so callously on that terrible morning. We also remember \nand honor the brave first responders and military servicemembers who \nhave lost their lives protecting and serving our country. It has been \nmore than a year since\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nPresident Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had finally been brought \nto justice. Although his death will never heal the pain of the families \nwho grieve their losses, we all hope that it will bring a degree of \nclosure and a measure of solace to them, and to all Americans.\n  In the aftermath of this tragedy, it became clear that changes to our \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies were needed to address the \ngovernment's failure to connect the dots before the attacks. I have \nworked to ensure that Federal agencies have the tools they need to make \nour borders more secure, improve our intelligence gathering, track down \nterrorists and bring them to justice, in ways that are consistent with \nour laws and fundamental values. I firmly believe that we can keep our \nNation safe without relinquishing our values.\n  The last 11 years have further exposed the perversity and bankruptcy \nat the core of al-Qaida's philosophy and the resilient strength at the \ncore of America's foundational principles. We are a people whose power \nis in our diversity, our principles, and our liberty. No attack on our \nshores has ever taken those from us, and no attack ever will.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I remember, as many do, exactly where I \nwas on this day 11 years ago. On that Tuesday morning the United States \nsuffered a terrible attack that resulted in almost 3,000 immediate \ndeaths. When we think of 9/11, we remember the shock, horror and \nfeelings of helplessness. But as we reflect on that day, we also \nremember the outpouring of compassion and common purpose that united us \nthen and in the days, weeks, and months that followed. We remember the \ncourage shown by the firefighters, po1ice, and other first responders, \nby the passengers of United Flight 93, and by so many others. That day \nleft us with a resolve to regroup, rebuild and recover while renewing \nour country's reputation as a world leader and symbol of freedom.\n  Eleven years later, Americans have shown that our resolve cannot be \nbroken. We remember and honor all those who have and continue to \nsacrifice to keep us safe, especially the more than 2 million members \nof our military who have served in the years since 9/11.\n  We should also remember the spirit of unity and determination that \nfollowed in the weeks and months after 9/11. We were not divided as \nDemocrats and Republicans, we were Americans united in purpose. We \nwould do well in these divisive campaigns to reflect on that unity as \nAmericans and pledge to work together to advance the best interests of \nthis great nation.\n  On this day of remembrance to our fallen heroes, I urge all Alaskans \nand Americans across the country to join together in service to our \nneighbors and communities.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, although 11 years have \npassed since September 11, 2001, our hearts still ache for the families \nof the victims as we recall the horror and disbelief of that day. The \nattacks were a barbaric assault on our Nation's values, meant to crack \nthe foundations of our civilization, strike fear in our hearts, and \nshake our resolve as a people. But the terrorists have failed in their \ntwisted objectives, as we remain steadfast in our belief in the \ngoodness of our Nation and her enduring ideals. We will never forget \nthe tragedy of that day and the lives that were lost, just as we will \nnever forget the sacrifices made by our troops to protect our freedoms. \nToday, we stand proudly as Americans first.\n  Among the nearly 3,000 innocent lives taken in the terror attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, were more than 90 residents of my State of \nMassachusetts. In alphabetical order are those residents and more than \n110 victims with close personal ties to the Commonwealth:\n\n       Anna S. W.

Mr. President, like others in this body, including Senator \nUdall of Colorado and my fellow senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, \nI support extending the production tax credit for wind energy. This \nextension is critical to maintaining America's leadership in green \nenergy development and can directly increase domestic job growth. \nVermont has already seen the positive results of the production tax \ncredit for wind energy, but the wind industry impacts our entire \ncountry. Every American has a stake in the extension of this tax \ncredit.\n  I am proud that Vermont is a leader in green energy. My State has set \nambitious, yet achievable, goals to develop renewable energy resources \nand technology. We are doing our part to promote job growth, national \nsecurity, and environmental benefits that tap into local, renewable \nenergy sources. Yet despite these efforts, Vermont has already \nexperienced negative consequences from the uncertainty that surrounds \nthe extension of this tax credit.\n  I frequently hear the success stories in the renewable energy \nindustry coming out of Vermont, and from industry leaders there about \nthe exciting new projects they are developing. But this summer, the \nstories have been different. One such company, NRG Systems in Vermont, \nhas been a global leader in wind measurement. The company's CEO, Jan \nBlittersdorf, and her team of dedicated employees take great pride in \ndelivering precise, reliable and proven wind measurement and turbine \ncontrol equipment. Jan is an industry leader who has been recognized as \na Champion of Change by President Obama and who has been praised for \nher renewable energy work and efforts to advance the role of women in \nthe green energy sector.\n  During the recession, as jobs were being cut in many sectors across \nthe country and in Vermont, NRG bucked the trend by hiring new workers, \nand the company continued to innovate and look for ways to grow their \nbusiness. Today, you can find their products in more than 144 \ncountries. Now, however, due to the uncertainty surrounding the \nextension of the production tax credit, companies like NRG are putting \nnew projects on hold, and for the first time in its 30 year history NRG \nSystems has been forced to lay off workers--a devastating prospect for \na business in a rural state that has prided itself on its ability to \nadapt to changing market conditions and its strong support for its \nworkers.\n  These are skilled and dedicated employees losing vital domestic jobs. \nAmerican workers cannot afford a delay in the extension of the \nproduction tax credit. At a time when manufacturing jobs have been \nshipped overseas, the wind energy sector has done the opposite: it has \nadded manufacturing jobs here in America. Wind energy companies, like \nNRG Systems, are entrepreneurs who are doing the kind of groundbreaking \nwork that drives our economy.\n  We have a chance to invest in jobs for America, rather than \nsubsidizing the oil industry to the tune of billions of dollars every \nyear. Our continued dependence on fossil fuels ensures that we will \nhave more of the extreme weather events that have long been a predicted \nconsequence of global warming, such as the drought that is devastating \nour Nation's farmers this summer and the terrible flooding from \nHurricane Irene last summer. It is time to say goodbye to the big oil \ntax subsidies and usher in a new era of wind energy. The benefits are \nclear: wind energy has propelled a sustainable and domestic energy \nsource, increased jobs for Americans, and strengthened our domestic \nenergy security.\n  These are jobs we cannot afford to lose. In Vermont, and for the wind \nindustry across the country, NRG Systems is the canary in the coal \nmine--an early indicator of the crisis that the wind industry is headed \ntoward if the production tax credit is not extended. This crisis is \nsomething we have seen every time this tax credit has lapsed. Each time \nthe production tax credit has been allowed to lapse, revenues in the \nwind industry fall precipitously, businesses shutter their doors, and \nworkers lose their jobs. There are ways to avoid this catastrophe.\n  We must continue the production tax credit now or we will most \ncertainly cede these jobs to other countries. I urge all Senators to \njoin me in supporting these important credits. They support American \njobs, American companies, American ingenuity, and American energy \nsecurity. We should extend the production tax credit for wind and \ncontinue America's leadership in this growing energy sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6101-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for women \nand families affected by ovarian cancer. In 2012, it is estimated that \napproximately 22,280 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and \n15,500 will die of the disease. In my State of Minnesota, an estimated \n260 women will die from ovarian cancer this year. Too many American \nwomen--sisters, daughters, nieces, wives, friends, neighbors, and \ncoworkers--are losing their lives to this disease.\n  Because no ovarian cancer screening or early detection test exists, \norganizations such as the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance stress that \n``until there's a test, awareness is best.'' I commend the Ovarian \nCancer National Alliance for its steadfast commitment to make women \naware of the risk factors, signs, and symptoms of ovarian cancer and \nfor its advocacy on behalf of women and families touched by this \ndevastating disease. I also would like to commend the Ovarian Cancer \nNational Alliance's Partner Member groups in my State, including the \nMinnesota Ovarian Cancer Alliance, which is one of the largest funders \nof research for ovarian cancer in the country.\n  Experts recommend that women see a gynecologist if they experience \nany of the often subtle symptoms of ovarian cancer daily for more than \na few weeks. Four major symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, \npelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, \nand frequent or urgent need to urinate. I ask all of my colleagues to \nbecome familiar with these symptoms and to share the information with \ntheir friends, family, staff, and constituents.\n  Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women and the \nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, making it the deadliest \nof gynecologic cancers. If ovarian cancer is treated before it has \nspread outside the ovary, the 5-year survival rate is 93 percent. \nCurrently, only 15 percent of ovarian cancers are found at such an \nearly stage and overall the relative 5-year survival rate is 46 \npercent. I urge my colleagues to help make women aware of the potential \nwarning signs to prevent future deaths. Experts acknowledge that \nsymptoms can be vague and may be associated with other medical \nconditions. However, as the saying goes, it is better to be safe than \nsorry.\n  September is National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month--an important \ntime during which ovarian cancer organizations, advocates, and others \nwill be helping to raise awareness about the disease and its symptoms. \nI urge my colleagues and their staff to join me in recognizing \nSeptember as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and to join with \nus in wearing teal throughout September to increase public knowledge \nabout this deadly disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6101-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6101-S6102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROSAIRE LONGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize Rosaire Longe, \na\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\nman who has dedicated much of his life to civil service. Whether \nfighting fires, serving the city of Burlington, VT, as city assessor, \nrepresenting his district in the Vermont State Legislature, or \nmaintaining order in the courtroom as a court officer, Mr. Longe has \ncontinually served the people and State of Vermont.\n  A native of New York, Mr. Longe spent most of his childhood years in \nVermont. After graduating from Burlington High School in 1958, Mr. \nLonge worked as a firefighter for the Burlington Fire Department, a \nprofession he continued for 10 years. Mr. Longe went back to school at \nChamplain College, where he received his associate's degree in \naccounting in 1979. Before beginning his career as a court officer, Mr. \nLonge worked as the Burlington City Assessor and served as a state \nrepresentative for one term in the Vermont Legislature. For the past 20 \nyears, Mr. Longe has ensured the smooth running of the Vermont Superior \nCourt in Burlington as a court officer. His ready smile and easy \nmanners have helped jurors, witnesses and judges alike feel assured in \nthe courtroom. Outside of work, Mr. Longe served as a Justice of the \nPeace for over 30 years, and in that capacity, he has presided over the \nmarriage of over 2,000 couples.\n  These professional accomplishments aside, Mr. Longe has touched the \nlives of many Vermonters. Friends and co-workers have described him as \n``one of the best men'' they know. Whether he is leading people in and \nout of the courthouse, officiating a neighbor's wedding, or merely \nencouraging those around him with a smile and a laugh, Mr. Longe has \nproven himself to be the epitome of a true Vermonter. Marcelle and I \nhave known Rosaire and his wife, Irene, for decades, and share \nVermonters admiration for him. In light of his character and history as \na public servant, Rosaire deserves recognition for a full lifetime of \ncivil service and contribution to his community and State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6102-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. HENRY JARECKI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to use this opportunity to recognize \nthe extraordinary contribution of a dear friend of mine, Dr. Henry \nJarecki, who is the founding chairman of the Institute of International \nEducation's Scholar Rescue Fund.\n  This year is the fund's 10th anniversary, and on September 18, 2012, \nDr. Jarecki will be honored with the Institute of International \nEducation's Humanitarian Award--along with Scholar Rescue's other \nfounders, Tom Russo, Henry Kaufman and George Soros--for his commitment \nto protecting endangered scholars around the world.\n  The Scholar Rescue Fund provides safe havens to scholars whose lives \nare threatened, often for no other reason than their intellectual \npursuits, allowing them to continue their academic work. No other \nglobal fund of this kind exists. Since 2002, with congressional \nsupport, the Scholar Rescue Fund has enabled 469 threatened scholars \nfrom 48 countries to resettle in places where they have safely pursued \ntheir professional studies and research, preserving the intellectual \ncapacity of a country during conflict or crisis.\n  Over 40 percent of these scholars have returned to their home \ncountries. For example, as reports emerged of assassinations of Iraqi \nscholars, the Scholar Rescue Fund identified those in danger and \nprovided stipends so they could resettle and continue teaching and \nwriting in Jordan and other neighboring countries. Many have since \nreturned to leadership positions at Iraqi universities as that country \nrebuilds its institutions of higher education.\n  While many have supported the Scholar Rescue Fund, Dr. Henry Jarecki \nstands out. Drawing on his own experiences as a child whose family fled \nNazi Germany, Dr. Jarecki has generously devoted his energy, resources, \nand time to the fund. He has been a passionate voice for responding to \nthe dangers confronting scholars in Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and now Syria.\n  He has guided staff and inspired fellow board members, always \nstriving to do more on behalf of persecuted academics. He has been a \nsource of support and hope to threatened scholars everywhere. Dr. \nJarecki's own words explain his motivation best: ``Most of all, I thank \nand admire our scholars, who have gone through hell to educate us.''\n  I am proud to have been his friend for decades, and I know his deep \ncommitment. It is with great respect, gratitude, and admiration that, \non the occasion of the Scholar Rescue Fund's 10th anniversary, we \nrecognize and commend Dr. Henry Jarecki's work to protect scholars \nworldwide. Because of his efforts the fund will continue into the \nfuture, saving the lives, work, and voices of threatened academics and \nreminding us all of the importance of intellectual freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6102-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HAZEN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On \nJuly 4 through July 7, 2013, residents of Hazen will be celebrating \ntheir community's history and founding.\n  Hazen has a rich Native American and settler's history, from the \nMandan and Hidatsa tribes establishing horticultural villages to Lewis \nand Clark spending a winter in what is now Mercer County. Settlers \nbegan establishing the area after the Lewis and Clark expedition \ndiscovered the ``highway to the Northwest'', otherwise known as the \nMissouri River. Hazen was named for A.D. Hazen, who was Third Assistant \nPostmaster General in the summer of 1884. General Hazen served at Fort \nStevenson, a military post on the north side of the Missouri River.\n  Located in the Bakken oil formation, Hazen is part of North Dakota's \nthriving energy industry. The community supports investing and \nexpanding the energy industry and also remains committed to a high \nquality of life for its residents. The city of Hazen has developed a \nwell-rounded business district and a dedicated parks and recreation \ndepartment, offering activities such as fishing, camping, and archery. \nThe area offers many opportunities to enjoy North Dakota's natural \nbeauty.\n  Among the events planned for the centennial are a fireworks display, \nconcerts, dinners, a glow-in-the-dark 5k run, and a fish fry. Hazen's \ncelebration is sure to give attendees an all-around experience that is \ntrue to its roots, providing that unique hometown feel for which North \nDakota is known.\n  I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating Hazen, \nND, and its residents on their 100th anniversary and in wishing them \nwell in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6102-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6102-S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL DONOHOE\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Over the August recess, I had the pleasure of \nattending a 90th birthday party for a remarkable Michiganian, Stan \nOvshinsky. I would like to share with my colleagues some of my remarks \nfrom that event.\n  The word ``visionary'' is over used, but surely it applies to Stan \nOvshinsky.\n  His vision for decades has been a world freed from its dependence on \nfossil fuels. One in which we create good jobs and a growing economy on \nthe strength of green ideas. One in which science lights the way to a \nbrighter future, and in which justice and fairness prevail.\n  He has worked for that vision every day of his 90 years, beginning in \nthe machine shops of Akron, OH.\n  The science behind what Stan has accomplished might be \nincomprehensible to most of us, even though Webster's New World \nDictionary tries to make it simple. Webster's defines the word \n``ovonic,'' from the name Ovshinsky, as ``designating, of, or utilizing \nvarious glassy, amorphous materials that undergo electronic or \nstructural changes, act as semiconductors when subjected to voltage, \nlight, etc., and are used in computer memory elements, electronic \nswitches, etc.'' That may still be pretty hard to understand for many \nof us.\n  But we certainly can understand the impact these innovations have had \non the world. Through his work on advanced batteries, solar cells, \nhydrogen power and more, Stan is one of the people who has brought us \ncloser to breaking our dependence on energy sources that endanger our \nenvironment, our economic well-being, and our national security.\n  We can also understand Stan's passion. Spend a few minutes talking to \nhim about his vision, and you see the world as it could be, a world in \nwhich American innovators pioneer the technologies that power a new \neconomy and create good jobs.\n  So his vision isn't just that of a scientist. It is the vision of a \npatriot.\n  Stan knows that the visionary's path is not an easy one. Those who \nseek to change the world embark on a lifetime of ups and downs.\n  He never attended college, but lack of formal education didn't stop \nhim. As Edison showed us, humankind's creative juices aren't always \nmeant for the more confined spaces of academia.\n  Two centuries ago, a Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, toured our \nbrandnew Nation, traveling from its major cities to the raw frontier of \nplaces such as Detroit and Saginaw.\n  Reflecting on the American character, de Tocqueville wrote that the \naverage American was ``above all an innovator. . . . Nothing prevents \nhim from innovating. Everything leads him to innovate.''\n  Stan is proof positive that the American spirit of innovation de \nTocqueville described is alive and well.\n  Many others joined me in celebrating Stan's accomplishments. I would \nlike to share with my colleagues the remarks of two distinguished \nguests: those of Hellmut Fritzche, the former chairman of the Physics \nDepartment at the University of Chicago; and of Harley Shaiken, the \nchair of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of \nCalifornia-Berkley. I ask unanimous consent that their remarks be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Remarks of Hellmut Fritzche\n\n\n                          STAN'S 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n       This is a very special occasion! We are getting together \n     with love, admiration and gratitude to celebrate the 90th \n     birthday of Stan. He has deeply touched and profoundly \n     influenced each one of us and changed our lives. Let me tell \n     you about myself.\n       Exactly 49 years ago began our most fruitful and exciting \n     collaboration and a deeply enriching friendship that includes \n     all our family members. Max Powel picked me up from the \n     airport and I looked in vain for a sign saying Energy \n     Conversion Devices at any of the big buildings we passed; Max \n     said ``they haven't put up a big sign yet''. Soon I was \n     sitting across Stan at his storefront office and laboratory \n     at W. McNichols Rd. Right away Stan showed me the completely \n     symmetric switching characteristics of his new devices on his \n     oscilloscope. I was flabbergasted, astonished, puzzled and \n     curious about the materials covering the two crossing wires \n     which formed his device. All this was new. I was hooked. This \n     was the opening to a new science which started a fruitful \n     phase of my research.\n       I was captivated by Stan's immense intellect, exuberance, \n     and his personal warmth and that of his young wife Iris. \n     Iris, Stan's soul, spirit and closest collaborator. Soon I \n     was guest in their small house in Birmingham and played \n     violin with their eight year old Steven.\n       I realized that Stan had discovered a huge unexplored field \n     of material science. This happens very rarely. We were in \n     unchartered territory. In Stan's disordered Ovonic materials \n     we were confronted with phenomena of bewildering diversity \n     and complexity which required for their explanation a new \n     language and concepts. Stan's intuition and deep \n     understanding of the roles of different elements in his \n     materials were ingenious.\n       You would think that the scientific community welcomed with \n     enthusiasm Stan's lead into an entirely new field of \n     materials with promising device possibilities. What a \n     disappointment! Stan's discoveries were contemptuously \n     dismissed and attacked by mainstream physicists. Was it \n     because Stan did not carry the union card of academic \n     credentials? Stan who rightfully views science as the noblest \n     endeavor was greatly disappointed by the pettiness, \n     irrationality and lack of curiosity of a good fraction of \n     scientists. Stan's reaction was admirable. He did not respond \n     impatiently or in anger. Since he was absolutely convinced of \n     the correctness of his ideas and the potential of his \n     materials, he trusted that his opponents would be won over as \n     soon as they understood his ideas and discoveries. However, \n     since his enemies were from the established research \n     institutions, they were able to block all federal research \n     support. That brought out Stan's other talents, that of \n     attracting and convincing like-minded people to help him \n     accomplish his goals and realize his vision. These usually \n     were likewise extraordinarily creative and imaginative \n     personalities. Frequent visitors to Stan and Iris and ECD \n     were Sir Nevill Mott, Isidor Rabi, Robert Wilson, Ed and Haru \n     Reishauer and Edward Teller.\n       Since I am name dropping, I have to tell you about a \n     fascinating dream. I dreamed that Stan and Albert Einstein \n     had become close friends, Stan was sitting at the desk and \n     Einstein on his bed, there was no other furniture in \n     Einstein's Spartan room--They were in the house near Berlin \n     which Einstein designed and had built for himself after the \n     city of Berlin rescinded on its promise to present a house to \n     Einstein as a gift of the city to his 50th birthday. Stan and \n     Einstein were in a deep discussion. Einstein had just said \n     ``Stan, we have much in common. We both feel that the \n     greatest joy in life is to discover a new truth of nature, we \n     both were fortunate to experience it a number of times.'' \n     Stan objected to equating their achievements but Einstein \n     stopped him ``No, my work was much easier. Both of us follow \n     our intuition and are doggedly stubborn like mules, but I \n     needed only pencil and paper and was kept on a safe track by \n     the logical rules of mathematics. You, on the other hand, \n     navigated in unchartered territories, gathering all knowledge \n     by experiments of your design on new materials of your making \n     and interpreting measurements of limited accuracy. Yet you \n     succeeded many times in discovering new materials and new \n     laws of material science. Not only that, you designed these \n     materials to be of great value to society.''\n       ``I know some of the difficulties you must have \n     encountered. I did an experiment only once in my life, with \n     the young De Haas. It was a complete flop. We made such an \n     unforgivable mistake that our experiment is still quoted \n     under the demeaning rubric ``Pathological Science'' serving \n     as an example of what experimentalists must avoid: `Never \n     let your preconceived notion influence your experiment!'. \n     We fell into that trap. We knew the value which we should \n     find in our experiment because I had calculated it. We \n     indeed measured it quite accurately. However, we were \n     influenced and fooled by our prior knowledge. The true \n     value turned out to be different by a factor two. My \n     calculation, based on classical concepts, was wrong.''\n       ``Now you see, Stan, how much I admire your successful \n     forays into completely unknown territories with naysayers and \n     enemies lurking around you. Who was this Oxford professor who \n     claimed amorphous semiconductors cannot exist because he \n     taught his students that their energy gap is formed by \n     interference of the electron wave functions at the periodic \n     lattice of crystals? We both had plenty of enemies, but for \n     us they lived in a different universe because we knew we were \n     right. I could easily disregard them, but for you they were \n     serious, they tried to prevent your work from getting funded, \n     experiments are expensive. So you had to play all the other \n     roles: being an entrepreneur, fund raiser, inventor and \n     engineer and machine builder, all in one person. Now you know \n     why I consider you to be the one to be admired.''\n       Stan was speechless, so Einstein carried on and said ``I \n     learned to protect my solitude, uncombed and dressed in my \n     ragged sweater--I protect my privacy. You notice there is no \n     living room and no telephone in this house I designed, and my \n     wife Elsa has a great talent shunning away visitors.''\n       I don't remember what Stan said, but Einstein continued: \n     ``People are in awe of me but no one loves me. I never had \n     true friends, I failed in my marriage. I envy you and Iris \n     for your talent to form deep friendships and to elicit love. \n     People are drawn to you; you understand them and you care. \n     Even more, you bring out their best, many working with you \n     feel you changed their lives. You and\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\n     Iris created a unique ECD culture of innovation and \n     collaboration. Enough said. So stop admiring me, you are \n     great!''\n       ``We share fundamental human values, I talked about them, \n     but you practiced them; you were effective starting as a \n     Union organizer and continued fighting against injustice and \n     prejudice all your life. It is typical for you to be the only \n     Fellow of the American Physical Society who, at the same \n     time, is a union member of the International Association of \n     Machinists.''\n       Einstein then talked about his work in the patent office \n     and how he enjoyed reading many of Stan's 400 or so patents. \n     Their discussion became too technical for me to include in \n     this talk. Getting up, Einstein finally said: ``by the way \n     Stan, I learned about your explanation of dark matter, the 26 \n     percent of all matter in the universe, one of the great \n     puzzles of modern Cosmology. You said it is not matter at all \n     but pure gravitation without matter. It is space/time \n     curvature produced by non-uniform expansion of the universe \n     instead of by matter. I agree with you, the expansion cannot \n     be uniform because mass, that is the galaxies and nebula fill \n     space in clumps. That will cause wrinkles in space time and \n     hence additional curvatures, which of course act \n     gravitationally, just what dark matter does. The referee was \n     wrong rejecting your paper on the grounds of my field \n     equations. These were written for a stationary universe in \n     order to keep the mathematics simple and tractable. Modern \n     scientists must not take as a gospel what I wrote down more \n     than 80 years ago.''\n       Here our dog jumped on my bed waking me up--what a dream! I \n     had to tell you about it. I hope you appreciate my effort to \n     imitate Einstein's German accent.\n       You might be surprised to hear Stan thinking about \n     cosmological problems. I always stayed with Stan and Iris \n     when I visited ECD. When we got to his home after a grueling \n     and strenuous day for Stan, we swam in the lake, had a \n     martini and enjoyed Iris' delicious dinner. Then Stan said \n     ``Let us relax and talk about physics''. Besides high \n     temperature superconductivity, Bose Einstein condensation, \n     non-silver photography, high remanence magnets, catalytic \n     actions of nano-crystals, and of course the Ovonic switching \n     and memory phenomena, we discussed current problems of \n     cosmology. We sat in his basement study surrounded by \n     thousands of his books, discussed and argued about scientific \n     problems. Between my visits we exchanged letters summarizing \n     and clarifying our thoughts in preparation of our next \n     session. I found a bundle of our letters. These are the ones \n     of 6 years between 1994 and 2000 dealing with cosmology. They \n     awake fond memories.\n       I mentioned thousands of his books. They fill all rooms and \n     the study, the guest room, the former gym and sauna in the \n     basement. The books, most of them heavily annotated with \n     colored markers, lead you through the history of the labor \n     movement, biographies of all important and admirable people \n     including some anarchists, books on Japanese Haiku, Chinese \n     art, history of social movements and world history. With his \n     incredible memory, Stan picks from the books piling up to the \n     ceiling and finds the passage supporting his argument. Stan \n     is a Renaissance man except for the important difference that \n     in the Renaissance no one was at the same time a scientist, \n     social activist, entrepreneur, machine builder, inventor, and \n     manufacturer. We have to find a new name for a person with \n     the incredible scope of knowledge and creativity of Stan. On \n     the other hand, there is no other person, so let's just call \n     him Stan Ovshinsky.\n       We wish you good health, success and a happy birthday.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Stan Ovshinsky: Celebrating the Past and Illuminating the Future--\n                      Harley Shaiken, UC-Berkeley\n\n       It is an honor and a joy to be here today with Stan and \n     Rosa, with their family and friends, to celebrate Stan's 90th \n     birthday. I will take my cue from Stan who has always \n     celebrated the past while looking to the future.\n       From a very young age Stan set out to change the world in a \n     progressive--no, in a radical way--and the world is a far \n     better place for his efforts. As impressive as his works have \n     been, I believe they will prove defining for future \n     generations.\n       Stan has combined brilliant science with a deep commitment \n     to social justice and he has pursued both with exceptional \n     vision and courage. They are fully intertwined in his mind \n     and his heart. They are not separate sides of Stan, they are \n     Stan.\n       If the term were not already used in physics, we might call \n     the passionate combination of science and social justice: \n     Ovonics.\n       His path has never been easy. When the times were toughest, \n     when the night was darkest, Stan persevered. Since it's his \n     birthday, let me begin with a verse by Ralph Chaplin, the IWW \n     poet and troubadour, who at times wrote from a jail cell and \n     who Stan reads in difficult times.\n       Chaplin wrote in ``No Truce for Us\":\n       ``Stubborn we stood against the stars to span\n       The night with dreams, our faces to the gale''.\n       Stan has spanned a lifetime with dreams, surmounted the \n     fiercest gales, and turned those dreams into profound new \n     realities.\n       Stan for me has been the dearest of friends, the most \n     exceptional of mentors. There is no one with whom it is more \n     exciting to share good news. When I met a beautiful young \n     woman from Chile in 1973, who is the love of my life, I first \n     brought her to meet Stan and Iris. And, there is no one who \n     is more supportive when the sky appears to be falling. I \n     wouldn't be who I am today without Stan.\n       Out of a lifetime of special moments I will speak briefly \n     about two separated by decades and thousands of miles: the \n     first was when I met Stan and Iris so many years ago in \n     Detroit and, the second, when I stood with Stan and Rosa only \n     a few years ago on an 8,000 foot mountain in the north of \n     Chile.\n       I first met Stan and Iris when I was 15 in a basement \n     community room in Northwest Detroit at a meeting to organize \n     a chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a civil \n     rights group. Their ideals and their love for each other \n     flowed through the room. The 1960s were just beginning. The \n     times were very heady and the times were deeply troubled. \n     Stan and Iris's commitment to civil rights was inspiring. \n     They supported students in the South who were being brutally \n     beaten for sitting at lunch counters and they stood with \n     African American families in Detroit who were threatened for \n     wanting a decent home down the block.\n       I would soon learn that Stan had organized workers into \n     unions in the 1930s and 1940s, on occasion being chased or \n     beaten for his efforts, and I would see him stand proudly \n     with labor throughout his life; I would see Stan champion \n     human rights throughout the world whether in Russia or Chile; \n     I would see his support of women in his life and in his \n     company far ahead of the curve; and I would witness him \n     oppose unjust wars guided by a moral compass whatever the \n     personal cost.\n       In the weeks and months after we met a friendship bloomed. \n     I would meet Stan and Iris after school in the storefront \n     offices on Six Mile Road of a company they had just founded. \n     At the time, the company had an oscilloscope or two and was \n     about to hire its first employee. It's name and its mission \n     would prove prophetic: Energy Conversion Laboratories. What a \n     name to choose in 1960!\n       In Stan's office, there was a periodic table of the \n     elements on the wall and shelves of books from Albert \n     Einstein to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, from the British \n     philosopher Bertrand Russell to the American labor leader A. \n     Philip Randolph.\n       As we talked, Stan would pull books off the shelves and put \n     them into my hands, books that would change my life. George \n     Orwell's Homage to Catalonia; John Reed's Ten Days That Shook \n     the World; the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr's Stride Toward \n     Freedom; and the German expressionist George Grosz's \n     paintings and drawings, among many others.\n       Although Stan has honorary doctorates in physics from the \n     University of Michigan and great universities throughout the \n     world, he says he acquired his advanced degree at the Akron \n     Public Library; I acquired mine in that Six Mile Road office.\n       In his office and in his living room, Stan spoke \n     passionately about science, he spoke about energy and \n     information as the pillars of a new age, and he spoke about \n     building a better world with urgency.\n       As I would quickly learn, for Stan speaking was the prelude \n     to action. Ideas led to new theories, new materials, new \n     areas of science; they led to machines and factories; they \n     laid the foundation for new industries.\n       Stan's path-breaking science harnessed the energy of the \n     sun and his values sought to use science to create jobs, \n     avoid wars over energy, and preserve the environment.\n       His vision was always international. He has traveled the \n     world tirelessly I suspect with the words of Eugene Debs in \n     mind ``if there is a lower class I am in it, if there is a \n     criminal element I am of it, if there is a soul in prison I \n     am not free.'' And, his practice seemed to have added ``if \n     someone sits in darkness my world becomes dimmer.'' Among so \n     many global achievements, forgotten villagers in Oaxaca, \n     Mexico were able to light the night using his solar materials \n     and illuminate a path to a better future.\n       Three years ago I came with Ricardo Lagos, the legendary \n     former president of Chile, to Detroit to meet Stan and Rosa.\n       He was so impressed by the visit--Stan and he proved to be \n     kindred spirits--that he organized a trip for them to Chile a \n     few months later.\n       We were invited to spend a magical day at the Paranal \n     Observatory on an 8,000-foot peak in the Atacama desert, the \n     driest place on the planet. Under a sundrenched sky and \n     during a night overflowing with stars, Stan expressed \n     admiration for what democratic governments had achieved in \n     Chile and spoke eloquently about solar possibilities for the \n     future. Over an intense week, he added a vital, transforming \n     voice to thinking about renewable energy in the country.\n       The magic continued at the home of President Michelle \n     Bachelet, a remarkable woman and an exceptional president. \n     Stan and her shared an instant rapport and a deep, personal \n     connection on values and ideals. The commitment for a better \n     world burned brightly for both of them.\n       These special moments made me realize that Stan has changed \n     the world in ways that he and we may not yet fully recognize. \n     We will look back and see that his science and his life \n     defined our age in profound ways.\n       He has inspired far more deeply and far more widely than he \n     may know. He has inspired because, as Senator Carl Levin so \n     eloquently put it, ``Stan has allowed us to see the world as \n     it could be.''\n       Those who worked with him at Energy Conversion Devices saw \n     his ideals in practice. He created a culture that celebrated \n     the worth and capacity of people--whatever\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\n     their formal qualifications, whoever they were--and inspired \n     unparalleled innovation and achievement over five decades.\n       Along the way there have been setbacks and tough defeats. \n     How could there not be given the powerful interests he has \n     challenged and the profound ways in which he has upended the \n     status quo? I am reminded about something his friend Norman \n     Thomas once said, which is now enshrined on a plaque in the \n     library at Princeton University. ``I am not the champion of \n     lost causes, but the champion of causes not yet won.''\n       Let me conclude with another poem. In a world spiraling \n     toward nightmare in 1938 Bertolt Brecht wrote ``To \n     Posterity.''\n       He lamented ``Alas, we who sought a world of human kindness \n     could not ourselves be kind.''\n       Stan has rewritten the poem with the work of a lifetime. \n     His version would read ``we who sought a world of human \n     kindness could only achieve it through kindness, generosity, \n     and solidarity with our fellow human beings.''\n       Happy birthday, Stan!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6105-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING LEO R. SEGALLA, SR.\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life, \nlegacy, and contributions of Leo R. Segalla, Sr., who passed away on \nMonday, September 10, 2012. Mr. Segalla was a dedicated pro-life leader \nwhose tireless efforts for many ministries and outreaches had a \ntremendous impact on the fight to defend the dignity of life.\n  In 2007, Leo approached Louisiana Right to Life with the vision of \ncreating a pro-life leadership training program for high school \nstudents. He developed the Louisiana Camp Joshua program on behalf of \nthe Knights of Columbus and Louisiana Right to Life. Under his \nleadership, Camp Joshua flourished and grew to two camps, the first in \nBaton Rouge and the second in Lake Charles. Over the past 5 years, this \nprogram has trained hundreds of teens to speak effectively on life \nissues and has inspired young adults to be pro-life leaders in their \ncommunities.\n  Leo also greatly contributed to the pro-life cause through his \nleadership in Baton Rouge Right to Life and as part of the Louisiana \nLife March Coalition. The pro-life community has lost a great friend \nand advocate, but his legacy will live on in the hundreds of young \npeople who have been empowered to stand for the dignity and sanctity of \nall human life.\n  It is with great sadness but also great honor that I recognize, \ncommend, and celebrate the life and legacy of Leo Segalla. Leo was a \nchampion of life who was unwavering in his defense of those who cannot \ndefend themselves. I extend my deepest condolences to his family and \nfriends in Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6105-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6105-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6105-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001--PM 61\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin the 90-day period prior to the anniversary date of its \ndeclaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and \ntransmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to \ncontinue in effect beyond the anniversary date.

Res. 550\n\n       Whereas according to the National Center for Health \n     Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 141 people in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, antitissue transglutaminase, and IgA \n     antiendomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of the skin and \n     other organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2012, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6110-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2781.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARINE CORPS AMPHIBIOUS LIFT \n                   AND PRESENCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Marine Corps is a combat force which \n     leverages maneuver from the sea as a force multiplier \n     allowing for a\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n     variety of operational tasks ranging from major combat \n     operations to humanitarian assistance.\n       (2) The United States Marine Corps is unique in that, while \n     embarked upon Naval vessels, they bring all the logistic \n     support necessary for the full range of military operations, \n     operating ``from the sea'' they require no third party host \n     nation permission to conduct military operations.\n       (3) The Department of the Navy has a requirement for 38 \n     amphibious assault ships to meet this full range of military \n     operations.\n       (4) Due to fiscal constraints only, that requirement of 38 \n     vessels was reduced to 33 vessels, which adds military risk \n     to future operations.\n       (5) The Department of the Navy has been unable to meet even \n     the minimal requirement of 30 operationally available vessels \n     and has submitted a shipbuilding and ship retirement plan to \n     Congress which will reduce the force to 28 vessels.\n       (6) Experience has shown that early engineering and design \n     of naval vessels has significantly reduced the acquisition \n     costs and life-cycle costs of those vessels.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense should carefully evaluate the \n     maritime force structure necessary to execute demand for \n     forces by the commanders of the combatant commands;\n       (2) the Department of the Navy carefully evaluate \n     amphibious lift capabilities to meet current and projected \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Department of the Navy should consider \n     prioritization of investment in and procurement of the next \n     generation of amphibious assault ships, as a component of the \n     balanced battle force;\n       (4) the next generation amphibious assault ships should \n     maintain survivability protection;\n       (5) operation and maintenance requirements analysis, as \n     well as the potential to leverage a common hull form design, \n     should be considered to reduce total ownership cost and \n     acquisition cost; and\n       (6) maintaining a robust amphibious ship building \n     industrial base is vital for the future of the national \n     security of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 131.

HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Ballistic Missile Defense Review of February 2010 \n     stated as its first policy priority that ``the United States \n     will continue to defend the homeland against the threat of \n     limited ballistic missile attack'' and that ``an essential \n     element of the United States' homeland ballistic missile \n     defense strategy is to hedge against future uncertainties, \n     including both the uncertainty of future threat capabilities \n     and the technical risks inherent to our own development \n     plans''.\n       (2) The United States currently has an operational Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system with 30 Ground-Based \n     Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, \n     protecting the United States against the potential future \n     threat of limited ballistic missile attack from countries \n     such as North Korea and Iran.\n       (3) As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear \n     and Missile Defense Policy Bradley Roberts testified before \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April 25, \n     2012, ``[w]ith 30 GBIs in place, the United States is in an \n     advantageous position vis-a-vis the threats from North Korea \n     and Iran,'' and ``neither has successfully tested an ICBM or \n     demonstrated an ICBM-class warhead''.\n       (4) Deputy Assistant Secretary Roberts testified that \n     maintaining this advantageous position ``requires continued \n     improvement to the GMD system, including enhanced performance \n     by the GBIs and the deployment of new sensors. It also \n     requires the development of the Precision Tracking Space \n     System (PTSS) to handle larger raid sizes and the Standard \n     Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIB as the ICBM threat from states \n     like Iran and North Korea matures. These efforts will help to \n     ensure that the United States possesses the capability to \n     counter the projected threat for the foreseeable future''.\n       (5) As its highest priority, the Missile Defense Agency is \n     designing a correction to the problem that caused a December \n     2010 flight test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system using the Capability Enhancement II (CE-II) \n     model of exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, and plans to \n     demonstrate the correction in two flight tests before \n     resuming production or assembly of additional Capability \n     Enhancement II kill vehicles.\n       (6) The Department of Defense has a program to improve the \n     performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, including a plan to test every component of \n     the Ground-Based Interceptors for reliability. According to \n     Department of Defense officials, the goal of the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor reliability program is to double the number of \n     threat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that our \n     current inventory of Ground-Based Interceptors could defeat, \n     thereby effectively doubling the capability of our current \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (7) The Missile Defense Agency, working with the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation and with United States \n     Strategic Command, has developed a comprehensive Integrated \n     Master Test Plan (IMTP) for missile defense, with flight \n     tests for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system planned \n     through fiscal year 2022, including salvo testing, multiple \n     simultaneous engagement testing, and operational testing.\n       (8) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, who \n     must review, approve, and sign each semi-annual version of \n     the Integrated Master Test Plan, testified that the Test Plan \n     is ``a robust and rigorous test plan''. He also testified \n     that the current pace of Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system testing of one flight test per year is the ``best that \n     we've been able to achieve over a decade''.\n       (9) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency testified \n     before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April \n     25, 2012, that flight testing the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system more often than once per year could cause \n     ``greater risk of further failure and setbacks to developing \n     our homeland defense capability as rapidly as possible''.\n       (10) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy, the \n     Department of Defense has already decided upon or implemented \n     a number of actions to improve the missile defense posture of \n     the United States in case the threat of Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missiles from North Korea or Iran emerges sooner or \n     in greater numbers than anticipated. These include the \n     following actions:\n       (A) The Missile Defense Agency has completed construction \n     of Missile Field-2 at Fort Greely, Alaska, with eight extra \n     silos available to deploy additional operational Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, if needed.\n       (B) With its request for 5 additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in the budget of the President for fiscal year \n     2013, the Missile Defense Agency plans to have enough test \n     and spare Ground-Based Interceptors to emplace in the 8 extra \n     silos from 2014 through 2025, and will keep the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor production line active for 5 additional years, \n     thus allowing additional Ground-Based Interceptor purchases \n     in the future, if needed.\n       (C) The Department has decided not to decommission \n     prototype Missile Field-1 at Fort Greely but, instead, to \n     keep it in a storage status that would permit it to be \n     refurbished and reactivated within a few years if future \n     threat developments make that necessary.\n       (D) The Missile Defense Agency plans to build an in-flight \n     interceptor communications terminal at Fort Drum, New York, \n     to enhance the performance of Ground-Based Interceptors \n     defending the eastern United States against possible future \n     missile threats from Iran.\n       (E) The Missile Defense Agency is continuing the \n     development and testing of the two-stage Ground-Based \n     Interceptor for possible deployment in the future, if needed.\n       (F) The Missile Defense Agency is upgrading early warning \n     radars in Clear, Alaska, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to \n     enhance the ability to defend against potential multiple \n     future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats from North \n     Korea and Iran.\n       (G) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptor for Phase 4 of \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach. It is intended to \n     augment the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system as a cost-\n     effective first layer of defense of the homeland against a \n     possible future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threat \n     from Iran.\n       (H) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Precision Tracking Space System, a satellite sensor \n     system to provide persistent tracking of large numbers of \n     missiles in flight, and fire-control quality targeting data \n     to various missile defense interceptor systems. According to \n     the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, ``the greatest \n     future enhancement for both homeland and regional defense in \n     the next ten years is the development of the Precision \n     Tracking Space System satellites''.\n       (11) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy \n     review, the Department of Defense is considering other \n     options to enhance the future United States posture to defend \n     the homeland, including the feasibility, advisability and \n     affordability of deploying additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, either in Alaska or at a missile defense site \n     on the East Coast of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national priority to defend the homeland \n     against the potential future threat of limited ballistic \n     missile attack from countries such as North Korea and Iran;\n       (2) the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system, with 30 Ground-Based Interceptors deployed in Alaska \n     and\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\n     California, provides protection of the United States homeland \n     against the potential future threat of limited ballistic \n     missile attack from North Korea and Iran;\n       (3) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, \n     sustainability, and operational performance that will allow \n     it to continue providing protection of the United States \n     homeland against limited ballistic missile attack;\n       (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest \n     priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system flight test failure and \n     demonstrate the correction in flight tests before resuming \n     production of the Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicle, in \n     order to provide confidence that the system will work as \n     intended;\n       (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance \n     the performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, and enhance the capability of the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense System, to provide improved capability to \n     defend the homeland against possible increased future missile \n     threats from North Korea and Iran;\n       (6) the Missile Defense Agency should continue its robust, \n     rigorous, and realistic testing of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system at a pace of one flight test per year, as \n     described in the Integrated Master Test Plan, including salvo \n     testing, multiple simultaneous engagement testing, and \n     operational testing;\n       (7) if successfully developed, the Standard Missile-3 Block \n     IIB interceptor would provide an essential first layer of \n     defense of the homeland against an emerging Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile threat from Iran, using a cost-effective \n     forward-based early intercept system that could permit \n     holding Ground-Based Interceptors in reserve, and if such \n     interceptor could be deployed on ships, it would also provide \n     a significant enhancement to defense against possible future \n     threats from North Korea;\n       (8) the Precision Tracking Space System has the potential \n     to improve dramatically the capability of homeland and \n     regional missile defense systems against large numbers of \n     missiles launched simultaneously, and should remain a high \n     priority for development;\n       (9) the Department of Defense has taken a number of \n     prudent, affordable, cost-effective, and operationally \n     significant steps to hedge against the possibility of future \n     growth in the missile threat to the homeland from North Korea \n     and Iran; and\n       (10) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate \n     the evolution of the long-range missile threat from North \n     Korea and Iran and consider other possibilities for prudent, \n     affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant \n     steps to improve the posture of the United States to defend \n     the homeland against possible future growth in the threat.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     on the status of efforts to improve the homeland ballistic \n     missile defense capability of the United States.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1)) shall include the following:\n       (A) A detailed description of the actions taken or planned \n     to improve the reliability, availability, and capability of \n     the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (B) A description of any improvements achieved as a result \n     of the actions described in subparagraph (A).\n       (C) A description of the results of the two planned flight \n     tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (Control \n     Test Vehicle flight test-1, and GMD Flight Test-06b) intended \n     to demonstrate the success of the correction of the problem \n     that caused the flight test failure of December 2010, and the \n     status of any decision to resume production of the Capability \n     Enhancement-II kill vehicle.\n       (D) A detailed description of actions taken or planned to \n     improve the homeland defense posture of the United States to \n     hedge against potential future Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missile threat growth from North Korea and Iran.\n       (E) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 232. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the introduction to the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Review of February 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     states that ``I have made defending against near-term \n     regional threats a top priority of our missile defense plans, \n     programs and capabilities''.\n       (2) In describing the threat of regional ballistic \n     missiles, the report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review \n     states that ``there is no uncertainty about the existence of \n     regional threats. They are clear and present. The threat from \n     short-range, medium-range, and intermediate-range ballistic \n     missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs) in regions where the \n     United States deploys forces and maintains security \n     relationships is growing at a particularly rapid pace''.\n       (3) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate on April 25, 2012, Dr. Bradley Roberts, Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile \n     Defense Policy stated, with respect to regional missile \n     defense, that ``the need arises from the rapidly emerging \n     threats to our armed forces in Europe, the Middle East, and \n     East Asia from regional missile proliferators and the basic \n     challenge such proliferation poses to the safety and security \n     of our forces and allies and to our power projection \n     strategy''.\n       (4) Iran has the largest inventory of regional ballistic \n     missiles in the Middle East, with hundreds of missiles that \n     can reach southeastern Europe and all of the Middle East, \n     including Israel. Iran is improving its existing missiles and \n     developing new and longer-range missiles.\n       (5) North Korea has a large and growing inventory of short-\n     range and medium-range ballistic missiles that can reach \n     United States forces and allies in South Korea and Japan. \n     North Korea is improving its existing missiles and developing \n     new and longer-range missiles.\n       (6) In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced \n     that he had accepted the unanimous recommendation of the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \n     establish a European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense, designed to protect deployed United States forces \n     and allies and partners in Europe against the large and \n     growing threat of ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (7) In November 2010, at the Lisbon Summit, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to adopt the core \n     mission of missile defense of its population, territory and \n     forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to \n     enhance its missile defense command and control system, the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, to provide \n     a North Atlantic Treaty Organization command and control \n     capability. This is in addition to contributions of missile \n     defense capability from individual nations.\n       (8) During 2011, the United States successfully implemented \n     Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including \n     deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, deployment of an \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ship in the eastern \n     Mediterranean Sea with Standard Missile-3 Block IA \n     interceptors, and establishment of a missile defense command \n     and control system in Germany.\n       (9) During 2011, the United States successfully negotiated \n     all the international agreements with North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies needed to permit future phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach, including agreements with \n     Romania and Poland to permit the deployment of Aegis Ashore \n     missile defense systems on their territory, an agreement with \n     Turkey to permit deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar on its \n     territory, and an agreement with Spain to permit the forward \n     stationing of four Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships at \n     Rota.\n       (10) Phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2015, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Romania.\n       (11) Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2018, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Poland.\n       (12) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2020, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptors at \n     Aegis Ashore sites. This interceptor is intended to protect \n     both Europe and the United States against potential future \n     long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (13) At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in \n     Chicago in 2012, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans \n     to announce it has achieved an ``interim capability'' for the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense system, \n     including initial capability of its Active Layered Theater \n     Ballistic Missile Defense system at a command and control \n     facility in Germany.\n       (14) The United States has a robust program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Israel, including joint development \n     of the Arrow Weapon System and the new Arrow-3 upper tier \n     interceptor, designed to defend Israel against ballistic \n     missiles from Iran. These jointly developed missile defense \n     systems are designed to be interoperable with United States \n     ballistic missile defenses, and these interoperable systems \n     are tested in large military exercises. The United States has \n     deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in Israel to enhance missile \n     defense against missiles from Iran.\n       (15) The United States is working with the nations of the \n     Gulf Cooperation Council on enhanced national and regional \n     missile defense capabilities against growing missile threats \n     from Iran. As part of this effort, the United Arab Emirates \n     plans to purchase two batteries of the Terminal High Altitude \n     Air Defense (THAAD) system, as well as other equipment.\n       (16) The United States has a strong program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Japan, including the co-development \n     of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor for \n     the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, intended to be \n     deployed by Japan and in Phase 3 of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, Japan's fleet of Aegis Ballistic Missile \n     Defense ships using the SM-3 Block IA interceptors, and the \n     United\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n     States deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, \n     particularly from Iran and North Korea, is serious and \n     growing, and puts at risk forward-deployed United States \n     forces and allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East, \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has an obligation to provide \n     force protection of forward-deployed United States forces, \n     assets, and facilities from regional ballistic missile \n     attack;\n       (3) the United States has an obligation to meet its \n     security commitments to its allies, including ballistic \n     missile defense commitments;\n       (4) the Department of Defense has a balanced program of \n     investment and capabilities to provide for both homeland \n     defense and regional defense against ballistic missiles, \n     consistent with the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and with \n     the prioritized and integrated needs of the commanders of the \n     combatant commands;\n       (5) the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense is an appropriate and necessary response to the \n     existing and growing ballistic missile threat from Iran to \n     forward deployed United States forces and allies and partners \n     in Europe;\n       (6) the Department of Defense--\n       (A) should, as a high priority, continue to develop, test, \n     and plan to deploy all four phases of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, including all variants of the Standard \n     Missile-3 interceptor; and\n       (B) should also continue with its other phased and adaptive \n     regional missile defense efforts tailored to the Middle East \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (7) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization are making valuable contributions to missile \n     defense in Europe, by hosting elements of United States \n     missile defense systems on their territories, through \n     individual national contributions to missile defense \n     capability, and by collective funding and development of the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system; and\n       (8) the Department of Defense should continue with the \n     development of the key enablers of enhanced regional missile \n     defense, including the Precision Tracking Space System.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report describing \n     the status and progress of regional missile defense programs \n     and efforts.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1) shall include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the adequacy of the existing and \n     planned European Phased Adaptive Approach to provide force \n     protection for forward deployed United States forces in \n     Europe against ballistic missile threats from Iran, and an \n     assessment whether adequate force protection would be \n     available absent the European Phased Adaptive Approach.\n       (B) An assessment whether the European Phased Adaptive \n     Approach and other planned regional missile defense \n     approaches of the United States meet the integrated \n     priorities of the commanders of the regional combatant \n     commands in an affordable and balanced manner.\n       (C) A description of the progress made in the development \n     and testing of elements of systems intended for deployment in \n     Phases 2 through 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, \n     including the Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptor and the \n     Aegis Ashore system.\n       (D) A description of the manner in which elements of \n     regional missile defense architectures, such as forward-based \n     X-band radars in Turkey and Japan, contribute to the \n     enhancement of homeland defense of the United States.\n       (E) A description of the current and planned contributions \n     of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, both \n     collectively and individually, to missile defense in Europe.\n       (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia \n     have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared \n     early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on \n     May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new \n     cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said ``it should \n     be premised on openness, mutual confidence and real \n     opportunities for cooperation, including the area of missile \n     defense. It should allow us to share information so that each \n     nation can improve its early warning capability, and its \n     capability to defend its people and territory. And perhaps \n     one day, we can even cooperate in a joint defense''.\n       (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law \n     by Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department \n     of Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the \n     exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of \n     launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of \n     launches of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data \n     Exchange Center (JDEC).\n       (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon \n     England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging \n     proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from \n     modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint \n     development of a regional missile defense architecture--all \n     designed to defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from \n     the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An \n     extraordinary series of transparency measures have also been \n     offered to reassure Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance \n     to sign up to these cooperative missile defense activities, \n     we continue to work toward this goal''.\n       (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian \n     President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile \n     defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United \n     States plan to continue the discussion concerning the \n     establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge \n     of ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed \n     our experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile \n     challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate \n     recommendations''.\n       (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Review established as one of its central policy \n     pillars that increased international missile defense \n     cooperation is in the national security interest of the \n     United States and, with regard to cooperation with Russia, \n     the United States ``is pursuing a broad agenda focused on \n     shared early warning of missile launches, possible technical \n     cooperation, and even operational cooperation''.\n       (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile \n     defense system to ``protect NATO European populations, \n     territory and forces'' and also to seek cooperation with \n     Russia on missile defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reaffirmed its \n     readiness to ``invite Russia to explore jointly the potential \n     for linking current and planned missile defence systems at an \n     appropriate time in mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO \n     Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that \n     ``we will actively seek cooperation on missile defense with \n     Russia'', that ``NATO-Russia cooperation is of strategic \n     importance'', and that ``the security of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and Russia is intertwined''.\n       (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the \n     Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile \n     defense, which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to \n     those deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against \n     common threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear \n     that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a \n     joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' \n     or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation \n     with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security''.\n       (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; \n     124 Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to \n     support the efforts of the United States Government and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with \n     the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative \n     to Iranian missile threats''.\n       (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to \n     cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've \n     disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that \n     poses no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. \n     However, we've mutually committed to resolving these \n     difficulties in order to develop a roadmap toward truly \n     effective anti-ballistic missile collaboration. This \n     collaboration may include exchanging launch information, \n     setting up a joint data fusion center, allowing greater \n     transparency with respect to our missile defense plans and \n     exercises, and conducting a joint analysis to determine areas \n     of future cooperation''.\n       (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. \n     Roberts stated that the United States has been pursuing a \n     Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since \n     2004, and that such an agreement is necessary ``for the \n     safeguarding of sensitive information in support of \n     cooperation'' on missile defense, and to ``provide the legal \n     framework for undertaking cooperative efforts''. Further, Dr. \n     Roberts stated that the United States would not provide any \n     classified information to Russia without first conducting a \n     National Disclosure Policy review. He also stated that the \n     United States is not considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' \n     technology with Russia.\n       (11) In a March 2012 answer to a question from the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia, Acting Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Policy Jim Miller wrote that ``I support U.S.-Russian \n     cooperation on missile defenses first and foremost because it \n     could improve the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n     missile defenses, thereby improving the protection of the \n     United States, our forces overseas, and our Allies. Missile \n     defense cooperation with Russia is in the security interests \n     of the United States, NATO, and Russia, first and foremost \n     because it could strengthen capabilities across Europe to \n     intercept Iranian missiles''. He also wrote that ``[t]he \n     United States has pursued missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia with the clear understanding that we would not accept \n     constraints on missile defense, and that we would undertake \n     necessary qualitative and quantitative improvements to meet \n     U.S. Security needs''.\n       (12) In February 2012, an international group of \n     independent experts known as the Euro-Atlantic Security \n     Initiative issued a report proposing missile defense \n     cooperation between the United States (with its North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization allies) and Russia. The group, \n     whose leaders included Stephen Hadley, the National Security \n     Advisor to President George W. Bush, proposed that the \n     nations share satellite and radar early warning data at joint \n     cooperation centers in order to improve their ability to \n     detect, track, and defeat medium-range and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles from the Middle East.\n       (13) In a letter dated April 13, 2012, Robert Nabors, \n     Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of \n     Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``it is Administration policy \n     that we will only provide information to Russia that will \n     enhance the effectiveness of our missile defenses. The \n     Administration will not provide Russia with sensitive \n     information that would in any way compromise our national \n     security, including hit-to-kill technology and interceptor \n     telemetry''.\n       (14) The United States and Russia already engage in \n     substantial cooperation on a number of international security \n     efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, \n     counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and \n     logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in \n     Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to \n     share and protect sensitive information, which they have both \n     done successfully.\n       (15) The United States currently has shared early warning \n     agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in \n     addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \n     United States has developed procedures and mechanisms for \n     sharing early warning information with partner nations while \n     ensuring the protection of sensitive United States \n     information.\n       (16) Russia and the United States each have missile launch \n     early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could \n     contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, \n     track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.\n       (17) The Obama Administration has provided regular \n     briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on \n     possible missile defense cooperation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, \n     its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, \n     particularly against missile threats from Iran;\n       (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile \n     defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and \n     a multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia \n     Council;\n       (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in \n     any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense \n     capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, \n     letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, \n     and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature;\n       (4) the United States should not provide Russia with \n     sensitive missile defense information that would in any way \n     compromise United States national security, including ``hit-\n     to-kill'' technology and interceptor telemetry; and\n       (5) the United States should pursue missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--\n       (A) United States classified information is appropriately \n     safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure;\n       (B) prior to sharing classified information with Russia, \n     the United States conducts a National Disclosure Policy \n     review and determines the types and levels of information \n     that may be shared and whether any additional procedures are \n     necessary to protect such information;\n       (C) prior to entering into missile defense technology \n     cooperation projects, the United States enters into a Defense \n     Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia that establishes \n     the legal framework for a broad spectrum of potential \n     cooperative defense projects; and\n       (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States or its North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization allies.\n\n     SEC. 234.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LATVIA AND \n                   OTHER NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION MEMBER \n                   NATIONS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NORTHERN \n                   DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The remote and austere environments in which United \n     States troops are required to operate as part of the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in \n     Afghanistan have increased the need for reliable lines of \n     supply in southwest Asia.\n       (2) The country of Afghanistan presents unique logistics \n     challenges, which have precipitated the development of \n     several redundant lines of supply.\n       (3) United States Transportation Command and the Defense \n     Logistics Agency (DLA), in consultation with United States \n     Embassy officials and other parties, have successfully \n     established memoranda of understanding and other agreements \n     with nations in and around southwest Asia to ensure the \n     reliability of lines of supply to Afghanistan.\n       (4) The lines of supply through Pakistan have been \n     repeatedly threatened by instability in that country. \n     Airlifting goods to Afghanistan, while safer, is expensive.\n       (5) The Northern Distribution Network (NDN) was established \n     in late 2008 to ensure that a safe and cost-effective line of \n     supply is available for United States troops in Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\n       (6) The two prongs of supply provided by the Northern \n     Distribution Network ship nonlethal goods from the Baltic \n     ports in the north and the Caucauses in the west to southwest \n     Asia and Afghanistan.\n       (7) The Northern Distribution Network has been successful \n     and now handles more than 50 percent of cargo shipped to \n     Afghanistan.\n       (8) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member \n     nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes have \n     contributed significantly to the success of the Northern \n     Distribution Network.\n       (9) The United States has strong economic ties to Northern \n     Distribution Network nations that are members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, and these nations may be able \n     to provide quality goods and services for near and long-term \n     use by the Department of Defense.\n       (10) Since 2009 the port of Riga, on the Baltic Sea, has \n     been a critical overland entry point for goods being shipped \n     using the Northern Distribution Network. Latvia is a member \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and has been an \n     ally of the United States in the region for many years.\n       (11) In September 2010, the Defense Logistics Agency, the \n     General Services Administration, and other parties hosted a \n     local procurement conference in Riga, Latvia.\n       (12) One hundred nine Latvian vendors attended the \n     September 2010 conference in Riga, and contracts with Latvian \n     vendors have been entered into as a result.\n       (13) In May 2012, Latvia hosted an international workshop \n     in Riga to examine ways of transforming the Northern \n     Distribution Network from a route for the delivery of United \n     States and other Allies' non-lethal goods to Afghanistan into \n     a commercial route that would support the economic growth of \n     Afghanistan and the southwest Asia region.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     are key economic and security partners of the United States \n     and are to be commended for their contribution to ensuring \n     United States and International Security Assistance Force \n     troops have reliable lines of supply to achieve the mission \n     in Afghanistan;\n       (2) when quality products at competitive prices are \n     available, significant effort should be made to procure goods \n     locally from Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization member nations along the Northern Distribution \n     Network routes; and\n       (3) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     remain allies of the United States in the region, and a \n     mutually beneficial relationship should continue to be \n     cultivated between the United States and Latvia and such \n     other nations in the future.\n\n                       Subtitle E--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 881.

SENSE OF SENATE ON POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS TO \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NETWORKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cybersecurity threats are pervasive and serious, \n     including through the supply chain of information technology \n     equipment and software.\n       (2) Semiconductor manufacturing is already dominated by \n     foreign producers, presenting supply chain risk management \n     challenges.\n       (3) In a number of instances, foreign manufacturers of \n     telecommunications equipment, including advanced wireless \n     technology, are gaining global market share due to high \n     quality and low prices. Competitive market forces ensure that \n     commercial providers of consumer, business, and government \n     systems and services will choose equipment and associated \n     software from these manufacturers. In some cases, like Huawei \n     Industries, this competitive position stems in part from \n     inappropriate government subsidies and other forms of \n     assistance.\n       (4) Some of these companies also present clear \n     cybersecurity supply chain risks that the Government must \n     address.\n       (5) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United \n     States has blocked the attempt\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n     by Huawei to acquire United States technology firms on two \n     occasions and the National Security Agency and the Secretary \n     of Commerce have advised two major United States \n     telecommunications carriers against selecting Huawei as a \n     supplier.\n       (6) The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383) provided authority and \n     mechanisms for the Secretary of Defense to control these \n     supply chain risks, but only for National Security Systems, \n     leaving many information technology systems and missions \n     exposed to supply chain risks.\n       (7) Blocking sales from providers of information technology \n     systems and services due to concerns about cybersecurity \n     risks, while maintaining our commitment to free trade and \n     fair and transparent competition, poses difficult policy \n     challenges.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Department of Defense--\n       (1) must ensure it maintains full visibility and adequate \n     control of its supply chain, including subcontractors, in \n     order to mitigate supply chain exploitation; and\n       (2) needs the authority and capability to mitigate supply \n     chain risks to its information technology systems that fall \n     outside the scope of National Security Systems.\n\n                       Subtitle D--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 941.

REPORT ON EFFECTS OF BUDGET SEQUESTRATION ON THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inability of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \n     Reduction to find $1,200,000,000,000 in savings will trigger \n     automatic funding reductions known as ``sequestration'' to \n     the Department of Defense of $492,000,000,000 between 2013 \n     and 2021 under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 USC 901a).\n       (2) These reductions are in addition to reductions of \n     $487,000,000,000 already being implemented by the Department \n     of Defense, and would decrease the readiness and capabilities \n     of the Armed Forces while increasing risks to the effective \n     implementation of the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The leaders of the Department of Defense have \n     consistently testified that threats to the national security \n     of the United States have increased, not decreased. Secretary \n     of Defense Leon Panetta said that these reductions would \n     ``inflict severe damage to our national defense for \n     generations'', comments that have been echoed by the \n     Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n       (4) While reductions in funds available for the Department \n     of Defense will automatically commence January 2, 2013, \n     uncertainty regarding the reductions has already exacerbated \n     Department of Defense efforts to plan future defense budget.\n       (5) Sequestration will have a detrimental effect on the \n     industrial base that supports the Department of Defense.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than August 15, 2012, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a \n     detailed report on the impact on the Department of Defense of \n     the sequestration of funds authorized and appropriated for \n     fiscal year 2013 for the Department of Defense, if \n     automatically triggered on January 2, 2013, under section \n     251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the readiness of the Armed Forces, including impacts to \n     steaming hours, flying hours, and full spectrum training \n     miles, and an estimate of the increase or decrease in \n     readiness (as defined in the C status C-1 through C-5).\n       (B) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the ability of the Department of Defense to carry out the \n     National Military Strategy of the United States, and any \n     changes to the most recent Risk Assessment of the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff under section 153(b) of title 10, \n     United States Code arising from sequestration.\n       (C) A list of the programs, projects, and activities across \n     the Department of Defense, the military departments, and the \n     elements and components of the Department of Defense that \n     would be reduced or terminated as a result of sequestration.\n       (D) An estimate of the number and value of all contracts \n     that will be terminated, restructured, or revised in scope as \n     a result of sequestration, including an estimate of potential \n     termination costs and of increased contract costs due to \n     renegotiation and reinstatement of contracts.\n       (3) Assumptions.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall assume the following:\n       (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the funds \n     subject to sequester are the funds in all 050 accounts, \n     including all unobligated balances.\n       (B) The funds exempt from the sequester are the following:\n       (i) Funds in accounts for military personnel.\n       (ii) Funds in accounts for overseas contingency operations.\n       (4) Presentation of certain information.--In listing \n     programs, projects, and activities under paragraph (2)(C), \n     the report required by paragraph (1) shall set forth for each \n     the following:\n       (A) The most specific level of budget item identified in \n     applicable appropriations Acts.\n       (B) Related classified annexes and explanatory statements.\n       (C) Department of Defense budget justification documents \n     DOD P-1 and R-1 as subsequently modified by congressional \n     action, and as submitted by the Department of Defense \n     together with the budget materials for the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2013 (as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code).\n       (D) Department of Defense document O-1 for operation and \n     maintenance accounts for fiscal year 2013, for which purpose \n     the term ``program, project, or activity'' means the budget \n     activity account and sub account for the program, project, or \n     activity as submitted in such document O-1.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Counter-Drug Activities\n\n     SEC. 1011.

Retaining all three Triad \n     legs will best maintain strategic stability at reasonable \n     cost, while hedging against potential technical problems or \n     vulnerabilities''.\n       (2) The Senate stated in Declaration 12 of the Resolution \n     of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty \n     that ``In accordance with paragraph 1 of Article V of the New \n     START Treaty, which states that, `Subject to the provisions \n     of this Treaty, modernization and replacement of strategic \n     offensive arms may be carried out,' it is the sense of the \n     Senate that United States deterrence and flexibility is \n     assured by a robust triad of strategic delivery vehicles. To \n     this end, the United States is committed to accomplishing the \n     modernization and replacement of its strategic nuclear \n     delivery vehicles, and to ensuring the continued flexibility \n     of United States conventional and nuclear delivery systems''.\n       (3) The Senate required the President, prior to the entry \n     into force of the New START Treaty, to certify to the Senate \n     that the President intended to modernize or replace the triad \n     of strategic nuclear delivery systems.\n       (4) The President made this certification in a message to \n     the Senate on February 2, 2011, in which the President \n     stated, ``I intend to (a) modernize or replace the triad of \n     strategic nuclear delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-\n     launched cruise missile, an ICBM, and a nuclear-powered \n     ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM; and (b) maintain \n     the United States rocket motor industrial base''.\n       (b) Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 23 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 491.

The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its \n     adoption without intervening motion.

REGIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SECURITY ZONES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A terrorist attack using high-activity radiological \n     materials, such as in a dirty bomb, could inflict billions of \n     dollars of economic costs and considerable societal and \n     economic dislocation, with effects and costs possibly lasting \n     for years.\n       (2) It may be easier for terrorists to obtain the materials \n     for, and to fabricate, a dirty bomb than an improvised \n     nuclear device.\n       (3) Radiological materials are in widespread use worldwide, \n     with estimates of the number of radiological sources ranging \n     from 100,000 to millions.\n       (4) Many nations have a security and regulatory regime for \n     their radiological sources that is much less developed than \n     that of the United States.\n       (5) Radiological materials are used at many civilian sites \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations \n     that have little security, placing these materials at risk of \n     theft.\n       (6) Many radiological materials have become lost, disused, \n     unwanted, or abandoned, with the Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     having recovered more than 30,000 radioactive sources in the \n     United States, repatriated more than 2,400 United States-\n     origin sources from other countries, and helped recover more \n     than 13,000 radioactive sources and radioisotope \n     thermoelectric generators in other countries.\n       (7) High-activity radiological materials can be used in a \n     dirty bomb.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     United States and global nonproliferation efforts should \n     place a high priority on programs to secure high-activity \n     radiological sources to reduce the threat of radiological \n     terrorism.\n       (c) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a study in accordance with \n     paragraph (3).\n       (2) Consultation.--The Administrator may, in conducting the \n     study required under paragraph (1), consult with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and such other departments and \n     agencies of the United States Government as the Administrator \n     considers appropriate.\n       (3) Matters included.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the radioactive isotopes and \n     associated activity levels that present the greatest risk to \n     national and international security.\n       (B) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials abroad, including coordination \n     with foreign governments, the European Union, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other international \n     programs, and nongovernmental organizations that identify, \n     register, secure, remove, and provide for the disposition of \n     high-risk radiological materials worldwide.\n       (C) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials domestically at civilian sites, \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations.\n       (D) A definition of regional radiological security zones, \n     including the subset of the materials of concern to be the \n     immediate focus and the security best practices required to \n     achieve that goal.\n       (E) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing regional radiological \n     security zones in high priority areas worldwide in order to \n     facilitate regional collaboration in--\n       (i) identifying and inventorying high-activity radiological \n     sources at high-risk sites;\n       (ii) reviewing national level regulations, inspections, \n     transportation security, and security upgrade options; and\n       (iii) assessing opportunities for the harmonization of \n     regulations and security practices among the nations of the \n     region.\n       (F) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing remote regional monitoring \n     centers that would receive real-time data from radiological \n     security sites, would be staffed by trained personnel from \n     the countries in the region, and would alert local law \n     enforcement in the event of a potential or actual terrorist \n     incident or other emergency.\n       (G) A list and assessment of the best practices used in the \n     United States that are most critical in enhancing domestic \n     radiological material security and could be used to enhance \n     radiological security worldwide.\n       (H) An assessment of the United States entity or entities \n     that would be best suited to lead efforts to establish a \n     radiological security zone program.\n       (I) An estimate of the costs associated with the \n     implementation of a radiological security zone program.\n       (J) An assessment of the known locations outside the United \n     States housing high-risk radiological materials in excess of \n     1,000 curies.\n       (4) Form.--The study required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate;

Res. 548\n\n(Designating the week beginning September 9, 2012, as ``National Direct \n               Support Professionals Recognition Week.'')\n\n       Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, \n     personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support \n     workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``direct support professionals'') are the primary \n     providers of publicly funded long term supports and services \n     for millions of individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, \n     trusted relationship with an individual with disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual \n     with disabilities with the most intimate needs on a daily \n     basis;\n       Whereas direct support professionals perform a broad range \n     of activities for individuals with disabilities, including \n     preparing meals, managing medications, bathing, dressing, \n     helping with mobility, providing transportation to school, \n     work, and religious and recreational activities, and helping \n     with general daily affairs;\n       Whereas a direct support professional provides essential \n     support to help keep an individual with disabilities \n     connected to the family and community of the individual;\n       Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals \n     with disabilities to live meaningful, productive lives;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are the key to \n     allowing an individual with disabilities to live successfully \n     in the community and avoid more costly institutional care;\n       Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are \n     female, and many are the sole breadwinners of their families;\n       Whereas, although direct support professionals work and pay \n     taxes, many are impoverished and are eligible for the same \n     Federal and State public assistance programs that individuals \n     with disabilities depend on;\n       Whereas Federal policies, State policies, and the opinion \n     of the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) \n     assert the right of an individual to live in his or her home \n     and community;\n       Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are \n     employed in home and community-based settings, and the \n     percentage of direct support professionals employed in such \n     settings is projected to increase during this decade;\n       Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage \n     of direct support professionals in every community throughout \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to \n     leave jobs due to inadequate wages and benefits, creating \n     high turnover and vacancy rates, which, research \n     demonstrates, adversely affects the quality of supports \n     provided to individuals with disabilities: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) designates the week beginning September 9, 2012, as \n     ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';\n         (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct \n     support professionals, direct care workers, personal \n     assistants, personal attendants, in-home support workers, and \n     paraprofessionals (referred to in this resolution as ``direct \n     support professionals'') in enhancing the lives of \n     individuals of all ages with disabilities;\n         (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support \n     professionals in serving needs that are beyond the capacity \n     of millions of families in the United States;\n         (4) commends direct support professionals as integral \n     participants in the long-term support and services system of \n     the United States; and\n         (5) finds that the successful implementation of the \n     public policies of the United States depends on the \n     dedication of direct support professionals.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 549\n\n     (Designating September 2012 as ``Campus Fire Safety Month.'')\n\n       Whereas, each year, States across the United States \n     formally designate the month of September as ``Campus Fire \n     Safety Month'';\n       Whereas, since January 2000, at least 152 people, including \n     students, parents, and children, have died in campus-related \n     fires;\n       Whereas 85 percent of those deaths occurred in off-campus \n     residences;\n       Whereas a majority of college students in the United States \n     live in an off-campus residence;\n       Whereas many fatal fires have occurred in a building in \n     which the occupants had compromised or disabled the fire \n     safety system;\n       Whereas automatic fire alarm systems provide the early \n     warning of a fire that is necessary for occupants of a \n     building and the fire department to take appropriate action;\n       Whereas automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly \n     effective method of controlling or extinguishing a fire in \n     the early stages, thus protecting the lives of building \n     occupants;\n       Whereas many college students live in an off-campus \n     residence, fraternity or sorority housing, or a residence \n     hall that is not adequately protected by automatic fire \n     sprinkler systems and automatic fire alarm systems;\n       Whereas fire safety education is an effective method of \n     reducing the occurrence of fires and the resulting loss of \n     life and property damage;\n       Whereas college students do not routinely receive effective \n     fire safety education while in college;\n       Whereas educating young people in the United States about \n     the importance of fire safety is vital to help ensure that \n     young people engage in fire-safe behavior during college and \n     after college; and\n       Whereas developing a generation of adults who practice fire \n     safety may significantly reduce future loss of life from \n     fires: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) designates September 2012 as ``Campus Fire Safety \n     Month''; and\n         (2) encourages administrators of institutions of higher \n     education and municipalities across the United States--\n         (A) to provide educational programs to all college \n     students in September and throughout the school year;\n         (B) to evaluate the level of fire safety being provided \n     in both on-campus and off-campus student housing; and\n         (C) to ensure fire-safe living environments through fire \n     safety education, the installation of fire suppression and \n     detection systems, and the development and enforcement of \n     applicable codes relating to fire safety.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 550\n\n(Designating September 13, 2012, as ``National Celiac Disease Awareness \n                                Day.'')\n\n       Whereas according to the National Center for Health \n     Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 141 people in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, antitissue transglutaminase, and IgA \n     antiendomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\n     malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, \n     miscarriage, congenital malformation, short stature, and \n     disorders of the skin and other organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) designates September 13, 2012, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n         (2) recognizes that all people of the United States \n     should become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n         (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n         (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/11/senate-section/article/S6239-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2012\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
