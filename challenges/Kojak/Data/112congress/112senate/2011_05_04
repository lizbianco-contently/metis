Madam President, hundreds of local first responders, 500 \nNational Guardsmen, and hundreds of volunteers in southern Illinois are \nworking around the clock to try to protect homes and communities from \nthe rising waters of the Ohio River and other rivers in the region.\n  I have a photo that shows the devastation, which I witnessed \npersonally last Friday. This is an area of southern Illinois, one that \nhas been hard pressed economically, has been struggling, and now is \ninundated with flooding.\n  A few days ago when I visited Olive Branch and Cairo, IL, near the \nsouthern tip of the State, I saw this flooding firsthand. Homes, barns, \nand roads were covered by floodwater. Voluntary evacuations have been \ncalled for in a dozen Illinois towns, and people are scrambling to find \na place to stay with friends and family and shelters to wait out the \nflood.\n  They worry about what will happen, when they will get back in their \nhomes, and when the kids will get back to school.\n  This is another photo which demonstrates the kind of floodwaters that \npeople are struggling with in my part of the world in southern \nIllinois. My colleague, Senator Kirk, was in southern Illinois over the \nlast couple of days and has witnessed this firsthand as well.\n  We are both prepared to do whatever we can to help our State and all \nof the States in the region that have been affected by this terrible \nflooding. In many cases this flooding is, unfortunately, going to be \nthere for some time.\n  One of the properties I showed was in Cairo, IL. The water is already \nwaist high and will continue to rise. It can be weeks before people can \nreturn home to see what, if anything, they can salvage.\n  Late Monday night, the Army Corps of Engineers made a very difficult \ndecision. They blew a hole in a levee on the Missouri side of the \nMississippi River near Cairo, IL, to relieve pressure on the levee and \non other levees along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. That decision \nwill flood farmland, and that flooding will relieve some of the \npressure on the towns and communities,\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nthe families and homes which have been threatened by these rising river \nwaters.\n  The decision to disable the levee at Birds Point in Missouri, as \ndifficult as it was, may have saved the lives of some of the nearly \n3,000 people in Cairo, IL, and surrounding communities. There are early \nindications that the Army Corps plan is starting to work. The Ohio \nRiver has already dropped 1\\1/2\\ feet at Cairo since 10 o'clock Monday \nnight. Engineers estimate the water level may go down as much as 7 feet \nas a result of the release of water at Birds Point.\n  I want to make it clear to the people of Missouri, to my colleagues \nfrom Missouri, that I will stand with them to make certain there is \ncompensation given to those farmers and homeowners who were affected by \nthis decision to open this levee. Their misfortune is going to spare \nliterally thousands of homes and businesses from the inundation of \nthese floodwaters, and we should stand with them just as if they were \nthe victims of the original flooding.\n  I am thankful for the good news that the river levels are coming \ndown, but the flooding is far from over. Water continues to rise and \novertop levees throughout the southern part of my State. My heart goes \nout to the men and women piling sandbags, to the National Guard--God \nlove them; every time we have an emergency in our State, they are there \nworking night and day--also to the men and women of the Army Corps of \nEngineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency, and all of the agencies--Federal, State \nand local--that are pitching in.\n  I stand ready with Senator Kirk to help in any way we can in Illinois \nand here in Washington over the next few days and weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2640-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, although lawmakers returned to \nWashington this week amidst news of a signal achievement in the war on \nterror, we also return to many critical debates about the situation \nhere at home.\n  Gas prices are straining budgets and threatening to stall the \neconomic rebound we have all been waiting for. Millions of men and \nwomen across the country still can not find a job.\n  And the two major parties have now presented competing visions of our \neconomic future.\n  Republicans have shown that we are committed to creating an \nenvironment in which the private sector can flourish and create jobs, \nthe jobs Americans need. As part of that effort, we outlined a \ncomprehensive jobs agenda yesterday.\n  And today we will oppose prematurely ending debate on the small \nbusiness bill. The other side has refused to allow votes on some of the \nbest ideas Republicans have offered for creating jobs as a part of this \nlegislation, including an important amendment by the ranking member of \nthe Small Business Committee, Senator Snowe. And we intend to oppose \ntheir efforts to short circuit this debate until they do.\n  Republicans are also committed to stopping the administration's \ninexcusable war on American energy at a time of near-record gas prices. \nAnd we are committed to repealing the Democrat health care bill that is \nalready raising costs and destroying jobs.\n  But hovering above all of this is a growing fear about our Nation's \ndebt.\n  The administration knows this. That is the reason for tomorrow's debt \nmeeting at the White House.\n  So this morning I would like to start there, because anyone who has \nfelt even the slightest twinge of pain from the recession has a vested \ninterest in this debate.\n  Here is why: if we do not act to reduce our debt, this country could \nvery well experience a crisis that makes the economic meltdown of 2008 \nlook like a slow day on Wall Street.\n  That is not my conclusion.\n  That is the conclusion of the Democrat cochair of President Obama's \nown debt commission, a man who has spent the last year looking at this \nissue from every conceivable angle and who is now telling anybody who \nwill listen that America faces, in his words, ``the most predictable \neconomic crisis in history.''\n  Few of us saw the last crisis materialize. This one we can see. And a \ngrowing number of people now recognize that the upcoming vote on the \ndebt limit provides us with the single best opportunity we have to \navoid this crisis before it strikes.\n  This is the moment to get serious about preventing this approaching \ncrisis and to show the world that we can come together, not for the \nsake of party but for all Americans.\n  The world is waiting for America to get its fiscal house in order. \nThe fact that members of both major parties are now showing a \nwillingness to do it is an encouraging sign.\n  But if we are actually going to do this, more Democrats in Washington \nhave to acknowledge the problem, and the urgency of addressing it now, \nin a serious way.\n  I realize that for some people that is a difficult thing to do. We \nare all grateful to the President's decisiveness over the weekend in \ngoing after Osama bin Laden. He is to be congratulated for it. Yet over \nthe past 2 years, we have had many crises. And all too often, it seemed \nthe hardest decision for the President was not whether to solve these \ncrises but whether or not to give a speech about them.\n  Last year, we waited for weeks to hear the President's position on \none of the biggest ecological disasters in history. And throughout this \npast winter and spring, we waited to hear what he thought about a debt \nthat had spiraled so out of control that America's economic outlook has \nbeen downgraded to ``negative'' for the first time ever.\n  We can not wait for the President on this one.\n  The consequences of sweeping our problems under the rug again are \njust too great.\n  So let me be clear: As even some Democrats have conceded, a failure \nto do anything meaningful about the debt would be far more harmful to \nour economic future than a failure to raise the debt limit.\n  The warnings are simply too loud to ignore.\n  In early 2008 most of us had no idea we were headed for a financial \ncrisis. Only a few prophetic voices were saying anything about the \ndangers in the housing market.\n  Over the past few years, we have seen the painful consequences of \nthat crisis: unemployment lines, lost savings, millions of homes \nforeclosed.\n  Despite this largely unforeseen economic catastrophe, the American \npeople have dug in. They have worked harder. They have tried to drag \nthe country back to fiscal health.\n  It has not been easy, but they have struggled every day to get us \nback on our feet.\n  What I am saying this morning is that the danger posed by the debt is \nnot uncertain.\n  It is coming right at us.\n  It is, as the cochair of the President's Debt Commission put it, the \nmost predictable crisis in history. And anyone who is more concerned \nabout raising the debt ceiling than in using this debate as an \nopportunity to prevent this most predictable crisis will answer for it. \nThe American people will make sure of it.\n  Some may continue to deny that we need to do something about the \ndebt; that the only thing we need to do is raise the debt limit and \nleave it at that. They want people to think this is all just some \npolitical exercise, and that we all just vote according to the \nPresident's political affiliation anyway.\n  Those days are over. Anyone who continues to pretend otherwise is not \njust deluding themselves. They are deluding the American people.\n  There isn't a single one of us who has not vowed to do everything in \nour power to prevent the next crisis from happening. Now we know for \ncertain--absolutely certain--it is on the way--unless we act to prevent \nit. Raising the debt limit alone will not prevent this crisis; it \nsimply avoids it.\n  That is why the only way we can claim we have actually done something\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nmeaningful in this debate is to insist on meaningful reforms as the \nprice of our vote. Yes, we have had clean debt ceiling votes before. \nThat was before S gave us a negative outlook for the first time ever \nand told us we risk a downgrade unless we get our fiscal house in \norder. That was before the world's largest private holder of U.S. \nTreasurys dumped its share of U.S. debt. That was before a commission \nthat has spent a year studying this issue told us we are headed for \nruin unless we act to prevent it. That was before this administration \nadded trillions to the debt and submitted a budget plan this year that \ncalled for another $13 trillion in debt over the next 10 years alone.\n  The crisis is here. The time to act is now.\n  We hear a lot from administration officials about what a catastrophe \nit would be if we didn't raise the debt ceiling, and there may very \nwell be some merit to that argument. But what good would it do to raise \nthe limit and wait for the disaster to strike? We might as well tell \npeople to move to the second floor in case of a fire on the first \nfloor.\n  My constituents do not have the jobs to lose. Kentucky doesn't have \nthe wealth to give away. We have seen the consequences of a recession \nwe did not predict. There is no excuse not to do everything in our \npower to prevent one we know is coming.\n  So let me suggest a way forward in this debate.\n  No. 1, pitting one group of Americans against another isn't going to \nsolve the problem. In fact, it is part of the problem. We all know it \nis going to take all of us working together to get out of this crisis, \nso why don't we start acting like it?\n  No. 2, there are not enough taxes Americans, rich or poor, can pay to \nsustain the kind of spending Democrats in Washington want. The \nPresident may say he wants to tax the rich, but sooner or later he is \ngoing to have to tax everyone else to pay for his plans. What is more, \nwe all know raising taxes would stall the rebound we all claim we want. \nSo let's admit we do not have a revenue problem; we have a spending \nproblem.\n  No. 3, we all know entitlements need to be part of this discussion. \nIt is about time everyone starts acknowledging it. I have seen the ads \nabout lawmakers voting to end Medicare. Let's be honest and admit \nnobody is talking about taking anybody's Medicare. Frankly, it is \npathetic to claim otherwise, and it only makes the problems harder to \nsolve.\n  No. 4, let's discuss the art of the possible. We all know tax \nincreases would not pass the House because of the damage they do to \nfamily budgets and businesses, and a bipartisan majority in the Senate \nopposes raising taxes on families, on energy production, and small \nbusinesses across America. So let's set that aside and find common \nground.\n  Everyone has a stake in this debate. If we face up to it as adults, \nwe will not only prevent a crisis, we will preserve our common way of \nlife, and we will show the world the United States can solve its \nproblems head on. Millions of Americans are looking for work and \nstruggling every day to rebuild their lives. Families and small \nbusinesses are being squeezed by gas prices and an administration that \nrefuses to do anything about it.\n  We will have debates about this in the days ahead, and Republicans \nwill continue to make the case for tapping our own energy resources. We \nwill make the case against new taxes and regulations and a health care \nlaw that is stifling jobs and creating new burdens. But all these \nefforts rise or fall on whether we do something about our debt.\n  It is time to show we can tackle the big stuff. The stakes are too \nhigh to let this debate come and go without acting. Denying the problem \nwill not solve it. Avoiding the problem until the next election will \nnot solve it. Giving speeches about the problem will not solve it. The \ntime has come to act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2641-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2641-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of John McConnell to be a U.S. district judge in my home \nState of Rhode Island. I had the occasion yesterday to be on the floor \nand to associate myself with the remarks of my senior Senator, Jack \nReed, but I wish to add some remarks of my own regarding how worthy an \naddition to the Federal bench Jack McConnell will be and to urge my \ncolleagues to support his nomination and, in particular, to support an \nup-or-down vote on his nomination.\n  The McConnell nomination has been reported on three separate \noccasions by the Senate Judiciary Committee, each time with a \nbipartisan vote. This bipartisan backing is not a surprise, given the \nbroad support his nomination has found across the political spectrum in \nmy home State of Rhode Island. I will not read all the quotes of \nsupport from prominent Republicans back home, but let me just touch on \na few.\n  Republican former Chief Justice Joseph R. Weisberger, an \nextraordinarily respected jurist of our State's supreme court, stated, \nfor example, that McConnell:\n\n     . . . would be superbly qualified to preside as a Federal \n     judge over the most challenging and complex cases. He is a \n     man of keen intelligence and impeccable integrity. He would \n     be a splendid addition to the distinguished bench of the \n     United States District Court of Rhode Island.\n\n  Republican former attorney general of Rhode Island Jeffrey Pine \nprovides equally glowing reviews:\n\n       Throughout his career, Jack has demonstrated the kind of \n     legal ability, integrity, dedication to his client, and \n     willingness to fight hard for the cause of justice that makes \n     him a truly outstanding candidate for the Federal judiciary. \n     . . . In my opinion, he would bring the kind of experience to \n     the Federal bench that would make him an outstanding judge \n     presiding at trials, and a fair and impartial arbiter for \n     those who come before him.\n\n  I would add that Attorney General Pines' Republican predecessor as \nattorney general, Arlene Violet, has been equally complimentary.\n  John Harpootian, the former Republican Party vice-chair, has added:\n\n       One of the greatest characteristics that I admire about \n     Jack so much is that, despite political differences of \n     opinion, he never allowed those differences to become \n     personal or to cloud his judgment. As a result, we have \n     always enjoyed spirited conversation regarding political \n     issues, but have remained great friends. These \n     characteristics lead me to unqualifiedly support Jack's \n     confirmation to the United States District Court for Rhode \n     Island.\n\n  There has been similar support beyond the Republican Party from the \neditorial board of our State's leading newspaper, The Providence \nJournal, owned by the Alexis Belo Corporation. Despite disagreeing with \nMcConnell on major litigation he brought in private practice, the paper \nwrote not one but two separate editorials supporting his nomination. \nThe paper opined, for example:\n\n       Jack McConnell, in his legal work and community leadership, \n     has shown that he has the legal intelligence, character, \n     compassion, and independence to be a distinguished jurist.\n\n  The Providence Chamber of Commerce has weighed in to praise him as a \n``well-respected member of the local community.'' Jack certainly has \nrichly deserved that title with all his various community service \nthroughout the years, whether for Crossroads Rhode Island, the State's \nlargest homeless center, Providence's Trinity Repertory Theater, the \nProvidence Tourism Council or other organizations.\n  In sum, those who know Jack McConnell as a lawyer and as a person \nrecognize that he will be a great district court judge, with a proper \nunderstanding of the limited judicial role. A native Rhode Islander and \na graduate of Brown University, McConnell will make his State proud in \nhis service on the Federal bench, particularly at a time when our court \nis straining under the workload caused by the vacancy he would fill.\n  Unfortunately, out-of-State interest groups have politicized the \nMcConnell nomination. I am not going to spend time now rebutting every \nargument these special interests and their well-paid lawyers have \nconcocted to attack this nomination. Suffice it to say that Jack \nMcConnell has answered all the questions posed to him by this body, \nleaving no doubt about his legal skill or his integrity.\n  I will briefly make two points, however.\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\n  No. 1, yes, Jack McConnell brought lawsuits against powerful \nindustries, including tobacco, asbestos, and lead paint. There is \nnothing wrong with that. There is no dishonor in representing poisoned \nkids, lung cancer patients or the bereaved widow of a mesothelioma \nvictim. It should not disqualify McConnell or anyone from confirmation. \nThe most important measures of a judicial nominee are legal expertise, \nstrong character, and a proper understanding of the judicial role, and \nthose are qualities that Jack McConnell possesses in abundance.\n  Yes, Jack McConnell has been active in politics, much like he has \nbeen active in many other aspects of Rhode Island public life. The \nquestion, however, is not whether he has been politically engaged in \nthe past but, rather, whether he will put aside his political advocacy \nwhen he goes on the bench. I know he will. My senior Senator, Jack \nReed, knows he will. Mr. McConnell testified before the committee that \nhe would. Consider what Judge Bruce Selya of the First Circuit Court of \nAppeals, a Republican appointee, said when interviewed by The \nProvidence Journal:\n\n       It would be a terrible rule to say candidates should be \n     excluded if they donate to their political parties in a \n     perfectly legal fashion.\n\n  The paper continued, describing the interview with Judge Selya:\n\n       Selya said that when Senators weigh the credentials of \n     political contributors who are nominated to the Federal \n     bench, the proper question is not how much money did they \n     give, but rather, can they make the transition from partisans \n     to impartial jurists. The judge said he believes McConnell \n     can do that.\n\n  Judge Selya is not only a leading Republican jurist in Rhode Island, \nhe is also a man of impeccable integrity, and his vouching for Jack \nMcConnell is entitled to considerable weight among all those who know \nJudge Selya.\n  We must not disqualify talented and successful advocates merely \nbecause of their prior political or legal advocacy. Some of my \nRepublican colleagues may not like the suits McConnell chose to bring. \nI do not share that view, but fair enough. We should remember, however, \nthat lawyers we disagree with can make the transition from advocate to \narbiter. Lawyers nominated by Republican Presidents who defended \ncorporations all their private practices simply do not have a monopoly \nover the proper judicial mindset.\n  Let me make a last point before I close. The tradition of this body \nhas been to give up-or-down votes to district court nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and who have the support \nof both home State Senators. That is an important tradition in this \nbody. Cloture has not historically been required. The Congressional \nResearch Service reports that from 1949 to 2009--over six decades--only \nthree cloture motions were ever made on district court nominations and, \nin each case, each nomination ultimately was confirmed without the 30 \nhours of postcloture time being used. For every other district court \nnomination in that 60-year stretch, no cloture motion has been \nnecessary.\n  We have departed from that tradition in this case, and I fear it is a \nconsequential departure. The majority leader has been forced to file a \ncloture motion on this nomination. I, nevertheless, hold out hope our \nRepublican colleagues will allow the motion to be withdrawn and grant \nan up-or-down vote to be held in short order. Doing so would be the \nproper course of action, in keeping with this institution's best \ntraditions and most conducive to future comity on nominations. Indeed, \nit would be consistent with the clearly held and firmly stated views my \nRepublican colleagues have indicated in the past.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of John \nMcConnell to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. \nI urge them to give deference to the judgment of Senator Reed and \nmyself in this area and, at a minimum, to grant him the up-or-down vote \nthat is Senate tradition for district court nominees backed by both \nhome State Senators who have emerged, in this case in a bipartisan \nfashion, from the Judiciary Committee with clearance from the ABA and \nthe FBI. Jack has proven himself to be an excellent lawyer and public-\nminded citizen of the highest integrity and he will be a great district \ncourt judge.\n\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nWhitehouse, in strongly supporting the nomination of Jack McConnell to \nbe a United States district court judge for the District of Rhode \nIsland. Indeed, as my colleague indicated, there is a big issue here \nbeyond Mr. McConnell; which is whether we are going to institute a new \nthreshold of cloture, which could be routinely applied to all district \ncourt judge nominees. As my colleague indicated, this is an \nextraordinary departure from the history of this Senate going back \ndecades.\n  We have long adhered to the tradition that local Senators and the \nlocal legal community and the local civic community are the best judges \nfor a potential nominee, subject, obviously, to the President's action \nand, quite importantly, to the review by the American Bar Association \nand, quite importantly, the background checks of the FBI, and, quite \nimportantly and very, very importantly, to the deliberations of the \nJudiciary Committee here in the Senate. This has been the process for \nboth Republicans and Democrats. It has extended over decades, and it is \nsomething I hope we can respect today through our deliberations and the \nconclusion of these deliberations.\n  Turning to Mr. McConnell, we are fortunate, I believe, to have an \nindividual of his talent and his character. Jack is a graduate of Brown \nUniversity and Case Western Reserve University Law School. He clerked \nfor a justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. He has received \nnumerous accolades and awards, such as the National Association of \nAttorneys General President's Award and Case Western Reserve \nUniversity's Martin Luther King, Jr., Award. He has been named to \nnumerous lists of the best lawyers. He has the top rating in both \nethics and achievement from Martindale-Hubbell, which is the service \nthat reviews and lists, practically, every attorney in the United \nStates.\n  But I do not simply want to repeat Jack's extraordinary resume of \nhard work and success. I want to share some of my personal judgments. \nHe is fundamentally and extraordinarily a decent and honest person. He \nstarted out from very humble beginnings. He has worked hard for \neverything he has accomplished in his life. Through his hours of not \njust legal work but pro bono work and volunteer work, he has \ncontributed more to the community than anyone I can think of in my home \nState of Rhode Island. And he has done it without fanfare. He has done \nit without self-promotion.\n  He was raised by his late father, who served in Korea with the U.S. \nMarine Corps and continued to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve. His \nmother Jane was a teacher. They demonstrated to him the values of hard \nwork and integrity and decency and honesty that have been the hallmark \nof his efforts and career.\n  While he was also juggling a very demanding legal career and a family \nand children, he took the time, early every Monday morning, to go to \nAmos House, which is a soup kitchen in Providence. It is where the \npoorest of the poor go simply to get some food for the day. He would \nquietly and anonymously serve breakfast, without publicity, without \nfanfare, because he saw this as being part of the community--someone \nresponsible not just for personal success, but for contributing back \nbecause he has been fortunate in his life.\n  He was a Big Brother to a young man in the west end of Providence, a \npoor neighborhood. He has taught first communion classes in his parish \nfor years. He has been a volunteer attorney at homeless legal clinics \nin Providence and Pawtucket--two of our central cities. He has served \non numerous boards--Crossroads Rhode Island, the biggest and largest \nhomeless service in the State of Rhode Island. He has been there \nworking hard, tirelessly. He has chaired the Providence Tourism \nCouncil, which has worked with the Greater Providence Chamber of \nCommerce to promote the city of Providence.\n  These are the types of attributes, experiences, life experiences, \nthat form a person and also provide the basis for being a judge. \nBecause the quality I\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\nthink we all have to look for in a person, who is sitting in judgment \nof complicated civil cases, serious criminal cases, but ultimately \ncases involving men and women, is that they feel that this person \nunderstands them and will be fair to them, regardless of whether they \nare a large corporation or a poor person before the district court. I \nam convinced Jack McConnell will do that--impartially, deliberately, \nand carefully. These are the qualities he has exemplified throughout \nhis career.\n  Jack enjoys strong support and broad support throughout the State of \nRhode Island, and it is a reflection of his work not just as an \nattorney but as a civic leader. I have heard from members from the \nbusiness community, the Rhode Island judiciary, the legal community, \nRepublican and Democratic elected officials, members of the clergy, as \nwell as individuals from Rhode Island's nonprofit sector and academic \nsector. All of them have submitted letters for the record, but I want \nto highlight a few.\n  The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce called Mr. McConnell ``a \nwell-respected member of the local community, leading important civic, \ncharitable and economic development institutions including Crossroads \nRhode Island, the Providence Tourism Council and Trinity Repertory \nTheatre.'' They do not oppose his nomination. If I were looking at the \nbusiness community, I would look at the local business community, not \nthe national, organized efforts, whose agenda is sometimes very far \nremoved from the needs of the small business men and women of Rhode \nIsland.\n  The Providence Journal, as my colleague has cited, has repeatedly \neditorialized in favor of his nomination. He has received emphatic and \nconsistent endorsements. In May of 2010, they said:\n\n       Providence lawyer John J. McConnell Jr., whom President \n     Obama has nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for \n     Rhode Island, is a very able attorney. He has also \n     demonstrated much civic commitment and leadership as a very \n     generous philanthropist and board member of various nonprofit \n     organizations in our area.\n\n  Furthermore:\n\n       Jack McConnell, in his legal work and community leadership, \n     has shown that he has the legal intelligence, character, \n     compassion and independence to be a distinguished jurist.\n\n  After no action was taken on Mr. McConnell's nomination by this body \nin the previous session, the Providence Journal wrote, in November \n2010, that Mr. McConnell is:\n\n       one of America's most able and successful litigators, and \n     has been a very energetic and generous leader in \n     philanthropies and other parts of community life. His \n     character and deep love of the law suggest strongly that he \n     will function as a disinterested judge--one able to look at \n     the facts of each case in the light of a close and rigorous \n     reading of statutory and constitutional law and precedent. \n     Indeed, his legal work and community leadership suggest that \n     he would be a distinguished jurist.\n\n  He is a man of tremendous character, recognized by community leaders. \nThe Institute for the Study & Practice of Nonviolence--an innovative \norganization on the south side of Providence--their executive director, \nTeny Gross, wrote in strong support.\n  Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Joseph Weisberger, one of the most \nrespected jurists in the history of Rhode Island, said of his \nnomination:\n\n       His great experience as a litigator has given him \n     exceptional knowledge of the intricacies of the rules and \n     practice and procedures of federal courts. He would be \n     superbly qualified to preside as a federal judge over the \n     most challenging and complex cases. He would be a splendid \n     addition to the distinguished bench of the United States \n     District Court of Rhode Island.\n\n  Justice Weisberger is a former Navy veteran and a 45-year veteran of \nthe Rhode Island bench, and he is a man who commands enormous respect \nin Rhode Island.\n  The Republican mayor of Rhode Island's second largest city, Scott \nAvedisian, has said:\n\n       Jack is a man of integrity, a strong sense of community, \n     and a very fair and forward-thinking individual.\n\n  This is a Republican elected official: ``a very fair and forward-\nthinking individual.''\n  Business executive Merrill Sherman, an avowed believer in the free \nmarket, a very successful entrepreneur and banker, concluded Mr. \nMcConnell ``has the temperament, demeanor and capacity to be an \nexcellent federal trial judge.''\n  So if Mr. McConnell is so bad for business, why are business leaders \nin the State reflecting on his qualities and giving him accolades and \npredicting he will be a distinguished jurist?\n\n  John Harpootian, another major Republican attorney in the State, a \ndistinguished attorney, stated:\n\n       In my view, however, the most important attribute is \n     integrity. Time and again, Jack has proven that he is a man \n     of great principle and integrity. While being a vigilant \n     advocate for his clients and the causes that he has taken up \n     during his professional career, Jack has always conducted \n     himself in the most ethical and professional manner; a trait \n     unfortunately sometimes not found among lawyers today.\n       One of the greatest characteristics that I admire about \n     Jack so much is that despite political differences of \n     opinion, he never allowed those differences to become \n     personal, or to cloud his judgement.\n\n  I am hard pressed, again, to believe the suggestions that have been \nmade that in some way Mr. McConnell is not a completely ethical person \nbecause every bit of evidence from Rhode Island--Republicans, \nDemocrats, lawyers, business leaders--from a lifetime of observation \nsuggests that he is ethical.\n  But perhaps the most compelling words are the words of former Rhode \nIsland Republican Attorney General Jeff Pine. As Jeff concluded:\n\n       There is no question in my mind that Jack would be an \n     honest, principled, ethical, and fair judge. He would be a \n     credit to our state and judiciary. I enthusiastically support \n     his candidacy for the position on the federal bench.\n\n  This is our former Republican attorney general.\n  If that judgment is not sufficient, let me render another judgment. \nThis is in the form of a colleague, a former Pennsylvania Attorney \nGeneral, a Republican, who is now a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit. This body, at the recommendation of the \nPennsylvania Senators, years ago, under President George W. Bush, \nconfirmed unanimously D. Michael Fisher to serve--after distinguished \nservice as a Republican attorney general in Pennsylvania--as a circuit \njudge. Here is what Judge Fisher said:\n\n       I met and worked with Mr. McConnell when I was the elected \n     Attorney General of Pennsylvania from 1996 to 2003. We worked \n     very closely together on the national tobacco litigation . . \n     . and worked closely with Mr. McConnell. . . . We spent \n     considerable time together in New York and at meetings \n     elsewhere and I had the unique opportunity to assess Mr. \n     McConnell's legal abilities and his character which were both \n     outstanding. . . . John J. McConnell Jr. is an outstanding \n     nominee to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District \n     of Rhode Island, and I enthusiastically support his \n     nomination.\n\n  These are the words of a Federal circuit court judge, nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush and confirmed unanimously by this Senate.\n  Again, I implore my colleagues to listen to what people who know Jack \nMcConnell have said and the words they have used: integrity, honesty, \ncharacter, independence, impartiality. Those are the words used by \npeople who know him, and that is the truth.\n  I urge not only on the merits, but also in terms of the traditions of \nthe Senate that we allow this vote to come to a final vote and that we \nvote for Mr. McConnell.\n  But let my turn briefly to the claims made by some. Frankly, I am a \nlittle bit leery to address these supposed criticisms, but they have \nbeen leveled and I think there should be some response.\n  The first claim seems to be that Mr. McConnell is anti-business. \nWell, outside of the support he has received from business leaders from \nRhode Island and the Providence Journal, which has a historic \nreputation going back several years of being a prominent supporter of \nbusiness in Rhode Island, I think it is also good to reference the fact \nthat two insurance industry trade associations--the National \nAssociation of Mutual Insurance Companies and the Property Casualty \nInsurers Association of America--originally signed a letter in 2010 \nthat stridently attacked Mr. McConnell.\n  However, in December of 2010, both of these associations, which \nrepresent companies that scrupulously work for their shareholders, \nwithdrew their opposition because they stopped and looked at the facts.\n  They spoke to their Rhode Island insurance company members. They \nexamined the Republican support for Mr.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nMcConnell. They listened to what the Greater Providence Chamber of \nCommerce had to say. To quote from the National Association of Mutual \nInsurance Companies' letter:\n\n       Upon further consideration and consultation with our member \n     companies in Rhode Island, and after evaluating support for \n     Mr. McConnell from the local business community and former \n     Rhode Island Attorneys General Arlene Violet and Jeffrey \n     Pine, NAMIC withdraws its opposition to his nomination. . . .\n\n  Again, those who have carefully considered Jack McConnell have \nacknowledged that he will bring no personal agenda to the courtroom, as \nhe has testified truthfully and accurately.\n  Another insinuation is that Mr. McConnell has not comported himself \nin an ethical manner. This is a serious charge. If any Senator is going \nto level this kind of assertion, they have to have clear and compelling \nfacts on their side.\n  Indeed, in his over two decades of practice, Mr. McConnell has never \nhad an ethics complaint alleged or filed against him. He has never had \na malpractice claim alleged or filed against him. He has never had a \nrule 11 motion filed against him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, then \nwe would need to add 2 minutes to the Republican side, and I ask \nunanimous consent for that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. There is a third claim against Mr. McConnell regarding the \nState of Rhode Island's lawsuit against a number of companies which, at \none time, manufactured lead paint. Let me state for the record that \nthis process had its start under a Republican Attorney General, Jeffrey \nPine, and then continued under two succeeding attorneys general.\n  The lawsuit had precedent under Rhode Island law. While it was a \nlengthy and difficult trial, Judge Silverstein, a State superior court \njudge who oversaw this trial and was responsible for the court's \nbusiness calendar, had nothing but praise for Mr. McConnell's \ninvolvement and that of his opposing counsels. Again, Judge Silverstein \nis one of our most respected judges by all sides and by the entire \nRhode Island bar for his judgment, integrity, and his skill. He had \nnothing but praise for Mr. McConnell's involvement.\n  A fourth claim is an insinuation that Mr. McConnell received some \nkind of favoritism when the state selected a legal firm to bring the \nlead paint lawsuit. The facts are again different from the claim. \nFirst, Mr. McConnell and former Attorney General Pine discussed this \nissue within the context of the global tobacco litigation. Attorney \nGeneral Pine then asked Mr. McConnell to provide a legal memo on this \nmatter. Attorney General Pine reviewed the materials and believed the \ncase was solid but did not want to undertake the case due to the end of \nhis term. In 1999, AG Pine's successor, who happened to be Senator \nWhitehouse, asked to be briefed on the matter. Then Attorney General \nWhitehouse, asked another firm, DeCof and DeCof, to review the case, \nand this firm found the merits of the case to be factually and legally \nsound under Rhode Island law. The case was then actively litigated by \nthe state under AG Whitehouse's tenure. It was then reviewed by AG \nWhitehouse's successor, who decided after much deliberation to continue \nthe case. So there you have it. A Republican Attorney General chose Mr. \nMcConnell more or less and his Democratic successors retained his firm.\n  I am also told this proposed arrangement was submitted to the court, \nthe court reviewed it, and did not object to it. I am also told by \nSenator Whitehouse that, indeed, the judge had the final approval of \nany type of payments made. That is the type of arrangement I think is \nwell within the consistency and ethics of procedures within Rhode \nIsland and across the Nation.\n  I could go on and on. I conclude by saying this: This is an \nindividual of integrity, character, decency, education, talent, and \nskill. Today, we are on the verge, I hope, of confirming a district \ncourt judge nominee. If we reject this person through a cloture fight, \nwe are setting up an extraordinarily dangerous precedent that in the \nfuture could be used to prevent individuals of character and talent \nfrom serving on the bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that over the \nnext 30 minutes Republican Senators led by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nPortman, and including the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, Senator \nCornyn from Texas, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, and myself be \npermitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2644-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2644-S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RIGHT-TO-WORK LAW\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, it seems as if every day there is \nsome new action by the Obama administration that throws a big wet \nblanket over job creation in America. Republicans haven't been hesitant \nto point this out and talk about too many taxes, too many regulations, \ntoo much debt, higher gasoline prices, higher health care costs, and \nthe health care law.\n  Yesterday, Senators Graham and DeMint and I introduced legislation to \nreaffirm section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act to permit States, if \nthey so chose, to have a right-to-work law, creating a competitive \nenvironment in which we can create more jobs in this country. This is \nin reaction to the action by the National Labor Relations Board that \nwould basically say the Boeing Company could not expand into a nonunion \nState.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial in \nthe Wall Street Journal today called ``Congress vs. the NLRB.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Congress vs. the NLRB\n\n       President Obama's National Labor Relations Board has spent \n     the year thumbing its nose at Congress by reinterpreting \n     longstanding labor law on behalf of union friends. Congress \n     is finally fighting back.\n       Tennessee GOP Senator Lamar Alexander along with South \n     Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Jim DeMint are this week \n     introducing legislation to rein in the labor board's latest \n     assault on business. The board's complaint against Boeing, \n     filed last month, is the first shot in a new union war on \n     federal right-to-work law, a policy shift that is every bit \n     as threatening as the drive to get rid of secret ballots in \n     union elections.\n       Boeing decided 17 months ago to invest $2 billion building \n     a new production plant for its 787 Dreamliner in South \n     Carolina. It made the decision only after talks broke down \n     with the International Association of Machinists and \n     Aerospace Workers, whose members wanted the work at a \n     unionized plant in Washington state. The union's many strikes \n     over the years have cost Boeing a bundle. South Carolina, \n     like 21 other states, has a right-to-work law, which forbids \n     compulsory unionism.\n       The Obama NLRB nonetheless chose to make Boeing a whipping \n     boy in a new offensive against right-to-work states. It filed \n     a complaint demanding that an administrative law judge halt \n     the South Carolina plant (set to open in July), and force \n     Boeing to move production to Washington.\n       This despite the fact that Boeing made clear this is a new \n     production facility or that it has added 12,000 jobs in \n     Washington since announcing the South Carolina move.\n       No matter. The complaint's real target is the federal \n     right-to-work guarantee. Among the most celebrated provisions \n     of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act is what's known as 14(b)--the \n     section that allows states to pass right-to-work laws. The \n     Boeing complaint guts that guarantee by effectively requiring \n     companies to continue manufacturing in union states--or be \n     found guilty of a rights violation. This is a union dream \n     come true, on par with ``card check.''\n       As Senator Alexander tells us, this is a direct attack on a \n     right-to-work law that was ``thoroughly debated'' by Congress \n     in 1947 and ``remains clear today.'' The Alexander-Graham-\n     DeMint legislation would clarify the existing provision, \n     ensuring that state right-to-work laws cannot be pre-empted \n     by the NLRB or union contracts. We're assuming the 11 \n     Democratic Senators from right-to-work states will stand up \n     for their non-unionized workers--if Senator Majority Harry \n     Reid (from right-to-work Nevada) allows a vote.\n       Boeing will fight the NLRB complaint, though that might \n     mean a protracted court fight. It also means more uncertainty \n     for every business considering a move of future production \n     facilities to a right-to-work state. Many of them may simply \n     relocate manufacturing overseas.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\n       This is the latest gambit from an Administration that has \n     been ramping up its regulatory and enforcement powers on \n     behalf of special-interest allies such as unions. The only \n     check against this is Congress, so we're glad to see Members \n     speaking up.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, as important as it is to say what we \ndon't like about the Obama administration's job policy, it is even more \nimportant for us to say what Republicans will do to create an \nenvironment to make it easier and cheaper to create private sector \njobs.\n  Senator Portman of Ohio has a strong background as a budget director, \nas a Congressman, and as a trade negotiator in the Bush administration, \nand he has a good understanding, representing one of our largest and \nmost important manufacturing States, of exactly what kind of policy it \ntakes to create an environment for job growth. He has been working with \nRepublican Senators so that we can clearly state our progrowth plan. We \nwould like to discuss that.\n  I ask Senator Portman, what would be the keys to the Republican plan \nto make it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I happen to have \nthe answer to his question. Yesterday--he is correct--we did propose a \njobs plan, which is a series of commonsense proposals to get our \neconomy back on track and create jobs across our country.\n  You will recall that a few years ago there was a stimulus effort in \nthe Congress--the President's $800 billion stimulus plan--that was \npassed. The idea was to get the economy back on track. There were \nestimates that it would have a big impact on job growth and, in fact, \nreduce our unemployment numbers significantly. That didn't happen.\n  One of the reasons that didn't happen is because it relied too much \non government providing the resources for jobs. Government doesn't \ncreate jobs, but government can create the climate for job growth. Our \nview is that we need to take a different approach. That approach is to \nstimulate private sector job growth and create that pro-growth \nenvironment.\n  The seven proposals we announced yesterday as part of our jobs plan \ninclude being sure that we do indeed deal with the deficit and debt \nbecause that is a negative impact today on our economy. In fact, there \nare economic studies out there showing that our GDP is much smaller \nthan it would otherwise be but for the deficit and debt. Also, we need \nto reform the Tax Code to spur economic growth. Economists across the \nspectrum agree that we can stimulate economic growth by having a Tax \nCode that makes more sense for job creation.\n  Regulation is a major issue. We will hear from our colleagues who \nwant to make sure we have regulatory relief for small businesses which \nare not able to create jobs because of the increased regulations coming \nfrom Washington.\n  We need a workforce that is more competitive, and that requires the \nFederal Government to do a better job on workforce development. Also, \nthere is the need to increase and expand exports. The President has \ntalked about that. We are eager to get trade agreements in Congress. We \ncan create hundreds of thousands of new jobs immediately through \nexpanding markets.\n  We also talked yesterday about energy. This is important. There are \nthings we can do right now to get America less dependent upon foreign \noil and use our own resources in this country more effectively. Then in \nterms of the health care circumstances--we will talk about this in a \nmoment--every person I have talked to in Ohio, and I have been on over \n200 factory visits in the last couple years--tells me the cost of \nhealth care is going up not down, which is making it harder to create \njobs. We will talk about the need to reduce health care costs.\n  This is a commonsense, seven-point plan to get the economy moving and \ncreate jobs. It is incredibly important to get the unemployment numbers \ndown and to be sure American families have opportunities. It is also \nvery important, though, in terms of dealing with the debt and deficit \nbecause, although we need to restrain spending--and Congress is \nbeginning to take small steps in that regard--we also need to grow the \neconomy.\n  When we have 1.8 percent economic growth, which we had in the last \nquarter, which is anemic, weak, and not something we should be \nsatisfied with, it is difficult to create that economic growth to help \ndeal with this huge overhang of deficits and debts.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said, we have other colleagues with us \ntoday, and Senator John Hoeven from North Dakota will talk about these \nissues, as will Senator Barrasso from Wyoming. Senator Cornyn from \nTexas has just joined us.\n  I ask Senator Hoeven, a former Governor of North Dakota--where there \nis about 3.6 percent unemployment and is a State that is producing \ndomestic energy to help meet our needs and is a big State for exports--\nif he will talk about his ideas on job growth and how it fits into this \njob plan.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, Senators \nPortman, Alexander, Barrasso, and Cornyn, that it is great to be here \nthis morning to engage in this colloquy. I want to follow up on the \npoints that my esteemed colleague referred to on both energy and trade. \nThey are very important in terms of job creation for our country.\n  If I could, I will start for a minute on the comprehensive nature of \nthis jobs plan that Republicans have put together. If we look at it, we \nwill see that it is truly comprehensive. It is about living within our \nmeans, about reforming our Tax Code, without raising taxes, to create a \nprogrowth environment, create jobs, and get our economy moving. It is \nabout unburdening our economy from the overregulation that is hurting \njob creation. It is about helping to create a more competitive \nworkforce to compete in a global economy. It is about increasing our \nexports, and it is about a truly comprehensive approach to energy that \nwill help us develop all of our sources of energy, both traditional and \nrenewable. It is also about commonsense health care reform. We need to \ndo that because we have more than 15 million people who are unemployed. \nEvery day they are unemployed is one day too many. We also have to get \non top of this deficit and debt we face. That means controlling our \nspending, reducing our spending, but it also means growing our economy. \nThat is the way to not only get people back to work but reduce the debt \nand deficit.\n  If we look at the 1990s when we were in a somewhat similar situation, \nthat is exactly what we did. We need to go back and do that. North \nDakota is a large energy-producing State--oil, gas, clean coal \ntechnology, and also the renewables, biofuels, and wind. But the way we \ndid it wasn't through government spending. It was through creating a \nlegal, tax and regulatory environment and creating certainty so that \ncompanies and entrepreneurs could invest in energy and advanced \nmanufacturing and technology--the whole gamut. But there are hundreds \nof millions to billions of dollars today that would go into investments \nall over this country in the energy patch, both traditional sources and \nrenewable sources of energy, with the latest, greatest technology--more \nenergy, more dependable, and cost effective, with better environmental \nstewardship.\n  That is what this is about, creating the right environment. By the \nsame token, we are looking at three different trade agreements: the \nSouth Korea Free Trade Agreement, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, \nand the Panama Free Trade Agreement. These would create more economic \nactivity. The Korea agreement alone is expected to increase U.S. \nexports to South Korea by $10 billion a year. We are talking hundreds \nof thousands of jobs.\n  We need to be working on those free-trade agreements right now, \ntoday, to approve them. I urge our leadership and the administration to \nwork with us to get those trade agreements to the floor and get them \napproved as part of this comprehensive jobs plan.\n  I thank my esteemed colleagues again, and I commend Senator Portman \nfor his outstanding work on this plan. I thank all of the members of \nour caucus for the contributions they have made to this plan. Also, \nagain, I express our desire to go to work with our friends across the \naisle on all of these provisions for the benefit of all of those who \nare looking for work, for the benefit of our economy, and for the \nimportant role that economic growth, along with spending restraint, \nwill play in helping us get on top of our debt and deficit.\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\n  With that, I turn the colloquy back over to Senator Portman for his \nadditional remarks.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nHe makes great points about the need for us to use our resources at \nhome on energy and for us to expand exports because that immediately \ncreates jobs in this country. He has done it. As a Governor, he rolled \nup his sleeves and got directly involved in economic development. He \nknows what it takes. The fact that he has been a champion of this plan \nand helped put it together gives me confidence that this is going to \nwork.\n  We need to work on a bipartisan basis. We are reaching out to our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and the administration. So \nmuch of this is common sense. These are things we should do now.\n  We are also joined by our colleague from Wyoming. He is Wyoming's \ndoctor. He is also a leader in the Senate and has taken the lead on a \nnumber of issues related to jobs, two of which are part of our jobs \nplan. One is, of course, the regulatory front, where he has taken the \ntime to really dig into how these regulations affect business growth. \nHe may have comments on that issue today.\n  I would like to hear Dr. Barrasso on that point but also on the \nhealth care front where, as a doctor, he looked into what the impact of \nhealth care reform will be on jobs. This is something that perhaps does \nnot get talked about enough. Unless we figure out a way to get health \ncare costs under control, it will be harder for us to create \nopportunities in this country because the costs embedded in hiring a \nnew employee under health care alone are so high that many companies \nare simply not hiring. I would love to hear his thoughts.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I thank Senator Portman for the \nincredible job he has been doing as a champion of efforts to create \nmore private sector jobs in this country, to make it easier and cheaper \nto create private sector jobs, for the private sector to create the \njobs we need. Senator Portman showed significant leadership in his \ncampaign last year in Ohio developing the Portman jobs plan. He went to \nfactories and small businesses all across the State of Ohio because he \nknows small businesses are the engines that drive the economy.\n  Seventy percent of the jobs created in this country are created by \nour small businesses one at a time. When there are government rules, \nregulations, redtape, and increased expenses, it makes it much harder \nbecause it does not provide the certainty the small businesses of this \ncountry need to create those new jobs. They may not be willing to take \nthe additional risk and additional expense because of the unknown \nconcerns.\n  I think that is one of the points that is highlighted in this \nwonderful plan Senator Portman has put together, along with the members \nof the Republican Party. A big part of this plan has to do with the \nrules and regulations that come out of Washington, DC--rules and \nregulations that may not even be connected to laws that were passed in \nthis body but rules and regulations put forward by this administration, \nby people who have a different view of how America works.\n  I was encouraged over 100 days ago when the President said he had an \nExecutive order that would try to eliminate some of the redtape. Here \nwe are 100 days later, and it is just another broken promise from this \nadministration. The redtape continues to hold American small businesses \nhostage.\n  We are trying to cut through that redtape. The American people \nrealize it. The administration may not realize it, but the American \npeople realize it. When the American people were questioned just this \nlast month about whether there are too few regulations or too many \nregulations and the impact on business, a majority said there are too \nmany regulations on our businesses.\n  How much money does Washington spend on regulations? I will tell you, \nMadam President. Government spent a record $55 billion developing and \nenforcing rules last year--$55 billion developing and enforcing rules \nlast year. That is just the spending of government. What is the impact \non businesses around the country? For every $1 the government spends to \nput forth and enforce these rules, it costs businesses of this country \n$30. That is over $1.5 trillion expended by businesses across the \ncountry. That is a drag on our economy, making it harder for them--not \neasier but harder and more expensive for the private sector to create \njobs. There is $30 of business expense for every $1 spent on rules and \nregulations out of Washington.\n  People are worried because it is going to get worse. There are still \n224 rules in the pipeline that have been labeled as ``economically \nsignificant.'' What is an economically significant rule? It is a rule \nthat has an impact on the economy of over $100 million. There are 224 \nof them coming down the line. Is it a surprise that the unemployment \nrate continues to be so high? It is because of the rules and \nregulations of this administration.\n  What do the American people believe about this situation? Over 70 \npercent of the American people believe several different things about \nthe effect of the rules. I will tell my colleagues what they are. This \nis polling from just last month. They will tell you that additional \nenvironmental regulation increases the price of energy for items such \nas gasoline and electricity. Seventy percent of Americans believe the \nrules coming out of Washington increase the costs of items such as \ngasoline and electricity--the energy issues. How much is the pain at \nthe pump costing the American family this year? About $800 per family \nthis year in higher gasoline rates than last year. If you are a family, \nthat has an impact on your quality of life. It has an impact if you are \ntrying to deal with bills, kids, and a mortgage. But there are a lot of \nregulations out there. The American people see this.\n  Also, over 70 percent of the American people know in their hearts and \nbelieve that small businesses--the job creators of this country--are \nimpacted much more than the large businesses of the country. But it is \nthe small businesses we want to help.\n  The other point that more than 70 percent of the American people \nbelieve, in a poll by the Tarrance Group, is that if regulations make \nit too expensive to keep jobs in America, businesses will continue to \nmove overseas. Businesses will continue to move overseas.\n  There is so much uncertainty with the rules and regulations coming \nout of this town that it is paralyzing the rest of our country. That is \njust on the rules and regulations aspect that people can see. There are \nso many rules and regulations that are still coming.\n  I was at a hospital in Cody, WY, talking about health care. I \npracticed medicine for 27 years, taking care of families all across the \nCowboy State. I was visiting a hospital in Cody, WY, and they said they \nwere trying to figure out one aspect of the health care law--\naccountable care organizations. It is 6 pages of the 2,700-page law \nthat was crammed through in the middle of the night, with Americans \nsaying: No we don't want this. The people who do regulations took 6 \npages of the law and came up with over 400 pages of regulations. They \njust came out about a month ago. The hospital administrator said: We \nare having to take money away from patient care, from helping with \nnurses and therapists to pay for consultants to try to explain these \nrules and regulations to us so we can abide by them.\n  Those are the kinds of regulations and rules on steroids that I \ncontinued to hear about as I traveled in the last week or so at home \nvisiting with people, visiting the communities, listening to what \npeople have to say and the concern and the uncertainty because what is \ncoming out of Washington is a drag on our economy. It is preventing us \nfrom making it easier and cheaper for the private sector to create more \njobs.\n  People all across the country are concerned, and that is why I am so \nhappy to be here with Senator Portman today and his efforts, his \nleadership on a jobs plan that is one that focuses fundamentally on the \nthings that will get government off the backs of the American people \nand let the American people get back to work. I thank Senator Portman \nfor his leadership at a time when we see a government that is borrowing \ntoo much, spending too much, and growing bigger every day. I am very \nappreciative of his efforts to get things back under control and get \nthe decisionmaking out of\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nWashington and back to the hometowns and States across the country.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank Dr. Barrasso. I appreciate the \namount of time he has put into this regulatory issue and the relief \nsmall businesses need on the regulatory front. It is obvious he is out \ntalking to businesses, and it is directly related to jobs because we \ncannot get the jobs back unless we reduce the cost of doing business \nthat comes from these regulations.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have remaining in this colloquy?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 12 minutes 7 seconds on \nthe Republican side.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, as I said, we are also joined by Senator Cornyn of \nTexas. I am going to ask him in a minute to say a few words about the \njobs plan. The input he has put into it has been terrific because he is \nthe guy who understands, again, the importance of small business, the \nimportance of us creating an environment through Washington laws and \nregulations that helps create jobs, and that it is not Washington that \nis going to create the jobs but the private sector that is going to do \nit.\n  I ask my colleague from Texas to say a few words about his thoughts.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Ohio, what a \nwelcome idea of refocusing on the No. 1 issue in America today, which \nis too many Americans out of work. Of course, we saw the growth numbers \nfor the first quarter of this year: 1.8 percent--hardly vigorous enough \nto create the kind of economic expansion and job creation we need.\n  As we are dealing with the spending issue, we have to deal with \ngrowing the economy. That is exactly what the Senator from Ohio has \nproposed--a comprehensive plan to try to figure out how to get people \nback to work and to try to get the kind of economic growth that will \nhelp us deal with this debt crisis we are in.\n  The one thing I especially like about the plan, although I like all \nof it, is the embracing of a notion of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. The Senator from Ohio has had a distinguished career \nnot only in the House but as U.S. Trade Representative and also as \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. He knows the budget \nnumbers and the intricacies of that better than just about anybody \nhere. He knows the difficulty we have had, whether Republican \nadministrations or Democratic administrations, of living within our \nmeans.\n  Now that we are spending so much money we do not have--about 40 cents \non every dollar, with $14.3 trillion in debt and huge deficits--we have \nto figure a way out of that situation. I think the best way to do that \nis to put this proverbial straitjacket on Congress and force us to do \nwhat every family and every business and 49 States do, either because \nof constitutional or statutory provisions.\n  I wish to say in conclusion how much I appreciate the good work he \nhas done. Senator Portman has been here a short time, but he brings a \nlot of experience and a lot of wisdom on these issues, particularly on \ngetting America back to work.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Texas. He is \nabsolutely right. When we look at the budget deficit and the debt and \nthe impact it is having on our economy today, it is clear we need \nconstraints. Forty-nine States have a balanced budget requirement. When \nI am back home talking with people in our cities and counties, in their \nstruggles with balancing their own budgets, they ask me: How can \nWashington continue to spend so much money it does not have? Forty \ncents of every dollar Washington spends today is borrowed money. \nClearly that restraint is needed.\n  It is important to get the economy back on track. Often we talk about \nthe record budget deficit and the $14 trillion debt in terms of its \nimpact on future generations. As the father of three, I am very \nconcerned about that, as we all should be, because we are mortgaging \ntheir future, the excessive spending today that they are going to have \nto pay back.\n  It is not just what is going to happen in the future. Our deficits \nand debts have gotten so big that there is an impact on the economy. \nThere was a study done recently by a couple of respected economists--\nRogoff and Reinhart--which says, in looking around the world, where a \ncountry's debt is up to 90 percent of its total economy, you have about \na 1-percent decline in the GDP or the growth in the economy. Our growth \nwas only 1.8 percent last quarter. That means it should have been at \nleast 2.8 percent but for our debt and deficit because now our gross \ndebt is 100 percent of our economy. So we are over that 90-percent \nthreshold, and we are impacting our economy today.\n  When we think about it, with all the government borrowing out there, \nit is crowding out private borrowing. There are fewer jobs being \ncreated in America because the government is playing a bigger and \nbigger role, crowding out the ability of small businesses to get a \nloan.\n  I also join a lot of other folks in this Chamber on both sides of the \naisle in my deep concern about the possibility of a debt crisis if we \ndo not deal with these historic deficits and debts. That could send our \neconomy into a tailspin with sky-high interest rates, with inflation \nthat is already rearing its ugly head again in this country. We need to \naddress this issue because it is the right thing to do for future \ngenerations--it is really a moral issue--but also because it does \nimpact what is going on today in our economy and our ability to get \nthis economy back on track and create jobs. It is so important to \nAmerican families and, as I said earlier, so important for us dealing \nwith the fiscal problems because we have to both restrain spending and \ngrow the economy, increase economic activity, which will increase \nrevenues.\n  Madam President, can you give me a warning when we have 5 minutes \nremaining in the colloquy today?\n  I would like to turn back to my colleague from Tennessee who started \nthis off this morning talking about the importance of this job plan.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, would the Senator have some more \ncomments on the plan and about what has been said by some of our other \ncolleagues?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague very much.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. To the Chair, if the 5-minute warning could be for the \nend of the 25 minutes because I intend to take 5 minutes after that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes remaining in \ntotal on the Republican side.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will take 1 minute and then conclude. I wish to \nthank Senators Portman, Cornyn, and Barrasso for this. We will be \nhearing often from Republicans who want to make clear what we are for \nas well as what we are against, and I thank the Senator from Ohio for \nhis leadership.\n  I wonder if, in the last 30 seconds or so, he wants to focus on trade \nand jobs, which has been his specialty.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. First of all, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \nhelping to promote this idea. Again, we are looking to reach out to \nDemocrats in this Chamber, in the House, and working with the \nadministration, to actually get this done. We need to get the American \neconomy back on track.\n  I just heard the Senator talk about trade, and we talked about that \nearlier. But as was said earlier, we need to increase exports because \nexports equal jobs. If we look at these three pending trade agreements, \nwhich the administration has yet to send to Congress--and we can't move \nunless they do that--they would create, alone, between 250,000 and \n380,000 jobs, depending on what numbers you look at. Think about that, \nhundreds of thousands of jobs are ready to be created right now by \nknocking down barriers to our workers, our farmers, and our service \nproviders just in these three instances alone.\n  We also need to provide the President with the authority to knock \ndown more barriers by giving him trade promotion authority. So I call \non the administration to send us those agreements--free up those \nagreements--and allow us here in America to be able to create more jobs \nby expanding our exports, by leveling this playing field between these \nthree countries--Panama, Korea, and Colombia--and then let us get busy \non having the United States even more engaged in international trade, \nexpanding exports and, therefore, creating jobs.\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\n  Let me review quickly these seven core areas and then turn it back to \nmy colleague from Tennessee.\n  We do need to focus on the fiscal situation, as we have talked about, \nto be able to help the economy. Our Tax Code needs to be reformed to \ncreate economic growth. We can do that. We know there is a way to do it \nwithout raising taxes and by reforming the code and making it more \nprogrowth; the regulations we talked about that are stifling so many \nsmall businesses in this country; the competitive workforce, retraining \nis critical, and we can do a much better job taking the existing \nFederal resources and directing them toward retraining for jobs that \nare actually there; expanding exports, we just talked about; of course, \npowering America's economy by using more of our own domestic \nresources--renewable but also traditional uses of energy; and, finally, \ngetting health care costs down, as Senator Barrasso talked about.\n  If we do these things, we will create more hope and opportunity at a \ntime when it is so desperately needed. We should be able to do it \nbecause they are commonsense ideas.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2648-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2648-S2649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, we have a vote at noon. I know there \nare a number of Senators who wish to speak. I will take about 5 \nminutes, I suspect Senator Cornyn wants to speak, and I know Senator \nGrassley wants to speak. I also see Senator Reid.\n  The Senate is a body of precedent. One important precedent is that \nnever in the Senate history has a President's district court \nnomination, reported by the Judiciary Committee, been defeated because \nof a filibuster; that is, because of a cloture vote. Once a nominee for \nFederal district judge has gotten to the floor, the majority of \nSenators have made the decision in an up-or-down vote.\n  Therefore, I will vote for cloture in order to allow an up-or-down \nvote on the President's nomination of John McConnell, then I will vote \n``no'' on confirmation because I believe he is a flawed nominee.\n  I know most of my Republican colleagues are going to register their \nopposition to Mr. McConnell by voting to deny an up-or-down vote. I \nrespect their decision. I understand how they feel. I also was outraged \nin 2003 when Democratic Senators filibustered President Bush's circuit \ncourt nominees simply because they disagreed with their philosophies. I \nmade my first speeches on the floor of the Senate arguing against such \na change in precedent.\n  On February 27, 2003, I said on this floor:\n\n       When it comes time to vote, when we finish that whole \n     examination, I will vote to let the majority decide. In plain \n     English, I will not vote to deny a Democratic President's \n     judicial nominee just because the nominee may have views more \n     liberal than mine. That is the way judges have always been \n     selected. That is the way they should be selected.\n\n  That is what I said in 2003.\n  In 2005, Republicans grew so upset with the Democrats' continued \nfilibustering of President Bush's circuit nominees, the Republican \nmajority leader threatened to eliminate the right to filibuster in \nconnection with judicial nominations. That proposal was called the \nnuclear option because it was said if Republicans succeeded in \nabolishing the filibuster, their actions would ``blow the place up.'' I \nsuggested, in two Senate speeches, that a small group of Senators, \nequally divided by party, agree to oppose the filibustering of judges. \nThe result of those remarks was the creation of the Gang of 14--the \nGang of 14 Senators who preserved the tradition of up-or-down votes by \nagreeing to use the filibuster only in extraordinary cases. I have \namended my own views to subscribe to the Gang of 14's standard for \nSupreme Court and circuit court judges.\n  It is true the Gang of 14 agreement didn't explicitly distinguish \nbetween circuit and district judges. But the debate then clearly was \nonly about Supreme Court and circuit judges, and the Senate always \nthought of district judges differently. District judges are trial \njudges. Circuit judges also must follow precedent but have broader \ndiscretion in interpreting and applying the law. Circuit judges' \njurisdictions are broader. Their attitudes and philosophies are much \nmore consequential in the judicial process.\n  That is why the Senate has never allowed a Federal district court \nnomination to fail by denying cloture. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, in the history of the Senate----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  There being no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, in the history of \nthe Senate, only three cloture motions have ever been filed on district \njudge nominations. In each case, the nomination eventually was \nconfirmed.\n  In 1986 cloture was invoked by a vote of 64-33 on Sidney Fitzwater \ndespite opposition to the nomination by Democratic senators. Mr. \nFitzwater was then confirmed 52-42.\n  In 1999 cloture was not invoked by a vote of 55-44 on Brian Theodore \nStewart's nomination because of Democrat opposition. He was confirmed \ntwo weeks later by a vote of 95-3.\n  In 2003 a cloture motion was filed on Marcia G. Cook's nomination but \nit was withdrawn and she was confirmed 96-0.\n  I certainly wish President Obama had nominated someone other than Mr. \nMcConnell. During his confirmation hearings, questions arose about a \npossible role in stolen corporate documents, in soliciting contingency \nfee legal contracts, and about his judicial temperament. Some senators \neven feel misled by some of his statements. It was even said he is the \nonly district judge to be opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in \nits 99-year history.\n  Well, the Senate has more than a 200-year history. And that history \nis not to use the filibuster to defeat a district judge nomination.\n  I am comfortable with the Gang of 14 precedent in the case of circuit \njustices and Supreme Court justices. I will continue to reserve the \nright to vote against allowing an up-or-down vote in an extraordinary \ncase. I also understand the strategy of ``They did it to us, so we will \ndo it to them.'' Unfortunately, that strategy, I am afraid, will lead \nus to a new and bad precedent, one which will weaken the Senate as an \ninstitution and come back one day to bite those who establish it.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know there are a number of us who would like to speak \non the upcoming cloture vote at noon on the McConnell nomination. I \nknow Senator Grassley would; I presume the Senators from New York and \nRhode Island would. I wonder if we could reach some unanimous consent \nagreement that would allow at least 5 minutes for each of us to speak.\n  I would pose that as a unanimous consent request; that for the \nSenators who are currently on the floor, the five of us, we be given up \nto 5 minutes to speak preceding the cloture vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Might I ask a question of the Chair? What is the time \nstatus? There is 35 minutes until noon; is that divided?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, the time is equally divided. \nThe Democrats control 19 minutes, the Republicans control 18\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I wish \nto remind the Senators this isn't the only debate on the floor. We are \nhaving a cloture vote on SBIR, and we would like some time to close \nthat debate as well. So I am open to work with the other Senators.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, reserving my right to object, I would \nsuggest, according to the request of the Senator from Texas, that the \nSenator from New York be recognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from \nTexas be recognized for 5 minutes, that I be recognized for 5 minutes, \nand then Senator Grassley be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The question then would be, Is there sufficient time for Senator \nLandrieu and, of course, Senator Leahy?\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Could I ask unanimous consent----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I don't know how to do this, but if we could do 3 \nminutes each and reserve at least 15 minutes for closure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has been consumed during this \ndebate.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I believe we have 37 minutes remaining; \nis that right, 19 and 18?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know Senator Leahy wants to close with 5 minutes.\n  So what we could do, equitably, is give each of the six Members on \nthe floor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have to object to that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. Madam President, I have the floor and I ask to be \nrecognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2649-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2649-S2657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COURT VACANCIES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to talk about a serious crisis \nin the third branch of government; that is, the rate of vacancies in \nthe U.S. district courts.\n  There is a crisis that is unlike almost all the other issues we \ngrapple with on a daily basis. It has a very simple solution. My \ncolleagues and I deal with a lot of very difficult and very divisive \nproblems every day. Not many of them lend themselves to solutions that \nare both politically and economically costless, but this one is easy: \nconfirm these judges.\n  Take the district court nominees who were passed out of committee \nwith bipartisan support, schedule votes on the floor, and confirm them. \nIt sounds easy. Apparently, it is not. It is not easy because my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have slowed the confirmation \nof district court judges to a trickle, even those nominees who were \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee with no objection from \nRepublicans.\n  This Congress, I am grateful for the hard work of Chairman Leahy, \nRanking Member Grassley, Majority Leader Reid, and Minority Leader \nMcConnell in beginning to unclog the pipeline, but we still have a long \nway to go. To go the rest of the distance, to restore the pace of \njudicial confirmations before the Federal judiciary faces the worst \nvacancy crisis in history, we need the consent of our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Here are the facts: The targeting of district court nominees is \nunprecedented. Five of the nineteen district court nominees who have \nreceived split votes in the last 65 years have been President Obama's \nnominees. We have only confirmed 61 of his district court nominees. By \nthis time in their Presidencies, we had confirmed 98 of President \nBush's and 114 of President Clinton's.\n  Judicial vacancies affect nearly 100 Federal courtrooms across the \nNation. One in nine seats on the Federal bench is vacant. So we should \napprove these nominees.\n  As for the current nominee pending on the floor, he is somebody who \ndeserves nomination. When we ask about nominees, we are concerned the \nstandard used by my colleagues is, would I have nominated this person, \nrather than is this person whom I might not have nominated in the \nmainstream? Jack McConnell is clearly in the mainstream. He has more \nthan 25 years' experience as a lawyer in private practice. Leading \nRepublican figures in Rhode Island have endorsed him. But he has \ngarnered opposition not because of his qualifications but because of \nhis clients. That is not fair, that is not right, and that is not how \nwe do judicial nominees.\n  He has chosen his work as a private lawyer, and that has no bearing \non his judicial temperament, his interpretive philosophy or his legal \nacumen. In the interest of my colleagues who require more time, I would \nurge, at the very least, that people take the standard of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee--don't block cloture on this nominee. If you think he is \nnot qualified, vote against him.\n  Jack McConnell deserves to be on the bench. I am glad Leader Reid has \ncalled him, and Senators Reed and Whitehouse have taken the lead. I \nurge, at least on cloture, that my colleagues let this nominee be voted \nupon.\n  I yield the remainder of the time I have been allotted so others of \nmy colleagues might speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have been conferring with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and other Senators who want to speak. Maybe if we \ncould try another attempt at a unanimous consent request that would \nallow all of us a chance to speak.\n  Since I have the floor, I assume I can speak for up to 10 minutes \nunder the standing order. I am willing to yield some of that time so \neverybody can have an opportunity.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I object to any unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have the floor. The Senator is out of \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the Senator from----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will proceed, then, under the standing order which \ngives me up to 10 minutes, as I understand.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I regret that the Senator from Louisiana is unwilling to \ncooperate and provide everybody a chance to be heard, but I will \nproceed.\n  I wish to speak to the nomination of Jack McConnell to the Federal \ndistrict bench. I spoke on this nomination yesterday. I have authored \nan op-ed piece in the Washington Times expressing my concern. I wish to \nsummarize my concerns for my colleagues' benefit and their \nconsideration.\n  I serve as a member of the Judiciary Committee, as does the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley. Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, this \nnominee was asked about allegations of theft of corporate documents \narising out of some lead paint litigation that his law firm was \npursuing in the State of Rhode Island. That has been the subject of \nsome discussion.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have several documents printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that after my comments, the complaint \nof the Sherwin Williams Company v. Motley Rice and others be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask one further unanimous consent, and that would be \nthat an article from Legal Newsline about a discovery dispute still \ndelaying the resolution of the theft case against Motley Rice be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. What I think these documents demonstrate is that not only \ndid Mr. McConnell intentionally mislead the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwith regard to his possession of these stolen documents, but now there \nhas been for some years--even after the lead paint cases have been \nessentially dismissed by the Rhode Island Supreme Court with the State \nand Mr. McConnell and his law firm having lost--ongoing litigation by \none of the defendants in that case suing for tortious interference with \ntheir property; also conversion--in other words, theft, as the \nPresiding Officer knows--of their private, proprietary documents, \nincluding their litigation strategy, including their trade secrets and \nthe like.\n  The article, dated April 21, 2011, that I have made part of the \nrecord shows that dispute over the theft of these documents remains \nunresolved. In other words, Mr. McConnell and his law firm's \nparticipation in this ongoing dispute remains unresolved. I don't know \nwhy the majority leader would choose to bring up a nomination of \nsomebody for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench when serious \nallegations about his law firm's participation and his personal \nparticipation in the theft of corporate documents in pursuit of \nlitigation remains unresolved. I think it is a terrible mistake.\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n  I know the Senator from New York suggests we ought to just go ahead \nand vote on cloture because he knows then that because our Democratic \nfriends control 53 votes in the Senate, Mr. McConnell will be \nconfirmed. But I am concerned that because the ethical allegations made \nagainst Mr. McConnell and his law firm remain unresolved, this is a \nterrible time for us to be voting on a lifetime tenure. If he were to \nbe confirmed and we find out later on that the court actually finds he \ndid participate in this conspiracy to steal these corporate documents, \nwhat would that say about the Senate and about this process, our \ndeliberative process? I think it would be a scandal. It would be a \nscandal.\n  Finally, let me say I have expressed my concerns previously about the \nscheme that a group of very smart trial lawyers have dreamed up to sue \nlegal industries for huge amounts of money by making alliances with \nState attorneys general and then suing in the name of the State but \nthen in the end settling these cases for billions of dollars--in some \ncases, hundreds of billions of dollars--and these lawyers reaping a \nwindfall of billions of dollars in attorney's fees. That is something \nStuart Taylor--I think one of the more level-headed commentators about \nlegal matters--has said, that this has indeed morphed the rule of law \ninto the rule of lawyers, and ultimately consumers will have to pay \nmore in terms of higher prices and the lawyers reap a windfall.\n  The very same lawyers who are hired through these no-bid, noncompete \ncontracts are indeed the political supporters of these very same \nattorneys general, raising at least the appearance of impropriety and a \npay-to-play system of providing litigation opportunities to these \nlawyers from which they reap billions of dollars and after which they \nfunnel campaign contributions back to the very same State officials who \nhave, in fact, authorized them to sue on behalf of the State. This is \nunseemly, to say the very least about it.\n  Finally, I would say Mr. McConnell continues by his own admission to \nbe eligible to receive up to $3.1 million a year in one of these \nshakedown-industry lawsuits where these trial lawyers have worked with \nState attorneys general to sue on behalf of the State, not in cases \nthat were actually tried but were actually settled under an existential \nthreat to these businesses and these industries.\n  At a time when we are talking, as Senator Portman did, about job \ncreation, the idea that we would be confirming a lawyer to a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench where he could then serve as a venue, \ngiven the venue shopping that frequently goes on in this type of \nlitigation, we can expect, if Mr. McConnell finds himself confirmed as \na Federal judge, that in the future litigants will find a warm \nreception in his court to these ethically dubious schemes.\n  I think it is an extraordinary circumstance according to the \nstandards set by the so-called Gang of 14. It is not something we will \nbe doing often. But when an ethically flawed nominee such as this \nnominee is proposed by the President of the United States on three \ndifferent occasions, and Senator Reid, the majority leader, as is his \nright, tries to slip this stealth nominee through when people are \npaying attention to other things, and we have not had adequate time to \ndebate and expose in the record so Senators can make a good judgment \nabout the facts and do their duty as individual Senators, I think it is \na terrible shame.\n  I intend to vote against cloture, and I hope my colleagues will so we \ncan have additional time to review this nominee's credentials and make \na good-faith assessment on behalf of all of our constituents.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           IN THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS CUYAHOGA COUNT, OHIO\n\n     THE SHERWIN WILLIAMS COMPANY,\n     101 Prospect Avenue, N.W., Cleveland, OH 44115 (Plaintiff), \n     v. MOTLEY RICE LLC, Motley Rice LLC, 28 Bridgeside Boulevard, \n     Mount Pleasant, SC 29464 And JOHN DOES, Defendants.\n\n     Complaint\n     JOHN P. O'DONNELL\n     CV 09 689237.\n\n       The Sherwin-Williams Company (``Sherwin-Williams''), for \n     its Complaint against Motley Rice LLC (``Motley Rice'') and \n     other unknown persons, alleges as follows:\n\n                    Introduction and Nature of Claim\n\n       1. The law firm of Motley Rice has represented since 1999 \n     the Rhode Island Attorney General, other government \n     officials, and private individuals in highly contentious \n     public nuisance and personal injury lawsuits filed against \n     Sherwin-Williams and other former manufacturers of lead paint \n     and pigments.\n       2. Without the knowledge or consent of Sherwin-Williams, \n     Motley Rice has somehow obtained stolen copies of PowerPoint \n     slides used by Sherwin-Williams' Associate General Counsel--\n     Litigation to advise the Company's Board of Directors on the \n     costs of defending the lead paint and pigment litigation, \n     among other information, and his analysis of potentially \n     available insurance coverage for that litigation--an issue \n     that Sherwin-Williams was actively litigating with its \n     insurers in a separate action. Those documents contain highly \n     confidential, proprietary business information and are also \n     protected by the attorney-client privilege and the attorney \n     work product doctrine.\n       3. It appears that Motley Rice, at the time it received \n     those slides, wrongfully obtained other Sherwin-Williams' \n     confidential, proprietary, and privileged documents from the \n     same person who is unknown to Sherwin-Williams. All of \n     Sherwin-Williams' confidential, proprietary, and privileged \n     documents taken without authorization will be referred to as \n     ``Documents'' in this Complaint.\n       4. Despite repeated requests by Sherwin-Williams, and \n     despite Motley Rice's admission that it obtained Sherwin-\n     Williams' Documents through its own efforts, Motley Rice has \n     refused to reveal how it obtained Sherwin-Williams' stolen \n     Documents; to identify all Sherwin-Williams' Documents in its \n     possession; to provide them to a court for in camera review; \n     or to return Sherwin-Williams' Documents.\n       5. By this action, Sherwin-Williams seeks to uncover how \n     Motley Rice obtained the Documents, to protect and secure the \n     return of its stolen Documents from Motley Rice, to prevent \n     any use of those Documents or information contained in them, \n     and to be compensated for the harm caused to Sherwin-Williams \n     by Motley Rice's wrongful acquisition and use of those \n     Documents.\n\n\n                              THE PARTIES\n\n       6. Sherwin-Williams is a corporation organized under the \n     laws of the State of Ohio, with its principal place of \n     business in Cleveland, Ohio.\n       7. Motley Rice LLC is a limited liability company \n     incorporated under the laws of South Carolina. It has its \n     principal place in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina and has \n     another office in Providence, Rhode Island.\n       8. The John Does are persons presently unknown to Sherwin-\n     Williams who assisted, aided, and abetted Motley Rice in the \n     tortious acts alleged in this Complaint. The John Does are \n     believed to be residents of the State of Ohio.\n\n\n                         JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n       9. Motley Rice has caused tortious injury in this State by \n     an act or omission in Ohio and by acts outside of Ohio \n     committed with the purpose of injuring Sherwin-Williams, \n     which resides in Ohio. Motley Rice also regularly conducted \n     business in Ohio during the time of the alleged tortious \n     acts. Thus, this Court has jurisdiction over Motley Rice \n     pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 2307.382(A)(3)-(4), (6), (7).\n       10. Venue is proper in Cuyahoga County because part of the \n     activity that gave rise to the claim for relief took place in \n     this County. Ohio R. Civ. Pro. 3(B)(3). Additionally, venue \n     is proper in Cuyahoga County because all or part of the claim \n     for relief arose in this County. Ohio R. Civ. Pro. 3(B)(6).\n\n\n                                 FACTS\n\n       11. In the course of conducting its business, Sherwin-\n     Williams creates and maintains confidential, proprietary, and \n     privileged information and documents. Included among those \n     documents are materials generated by Sherwin-Williams' \n     attorneys to provide advice to Sherwin-Williams' Board of \n     Directors concerning ongoing litigation strategy, \n     anticipation of litigation, developments and costs of defense \n     as well as potentially available insurance coverage for \n     litigation liabilities and defense costs.\n       12. Sherwin-Williams' attorneys have frequently met with \n     the Board of Directors to discuss the lead paint and pigment \n     litigation and the disputes and litigation with its insurers \n     to obtain reimbursement of defense costs and any potential \n     judgments in the lead paint and pigment litigation. The oral \n     and written presentations by Sherwin-Williams' attorneys to \n     the Company's Board of Directors are intended to be \n     confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege \n     and attorney work product doctrine. Presentations to the \n     Board of Directors may also contain confidential and \n     proprietary business information, such as strategies for \n     other litigation, trade secrets for new products, acquisition \n     plans, employment policies, and other sensitive, competitive \n     information. For these reasons, all minutes of and \n     presentations at Sherwin-Williams' Board of Directors' \n     meetings are kept strictly confidential and are securely \n     maintained with restricted access at the company.\n       13. Since October 1999, the State of Rhode Island, through \n     its Attorney General, has retained Motley Rice to sue certain \n     former manufacturers of lead pigments used in architectural \n     paints decades ago, including Sherwin-Williams, for allegedly \n     creating a public nuisance (``Rhode Island Litigation''). \n     Under a contingency fee agreement with the Rhode Island \n     Attorney General, Motley Rice\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n     and other counsel are responsible for all costs and expenses \n     of prosecuting the claims in the Rhode Island Litigation.\n       14. Since the commencement of the Rhode Island Litigation, \n     Motley Rice has been retained by local governments in \n     California, New Jersey, and Ohio to bring similar public \n     nuisance lawsuits against Sherwin-Williams and other former \n     lead pigment manufacturers. Motley Rice also tried \n     unsuccessfully to obtain representation of the cities of St. \n     Louis and Milwaukee as part of its continuing campaign to \n     launch public nuisance lawsuits against Sherwin-Williams and \n     other former lead pigment manufacturers all across the \n     country. The public nuisance lawsuits seek to require \n     several, out of many, former lead pigment manufacturers, \n     including Sherwin-Williams, to remediate all lead paint in \n     all buildings.\n       15. Also, since 1999, Motley Rice has represented dozens of \n     individual plaintiffs in Wisconsin who have sued Sherwin-\n     Williams and other former lead pigment manufacturers alleging \n     personal injuries from elevated blood lead levels.\n       16. Motley Rice attorneys frequently came into Ohio in 2006 \n     to meet and communicate with mayors and members of the \n     executive and legislative branches of local governments in \n     order to persuade them to retain Motley Rice to bring public \n     nuisance lawsuits against Sherwin-Williams and other former \n     lead pigment manufacturers. Beginning in September 2006, \n     Motley Rice was retained to sue Sherwin-Williams and others \n     on behalf of the cities of Akron, Athens, Canton, Cincinnati, \n     Columbus, Dayton, East Cleveland, Massillon, Lancaster, \n     Toledo, and Youngstown and the Stark County Housing \n     Authority. It signed a contingency fee agreement for each \n     city. Motley Rice moved for, and was allowed, leave to appear \n     as counsel pro hac vice in state court for each Ohio \n     plaintiff. Motley Rice wrote, appeared as counsel, and \n     submitted complaints for each Ohio plaintiff. It wrote and \n     submitted briefs in every Ohio case in which defendants filed \n     a motion to dismiss or other pre-trial papers. Motley Rice \n     attorneys appeared in Ohio Common Pleas Courts located in \n     Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Toledo to argue motions, \n     and it responded to public records requests on behalf of \n     various cities.\n       17. Through the public nuisance and personal injury \n     litigation against Sherwin-Williams and others, Motley Rice \n     was and still is attempting to gain millions of dollars in \n     fees for itself.\n       18. Motley Rice's representation of cities in Ohio \n     continued until at least July 2008. Its representation was \n     ultimately unsuccessful, as every Ohio city's complaint was \n     either voluntarily dismissed or dismissed by court order.\n       19. In or about 2006, while Motley Rice was soliciting Ohio \n     cities to retain it, one or more attorneys from Motley Rice, \n     including Fidelma Fitzpatrick, met with a former Sherwin-\n     Williams employee at Cleveland Hopkins Airport. This former \n     employee had been responsible for preparing the PowerPoint \n     slides and other graphics used during presentations made to \n     Sherwin-Williams' Board of Directors in 2004, 2005, and \n     earlier years. Sherwin-Williams did not know of this secret \n     meeting.\n       20. At no time in meeting with the former Sherwin-Williams \n     employee did any Motley Rice attorney caution him not to \n     disclose or discuss any confidential, privileged, or \n     proprietary information or document belonging to Sherwin-\n     Williams.\n       21. During the meeting, the former Sherwin-Williams \n     employee provided Motley Rice with the names of other former \n     employees, several of whom may have had a role in preparing, \n     or would likely have had access to, Board presentation \n     materials.\n       22. On July 1, 2008, the Rhode Island Supreme Court \n     unanimously ruled in favor of Sherwin-Williams and other \n     defendants in the Rhode Island Litigation, reversing a jury \n     verdict in favor of the State and holding that the complaint \n     should have been dismissed at the outset.\n       23. After the Rhode Island Supreme Court's ruling, Sherwin-\n     Williams filed a motion in the trial court, called the \n     Superior Court, for entry of final judgment in its favor, \n     including an award of costs incurred in defending the \n     lawsuit. Although Sherwin-Williams has not yet submitted an \n     itemized bill of costs, Motley Rice submitted a bill of costs \n     for the State exceeding $1.9 million when it initially \n     prevailed in the trial court.\n       24. On September 24, 2008, Motley Rice, on behalf of the \n     State of Rhode Island, filed in the Superior Court a \n     Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion \n     for Costs (``Supplemental Memorandum''). Because Motley Rice \n     is obligated under its contingency fee agreement with the \n     Rhode Island Attorney General to pay all costs of the Rhode \n     Island Litigation, it has a direct, personal financial self-\n     interest in whether the Rhode Island Superior Court awards \n     costs to Sherwin-Williams and, if so, the amount of costs.\n       25. The State's Supplemental Memorandum, which Motley Rice \n     prepared, signed, and filed, contained as an exhibit a copy \n     of the PowerPoint slides used by Sherwin-Williams' Associate \n     General Counsel--Litigation during his presentation to the \n     Board of Directors in October 2004. The first slide \n     identified the speaker as Sherwin-Williams' Associate General \n     Counsel--Litigation. The second slide showed the company's \n     cost to that date of defending the lead paint and pigment \n     litigation. The third slide presented the Associate General \n     Counsel's analysis and opinion regarding potentially \n     available insurance coverage for that litigation, a matter \n     then and still in dispute with its insurers. The presentation \n     contained confidential information, was prepared to provide \n     legal advice to the Board of Directors, and was intended to \n     be confidential and privileged. The Directors were not \n     allowed to keep copies of those slides (hereinafter ``October \n     2004 Confidential Board Slides''). Because Sherwin-Williams \n     considered the information in the October 2004 Confidential \n     Board Slides to be confidential, proprietary, and privileged, \n     it has not publicly disclosed that information.\n       26. Sherwin-Williams never produced in any lawsuit the \n     documents or information contained in the October 2004 \n     Confidential Board Slides. Nor has Sherwin-Williams knowingly \n     produced the October 2004 Confidential Board Slides to any \n     person outside the company. On their face, the October 2004 \n     Confidential Board Slides show that they contain confidential \n     and proprietary information and that they were created and \n     used for the purpose of providing legal advice and analysis.\n       27. The copy of the October 2004 Confidential Board Slides \n     that Motley Rice attached to its Supplemental Memorandum \n     bears a fax line at the top reflecting that it was one page \n     of a 34-page fax sent by an unidentified person from a \n     FedexKinko's in Akron, Ohio. The 34-page fax containing the \n     October 2004 Confidential Board Slides was sent on September \n     12, 2006 from the fax number (330) 668-1105; the receiving \n     number is not identified.\n       28. On information and belief, the other 33 pages of the \n     fax contain highly confidential and proprietary business \n     information, including information regarding strategies in \n     other litigation, proposed business strategies, plans for \n     geographic expansion and market growth, potential mergers or \n     acquisitions, retail partnerships, and sensitive information \n     regarding the company's finances.\n       29. On information and belief, the other 33 pages of this \n     fax are or were in the possession of Motley Rice.\n       30. To this date, despite Sherwin-Williams' request, Motley \n     Rice has refused to (a) explain how it came into possession \n     of the October 2004 Confidential Board Slides; (b) confirm if \n     it has the other 33 pages of the fax; and (c) identify and \n     return Sherwin-Williams' Documents.\n       31. Motley Rice deliberately obtained, kept, and used \n     copies of the October 2004 Confidential Board Slides and \n     other documents belonging to Sherwin-Williams while it knew \n     or should have known that those documents had been taken \n     without Sherwin-Williams' authorization and were \n     confidential, proprietary, and privileged. Motley Rice acted \n     for its own financial self-interest and gain and in conscious \n     disregard of Sherwin-Williams' legal rights and property \n     interests.\n\n\n                                COUNT I\n\n                               CONVERSION\n\n       32. Sherwin-Williams incorporates by reference its \n     allegations in Paragraph 1 through 31 of this Complaint.\n       33. Sometime before September 24, 2008, Motley Rice \n     intentionally and wrongfully obtained and kept without \n     Sherwin-Williams' knowledge or permission its Documents, \n     including the October 2004 Confidential Board Slides and, on \n     information and belief, the documents sent with the September \n     16, 2006 fax. Motley Rice may also have additional Sherwin-\n     Williams' Documents.\n       34. Motley Rice knew, or should have known, that the \n     October 2004 Confidential Board Slides and the Documents sent \n     with the September 12, 2006 fax are the property of Sherwin-\n     Williams.\n       35. Motley Rice knew, or should have known, that the \n     Documents were taken from Sherwin-Williams and provided to \n     Motley Rice without Sherwin-Williams' knowledge or \n     permission.\n       36. Motley Rice also knew, or should have known, that it \n     had no right to possess or use Sherwin-Williams' stolen \n     Documents. Nevertheless, in conscious disregard of Sherwin-\n     Williams' legal rights and property interests, Motley Rice \n     chose to obtain, keep and use those Documents for its own \n     financial benefit in the Rhode Island Litigation and to \n     attempt to cause substantial harm to Sherwin-Williams.\n       37. At all relevant times until present Motley Rice has \n     acted with malice and conscious disregard of Sherwin-\n     Williams' legal rights and property interests. By wrongfully \n     obtaining, retaining possession of, and using Sherwin-\n     Williams' stolen Documents for Motley Rice's own advantage \n     and self-interest with the intent to harm Sherwin-Williams, \n     Motley Rice has converted and continues to convert Sherwin-\n     Williams' property.\n       38. By refusing to return Sherwin-Williams' Documents \n     despite Sherwin-Williams' request to identify and return \n     those Documents, Motley Rice continues to the present day to \n     wrongfully convert Sherwin-Williams' property.\n       39. Wherefore, Sherwin-Williams requests compensatory \n     damages in an amount in excess of $25,000, punitive damages, \n     costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n\n                                COUNT II\n\n                                REPLEVIN\n\n       40. Sherwin-Williams incorporates by reference the \n     allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 39 of this Complaint.\n       41. Sherwin-Williams created and is the sole rightful owner \n     of its Documents now wrongfully obtained, possessed, and used \n     by\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n     Motley Rice without Sherwin-Williams' permission, including, \n     but not limited to, the October 2004 Confidential Board \n     Slides and, on information and belief, the documents sent \n     with the September 12, 2006 fax.\n       42. No one has the right to possess, retain, or use \n     Sherwin-Williams' Documents without the permission of its \n     Board or management.\n       43. Motley Rice has wrongfully obtained, kept, and used \n     Sherwin-Williams' Documents without Sherwin-Williams' \n     permission.\n       44. Motley Rice knew or should have known that those \n     Documents were taken from Sherwin-Williams without Sherwin-\n     Williams' knowledge or permission, and that it was wrongfully \n     obtaining, keeping, and using property belonging to Sherwin-\n     Williams.\n       45. Sherwin-Williams has requested Motley Rice to return \n     Sherwin-Williams' Documents.\n       46. Motley Rice has deliberately and wrongfully refused to \n     return Sherwin-Williams' property, and it has chosen to use \n     Sherwin-Williams' Documents for its own financial advantage \n     and to the substantial detriment of Sherwin-Williams.\n       47. Motley Rice continues to retain and refuses to identify \n     and return Sherwin-Williams' Documents without any right or \n     privilege to do so.\n       48. At all relevant times until present, Motley Rice has \n     acted with malice and conscious disregard of Sherwin-\n     Williams' legal rights and property interests. Motley Rice \n     wrongfully obtained, kept, and used Sherwin-Williams' stolen \n     Documents for the purpose of harming Sherwin-Williams and for \n     Motley Rice's own economic gain.\n       49. Wherefore, Sherwin-Williams is entitled to the \n     immediate identification and recovery of its Documents in the \n     possession, custody, and control of Motley Rice or its \n     attorneys, employees, and agents, damages in an amount \n     exceeding $25,000, punitive damages, costs, and reasonable \n     attorneys' fees.\n\n\n                               COUNT III\n\n                  AIDING AND ABETTING TORTIOUS CONDUCT\n\n       50. Sherwin-Williams incorporates by reference the \n     allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 49 of the Complaint.\n       51. Each John Doe owed to Sherwin-Williams the duty of \n     loyalty and good faith and the duty to maintain the \n     confidentiality of Sherwin-Williams' proprietary and \n     privileged documents.\n       52. Each John Doe breached these duties by wrongfully \n     converting Sherwin-Williams' Documents and providing them \n     without Sherwin-Williams' knowledge or permission to Motley \n     Rice, which had no privilege or right to obtain or possess \n     those Sherwin-Williams' Documents.\n       53. Motley Rice wrongfully obtained, kept, and used \n     Sherwin-Williams' Documents that Motley Rice knew, or should \n     have known, were taken or obtained without Sherwin-Williams' \n     knowledge or permission and in breach of each John Doe's \n     duties to Sherwin-Williams.\n       54. By using Sherwin-Williams' Documents in the Rhode \n     Island Litigation, Motley Rice assisted, aided, and abetted \n     each John Doe, and each John Doe assisted, aided, and abetted \n     Motley Rice, in tortious conduct harming Sherwin-Williams.\n       55. By wrongfully obtaining, keeping, and using Sherwin-\n     Williams' Documents that it knew, or should have known, were \n     stolen or wrongfully obtained by each John Doe without \n     Sherwin-Williams' knowledge or permission, Motley Rice \n     assisted, aided and abetted each John Doe's tortious conduct.\n       56. By wrongfully taking or obtaining Sherwin-Williams' \n     Documents and providing those Documents to Motley Rice \n     without Sherwin-Williams' knowledge or permission, each John \n     Doe assisted, aided, and abetted Motley Rice in its tortious \n     conduct.\n       57. By wrongfully retaining without permission and refusing \n     to identify and return Sherwin-Williams' Documents, each John \n     Doe has assisted, aided, and abetted Motley Rice's tortious \n     conduct.\n       58. Each John Doe and Motley Rice have acted at all \n     relevant times until present with conscious disregard for \n     Sherwin-Williams' legal rights and property interests and for \n     the purpose of causing substantial harm to Sherwin-Williams.\n       59. Wherefore, Sherwin-Williams requests compensatory \n     damages in an amount exceeding $25,000, punitive damages, \n     costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n\n                                COUNT IV\n\n REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, AND \n                          PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n       60. Sherwin-Williams incorporates by reference the \n     allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 59 of the Complaint.\n       61. Pursuant to Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 65(A), \n     Sherwin-Williams requests the Court to issue a Temporary \n     Restraining Order prohibiting Motley Rice, any of its \n     attorneys, employees, or agents, and each John Doe from:\n       (a) Using or reproducing Sherwin-Williams' Documents;\n       (b) transferring, conveying, disclosing, or communicating \n     in any manner Sherwin-Williams' Documents or their contents \n     to any person;\n       (c) destroying any Sherwin-Williams' Documents or any \n     copies of any such Documents, including electronically stored \n     information;\n       (d) destroying or disposing of any Documents, including \n     electronically stored information, that constitute, show, or \n     discuss how Motley Rice obtained, received, disclosed, used, \n     or communicated Sherwin-Williams Documents.\n       In addition, Sherwin-Williams requests that a Temporary \n     Restraining Order require Motley Rice to:\n       (e) immediately file with the Clerk of Court under seal all \n     originals and copies of Sherwin-Williams' Documents in the \n     possession, custody, or control of Motley Rice or any of its \n     attorneys, employees, or agents; and (f) identify all persons \n     (i) who have possession, custody, or control of Sherwin-\n     Williams' Documents, or (ii) who provided or sent those \n     Documents directly or indirectly to Motley Rice or any of its \n     attorneys, employees, or agents.\n       62. A temporary restraining order is necessary to preserve \n     Sherwin-Williams' valuable property rights in its Documents \n     and confidential business information.\n       63. Sherwin-Williams will suffer irreparable harm if \n     Defendants are permitted to transfer, release, possess, use, \n     disclose, or communicate in any manner Sherwin-Williams' \n     Documents and confidential business information.\n       64. Sherwin-Williams further requests the Court, after \n     appropriate hearing, to enter a preliminary and permanent \n     injunction granting the same relief requested in paragraph 60 \n     (a), (b), (e) and (1) and, in addition, requiring Motley Rice \n     to immediately return all originals and copies of Sherwin-\n     Williams' Documents, all documents discussing the contents of \n     those Documents, and all documents reporting or discussing \n     confidential, proprietary or privileged communications \n     between Sherwin-Williams' attorneys and its directors, \n     officers or employees, in the possession, custody, or control \n     of Motley Rice or any of its attorneys, employees, or agents.\n       65. Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Sec. 2737.03, Sherwin-\n     Williams requests this Court to issue an order requiring \n     Motley Rice to return all of Sherwin-Williams' Documents, all \n     documents discussing the contents of those Documents, and all \n     documents reporting or discussing confidential, proprietary \n     or privileged communications between Sherwin-Williams' \n     attorneys and its directors, officers or employees, in the \n     possession, custody, or control of Motley Rice or any of its \n     attorneys, employees, or agents.\n\n     Dated: April 3, 2009\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n     James R.

Motley Rice, which filed lawsuits against Sherwin-\n     Williams and other paint companies over lead-based paint, \n     allegedly obtained privileged documents stolen by the company \n     from a former employee.\n       According to a Jan. 31 order, Sherwin-Williams is filing a \n     supplemental brief in support of its motion to compel Motley \n     Rice's answers. Some of the case, which could have an impact \n     on the pending nomination of Motley Rice attorney Jack \n     McConnell to a federal judgeship in Rhode Island, has been \n     filed under seal.\n       The Wall Street Journal mentioned the case in a recent \n     editorial. McConnell's nomination was recently approved by an \n     11-7 vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the matter \n     will now go to the full Senate.\n       ``In response to written questions from Arizona Senator Jon \n     Kyle in May 2010, Mr. McConnell told the committee he wasn't \n     very involved in the lead paint case, was not familiar with \n     the documents in question and had no reason to believe he'd \n     be one of the defendants in the Ohio lawsuit. In deposition \n     testimony in September 2010, however, his memory was suddenly \n     refreshed,'' the editorial says.\n       ``He was the first lawyer in his office to review the \n     documents, signed a brief which incorporated portions of them \n     and even helped write an article about the information.''\n       Because of his ``changing story,'' the WSJ doesn't feel he \n     is worthy of a spot on the bench.\n       McConnell and Motley Rice's Rhode Island office represented \n     several states and municipalities in the lead paint \n     litigation, which alleged paint companies had created a \n     public nuisance by manufacturing lead paint before its \n     federal ban in 1978. Public nuisance claims have no statute \n     of limitations, like product liability claims do. The suits \n     were largely unsuccessful.\n       Along the way, Sherwin-Williams claims, Motley Rice \n     obtained a PowerPoint presentation given by the company's \n     attorney's to\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n     its board of directors. The presentation outlined litigation \n     costs and possible coverage by its insurers.\n       The company said the presentation was protected by \n     attorney-client privilege, but Stephen Walker met with Motley \n     Rice at Cleveland Hopkins Airport in 2006 to hand over the \n     presentation. Walker had been laid off from his job in 2005 \n     and had formerly assisted company officers, attorneys and \n     executives with technical and design aspects of PowerPoint \n     presentations.\n       Motley Rice did not notify Walker that it could not receive \n     documents protected by privilege, the company says.\n       A trial was scheduled for last year but it was postponed. \n     No new trail date has been set.\n       Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed recommended \n     McConnell to fill a vacancy in U.S. District Court in Rhode \n     Island last year. Whitehouse is a member of the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       ``Jack McConnell is a brilliant legal mind and an \n     outstanding community leader. We believe he possesses the \n     experience, intellect, and temperament to be a judge on the \n     U.S. District Court for Rhode Island,'' a statement released \n     by the senators said.\n       Whitehouse, then the attorney general, hired McConnell and \n     his firm Motley Rice to file lawsuit against the former \n     makers of lead paint in 1999.\n       The state Supreme Court unanimously struck down a verdict \n     for the plaintiffs in 2008. Sherwin-Williams says Motley Rice \n     produced the part of the PowerPoint presentation concerning \n     litigation costs when the company argued the plaintiffs \n     should be liable for its attorney fees.\n       After Whitehouse left the Attorney General's Office, \n     McConnell and his wife pumped $12,600 into his campaign fund. \n     Whitehouse took office in 2007.\n       Since 2001, the McConnells have given Reed $13,200, \n     including $8,800 for his 2008 re-election campaign.\n       McConnell also represented some states in their lawsuits \n     against the tobacco industry. His work, and the work of other \n     private attorneys, led to the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement \n     Agreement. It has an estimated worth of $246 billion over its \n     first 25 years and allows for annual payments made to the \n     attorneys who litigated the case.\n       A post by Judicial Watch says McConnell will receive \n     between $2.5 million and $3.1 million annually until 2024 as \n     a result of the settlement.\n       Through the years, he and his wife have given more than \n     $600,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates, \n     including Obama. Obama nominated him in March 2010.\n       The Institute for Legal Reform, an affiliate of the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, is one of the groups opposing \n     McConnell's nomination. The ILR owns Legal Newsline.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I propose a unanimous consent agreement \nthat would recognize myself for 5 minutes, Senator Grassley for 5 \nminutes, Senator Leahy for 5 minutes, and then Senator Snowe and \nSenator Landrieu for 10 minutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, this is not a stealth nomination. Mr. \nMcConnell has been approved and voted by the committee three separate \ntimes. This has already lasted years. There is nothing stealthy about \nit. That is an exaggeration and completely inaccurate.\n  Let me suggest in response to all the ethical claims or allegations, \nMr. McConnell has never had an ethics complaint alleged or filed \nagainst him. All of these issues of so-called stolen documents were \nvetted and reviewed by a court in Rhode Island by Judge Silverstein. \nJudge Silverstein found no merit to their claims and, in fact, \ncommended Mr. McConnell for his involvement and the involvement of his \nopposing counsels in this case.\n  Let me also try to respond to the issue of the so-called shakedown \nsuits. One of the participants in those shakedown suits is a current \ncircuit court judge, whom my colleague voted for. He is on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania. He was a Republican Attorney \nGeneral of Pennsylvania. He worked with Mr. McConnell in a path-\nbreaking suit to bring tobacco companies to justice and to provide \nStates billions of dollars to relieve the dangers and the harm caused \nby tobacco. This judge, this Federal circuit judge, testifies to the \nintegrity and the character of Jack McConnell. I am indeed appalled \nthat his integrity would be questioned in such a way.\n  With respect to statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthey have been consistent. He has said, with respect to these \ndocuments, these allegedly stolen documents, ``I saw the documents \nprior to suit being filed in Ohio.'' Again, this second suit is really \nretaliation by the companies in order to express their great anger at \nbeing sued in Rhode Island. ``I saw the documents prior to suit being \nfiled in Ohio. I briefly saw them when they were first faxed to our law \nfirm and then again a few years later, I saw them when we submitted one \npage of the documents to the court in Rhode Island. I would not say I \nwas familiar with the documents in any fashion.'' He makes no bones \nabout the fact that he saw those documents. Then the debate seems to \nbe, the quibble seems to be not about a clear misstatement but what--\n``familiar'' means. I think he was being very careful. I think if a \nlawyer says: I was familiar with the documents, it means they have read \nthem thoroughly, they read them carefully. He couldn't say that. This \ncame over his desk, was quickly out of his hands and quickly in the \nhands of others.\n  Again, all these allegations of unscrupulous behavior, unethical \nbehavior have never been supported by any finding. There is a case in \nOhio. It is not directly against Jack McConnell. He is not a named \nparty. It is his law firm. He is one of many people in the law firm. \nThere are suits filed against organizations, I would suspect, \nfrequently. Is every member of the organization involved? I suspect \nnot.\n  Finally, let me just respond to this notion of, well, this is just an \nelaborate arrangement between attorneys general and Jack McConnell. \nAgain, the process for this suit started with a Republican attorney \ngeneral. The succeeding attorney general was, indeed, our colleague \nSheldon Whitehouse. They scrupulously had a contract that was reviewed \nby the court. In fact, the court had to approve any payments to \nMcConnell's firm. That is the judge's call, not the attorney general's \ncall.\n  Interestingly enough, in response to this whole suggestion that there \nis this cozy deal going on here--Jack McConnell is such a principled \nand active Democrat that when my colleague ran for Governor of Rhode \nIsland, Jack McConnell handled the successful campaign of his opponent, \na woman with whom he felt more aligned in terms of her philosophy, in \nterms of her commitment to issues he cared about. Senator Whitehouse \nlost that race--unfortunate for the State of Rhode Island, fortunate, I \nthink, for the U.S. Senate.\n  So this suggestion, this notion that this is all a cozy deal that has \nbeen worked out is absolutely erroneous.\n  The overwhelming consensus of lawyers, clergy, everyone in Rhode \nIsland, business leaders, is this is one of the most honest and ethical \npersons you would ever want to know. Frankly, that was the ultimate \nissue that prompted me to recommend him to the President of the United \nStates. He is a decent man of character, and I think the assault on his \ncharacter is unprecedented, as well as this assault on allowing a \ndistrict court judge to have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support for Jack McConnell's nomination to the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island, as well as editorials \non the McConnell nomination from the Providence Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, May 14, 2010]\n\n                      Editorial: Confirm McConnell\n\n       Providence lawyer John J. McConnell Jr., whom President \n     Obama has nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for \n     Rhode Island, is a very able attorney. He has also \n     demonstrated much civic commitment and leadership as a very \n     generous philanthropist and board member of various nonprofit \n     organizations in our area.\n       ``Jack'' McConnell's nationally known abilities have gotten \n     him hired to press some very big lawsuits. As with most \n     plaintiffs' lawyers who have practiced at the highly \n     competitive national level for a long time, some of these \n     have been very controversial. The most notable example is the \n     case against lead-paint makers pursued at the behest of then-\n     Rhode Island Atty. Gen. (and now U.S. Sen.) Sheldon \n     Whitehouse.\n       We remain convinced that that action, which was (happily, \n     to us) terminated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, was \n     unfortunate. But some other cases Mr. McConnell was involved \n     in, such as against tobacco companies, we agreed with. But \n     then, Mr. McConnell has been a hired hand doing as capably as \n     he could the job he has specialized in--pursuing product-\n     liability and other class-action cases. Mr. McConnell, a \n     graduate of Brown and Case Western Reserve University Law \n     School, has been retained in these high-profile lawsuits \n     because of the ability and strenuous work ethic he has shown \n     time and time again.\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\n       Jack McConnell has had very close ties with the Democratic \n     Party, to whose candidates he has given a lot of money. But \n     many federal judges have had close political links before \n     being named to the bench. The judgeship-nomination process \n     can rarely be separated from politics in varying degrees, as \n     even a cursory look at the backgrounds of state and federal \n     judges will demonstrate.\n       Many over the years had been elected officials and/or \n     highly partisan Democrats or Republicans but have displayed \n     great judicial judgment, disinterestedness and independence \n     when they achieved the protective tenure of the bench.\n       But in any case, Jack McConnell, in his legal work and \n     community leadership, has shown that he has the legal \n     intelligence, character, compassion and independence to be a \n     distinguished jurist. Indeed, given his understanding of the \n     ``little guy,'' Mr. McConnell could serve as something of a \n     healthy offset to the corporate-lawyer backgrounds and \n     attitudes that so many judges have. And his deep knowledge of \n     environmental law could be of particular importance in coming \n     years as such issues come to the fore more often. We hope \n     that the Senate confirms him.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, Nov. 23, 2010]\n\n                   Editorial: Still Confirm McConnell\n\n       As we have said (``Confirm McConnell,'' editorial, May 14) \n     Providence lawyer John (``Jack'') McConnell is highly \n     qualified to be a U.S. District judge. He's one of America's \n     most able and successful litigators, and has been a very \n     energetic and generous leader in philanthropies and other \n     parts of community life.\n       But Republicans in the U.S. Senate seem determined to \n     derail his nomination, both because they dislike Mr. \n     McConnell's frequent past support of Democratic candidates \n     and, more generally, because they want to do anything they \n     can to defeat President Obama, who nominated him.\n       To say that the current mood of Congress is partisan is an \n     understatement.\n       Yes, like many judicial nominees, Mr. McConnell has taken \n     partisan stands in the past. But his character and deep love \n     of the law suggest strongly that he will function as a \n     disinterested judge--one able to look at the facts of each \n     case in the light of a close and rigorous reading of \n     statutory and constitutional law and precedent. Indeed, his \n     legal work and community leadership suggest that he would be \n     a distinguished jurist.\n       The Senate should face down a filibuster and approve his \n     nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce]\n\n    Statement of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce on the \n        Nomination of John McConnell to the U.S. District Court\n\n       On Tuesday May 11, the United States Chamber of Commerce \n     urged the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject \n     the nomination of John J. `Jack' McConnell for a judgeship on \n     the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island.\n       The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce was not \n     consulted at any point in the process by the United States \n     Chamber of Commerce or The Institute for Legal Reform as to \n     our views relative to the nomination of Mr. McConnell.\n       The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce has never \n     endorsed nor opposed nominees vying for the federal or state \n     judiciary.

McConnell who has been nominated by the \n     President to the U.S. District Court for the District of \n     Rhode Island.\n       I met and worked with Mr. McConnell when I was the elected \n     Attorney General of Pennsylvania from 1996-2003. We worked \n     very closely together on the national tobacco litigation \n     which resulted in the $206 Billion 1998 Master Settlement \n     Agreement. I was designated by my Attorney General colleagues \n     to be part of the national negotiating team and worked \n     closely with Mr. McConnell who was part of that team along \n     with his partner from Ness Motley, Joe Rice. We spent \n     considerable time together in New York and at meetings \n     elsewhere and I had the unique opportunity to assess Mr. \n     McConnell's legal abilities and his character, which were \n     both outstanding. He was one of our key people in developing \n     strategy, drafting documents and evaluating various \n     provisions of this landmark settlement.\n       In addition to his work with the state Attorneys General in \n     that case, Mr. McConnell has been involved in major \n     litigation in the state and federal courts in Rhode Island \n     and elsewhere across the country. He has been honored for his \n     legal skill and acumen by many organizations and has made \n     major contributions to the cause of justice in his state and \n     elsewhere.\n       John J. McConnell, Jr. is an outstanding nominee to serve \n     on the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island \n     and I enthusiastically support his nomination. If I can \n     provide any additional information, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Very truly yours,\n     D.

Pine Esq.,\n\n                                      Providence, RI, May 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I have the pleasure of writing on \n     behalf of John (Jack) McConnell Jr. for a position on the \n     Federal bench. I served as Rhode Island Attorney General from \n     1993-1999, as a Republican.\n       I have known Jack for more than fifteen years, both \n     professionally and personally, and feel very qualified to \n     comment on his credentials for such a prestigious position. \n     Throughout his career, Jack has demonstrated the kind of \n     legal ability, integrity, dedication to his client, and \n     Willingness to fight hard for the cause of justice that makes \n     him a truly outstanding candidate for the Federal Judiciary.\n       During my tenure as Attorney General I worked closely with \n     Jack during the multi-state tobacco litigation initiated on a \n     bipartisan basis by more than 40 Attorneys General in the \n     mid-1990's. As Attorney General, I was directly involved in \n     the prosecution of our lawsuit and in the settlement \n     negotiations between the Attorneys General and the tobacco \n     industry. In that capacity I had the ability to work with and \n     observe Jack over an extended period of time as he \n     represented many states' interests, including Rhode Island; \n     in short, what I observed was an attorney who was smart, \n     ethical, diligent and absolutely dedicated to the cause of \n     justice on behalf of his client.\n       Since our interaction in the public sector I have remained \n     very aware of Jack's talents and abilities as an attorney. I \n     closely followed the lead paint litigation in Rhode Island, \n     where Jack led the fight on behalf of the victims of this \n     public health problem.\n       He has always fought for those less fortunate who might \n     otherwise not have had a voice in the judicial system. Jack \n     has been that effective voice for many people for many years. \n     I also believe that as an experienced litigator Jack has an \n     outstanding ability to look at legal issues from all \n     perspectives, without bias or predisposition, and I have no \n     doubt that he would be fair to all litigants who appear \n     before him. In my opinion he would bring the kind of \n     experience to the federal bench that would make him an \n     outstanding judge presiding at trials, and a fair and \n     impartial arbiter for those who come before him.\n       I also have the pleasure of knowing Jack outside of legal \n     circles, and while I consider him a friend, my comments about \n     him as a person and family man are not influenced by our \n     friendship--they are objective assessments that are very easy \n     to make.\n       Jack and his wife Sara have three children who are very \n     close in age to each of my three children. For most of the \n     past fifteen years our children have attended the same \n     schools at the same time. Jack is a devoted and dedicated \n     father who understands the importance of being there for your \n     family even if the demands of a busy career are always \n     present. All three of their children have grown up with \n     strong values, a sense of giving back to society, and the \n     same kind of commitment to others that Jack and Sara have. \n     Jack understands the balance that needs to be struck between \n     career and family, and while he has achieved great success \n     professionally, he retains the strong values of his own \n     upbringing, which he in turn imparts to his children.\n       In addition to his professional accomplishments and \n     commitment to his family, Jack has always been very active in \n     the community, involved in a number of civic activities, and \n     he has been honored for his efforts on many occasions. He \n     enjoys an outstanding reputation in both the legal community \n     and the community at large, and many organizations have \n     recognized his commitment to his public service.\n       In conclusion, there is no question in my mind that Jack \n     would be an honest, principled, ethical and fair judge. He \n     would be a credit to our state and to our judiciary. He has \n     earned this prestigious position for his many years of hard \n     work, legal experience and success as an attorney, as well as \n     his position in the community as a respected civic leader and \n     family man.\n       I enthusiastically support his candidacy for a position on \n     the federal bench.\n       If I can answer any questions or be of further assistance \n     to you, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jeffrey B. Pine.\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        Paster & Harpootian, Ltd.,\n\n\n                                           Counsellors at Law,\n\n                                        Cranston, RI, May 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for allowing me the time to \n     write to you in support of my friend and colleague, John J. \n     McConnell, Jr., for confirmation to the United States \n     District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a confirmation \n     hearing on his appointment on May 13, 2010.\n       I have known Jack McConnell for many years as a \n     professional colleague, fellow dedicated board member of \n     Trinity Repertory Company here in Rhode Island and as a very \n     friendly political rival.\n       Time and again, Jack has proven that he is a man of great \n     principle and integrity. While being a vigilant advocate for \n     his clients and the causes that he has taken up during his \n     professional career, Jack has always conducted himself in the \n     most ethical and professional manner; a trait unfortunately \n     sometimes not found among lawyers today.\n       Jack and I also know each other from being on opposites \n     sides of the aisle politically, including some elections as \n     well. As you know, elections can turn bitter and the \n     participants can sometimes allow themselves to get caught up \n     in the bitterness to the extent of it becoming personal. One \n     of the greatest characteristics that I admire about Jack so \n     much is that, despite political differences of opinion, he \n     never allowed those differences to become personal, or to \n     cloud his judgment. As a result, we have always enjoyed \n     spirited conversation regarding political issues, but have \n     remained great friends.\n       These characteristics lead me to unqualifiedly support \n     Jack's confirmation to the United States District Court for \n     Rhode Island.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you believe I have \n     information which may be helpful to you in this process.\n       Thank you very much for your kind consideration.\n           Very truly yours,\n     John M. Harpootian.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Executive Chamber,\n\n\n                                City of Warwick, Rhode Island,\n\n                                                      May 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: I am pleased to write this letter in \n     support of John J. ``Jack'' McConnell, Jr., who is seeking \n     appointment to the United States District Court for the \n     District of Rhode Island.\n       Jack had been an acquaintance of mine for many years, but \n     it was not until we began serving together for two non-profit \n     agencies--Crossroads Rhode Island's Board of Directors and \n     the Institute for the Study and Practice of Non-Violence that \n     I got to know him well. Jack is a man of integrity, a strong \n     sense of community and a very fair and forward-thinking \n     individual.\n       As the Republican Mayor of Rhode Island's second largest \n     community, I have always firmly believed that the ability to \n     reach consensus among people of differing points of view is \n     critical to the well-being of our residents and our state as \n     a whole. In the time I have come to know Jack, I have \n     realized that he shares this same philosophy.\n       The District Court appointment is a critical one to ensure \n     that our justice system continues to provide victims and \n     their accused with an opportunity to be heard fairly and \n     impartially. I believe that Jack would be a valuable asset to \n     the bench and a good representative of Rhode Island in the \n     federal court system.\n       I am proud to offer this recommendation and respectfully \n     urge you to give him your serious consideration. Thank you \n     for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Scott Avedisian,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Arlene Violet, Esq.,\n\n                                    Barrington, RI, Dec. 10, 2010.\n     In Re Jack McConnell.\n\n       Dear Senator Sessions: As a former Republican Attorney \n     General I have followed your career from the day you became \n     the Attorney General for your state. You have acquitted \n     yourself very well and have served the people of Alabama with \n     diligence and competence.\n       I am writing to you in support of the nomination of Jack \n     McConnell. As an attorney for close to 36 years I have known \n     Jack for about 20 of them. I often appeared in court and on \n     occasion he'd be ahead of me on the docket and I'd be on \n     ``standby'' for my case. I observed a carefully prepared \n     advocate who had done his homework. He is a highly respected \n     attorney here because his word was his bond. His \n     forthrightness as an attorney along with his competence and \n     honesty have convinced me that he will be a fair and balanced \n     judge on the federal bench.\n       He has also been on the Board of Trustees at Roger Williams \n     University where I am also a trustee. He has been the voice \n     of reason and analysis on the tough issues facing \n     universities today. His judgment is finely honed and I have \n     no doubt that he will apply his analytical skills in service \n     to the highest standards of jurisprudence. I respectfully ask \n     you to confirm his nomination to the bench.\n       With every best wish for you and your family, I remain,\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Arlene Violet.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Supreme Court of Rhode Island,\n\n\n                                 Frank Licht Judicial Complex,\n\n                                     Providence, RI, Feb. 9, 2009.\n     Re John J. McConnell, Jr.\n\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Cranston, RI.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I have recently learned that the subject \n     attorney has applied to your office as a candidate for \n     appointment to the United States District Court for the \n     District of Rhode Island. It may be of assistance in \n     evaluating his application if those who are familiar with his \n     professional background write concerning his outstanding \n     qualifications.\n       I have known Mr. McConnell since 1983 when he served as a \n     law clerk to Justice Donald F. Shea of the Rhode Island \n     Supreme Court. Prior to this service, he graduated from Brown \n     University and Case Western Reserve University School of Law. \n     His talent and personality were outstanding from the earliest \n     stages of his career.\n       Since he left our court, I have observed, with great \n     admiration, his meteoric rise as a trial lawyer. He has been \n     lead counsel in a number of extremely high profile cases in \n     both State and Federal Courts. His work in the negotiation of \n     the master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry on \n     behalf of forty-six states is legendary in the annals of \n     litigation. His achievements in asbestos litigation are \n     equally distinguished and involved some of the most complex \n     cases on record. He has been recognized by his peers with \n     numerous awards for service to the profession as well as \n     designation as one of the best lawyers in America. The Rhode \n     Island Bar Association has honored him for his service to the \n     poor and disadvantaged.\n       His compassion and charitable contributions have benefited \n     agencies in the field of health, education and service to the \n     poor and homeless. His service as a director of Crossroads \n     Rhode Island is only one example of his reaching out to the \n     needy and dispossessed.\n       He has been active in civic affairs in the City of \n     Providence, the State of Rhode Island as well as on the \n     national level. He is a splendid example of a model citizen \n     whose advice and counsel are sought after and freely given.\n       His great experience as a litigator has given him \n     exceptional knowledge of the intracies of the rules of \n     practice and procedure in the federal courts. He would be \n     superbly qualified to preside as a federal judge over the \n     most challenging and complex cases. He is a man of keen \n     intelligence and impeccable integrity. He would be a splendid \n     addition to the distinguished bench of the United States \n     District Court of Rhode Island.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Joseph R. Weisberger,\n                                             Chief Justice (Ret.).\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to oppose the cloture motion on \nJack McConnell, who has been nominated to be U.S. district judge for \nRhode Island.\n  In the first few months that I have been ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I have worked in good faith to move forward with \nconsensus nominees. We have taken positive action on 68 percent of the \njudicial nominees submitted in this Congress. Despite my efforts, \nfriends on the other side of the aisle and the President's top lawyer \ncontinue to claim we are not moving fast enough. There are additional \nconsensus nominees the Senate could turn to. We could confirm \nadditional district judge vacancies, as we have been doing. But rather \nthan continuing to move forward with consensus nominees, the majority \nleader chose to throw up a detour and proceed to one of the President's \nmost controversial nominees, Mr. McConnell. It seems no good deed goes \nunpunished.\n  Before turning to Mr. McConnell's record, I want to say a few words \nabout the use of extended debate in considering judicial nominations. \nMy friends on the other side have made some comments on this issue that \nare pretty difficult to understand given the record there.\n  First, with respect to district court nominees, and contrary to what \nmy colleagues have suggested, there have been in the past filibusters \nof district court nominees. Most recently, the Democrats successfully \nfilibustered a district court nominee in 1999, Mr. Brian Stewart by a \nvote of 55 to 44. Judge Stewart was ultimately confirmed.\n  But the fact of the matter is that district court nominees have been \nfilibustered, and it was Democrats who first took the step. On circuit \ncourt nominees, the record is far worse. I would note that I do not \nnecessarily like to\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\nvote against cloture on judicial nominees. I do not take these votes \nlightly. But these are the rules that the other side instituted.\n  Under the precedent and threshold that the Democrats first \nestablished, Members must decide whether they believe they should move \nforward to a vote on confirmation of this nominee. By any fair measure, \nMr. McConnell qualifies as a very extraordinary circumstances. I have \nreached this conclusion based on a number of factors. I want to discuss \na couple of these reasons now.\n  I am particularly troubled by the way Mr. McConnell handled himself \nbefore the committee. I believe Mr. McConnell at best misled the \ncommittee when he testified about his familiarity with a set of stolen \nlegal documents that his law firm obtained during the lead paint \nlitigation. When asked about these documents during his committee \nhearing, he testified that he saw the documents ``briefly'' but that he \nwas not familiar with them ``in any fashion.''\n  But several months after his hearing, Mr. McConnell was deposed under \noath about those same documents. In his sworn deposition, Mr. McConnell \ntestified that he was the first lawyer to receive the documents. He \ndrafted a newspaper editorial citing information that came directly \nfrom those documents. He testified that he reviewed and signed a legal \nbrief that incorporated the stolen documents. And even though he told \nthe committee that he was not familiar with the documents ``in any \nfashion,'' during his deposition he testified that he did not see any \nindication on the documents that they were confidential or secret.\n  How could he know the documents were not confidential or secret if, \nas he testified before the committee, he was not familiar with them \n``in any fashion?''\n  Given these facts, it is hard to square Mr. McConnell's testimony \nbefore the committee with his sworn deposition testimony a couple of \nmonths later.\n  The litigation over these documents remains ongoing. We do not know \nhow it will conclude. We do not know whether Mr. McConnell and his law \nfirm will be held liable for the theft of these documents. But what is \nthe Senate going to do if we confirm this individual but at some later \ndate he or his law firm are found liable for theft? At that point, it \nwill be too late. Members will not be able to reconsider their votes.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently opined that Mr. McConnell's \n``changing story about his lead paint advocacy is enough by itself to \ndisqualify him from the bench.'' I could not agree more.\n  There are other aspects of Mr. McConnell's record that concern me a \ngreat deal, which I will outline later. I will just conclude by saying \nthis. I have supported the overwhelming majority of President Obama's \njudicial nominees. If it were up to me, I would not have nominated many \nof those individuals. But I supported them nonetheless. Mr. McConnell \nis in an entirely different category. I believe that he misled the \ncommittee when he testified before us. For that reason alone, I do not \nthink he should be rewarded with a lifetime appointment to the Federal \nbench. But even if I did not have that concern, I could not support \nthis nominee.\n  I yield back the time that was allotted to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I hope that all Senators have had a \nchance to consider the remarks of the Senators from Rhode Island on \nthis nomination. I do not think anyone could listen to the remarks of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island yesterday and today \nand come away doing anything other than voting for cloture. Likewise, \nSenator Whitehouse, who spoke this morning and has shepherded this \nnomination through the Senate Judiciary Committee, has done an \noutstanding job in his statement not only this week but throughout the \ncourse of this nomination, which now extends into a second year. They \nhave set forth not only the merits of this nominee, but also what is at \nstake for the Senate and the country if Senate Republicans take the \nvirtually unprecedented action of filibustering a Federal district \ncourt nominee.\n  Jack McConnell has bipartisan support from those in his home State. \nLeading Republican figures in Rhode Island have endorsed his \nnomination. They include First Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Bruce \nSelya; Warwick Mayor Scott Avedisian; Rhode Island Chief Justice Joseph \nWeisberger; former Rhode Island Attorneys General Jeffrey Pine and \nArlene Violet; former Director of the Rhode Island Department of \nBusiness Barry Hittner; former Rhode Island Republican Party Vice-Chair \nJohn M. Harpootian; and Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Michael \nFisher.\n  With more than 25 years of experience as an outstanding litigator in \nprivate practice, Mr. McConnell has been endorsed by the Providence \nJournal, which wrote:\n\n       In his legal work and community leadership [he] has shown \n     that he has the legal intelligence, character, compassion, \n     and independence to be a distinguished jurist.\n\n  That is what Senator Reed talked about, the nominee's qualifications, \nexperience, temperament, integrity, and character.\n  Just a few years ago, Republican Senators argued that filibusters of \njudicial nominees were unconstitutional, and that every nominee was \nentitled to an up-or-down vote. Of course, they said that with a \nRepublican President. Now suddenly things have changed. At that time, a \nnumber of Republican Senators joined in a bipartisan memorandum of \nunderstanding to head off the ``nuclear option'' and agreed that \nnominees should only be filibustered under ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' No one could seriously argue that this Federal \ndistrict court nomination presents anything approaching ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' that might justify a filibuster to prevent a vote on \nthe nomination.\n  It would be unfortunate if Senators were to knuckle under to the \ndemand for a filibuster by special interest business lobbies. Mr. \nMcConnell should not be filibustered for being a good lawyer, yet that \nis at the root of any opposition. The corporate lobby opposes him \nbecause he successfully represented plaintiffs, including the State of \nRhode Island itself, in lawsuits against lead paint manufacturers. Some \nhere in the Senate may support the lead paint industry. That is their \nright. I support the right of this attorney to bring legal claims based \non the poisoning of children by the lead in paint and to hold those \nresponsible accountable. You can support the lead paint manufacturers \nor you can support the children who were poisoned. I will stand with \nthe children. That is what Mr. McConnell did. That is why the business \nlobbies oppose him. No Senator should oppose Mr. McConnell for doing \nwhat lawyers do and vigorously representing his clients in lawsuits. \nThat is not a justification to filibuster this nomination. Mr. \nMcConnell has testified and demonstrated that he understands the \ndifferences between the role of the judge and the role of an advocate \nfor one of the parties.\n  With judicial vacancies at crisis levels, affecting the ability of \ncourts to provide justice to Americans around the country, we should be \ndebating and voting on each of the 13 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. No one should be playing partisan games and \nobstructing while vacancies remain above 90 in the Federal courts \naround the country. With one out of every nine Federal judgeships still \nvacant, and judicial vacancies around the country at 93, there is \nserious work to be done.\n  I have made it a practice as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to respect the views of home State Senators from both sides \nof the aisle. I have encouraged President Obama to work with home State \nSenators from both sides of the aisle. Republican Senators used to \ndefer to home State Senators on Federal district court nominations. \nThat was their justification for voting both for or against nominations \nduring the last several years. But if Senate Republicans abandon that \ndeference and engage in a filibuster of this Federal district court \nnominee, and ignore the strongly held views of home State Senators, \nthen they will be undercutting all those understandings and practices.\n  When home State Senators as widely respected and as serious about the \nrule of law as the Senators from Rhode Island endorse a Federal \ndistrict court\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nnominee, that nominee should not be filibustered. They never have been. \nI have been here 37 years. We used to treat each other, as well as such \nnominees willing to serve on the bench, with respect. I hope that today \nthe Senate will return to that tradition. I trust that Senate \nRepublicans will not go down the dark path on which they are headed.\n  Senator Reed spoke yesterday of the precipice on which the Senate is \npoised. Senator Whitehouse, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Schumer have \nspoken eloquently on this issue as well. I urge all Senators, Senators \non both sides of the aisle, to do the right thing to honor our \nconstitutional role and traditions, and to vote in favor of ending this \nfilibuster so that the nomination of Jack McConnell can then be \nconsidered on the merits and voted up or down.\n  I reserve the balance of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In fact, I have championed the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research Program since its inception in 1982, when \nI was serving in the House of Representatives.\n  But regrettably there has been a disturbing trend in this body over \nthe past several years of disregarding the minority rights and flat out \ndisallowing votes on our amendments.

Let's allow Senators to offer amendments and have \nvotes on them. That is the Senate that I know, and the one that has \nserved our country so well since it first convened in 1789.\n  As we all well know, the Senate has traditionally been a place where \nthe rights of the minority were protected, and where constructive \ndebate is the rule, not the exception. It is supposed to be the \ninstitutional check that ensures all voices are heard and considered. \nBecause while our constitutional democracy is premised on majority \nrole, it is also grounded in a commitment to minority rights.\n  The fact of the matter is, we have been considering the small \nbusiness innovation research legislation since March 14, a month and a \nhalf ago. Over the course of that time, when excluding weekends and \nrecesses, the Senate was in session 15 days. And in those 15 days, we \nhad merely 3 days in which the Senate has held votes related to this \nlegislation--3 days.\n  Furthermore, we have voted on 11 amendments out of 137 amendments \nfiled prior to the Easter recess, which hardly represents an open \namendment process. So we have 137 amendments filed. What do we do? We \ndo not hold votes or debate these issues, allowing those amendments to \nbe offered, we go on a 2-week recess, a fact that was not lost on the \nAmerican people. What they saw was business as usual in Washington, \nacting as if there is nothing wrong in America today.\n  So it is disappointing to hear the statements that the Republicans \nare not allowing this bill to move forward. We are more than ready to \nmove forward with votes on amendments, then onward to final passage. \nThat is how the process works in the Senate.\n  We could have already been at that point if we had been given the \ntime, instead of having recesses and days off and morning business. \nIndeed the majority has squandered the time of the past several months \nnot on this legislation but in quorum calls and in morning business. \nThere was nothing else commanding our attention.\n  There were several days we voted for the continuing resolution. I \nunderstand not having votes on those days. But just 3 days for votes \nout of 15 is unfortunate, not to mention underachieving. We could have \nheld votes on any other day.\n  Indeed, on April 19, USA Today ran an article titled, ``Two chambers \nwork at different paces.'' It noted that the House of Representatives \nhas held 277 roll call votes as of April 18, the most in that period of \ntime since 1995 following the Republican Revolution. The article then \nshifted its focus to the Senate, where it noted that our body has held \na mere 68 record votes ``the fewest roll-call votes since 1997''! One \nof our colleagues in the House joked last month that the Senate has two \npaces--``slow and glacial.'' It would be humorous if it didn't mean \nthat the American people are getting short-changed by their elected \nrepresentatives, who were sent here to vote on the critical issues \nfacing our country.\n  Voting is our primary responsibility, as are amendments to flesh out \nthe legislative process. We should have had a vote on the legislation I \nwas offering as an amendment, in conjunction with Senator Coburn and \nsix other cosponsors on regulatory reform, to reduce the burden on our \nNation's small businesses.\n  This would have had a direct impact, here and now, on the ability of \nsmall businesses to create jobs. I am mystified as to why I cannot have \na vote on this regulatory reform amendment as the ranking member of the \nSmall Business Committee.\n  In November, the Senate Small Business Committee held a hearing on \nregulatory reform. It was noted in that hearing that a 30-percent \nreduction in regulatory costs in an average 10-person firm would save \nnearly $32,000, enough to hire one additional individual. After \nenduring 26 straight months with unemployment at or above 8 percent, it \nis more imperative than ever that we finally liberate American small \nbusinesses from the regulatory burden that diminishes our ability to \ncompete globally and create jobs at home.\n  The regulatory reform amendment I am proposing with Senator Coburn is \nstrongly supported by a variety of small business community \norganizations: the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, and 28 other groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Coburn: As representatives of small \n     businesses, we are pleased to support Senate Amendment 299, \n     the Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act of 2011. This \n     amendment to S. 493, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act, puts \n     into place strong protections for small business to help \n     ensure that the federal government fully considers the impact \n     of proposed regulation on small businesses.\n       In an economy with high unemployment, and where almost 2/3 \n     of all net new jobs come from the small business sector, we \n     appreciate that your legislation would require regulators to \n     further analyze the impact of certain proposals on job \n     creation. The annual cost of federal regulation per employee \n     is significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms. \n     Federal regulations--not to mention state and local \n     regulations--add up and increase the cost of labor. If the \n     cost of labor continues to increase, then job creation will \n     be stifled because small businesses will not be able to \n     afford to hire new employees.\n       The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act expands the scope \n     of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) by forcing government \n     regulators to include the indirect impact of their \n     regulations in their assessments of a regulation's impact on \n     small businesses. The bill also provides small business with \n     expanded judicial review protections, which would help to \n     ensure that small businesses have their views heard during \n     the proposed rule stage of federal rulemaking.\n       The legislation strengthens several other aspects of the \n     RFA--such as clarifying the standard for periodic review of \n     rules by federal agencies; requiring federal agencies to \n     conduct small business economic analyses before publishing \n     informal guidance documents; and requiring federal agencies \n     to review existing penalty structures for their impact on \n     small businesses within a set timeframe after enactment of \n     new legislation. These important protections are needed to \n     prevent duplicative and outdated regulatory burdens as well \n     as to address penalty structures that may be too high for the \n     small business sector.\n       The legislation also expands over time the small business \n     advocacy review panel process. Currently, the panels only \n     apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These panels have \n     proven to be an extremely effective mechanism in helping\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n     agencies to understand how their rules will affect small \n     businesses, and help agencies identify less costly \n     alternatives to regulations before proposing new rules.\n       We applaud your efforts to ensure the federal government \n     recognizes the important contributions of job creation by \n     small business, and look forward to working with you on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American Bakers \n     Association, American Chemistry Council, American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, Associated Builders and Contractors, Food \n     Marketing Institute, Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association, \n     Hispanic Leadership Fund, Independent Electrical Contractors, \n     Institute for Liberty, International Franchise Association, \n     National Association for the Self-Employed, National \n     Association of Home Builders, National Association of \n     REALTORS, National Association of the Remodeling Industry \n     (NARI).\n       National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), National \n     Black Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent \n     Business, National Funeral Directors Association, National \n     Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association, National \n     Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation, National \n     Roofing Contractors Association, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling \n     Contractors--National Association, Printing Industries of \n     America, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, Snack \n     Food Association, Society of American Florists, U.S. Chamber \n     of Commerce, Window and Door Manufacturers Association.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. We have taken great strides to address the concerns of \nthose from across the aisle. But they keep moving the goalposts. For \ninstance, some did not like our definition of indirect effect and costs \nwith respect to evaluating the impact of regulations on small \nbusinesses. So we agreed to take the language that was initially \nproposed by Dr. Sargeant with the Office of Advocacy at the Small \nBusiness Administration. He is the President's top small business \nregulatory appointee.\n  It was expressed that the Office of Advocacy would require more \nfunding to carry out these additional responsibilities. I agreed. We \nproposed increased authorization for the funding for this office. \nMoreover, we offset that spending with cuts in the SBA, already \nproposed in the President's 2012 budget.\n  There were concerns with language that would require that rules \nsunset if agencies failed to review them as required by law, by the \nway. So we developed a compromise. Instead there would be a ``stick'' \nof reducing an agency's budget for salaries by 1 percent if it failed \nto comply with its review requirements under law. Moreover, it includes \nseveral safeguards to allow the agency to have multiple bites out of \nthe apple to satisfy their legal requirements. We heard that some \nDemocrats might oppose adding regulatory review panels at every agency, \nimmediately, saying that doing so would be too much, too soon and that \na phase-in would be more responsible so we proposed a modest phase-in \napproach of three additional agencies per year over 3 years. After all, \nwhat is wrong with having small business review panels established at \nagencies, when they are proposing rules? Let's determine whether those \nrules are going to affect small businesses before they are implemented \nin the rulemaking process, not after.\n  You know, I hear in the Senate, well, we will see. We will let the \nrules take effect, and then see what happens to small businesses \nafterwards. Does anybody understand what that means for a small \nbusiness on Main Street in America to have to implement a regulation \nthat is handed down from the Federal Government--the cost of \ncompliance, the added number of employees it requires just to deal with \nthe regulatory burden? They can't afford it. After all, we are in an \nage of high unemployment. It is persistent.\n\n  So we could deal with this issue here and now. We have had a number \nof hearings over time on regulatory reform. The Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee has had hearings on regulatory reform. The \ntime is now to address it.\n  Furthermore, what is the problem with allowing a vote on this \namendment? That is what I don't understand. Why can't we have a vote on \nthe amendment on regulatory reform? If those on the other side do not \nwant to support it, they can vote against it. But let's have a vote. \nLet's have a debate. What else are we doing?\n  We just came off of a 2-week recess. I cannot imagine anybody that \nwent home and talked to small businesses on Main Street or to the \naverage person who is desperately searching for a job not understanding \nthat we need to do something about these key issues.\n  We should focus more on issues like this and less on concerns about \nlunches, or recess. It is about doing our work in the Senate however \nlong and however hard it is, but to do it. That is what this issue is \nall about. It is about doing things that are going to matter on Main \nStreet, and regulatory reform matters on Main Street. We can talk about \nit endlessly. The time is now to act. That is what this is all about. \nLet the Senate work in the traditions of the Senate: an open, \ndeliberative process.\n  When we had the continuing resolution, we had 700 amendments in the \nHouse of Representatives. What amendments did we have? The same is true \nnow. They are shutting down the process. I am told that we had 137 \namendments, and what did the Senate do? Go on recess for 2 weeks.\n  The point is, we have a serious problem in America. It is \npersistently high unemployment. It is subpar growth. The economic \nconditions are deeply troubling. We have to get the show on the road, \nand that means regulatory reform.\n  It is one of the chief, foremost concerns among small businesses. \nAmong the plethora of concerns they have about what we are doing or not \ndoing, one of the foremost issues is regulatory reform, and we are \ndithering. I can't even get a vote on the amendment. Vote yes or vote \nno. Let's debate it.\n  Is there anything else we are doing in the Senate? Can somebody tell \nme? We just came off of a 2-week recess, and I am mystified why we are \njust driving this to a cloture vote and I am denied a vote on an \namendment that is so relevant to the well-being, to the survival of \nsmall businesses--regulations.\n  There was a $26 billion increase in regulation costs last year. That \nis on new regulations. The total cost is $1.7 trillion overall. Some \nhave debated that cost saying that is not a true cost. They say: No, it \nis this cost. It is a lesser cost. Some say: Well, it is less than $1 \ntrillion. Why? Because they do not count the IRS. Well, ask the small \nbusinesses if IRS regulations are hampering their well-being and \nsuffocating the entrepreneurial spirit in America, or the FCC or all \nthe myriad of other independent agencies that are not included. I \nsuggest everybody take Main Street tours and see what is happening.\n  If we are wondering why we can't create the jobs that are necessary \nfor America, then just look right here. We are shutting down the \nprocess with cloture votes. For what? Because we can't have a debate. \nWe can't have votes. We are doing nothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture \non this important bill. It is the Federal Government's largest research \nprogram for new technologies and innovation. It is a job creator. It is \nwidely supported by many business organizations in this country. It is \na bill that should have passed 6 years ago. It is a bill, a statute, \nthat will expire in less than 30 days from now. If we don't vote \nfavorably on this bill today, there will be virtually no chance of this \nprogram being extended under law, and we will either have to eliminate \nthe program entirely or we will revert back to no way to do business, \nwhich is a 3-month or 6-month rolling extension.\n  I wish to answer a few of the charges made by my colleague. First of \nall, I have the greatest respect for my ranking member, and I can \nunderstand her frustration as being the ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee and not getting her amendment on the Senate floor. I \nwould respectfully remind her that we could have had a vote on her \namendment in committee except that her side demanded--and I wish to \nsubmit a letter to the effect--that the bill come out of our committee \nclean; that the SBIR bill not be attached to anything else so we could \nhave an open debate on it because it has been going on for 6 years.\n  No. 2, an open amendment process, which the majority leader has been \nmore than gracious with, considering\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\nthe fact that 150 amendments have been filed on a bill that is only 116 \npages long, and 95 percent of these amendments have nothing to do with \nthis bill--the majority leader has been more than patient. But an open \ndebate does not--on the Senate floor, an open and free debate does not \nmean eliminating the committee process in the Senate that has existed, \nto my knowledge, as long as this body has existed, and it never will.\n  We cannot trample on the rights of our committees, whether it be \nHomeland Security, which has primary jurisdiction over this issue, or \nthe Small Business Committee, which has some jurisdiction over this \nissue. But because this regulatory reform bill is so far reaching and a \nnecessary debate to have--not here, not now, not on this Senate floor \nbut in the relevant committees. In fact, there are four other bills \nbesides that of my ranking member. Senator Vitter has one bill, and I \nwill submit for the Record other bills that have been filed, in fact, \non this exact subject.\n  The chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who sits right here \nat this desk, has already agreed to have a hearing on all of these \nbills because Senator Snowe, with all due respect, is not the only \nMember who has an interest in regulatory reform. My committee, which I \nchair, does not have complete jurisdiction over this issue. Commerce is \ninterested in it. Homeland Security is interested in it.\n  I can't pull a bill--I don't believe it is right to pull a bill from \nthe floor to have a vote that has not had a hearing in any committee of \nthe Senate. That is not an open process. That is an ask that is \nimpossible to agree to.\n  No. 3 in my argument: If we vote no on cloture, I wish to remind \nSenators the amendments of Senator Carper and Senator Vitter will see \nno light of day. They have good amendments they have been working on \nfor 3 years that have had committee review to help expedite the sale of \nFederal buildings that could save taxpayers millions of dollars. That \namendment will go down.\n  The Cornyn amendment, which establishes a commission to cut spending \nwhich will also save taxpayer money and reduce the burden on taxpayers, \nthat amendment will go down.\n  Senator Paul's amendment to reduce spending by $200 billion, he will \nnot get the majority of our votes, but there will be an interesting \ndebate on whether we can cut $200 billion out of the Federal \nGovernment. We lose that amendment.\n  Senator Hutchison has an amendment for us to debate all of the \nregulations in the entire universe on health care. People are \ncomplaining about regulations for health care. We are giving a vote on \nthat. That amendment will not be voted on.\n  Senator Cardin has an amendment to fix surety bonds. We are going to \nlose that.\n  Senator Snowe, herself, has an amendment to prevent fraud in \ncontracting. We are going to lose that.\n  So, evidently, 95 percent of the loaf is not enough. So we either get \n60 votes on this bill or we don't.\n  Mr. President, I wish to give my last minute to Senator Shaheen, and \nI wish to ask her a question. What actually did the Senator hear in the \nArmed Services Committee that is relevant to this bill? If I have 2 \nseconds, go ahead and tell me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I took the opportunity yesterday in an Armed Services \nCommittee subcommittee to ask Department of Defense officials who have \nbeen responsible for maintaining our military technological edge what \nthe impact would be on DOD's research if Congress does not reauthorize \nthe SBIR Program. Assistant Secretary Zachary Lemnios said the SBIR is \n``something we absolutely need.'' He spoke of what it is like talking \nto small innovative companies he works with through SBIR, and he told \nme:\n\n       There are small companies willing to take some risk in \n     areas where larger companies just, for whatever reason, just \n     don't. You spend a day with a small business like that, and \n     your mind explodes with new ideas.\n\n  That is the kind of innovative spirit we need to stay competitive. We \nneed this for America's national security, and as the Senator from \nLouisiana points out, this is a program that creates jobs.\n  We need to get this reauthorization done. We need to talk about \nregulatory reform, but we need to do this first.\n  In a few minutes we will be voting on whether to move forward with a \nbill reauthorizing a program that is critically important to my home \nState of New Hampshire and the entire country--the Small Business \nInnovation Research program, or SBIR.\n  As Chair Landrieu has pointed out, the Senate has been debating this \nbill for 5 weeks now. My colleagues and I from the Small Business \nCommittee have come to the floor several times to talk about the \nimportance of this program for the future of our economy. The bottom \nline is that SBIR promotes innovation among the entrepreneurs that will \nkeep the American economy competitive in the 21st century.\n  But as we decide whether to move forward with this bill--which has \nbroad bipartisan support--I wanted to talk about the importance of \nSBIR--not just for our small businesses, but also for our national \ndefense.\n  Many agencies have come to rely on small, innovative companies to \nhelp them think outside the box and solve important problems. This is \nespecially true for agencies that are charged with protecting our \nnational security. Agencies like the Department of Defense rely on \nsmall companies to perform R that often leads to technologies that \nhelp our troops in the battlefield and help secure our country.\n  I took the opportunity yesterday at an Armed Services Committee \nhearing to ask the Department of Defense officials responsible for \nmaintaining our military's technological edge what the impact would be \non DOD's research if Congress did not reauthorize SBIR. Assistant \nSecretary Zachary Lemnios said the SBIR is ``something we absolutely \nneed.'' He discussed what it is like talking to the small, innovative \nentrepreneurs that he works with through the SBIR program. He told me, \n``there are small companies willing to take some risk in areas where \nlarger companies just, for whatever reason, just don't. You spend a day \nwith a small business like that, and your mind explodes with new \nideas.''\n  That is the kind of innovative spirit that we need to stay \ncompetitive. And it is the same spirit that agencies like the \nDepartment of Defense need to keep America secure. In 2010, the \nDepartment of Defense issued nearly 3,000 awards through the SBIR \nprogram.\n  Let me give just one example of a company in my State that has \nbenefitted from the SBIR program and has helped the Department of \nDefense develop a product that is currently helping our troops carry \nout their missions.\n  Earlier this year, I visited a firm called Active Shock in \nManchester, NH. Active Shock showed me the suspension technologies that \nit developed with funding from a competitive SBIR award. These \ntechnologies are now used by the Department of Defense to help our \ntroops in the field. They help stabilize our war vehicles in rough \nterrain.\n  This is exactly the kind of high-tech product that is developed as a \nresult of SBIR. And SBIR awards are absolutely critical for these small \ncompanies. Bill Larkins, the CEO of Active Shock, told me that Active \nShock would simply not be here today were it not for the SBIR program. \nThe products that Active Shock developed also have commercial \napplications, so the SBIR awards have helped them grow and create jobs. \nActive Shock started with only a few employees; now, it has grown to \nover 30 employees.\n  Active Shock is just one of many small firms in New Hampshire that \nhave successfully competed for funding through SBIR in the 28 years it \nhas been in existence. All across New Hampshire, small businesses that \notherwise would not be able to compete for federal R funding have won \ncompetitive SBIR grants that advance technology and science and create \ngood jobs. In just the last 2 years, New Hampshire firms have won 80 \nSBIR awards.\n  And many of these companies are helping the Department of Defense \nmeet its R needs--in fact, despite its small size, New Hampshire is \nranked 22nd in the Nation for total grants awarded from the Department \nof Defense since SBIR began.\n  We need to focus on smart ways to create jobs and stay competitive. \nThis\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nprogram is critical for meeting that goal. But we also need to remember \nthat SBIR also enhances our national security.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nprogram.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for answering my \nquestion.\n  I would like to submit many more things for the Record. But, again, I \nwish to close, because we are 10 minutes extended from the vote, by \nasking the Senate to please consider voting for the SBIR Program. If we \ndon't it will expire on May 31 this year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2660-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2660-S2661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly vote on the \ncloture motion on the Jack McConnell nomination. We have been working \nin good faith with our Democratic colleagues to confirm consensus \njudicial nominees in general and to fill judicial emergencies in \nparticular. So it is disappointing that our Democratic friends have \nchosen to depart from this bipartisan practice and to press the \nMcConnell nomination which would not fill a judicial emergency and is \nabout as far from a consensus nomination as one could imagine.\n  Mr. McConnell has described his judicial philosophy in this way:\n\n       There are wrongs that need to be righted, and that's how I \n     see the law.\n\n  In Mr. McConnell's eyes, the wrongdoers in America are invariably its \njob creators.\n  His legal career has been marked by a pervasive and persistent \nhostility to American job creators. This bias against one part of \nAmerican society is fundamentally antithetical to the rule of law, and \nit has led him to take a series of troubling actions that show his \nunfitness for a lifetime position as a fair and impartial judicial \nofficer.\n  For example, he has filed what his hometown newspaper described as a \n``ludicrous'' lawsuit against businesses. This case ended up costing \nnot just the companies but Rhode Island taxpayers as well. After the \nState's supreme court unanimously rejected his frivolous legal theory, \nhis clients--the taxpayers--had to pay a quarter of a million dollars \nin lawyers' fees.\n  Rather than be contrite about the damage he had done, he lashed out \nat his State's supreme court, saying it let ``wrongdoers off the \nhook.'' He has made other intemperate statements as well that \nunderscore his bias, such as when he insisted that one American \nindustry only does ``the right thing'' when it is ``sued and forced to \nby a jury.''\n  After such a long record of hostility toward one segment of American \nsociety, it is difficult to believe Mr. McConnell can now turn on a \ndime and ``administer justice without respect to persons,'' as the \njudicial oath requires. The business community does not think so, and \nit is easy to see why.\n  In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has never before opposed a \ndistrict court nominee in its 100-year history--not once. Yet it is so \ntroubled by Mr. McConnell's clear disdain for the business community \nthat it has taken the extraordinary step of opposing this nomination.\n  Senator Cornyn pointed out yesterday that there are also serious \nethical issues with Mr. McConnell's nomination. He pioneered the \npractice of ``pay to play'' lawsuits, where he solicited lucrative no-\nbid, contingency fee contracts from public officials.\n  He has given statements to the Judiciary Committee that are \nmisleading at best and untrue at worst about his familiarity with a \ncase involving stolen litigation documents. There is the outstanding \nmatter of the stolen litigation documents themselves, over which his \nlaw firm and several unnamed ``John Doe'' defendants are being sued.\n  In light of all the problems with the McConnell nomination, I have \nlistened with interest to the admonishments by the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and other Democratic colleagues against opposing \ncloture on his nomination. I know my record of supporting up-and-down \nvotes for controversial judicial nominees during the administration of \nPresident Clinton, and I am equally aware of the determined efforts by \nmy Democratic colleagues ``to change the ground rules'' in the Senate \nconfirmation process once there was a Republican President.\n  My Democratic colleagues ultimately succeeded in their efforts by \nrepeatedly filibustering President Bush's judicial nominees. I wish our \nfriends had not succeeded and not set up that precedent. But they did. \nAnd the precedent is the precedent, and their buyer's remorse now that \nthere is again a Democrat in the Oval Office will not change it.\n  Over the years, there have been bipartisan concerns with judicial \nnominees, and cloture has been needed to end debate. Abe Fortas is a \nfamous case. He was opposed by Senators from both sides of the aisle \nbecause of ethical issues, and his nomination did not even have \nmajority support, let alone the votes needed to invoke cloture.\n  But the partisan filibuster is a more recent development, and our \nDemocratic colleagues have been the proud pioneers in this area. In \n1986, they mounted the first partisan filibuster against a judicial \nnominee. That nominee, by the way, was a district court nominee, Sidney \nFitzwater.\n  Also in 1986, they mounted the first partisan filibuster against a \nnominee to be Chief Justice. That was Chief Justice Rehnquist's \nnomination.\n  In 1999, they mounted the first successful partisan filibuster of a \njudicial nominee. That too involved a district court nominee, Brian \nStewart. Both the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island voted to filibuster Mr. Stewart. I, and all \nRepublicans, voted actually against filibustering him.\n  Our friends' successful filibuster of this nominee is now \ninconvenient to their narrative about filibuster norms and propriety. \nThey claim that filibuster does not count. I guess they are saying they \nonly filibustered him to leverage floor votes on other judicial \nnominees, and once they got what they wanted, he was confirmed. I \ngather this is the ``coercion exception'' to the body of filibuster \nprecedent they have created.\n  In 2003, our friends mounted the first successful filibuster of a \ncircuit court nomination. That would be Miguel Estrada's nomination. He \nwas filibustered seven times, in fact. Our Democratic colleagues added \nto this record by filibustering nine other circuit court nominees, a \ntotal of 21 times. That is a record, too. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the senior Senator from Rhode Island participated in all \nof those filibusters as well.\n  In 2006, led by President Obama himself, our Democratic colleagues \nmounted the first partisan filibuster of a nominee to be an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. That would be the Justice Alito \nnomination. Our Democratic friends from Vermont and Rhode Island joined \nin that filibuster, too.\n  I agree that filibusters of judicial nominees should be used \nsparingly. Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave filibustered judicial nominees whenever it suited their purposes \nto do so, whether it was to defeat nominees such as Miguel Estrada or \nto leverage other nominees as with the Stewart nomination. Given their \npersistent enthusiasm for the judicial filibuster, I do not view our \nDemocratic friends as the arbiters of filibuster propriety.\n  In this case, I believe the McConnell nomination is an extraordinary \none. He should not be confirmed to a lifetime position on the bench. I \nwill oppose cloture, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during my 24 years in the U.S. Senate I \nhave not once voted against cloture for a nominee to the district \ncourt, and I will not do so today. As a member of the ``Gang of 14'' in \n2005, I agreed that ``Nominees should be filibustered only under \nextraordinary circumstances.'' The nomination of Mr. McConnell does not \nrise to a level of ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  However, I am deeply troubled by Mr. McConnell's less than candid \nresponses\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nto the Senate Judiciary Committee, his liberal judicial philosophy, \nincluding his public antipathy toward private enterprise, and his \nstrong political activism. For these reasons, I will not support his \nnomination.\n  Shaping the judiciary through the appointment power is one of the \nmost important and solemn responsibilities a President has and \ncertainly one that has a profound and lasting impact. The President is \nentitled to nominate those whom he sees fit to serve on the Federal \nbench, and unless the nominee rises to ``extraordinary circumstances,'' \nI have provided my constitutional duty of ``consent'' for most \nnominees.\n  While I would not have chosen Mr. McConnell as a nominee to the \nFederal bench if I were in a position to nominate, I respect the \nPresident's ability to do so and therefore will vote for the cloture \nmotion on Mr. McConnell's nomination, but will strongly oppose his \nnomination to the Federal bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2661-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2011\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McCONNELL, JR., TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                        DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle for allowing cloture to be \ninvoked on this nomination. It is so important that we not get into a \nposition where we have to file cloture on all these district court \njudges. If there are real problems, there is the hearing process. That \nis where, when problems arise, it comes out in the committee, and there \nis ample time to make a case if you don't like them personally for \nwhatever reason. But this is a good man. The biggest problem he had is \nhe is a trial lawyer--a very fine trial lawyer.\n  But I express my appreciation to those on the other side of the aisle \nwho\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\ndid the right thing. This is going to make the atmosphere around here \nso much more pleasant. I am disappointed we weren't able to get cloture \non the small business jobs bill. That was an important piece of \nlegislation. I thought we had been so very fair on this legislation in \nallowing amendments, and we are going to continue allowing amendments. \nThere will be rare occasions, as Senator McConnell said when we started \nthis new Congress, when he will not, without a cloture vote, allow us \nto proceed to a bill. But generally speaking, we have been able to move \nlegislation, and that is important. I have said the same thing about \nfilling the tree. I will still fill the tree, but it will be a rare \noccasion that we will do that. I think that is going to make things \naround here a lot better.\n  Again, I say thank you very much for allowing this to go forward. \nThis is very important that we are able to move on and have the \nnomination process, as relates to judges, move forward expeditiously. \nThere is a lot of blame to go around as to what has transpired in years \npast. We are past that. Let us move on. There are things that probably \nwe as Democrats could have done a little differently, and there are \nthings the Republicans could have done differently as it relates to \njudges. But let us start now, as we have been today, with a new day.\n  Again, I say for the fourth time, this is a good day for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to thank all my colleagues, \nparticularly those who supported this motion to invoke cloture. \nEveryone brought to this floor very vigorous arguments and very clear \npositions.\n  I think what has been confirmed today is not just moving forward on \nthe confirmation of one judge but reaffirming a practice in the Senate \nthat if the home State Senators submit a District Court nominee who is \nthen put forth by the President, and if that person--that man or \nwoman--receives the appropriate evaluation by the bar association, the \nappropriate vetting by the FBI, the appropriate scrutiny of the \ncommittee, and then the vote of the committee is to bring that District \nCourt nominee to the floor, that we will move to an up-or-down vote on \nthe merits of the individual District Court nominee.\n  There were extraordinary individuals engaged in this discussion, and \nthey may view--in fact, I think they do view--the merits quite \ndifferently than I. But what they had firmly in mind was not just this \nmoment but the Senate as an institution going forward. I particularly \nwish to commend Senator Alexander, Senator Graham, Senator Collins, \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, Senator Murkowski, Senator McCain, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Thune, Senator Saxby Chambliss, Senator Johnny \nIsakson, and Senator Kirk, as well as all my other colleagues who \njoined.\n  This vote, I think, to many of my colleagues, was less about an \nindividual and more about whether the Senate would conduct its business \nin a time-honored tradition with respect to District Court nominees; \nwhether the viewpoints not just of individual Senators from a \nparticular State but the community of that State--the business leaders, \nthe civic leaders, the members of the bar--whether their views and \ntheir evaluation would be weighed successfully.\n  I thank everyone for the opportunity to move forward on this \nnomination. Again, I appreciate and respect the principled debate and \nthoughtful debate of those who took a different position. But I think \ntoday is not just a case of an individual nomination; I hope it sets \nthe standard going forward--again, a standard that we as Democrats must \nrespect. If a person is nominated to be a District Court judge, if that \nperson passes through the close scrutiny of the bar association, of the \nFBI, of the Judiciary Committee, and comes to the floor, that District \nCourt nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. That is something we all \nhave to expect. It cannot be a device of convenience for the moment; it \nhas to be a practice of this institution. I think today we went a long \nway to institutionalize that.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I planned to present some similar \nwords--if my senior Senator would stay just for one moment with me on \nthe floor. He spoke so eloquently that I am simply going to associate \nmyself with his remarks, but I also want to add one additional point, \nwhich is how much I appreciate his leadership and how hard he worked \nand the extent to which the credibility he has built over years with \nhis colleagues in this institution has helped to get us to this point. \nThis was not preordained.\n  There are times here when it feels as if the interest groups that \nseek our attention and our good wishes control the day around here and \nthere is not much of an institution. Today was a day in which the \ninstitution stood up for itself in all the ways Senator Reed mentioned. \nAgain, I associate myself with his remarks and add my gratitude and \nrespect for him for his leadership through this process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that my time be counted against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to add my kudos to Senator Reed \nand Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island for their persistence and \ntheir success today in getting a fine person to the bench.\n  I also thank my Republican colleagues, those who voted for cloture. \nMaybe that will help break some of the logjams here. I think it is very \nmeaningful to us on this side of the aisle for that to happen. It \nshould happen, of course, but the fact that it did happen maybe says \nsomething--that this is a day, after what happened over in Pakistan, \nthat we can come together. It is meaningful.\n  I thank Senator McConnell as well. He had his strong views, but \nobviously we know the respect his colleagues have for him and thank him \nas well for understanding that there will be differing views within \nboth sides of the aisle as well as on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                        Death of Osama Bin Laden\n\n  I rise to speak on a different subject today, and that is about what \nhappened in Pakistan and the aftermath.\n  First, of course, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the evil mastermind \nof the world's bloodiest terrorist organization, was a thunderous \nstrike for justice for the thousands of my fellow New Yorkers and \ncitizens from all over the world who were murdered on 9/11. It took \nalmost a decade, but the world's most-wanted terrorist finally met his \nfate 4 days ago. New York's heart is still broken from the tragedy of \n9/11, but at least this brings some measure of closure and consolation \nto the families and victims.\n  When I spoke to the families, one of the things that they said galled \nthem almost every day when they woke up was that their father or \nmother, brother or sister, son or daughter, husband or wife was gone \nand bin Laden still lived. That kind of galling knowledge is no longer \nin their hearts and minds because bin Laden, at least, has met his \ndeserved fate.\n  We owe a massive debt of gratitude to our military. They have done an \namazing job. I sat in on the briefings. Your jaw drops at their \nprofessionalism, their excellence, their sacrifice, their courage, \ntheir dedication--unbelievable.\n  That is also true of our civilian intelligence. The CIA, led by Leon \nPanetta, should be incredibly proud. We know they are. It is an agency \nthat gets too little of the acclaim their accomplishments deserve.\n  Finally, the job President Obama did should not be forgotten. His \nsteely courage, his quiet courage was incredible. All one had to do was \nlook at some of the films from the Situation Room and learn a little \nbit of the history to know what an amazing feat this was for our \nPresident. He could have taken the easy way out, in a certain sense. He \ndidn't. The easy way out probably would have been an air bombardment, \nbut we never would have known certainly that bin Laden is gone, and \nthere might have been--probably would have been many unnecessary \ncivilian casualties. The President chose the right path.\n  I want to say something about this President. He is not a chest \nthumper.\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nHe is not somebody who involves himself in a lot of rhetorical \nflourishes. He is serious, he is focused, he is factually driven. But \nlet no one mistake the fact that he is fact-driven and often quietly \ncontemplative for a lack of steel or a lack of courage or a lack of \nstrength. This incident showed the true strength of the man. His speech \nSunday night--modest but forceful, proud but understated--was President \nObama. There has been a lot of talk of lack of determination or taking \na side or focus. I think the people who do that mistake the President's \nsteel--often low key, often fact-based, often without chest thumping or \nbig slogans--for a lack of strength. They are so wrong. The actions \nshow it. I think every American, regardless of political party, \nregardless of political attitude and conviction and ideology, should be \nproud of our military and of our country but also of our President.\n  I want to say one more thing about this. I read today's newspapers, \nand there was a great deal of talk about how some of the facts that \nwere reported in the early moments after this great victory were not \nexactly correct. There is certainly reason to correct facts, and they \ncertainly are news, but they should not displace the importance of what \nhappened. For critics to dwell on the early discrepancies and over-\nexaggerate their importance would be an injustice to the magnitude of \nwhat really happened. It is only 2 days after we learned early Monday \nmorning of what happened, and all of a sudden, it seems, oh, they \nmessed up this or they didn't do that right or this and that. There \nwere discrepancies and they should be made public, but to dwell on \nthem, to listen to the morning news shows or to look at the headlines \nblaring, may have us miss the main point, which is that a superb, \nprofessional, well-practiced, and almost flawless military mission and \ncivilian accompaniment got rid of the greatest terrorist in the world.\n  Let's keep our priorities straight. Let's acknowledge, let's find the \nfacts and watch as they come out, let's make sure some of the early \ncomments that were not right are corrected, but let's not let that in \nany way detract from the greatness and magnitude of what happened. Our \nfocus should be on the successful mission and on the message it sends \nto the world, which is, to those who would test the resolve of the \npeople of the United States of America: Do not doubt our resolve. If \nyou do us harm, we will find you, we will mete out justice, and we will \nprevail. That is where our focus should be and should stay.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nacknowledge the steady efforts of our Armed Forces and our intelligence \ncommunity to eliminate the leader of al-Qaida and to help bring some \npeace and relief to our Nation and to those who lost loved ones in the \ntragedy on\n9/11.\n  I have heard some people say justice has been done because the leader \nof this terrorist organization has finally been killed. I am not one \nwho is going to say justice has been done. I do not consider taking out \nthe leader of a terrorist organization who killed thousands of \nAmericans who just went to work one day to do their jobs, to add to \ntheir quality of life and the lives of their families, an even trade. I \ndo not consider it is enough. However, it is a first step to righting \nthe wrong that was done by not only the leader of al-Qaida but all of \nthose he trained through the years to give up their own lives in order \nto kill innocent people. He ruined the lives of so many Americans, and \nhe also ruined the lives of so many young Muslim followers who gave up \na productive life for one of terrorism and murder.\n  I thank President George W. Bush for his relentless efforts to put \nthis accomplishment in motion. He is the President who received the \nshock on 9/11, who had to deal with the immediate aftermath, and he put \nin place the organizations, the military control, and the intelligence \ngathering that have brought us to this point today.\n  I commend President Obama for carrying these principles through to \ncompletion. As things are unfolding more and more we know President \nObama made a very tough and very decisive and correct decision. I think \nboth President Bush and President Obama deserve praise today.\n  I also especially say I am proud of the Navy SEALs who knowingly went \ninto harm's way to take down Osama bin Laden. Those are the troops who \nprobably thought there was a chance they might not come back home, but \nthey are among the most highly trained forces in the world. They \noperate in sea, air, and on land. Each and every day they volunteer for \nsome of the most dangerous missions under the most difficult \ncircumstances, and without recognition. Normally, it is something we \nnever hear about that takes us one step closer to wiping out the \nterrorism we know in the world today. They are truly our Nation's \nheroes.\n  While much praise, deservedly, goes to the two dozen Navy SEALs who \nraided the terrorist stronghold using surprise and lethal speed, we \nshould not think that they went there alone because they did not. \nShortly after the world saw the brutality of Osama bin Laden's savage \nplan unfold on American soil nearly 10 years ago, President Bush took \nthe decisive steps to launch an aggressive campaign to hunt down those \nresponsible, including Osama bin Laden.\n  One such step occurred on October 26, 2001, when President Bush \nsigned into law the PATRIOT Act. It provided the law enforcement and \nthe intelligence community greater authority to track and intercept \ncommunications among suspected terrorists. This law has proven to be \nimmeasurably valuable to the intelligence community. It has enhanced \nour ability to find and capture terrorists. I hope we will be able to \nreach a bipartisan agreement to extend the provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct that are set to expire at the end of this month.\n  As we have seen from various media reports--and I look forward to \ngetting more details--the ability to monitor communications was a \ncrucial lead used by analysts to determine the eventual location of \nOsama bin Laden. As my colleagues are aware, the provisions that are \nset to expire include the authorization for the FBI to use roving \nwiretaps on surveillance targets because at the time we took up the \nPATRIOT Act, we were still having to get permission from authorities to \nwiretap a telephone number--not keeping up with the technology advances \nthat allow you to have a cell phone and never have a landline and throw \naway a cell phone every 15 minutes if you think you are in danger of \nbeing under surveillance.\n  It also has a ``lone wolf'' provision that allows for the \ninvestigation of individuals who are acting alone but who have been \nradicalized and are sympathetic to terrorist organizations and pose a \nsignificant national security threat.\n  These are just two of the provisions that have enhanced our \ncapabilities to obtain information that has been crucial in capturing \nnot only terrorists we know have already plotted against us but also to \nuncover their plots before they are able to do harm.\n  We must not allow the provisions of the PATRIOT Act to expire, \nespecially at a time when al-Qaida is reeling from the death of their \nleader and could be plotting revenge. Stepping back our intelligence \nefforts now could allow al-Qaida to regroup and launch additional \nattacks against our Nation.\n  Another very important step was taken when President George W. Bush \nsigned the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in December \n2004. This act created the National Counterterrorism Center. This \ncenter is the primary organization in the U.S. Government for \nintegrating, analyzing, and sharing all intelligence from the CIA, FBI, \nDepartment of Defense, and others which pertains to counterterrorism. \nThis is a very important tool for compiling the various information \nthat was being gathered by many of the intelligence organizations and \nputting it through one grid and analysis. It was\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nthat painstaking analysis through the last 10 years that allowed \nactionable intelligence to be the instigator of the effort to take out \nOsama bin Laden.\n  Within our military, we have a small group of Tier 1 units that are \nspecially selected and highly trained for this exact type of mission. \nThey have gained fame in the last few decades through books and movies. \nBut these heroes are real.\n  I wish to point out that the commander of these elite warriors, VADM \nWilliam McRaven, is a proud Texan from San Antonio, who is also an \nalumni of the University of Texas. Admiral McRaven is a highly \ndecorated Navy SEAL who lives by the SEAL code and ``earns his trident \nevery day.'' Vice Admiral McRaven has been nominated by the President \nto receive his fourth star and, if confirmed, will lead U.S. Special \nOperations Command. I can think of no one better qualified to lead our \nspecial operations than he is. I look forward to supporting his \nconfirmation on the Senate floor.\n  While these highly skilled commandos deserve every accolade that is \nbestowed upon them, we cannot forget those who guided them to the \ntarget: the direct and indirect support personnel, the technicians, the \nanalysts, the pilots and crews, and all those who have worked \nmeticulously and attentively for years to finally put together all the \npieces to get the SEALs to the right place at the right time.\n  We have seen many changes in the past 10 years. Departments and \nagencies have been consolidated or created, military commanders have \nretired, and administrations have changed hands. Most of the soldiers \nwho conducted that first raid in Afghanistan in October of 2001 are no \nlonger wearing uniforms, just as most of those in the military today \nwere still in school in September of 2001. Many of those signed up to \ngo into the military after 9/11 because they felt so much loyalty to \nour country.\n  I wish to acknowledge those who devoted so many years to pursuing \nOsama bin Laden. To those who have retired or moved on to other \nprofessions, I want you to know we appreciate you and your work was not \nin vain.\n  Our leaders said from the beginning, after September 11--that fateful \nday--that we would get Osama bin Laden. Through the efforts of \nthousands, we did. We have the most professional, the best trained, the \nbest equipped military and intelligence agencies in the world.\n  While there are sighs of relief now from the public, our work is \nclearly not done. Al-Qaida is still plotting against our freedom. Other \ngroups are just as zealously dedicated to the mission of destroying our \nway of life. So while taking down the head of al-Qaida was a victory, \nit is also a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant.\n  As we speak right now, our intelligence experts are employing, \nanalyzing, and disseminating the information gleaned from the bin Laden \nraid, and our special operators are preparing for their next mission, \nwhatever it may be. I believe our country is united in the commitment \nto protecting what makes America great: our freedom and our way of \nlife.\n  I look forward to a day when we will not have to walk through a body \nscan or put our shoes on an x-ray machine to get on an airplane. I look \nforward to a day when we will not have to fight against an enemy who is \nliving among us, an enemy who is plotting against us in our own \ncountry, an enemy who is willing to kill itself in order to kill \ninnocent people and destroy our way of life. I look forward to a day \nwhen we never see a casket at Dover, DE--one of our military elite \ncoming home having made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  That day will only come if we as a nation remain willing to fight to \nprotect the ideals of America--the foundation that was laid by our \nFounding Fathers and has been protected by every generation since that \ntime. Today is a day we reflect on those principles. It is a day we \nrenew our commitment to uphold them at all costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the country faces two large economic \nchallenges. The first is growing our economy, creating jobs, getting \nthe economy back on track. The second major challenge is cutting the \ndeficit. I wish to briefly talk about both of those.\n  I have four charts--one that relates to jobs and growing the economy \nand three that deal more specifically with the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, in Washington, the debate has shifted almost entirely \nto a discussion of the deficit. Too many people in Washington are \npretending our efforts to generate growth in the economy have been \naccomplished, that it is a done deal, that we have recovered from the \nrecession, and we can now focus full time on how to cut the deficit.\n  The fact is, this is simply not true. Professor Alan Blinder, an \neconomist at Princeton and former Deputy Chair of the Federal Reserve, \ntestified before the Senate Finance Committee a couple weeks ago. He \nmade the following statement:\n\n       The economic recovery is mediocre at best and unemployment \n     remains high. To me, those conditions describe a bad time to \n     put the economy on a diet of either spending cuts or tax \n     increases.\n\n  Let me point to the first chart to underscore the point professor \nBlinder made. The recession we have just gone through created a very \ndeep hole. If you look at the number of private sector jobs that were \nlost between November of 2007 and the end of March of 2010, you can \nsee--it is February of 2010--8.8 million jobs were lost as a result of \nthe recession. While things are getting better, it is clear they have \nnot gotten better enough. We have now created 1.8 million new jobs \nsince we began adding private sector jobs. So we still have a shortfall \nof about 7 million jobs that need to be created in order to get back to \nwhere we were in November of 2007. Of course, there have been a lot of \nnew people who came into the job market since then, so we need to \ncreate more jobs than that.\n  We are encountering some strong headwinds in our effort to dig out of \nthe recession. The strongest headwind is the high price of oil and gas, \nwhich is a tax on consumers, a tax on our businesses, and it comes at a \nvery bad time. We are all looking for ways to try to deal with that. \nFrankly, it is difficult to legislate a solution.\n  Another headwind is one of our own creation; that is, the constant \ndrumbeat we hear to cut spending at all levels of government--cut it in \nWashington, cut it at the State level, cut it at the local level. My \nown strong view is we should heed Professor Blinder's advice. We need \nto continue to work to keep investing in those things that will help us \ncreate good-paying jobs. Timing is important. We clearly need to reduce \nthe deficit, but we should adopt policies this year that will put us on \na long-term path to reduce the deficit. I hope these policies will \ndelay major cuts in spending and major increases in taxes, until we can \ncome out of this recession some additional distance.\n  Let me talk about the deficits, the second challenge I talked about \nbefore. We have a chart called ``Federal Revenues and Outlays as a \nPercentage of Gross Domestic Product.'' This is for a 40-year period, \nfrom 1970 to 2010. It is a chart the Congressional Budget Office \nprepared and presented to us.\n  Clearly, there are some important points you can take away from this \nchart. No. 1, on average, over the last 40 years, the Federal \nGovernment has accounted for 20.7 percent of gross domestic product--\nspending by the Federal Government--on average. Over that same period, \non average, we have raised 18.1 percent of GDP in the form of revenues. \nSo, on average, we have been running a deficit of about 3 percent of \nGDP each year during this 40-year period. Today, that 3 percent of GDP \nis about $450 billion.\n  The one time during this 40 years when we achieved a balanced \nbudget--and even ran a surplus for a 4-year period--was at the end of \nthe 1990s and in the year 2000. How did we manage to do that? Well, \nbeginning in 1990, the Congress passed, and President George H.W. Bush \nsigned, a bill that both restrained spending and raised taxes. Again, \nin 1993 and again in 1997, Congress passed and, in that case, President \nClinton signed, budget plans that\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\ndid even more to do what had been done in 1990; that is, both of those \nplans restrained spending and raised revenues.\n  We enjoyed a strong economy during those years in question and that, \nof course, helped to bring more revenue into the government and get us \nto a balanced budget and a surplus.\n  What went wrong that caused us to, once again, fall into deficit? I \nwill cite three factors:\n  First, the tax cuts Congress enacted in the last decade. Beginning in \n2001 and then again in 2003, Congress passed what have come to be known \nas the Bush tax cuts. These fairly drastically reduced the revenue \ncoming to the Federal Government. At the same time we were cutting \ntaxes, we ramped up Federal spending, primarily for defense, and that \nis a result of the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war. The estimate there \nis that something like $1.3 trillion has gone into those efforts. In \naddition to defense, we ramped up spending on health care primarily by \nincluding a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. All of that \nincreased spending occurred without any increase in revenues to pay for \nit. I repeat that none of this spending was offset with increased \nrevenues.\n  The third factor, of course, that has brought us into the very \nserious deficit we now face is the slowdown of economic activity. This \ncontributed substantially to increased expenses for the government and \nsome of the entitlement programs--Medicaid, food stamps, and a variety \nof them--but also the decreased revenues. When people are earning less \nmoney, they pay less in taxes and less revenue comes to the government \nto pay for those services that the government is providing.\n  The deficit, of course, has worsened substantially in the last 2 \nyears because of, first, reduced Federal taxes being collected, largely \na result of the recession; second, increased Federal spending--both \nbecause there is more demand for government services as a result of the \nrecession and also because we passed the Recovery Act to stimulate the \neconomy. I think most economists would conclude it has helped stimulate \nthe economy.\n  The Pew fiscal analysis initiative analyzed the policies and \nlegislation that have caused the surpluses of the late 1990s to become \nthe deficits we see today. They produced a list showing their \nconclusions. That list is on this chart. We can see these are in the \norder of importance, the order in which they contributed to the current \ndeficit situation.\n  The top two drivers on this list are the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--they \naccount for about 13 percent of what we face today in deficits--and the \nIraq and Afghanistan wars, which account for about 10 percent of what \nwe face.\n  All told, tax cuts caused 21 percent of deficits since 2001; \nincreased defense spending caused 15 percent of deficits. Two-thirds of \nthat was due to Iraq and Afghanistan. Increased nondefense spending \ncaused 10 percent of the deficits we currently face; the Recovery Act \ncaused 6 percent; Medicare prescription drug caused 2 percent.\n  The final chart I have shows how these policies have affected the \ndeficit over time. This is a chart which is labeled ``Why CBO's debt \nprojections changed between 2001 and 2011,'' the specific policies and \ndrivers. I know this is very difficult for anyone to see on a \ntelevision. Let me make the main points.\n  The main points are that the changes caused by the legislation make \nup the large segments at the top of the chart, including interest \ncharges. They caused 65 percent of the deficits when we look at these \npolicy changes. The remaining 35 percent of deficits are due mainly to \nthe economic and technical adjustments to CBO's projections primarily \nto reflect the lower revenue we have enjoyed because of the recessions.\n  How do we dig out of the hole we are in? I say simple obvious things. \nNo. 1, we need to keep the focus on growing the economy. As Professor \nBlinder said, do not put the economy on a diet. This is not the right \ntime to do that.\n  Second, we need to agree, as we did in 1990 and 1993 and 1997, to a \nbalanced package of spending cuts and tax increases that will, once \nagain, put us on a path to a balanced budget. We have some serious \nproposals to work from in achieving this deficit reduction plan. Of \ncourse, the President's deficit reduction commission, the Simpson-\nBowles commission, and Senator Domenici and Alice Rivlin, the former \nhead of the Congressional Budget Office, put out a bipartisan \ncommission report which is very constructive. The President himself has \ngiven the framework for a plan. There is a bipartisan group of \nSenators, the Gang of 6, who are working to come up with a proposal. \nAnd, of course, Senator Conrad, who chairs the Budget Committee, is \nputting together a proposed budget plan for that committee's \nconsideration.\n  All of these plans I have mentioned follow the model used in the \n1990s of combining both spending cuts and revenue increases. The only \nproposal that does not follow this model of a balanced package of \nspending cuts and tax increases is the budget that was passed by the \nHouse Republicans 2 weeks ago. Rather than raising revenue while \ncutting spending, it would cut revenue while cutting spending. In my \nview, this cannot lead us to a lower deficit.\n  There is a lot of political polarization in Washington. I remain \nhopeful that we can get a critical mass of right-thinking people to do \nwhat is responsible, to come together on a balanced package of spending \ncuts and revenue increases that we can commit to going forward. We \nshould be able to agree on policies that grow the economy and shrink \nthe long-term deficit.\n  I pledge my best efforts to achieve these objectives. I urge my \ncolleagues to work to do so as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the effort \nof the House last month to repeal the Federal Communications \nCommission's net neutrality rules. Net neutrality is the very simple \nidea that all content and applications on the Internet should be \ntreated the same regardless of who owns the content or the Web site. \nThis is not a radical concept, in large part because it is what we see \nand experience every time we use the Internet. But the House wants to \nchange all of that and effectively turn control of the Internet over to \na handful of very powerful corporations.\n  I want to take a few moments today to tell you why I think the \nHouse's vote was a mistake, and why I am going to do everything in my \npower to make sure we don't make the same mistake in the Senate. But \nbefore I get into those details, I think it is important to take a step \nback and talk about the Internet we have today.\n  Let's be clear. The Internet we have exists because it is free and \nopen, because we have always had net neutrality throughout the entire \nexistence of the Internet. I have to give credit to my opponents on \nthis issue who have done a masterful job of manipulating the American \npublic into believing that net neutrality is something that it is not.\n  Net neutrality is not about a government takeover of the Internet. It \nis simply the idea that all content, whether it is a Web page, an e-\nmail, or a movie we are downloading can load onto our computers at home \nat the same speed, regardless of who owns or controls that content.\n  This is not a radical idea. It is what we experience today when we \nuse the Internet. Right now, if we buy Rihanna's latest song from \niTunes, it downloads as quickly as a song from a friend who started a \nband in his or her garage.\n  If you send an e-mail to your mother, it arrives in her inbox just as \nquickly as the e-mail she gets from President Obama. If you start a Web \nsite for your small business, your customers are able to access your \nWeb site and place orders for your products just as quickly as if they \nwere buying from a multinational corporation.\n  I like to talk about YouTube's early days as a startup because it is \nsuch a\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\npowerful example of why net neutrality is so critical and how this \nsimple concept helped create a billion-dollar company practically \novernight. YouTube's early headquarters were situated in a tiny space \nabove a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Francisco, CA. But just \n6 months after the site was activated, over 100 million people were \nusing YouTube to watch videos every day. Less than 2 years after it \nstarted, YouTube sold their business to Google for $1.6 billion. Isn't \nthat incredible?\n  Well, I am here to tell you it would not have been possible without \nnet neutrality. At that time, Google had a competing product, Google \nVideo, which was the standard at the time but was widely seen as \ninferior. If Google had been able to pay Comcast or Verizon or any of \nthe others large amounts of money to make its Web site faster than \nYouTube's, YouTube would still be floundering over that pizzeria or \nmost likely it would have ceased to exist at all. Fortunately, Google \ncouldn't pay for priority access, and the rest is history.\n  What I am saying is, we take, and have taken, this equality that \nYouTube enjoyed--this basic fairness or neutrality--for granted in \nlarge part because that is how the Internet has always been. \nUnfortunately, many Members of the House have twisted this concept and \nare misleading the American public into believing that the government \nwants to take over the Internet. That is simply not true.\n  One Member of the House actually got up on the House floor and said \nthis:\n\n       Over the last 10 years, over $500 billion--billion with a \n     ``b''--of private investment has been made to develop \n     broadband throughout the country. This is without any kind of \n     taxpayer money.\n\n  He is wrong on that point, but let's put that aside for now. He went \non to say:\n\n       This is private sector money being put into the marketplace \n     to go and create jobs, to go and create the kinds of \n     technologies that allow you to view and use all kinds of apps \n     that are available on these kinds of devices. That was done \n     without net neutrality. They would tell you that they need \n     net neutrality in order to have this innovation. Of course, \n     they fail to point out that net neutrality was not in place \n     when all this innovation happened.\n\n  Yes, it was; it was in place. That is the whole point. All of this \ninnovation occurred while net neutrality was in place. We are not \ntrying to change anything. We are keeping the Internet the way it has \nbeen during this explosion in innovation.\n  Now, my fervent hope is that this Member of Congress was just \nhorribly, egregiously misinformed because not only is his statement \nuntrue, it is the opposite of true. It is 180 degrees opposite of the \ntruth.\n  Please, everyone understand this, I beg you. Net neutrality has been \nin place since the beginning of the Internet.\n  From the very beginning, during all of that explosive growth, the \nInternet operated with an understanding that network providers must \ntreat all content the same and must interconnect the pipes they have to \ncustomers' homes with the pipes that are owned by other operators. This \nwas a fundamental design principle that was established by academics, \nengineers, and computer scientists who designed the earliest protocols \nfor Internet traffic.\n  The fact is, the Internet started and grew because everyone realized \nthey needed to cooperate and work together for customers to be able to \nhave access to the content they wanted. They realized that is what \nconsumers needed to create demand for Internet service, and they \nrealized that is what would lead to the most innovation on the \nInternet.\n  The FCC isn't trying to change that. It has no interest in derailing \nfree enterprise. Quite the contrary. The FCC is interested in \nprotecting the innovators and entrepreneurs who have made the Internet \nwhat it is today. Because of the Internet, you no longer need a major \nstudio to like your film or a television show you produce in order to \nhave people see it. You no longer need a major record deal to start \ndistributing your music. You no longer need a high school diploma or a \nfancy degree to launch a small business and sell your products online. \nWe don't want to change that. We want to preserve that.\n  The FCC's only goal is to make sure the Internet we know and love \ndoes not become corrupted and altered by a small number of large \ncorporations controlling the last free and open distribution channel we \nhave in this country.\n  As telecom companies have grown larger and fewer and started owning \nnot just the pipes but also the content, their incentives have changed. \nThey are starting to care more about giving their own content a \ncompetitive advantage rather than promoting innovation and competition \non the Internet.\n  The fight for net neutrality isn't about changing the Internet, it is \nabout creating a few rules of the road to keep it open and free, to \nkeep it the same, and to continue the innovation and growth that is \nsuch a creator of jobs and wealth.\n  The fight for net neutrality is about making sure large corporations \nare not allowed to put tollbooths on the information superhighway. This \nfight is about making sure that the Internet stays the way it is--free, \nopen, equal, available to everyone regardless of how much they can pay \nto get their content.\n  There was a time not so long ago when net neutrality was a bipartisan \nissue that was not incredibly controversial. Three years ago, Mike \nHuckabee was talking about the need to keep the Internet a level \nplaying field. In 2006, 11 House Republicans voted in favor of net \nneutrality on the floor. Rarely do you have the Gun Owners of America \nand the Christian Coalition joining with moveon.org and the ACLU to \nadvocate for the same policy of nondiscrimination on the Internet. But \nthey all agree on net neutrality. And so do the Catholic bishops.\n  Later today, I will receive 87,000 letters opposing the House's \neffort to undo the FCC's open Internet rules. These letters came from \nAmericans across the United States, including 2,000 letters from \nMinnesotans who are worried about this issue. They want the Internet to \nstay the way it is--open and free from corporate control.\n  I am confident as more Americans realize what is at stake, we will \nhear from more and more constituents who will ask us to protect them \nfrom corporate takeover of the Internet.\n  What is most striking about this issue, which seems to have gotten \nlost in the rhetoric that my opponents use, is that experts from Bank \nof America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and \nRaymond James have all stated they do not believe the FCC's current \nrules will hurt investment. Citibank has called the rule ``balanced'' \nand Goldman Sachs said it is ``a framework with a lot of wiggle room'' \nthat is a ``light touch'' by the FCC. Despite this broad and diverse \ncoalition of businesses and interest groups, we are still arguing about \nsomething that should have been settled long ago.\n  Why is that? A lot has changed in the last couple of years. Control \nof the Internet has been placed in the hands of a small number of \nplayers. Media consolidation has raised the stakes for certain mega \nconglomerates which have a lot more to gain in a world without net \nneutrality. I was last year on the Senate floor talking about net \nneutrality back in December when the NBC-Comcast merger had not yet \nbeen approved by the FCC or the Department of Justice. At the time, I \nwarned this would be the first in a cascade of media consolidation \ndeals. Wouldn't you know it, 2 months later, AT announced another \nrecord-breaking $39 billion deal with T-Mobile.\n  That merger, which Wall Street applauded, is almost assuredly going \nto be a raw deal for consumers. If approved, we will have a duopoly in \nwireless telecommunications in this country. Eighty percent of the \nwireless space will be controlled by two companies--AT and Verizon.\n  I look forward to the hearing next week in the Antitrust Subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee so we can further explore the details of \nthis deal. But I think it is fair to say I am very skeptical because it \nis likely to raise prices and it certainly will reduce choice for \nconsumers. I have always been skeptical of media consolidation because \nat the end of the day, when corporations have tremendous amounts of \npower to control prices and cripple competitors to benefit their bottom \nline, everyone loses.\n  But the impact of media consolidation in telecommunications is about \nmore than just consumer prices. We\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nhave always known that large corporations have the power to influence \nelections. Last year, the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United \ntook a situation that was already terrible and made it worse--much \nworse. Now AT, Verizon, Time Warner, and Comcast can spend unlimited \namounts of money to support the candidate or campaign they care most \nabout or try to weaken or kill net neutrality. It does not take a \nrocket scientist to realize that when a single corporation--in this \ncase AT $15.3 million in a single year to influence Congress \nand has 93 full-time lobbyists on its roster, Congress might churn out \nlegislation that AT likes.\n  How can American consumers, stuck with rising cable, Internet, and \ncell phone bills, ever be expected to counter that type of lobbying \npower?\n  With media consolidation, we have seen a shift in the net neutrality \ntalking points of Members of Congress who are also receiving large \nchecks from Verizon, AT, and Comcast. Yet the irony here is that the \nopen Internet rules passed by the FCC earlier this year are actually \npretty weak and riddled with loopholes. Actually, I think that is the \n``wiggle room'' to which Goldman Sachs was referring.\n  These rules are, let's be honest, a mediocre compromise drafted to \nappease a handful of powerful Internet service providers.\n  I was not happy with these rules and thought the FCC should have done \nmore, particularly to cover wireless Internet networks. But it did not. \nIt did not in part because the Commission wanted companies such as AT \nto get on board with its plan, and AT did--more or less. AT did not \nthink the rules were ideal, but it acknowledged the framework is a \ncompromise that gives its investors certainty.\n  That has not changed how the House is framing its rhetoric about this \nrule, which is one of the reasons I think the vote last month was a \npolitical stunt designed to misinform Americans and appease a small \nnumber of very vocal critics. This is not what most Americans, \nentrepreneurs, or small businesses want. They and I want a world where \nthe future Twitters, eBays, and Amazons of the world can grow and \nthrive without interference from big, mega conglomerates.\n  Finally, regardless of how one feels about the FCC's rules, I think \nwe can all agree this issue requires thoughtful debate and discussion, \nnot the kind of uninformed rhetoric I quoted earlier from the House \ndebate. By forcing an up-or-down vote through the Congressional Review \nAct, the House leadership short circuited the normal legislative \nprocess and ignored the FCC's work on this issue.\n  The FCC spent months examining this topic and meeting with tons of \nstakeholders and Internet companies. It carefully considered and \ncompromised on a range of issues that I, frankly, wish they had not \nbudged on. To claim that the FCC engaged in a power grab is unfair and \nfar from the truth.\n  The White House has said the President will veto this resolution, but \nI will be working hard in the coming months to make sure that we have \nenough votes to stop this before it reaches the President's desk.\n  We are at a pivotal moment. If we do not act to preserve the FCC's \nopen Internet rules, the Internet as we know it today may cease to \nexist. I hope my colleagues will recognize this and will join with me \nin voting down the House's resolution of disapproval.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, everyone in this body agrees that we \nmust take aggressive action to reduce the deficit, but we have to do it \nright. Frankly, the best way to bring down the deficit is to help 15 \nmillion unemployed Americans get good middle-class jobs again. Those \nhard-working Americans would be delighted to be on the tax rolls and to \nbe taxpayers once again. But, regrettably, the tea party budget passed \nby the House Republicans last month takes us in the opposite \ndirection--it would weaken our economy and destroy jobs.\n  I have spoken previously on the Senate floor about the grave flaws in \nthe Republican budget. But beyond the misguided priorities in that \nbudget, I object to its premise. The premise of the tea party \nRepublican budget coming over from the House is that America is poor \nand broke and we can no longer afford the investments that make \npossible a strong middle-class and world-class economy. Indeed, some \nHouse Republicans take the radical view that government has no business \ninvesting in the middle class, period. I emphatically reject the \ndefeatist premise of this Republican budget. The United States of \nAmerica is a wealthy Nation--the wealthiest Nation in world history. \nThe problem is how that wealth has been shared or not shared among the \nAmerican people, with income inequality that is the highest among \ndeveloped countries. Let me repeat that. Right now, income inequality \nin America is the highest among developed countries. So the problem is \nhow our wealth has been invested or misinvested, with trillions of \ndollars squandered by money manipulators on Wall Street or funneled to \nthose at the top through tax cuts.\n  Unfortunately, the tea party budget, authored by Congressman Ryan, \nwould make these problems far worse. It lavishes yet more tax cuts on \ncorporations and the wealthy even as it slashes investments that \nundergird the middle class in this country--everything from education \nfunding to Medicare and Medicaid. Let me state the obvious: If working \npeople in the middle class are going to take a hit in tough times, it \nshouldn't be to take a hit to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Let's look at some of the particulars in this so-called deficit \nreduction plan of the House Republicans. For starters, never before \nhave I heard of a deficit reduction plan that begins by demanding \ntrillions of dollars in new tax cuts, largely for corporations and the \nwealthy. In addition to allowing the very wealthy to keep all of the \nbenefits of the Bush-era tax cuts and to keep them permanently, the \nRepublican budget would cut the top tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 \npercent. Let's again state the obvious: This doesn't reduce the \ndeficit; it digs the deficit hole much deeper.\n  Next, the Republican budget dismantles Medicare and Medicaid and lays \nthe groundwork for deep cuts to Social Security--changes that will \ndevastate the economic security of the middle class in this country.\n  The Republican budget says we cannot cut one additional dime from the \nPentagon budget because I guess to them there is no waste in the \nPentagon, there are no unnecessary weapon systems, no troops based in \nJapan or Europe or elsewhere who could be brought home. Meanwhile, this \ntea party Republican budget slashes Federal investments in everything \nfrom education to infrastructure to law enforcement back to the levels \nof the 1920s. Again, let me repeat that. It slashes Federal investments \nin everything from education to infrastructure to law enforcement back \nto the levels of the 1920s.\n  It also repeals Wall Street reform that we passed here, as well as \nthe consumer protections in the affordable care act, including the ban \non denying coverage for preexisting conditions. What has that got to do \nwith the deficit?\n  Their budget cuts funding for food safety, workplace safety, \nenvironmental protection, and guts the commonsense regulation of \ncorporate America. It tells Wall Street bankers and speculators, health \ninsurance companies, credit card companies, and mortgage lenders: You \nare free to go back to the reckless abusive practices of the past. We \nwill just trust you to do what is right for the American people.\n  To appreciate just how extreme and ideological this budget is, look \nmore closely at the blueprint for replacing Medicare with a voucher \nsystem. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that by \n2030, future seniors would have to pay two-thirds of the cost of their \nprivate health insurance. Their out-of-pocket costs would average in \nexcess of $12,000 per person, per year--more than double the current\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\ncost to seniors. Yet this would pay for private plans that would \nprovide only half of current Medicare coverage. How many seniors can \nafford to pay $12,000 annually out of pocket for health insurance that \nonly gives them half the coverage they have right now for Medicare? And \ngood luck finding affordable coverage if you are a 70-year-old with a \npreexisting condition, such as heart disease. Good luck fighting \nendless battles with your private health insurance company over that \none.\n  Madam President, does this tea party Republican budget reflect our \nvalues and priorities as Americans? Is this the kind of country we want \nto live in, the kind of country we want to pass on to our children? Of \ncourse not. Americans don't want or expect a handout, but they \nrightfully expect a government that lends a helping hand, not one that \nstands in their way and not one that destroys the essence of the middle \nclass. The American people want a government that helps them to achieve \nretirement security, a government that makes sure that when we put \nmoney away for retirement, it is going to be there when we retire. The \nAmerican people want to maintain strong investments in education and \ninfrastructure.\n  To reduce deficits, the American people want shared sacrifice, \nincluding an increase in revenues from those who can most afford it. \nThey want an end to taxpayer subsidies to oil and gas companies, and \nthey want to cut Pentagon spending. Yet the Republican budget does \nexactly the opposite in every single respect.\n  Make no mistake, this tea party Republican budget puts us on a course \nof disinvestment, drift, and decline. This budget wreaks of pessimism \nand gloom and doom. As I said, its defeatist premise is that the United \nStates is poor and broke and we can no longer afford a strong and \nsecure middle class, we can no longer afford to prepare our young or \ncare for our elderly. Yet, bizarrely, the Republicans insist that we \ncan afford--we can absolutely afford--another enormous tax cut for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  I totally reject their premise. I reject this defeatist Ryan budget--\nthe premise that America is poor and broke.\n  Here is the truth: The United States is recovering from the largest \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression and from the damage caused \nby very unwise budget decisions made over the last decade, and we are \ngrowing wealthier by the day. Our entrepreneurial economy, our \ntechnology, our universities and the arts are the envy of the world. \nAmericans are still the best educated and most productive people on \nEarth.\n  Most importantly, Americans continue to be an optimistic, can-do \npeople. We have faced national trauma, including depressions and wars \nand national disasters, many times before, and we have always rebounded \nstronger and better than ever. We can overcome our current challenges \nwithout sacrificing our great middle class and without abandoning our \nseniors or people with disabilities and the less fortunate among us.\n  There is one important point of agreement on both sides of the aisle \nhere in the Senate: We agree the current budget deficits are \nunacceptable. We must bring these deficits under control.\n  However, deficits are by no means our only urgent economic challenge. \nAn even greater challenge--a greater challenge--is our fragile economy \nand the jobs crisis. Addressing this successfully will help reduce the \ndeficit. Now, the unofficial unemployment rate is 8.8 percent, but the \nreal unemployment rate, including people who are underemployed or who \nhave dropped out of the job market in frustration and are no longer \nworking, is a staggering 16 percent.\n  Meanwhile, our middle class is under siege. Our middle class is being \ndismantled as fast as big corporations can shift our manufacturing jobs \noverseas. People are losing their savings, their health care, their \npensions, and in many cases losing even their homes. With good reason, \nthe American people feel they are losing the American dream for \nthemselves and for their children.\n  That is why we cannot look at the deficit reduction challenge in \nisolation. We cannot just take a slash-and-burn approach to the budget. \nSmart countries do not just turn a chainsaw on themselves. Instead of \nthis tea party Republican budget, which is being sold through fear and \nfatalism, we need a budget that reflects the hopes and aspirations of \nthe American people. We need a budget that brings deficits under \ncontrol in a way that allows us to continue investments that boost \ncompetitiveness, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class.\n  I would add this: We need a deficit reduction plan that actually \nattacks the sources of our current deficits. What are those sources? \nWell, a remarkable article from the front page of Sunday's--May 1--\nWashington Post by Lori Montgomery documented clearly how the huge \nbudget surpluses of the Clinton years were turned into the $1 trillion \nbudget deficit President George W. Bush passed on to President Obama. \nThe article states:\n\n       Voices of caution were swept aside. Political leaders chose \n     to cut taxes, jack up spending, and, for the first time in \n     U.S. history, wage two wars solely with borrowed funds.\n\n  The article cites a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office which determined that ``routine increases in defense and \ndomestic spending account for only about 15 percent of the financial \ndeterioration. The biggest culprit, by far, has been an erosion of tax \nrevenue, triggered largely by two recessions and multiple rounds of tax \ncuts.''\n  The article also notes that Federal tax collections now stand at \ntheir lowest level as a percentage of the economy in 60 years.\n  Let me repeat that--their lowest level in 60 years.\n  Of legislation passed since 2001, when George W. Bush became \nPresident, about half of the negative impact on deficits came from \nreductions in revenue and nearly a quarter came from increases in \ndefense spending. One-half came from reductions in revenue.\n  I am talking now about what are the sources. What are the sources of \nthe deficit hole we are in? In 2001, we had huge surpluses. CBO said if \nwe maintained the same budget policies that by 2010 we would have paid \noff the entire national debt. 10 years later, in 2011, we have a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit. What happened? What decisions were made in those 10 \nyears that put us in that hole?\n\n  As I said, the article by Lori Montgomery in the Washington Post \nclearly points out, and the CBO clearly points out, that half of the \nhole we are in came from reductions in revenue, one-quarter came from \nincreases in defense spending, and one-quarter from everything else.\n  As the CBO analysis makes clear, we do not just have a spending \nproblem, we have a revenue problem. The main source of our current \ndeficit problem is not the modest increase in domestic spending beyond \nthe one-time spending in the Recovery Act--which is rapidly coming to \nan end. The principal source of our deficits is the deep tax cuts and \nthe surging Pentagon budget, 75 percent of our current problems.\n  Yet now the tea party Republican budget calls for trillions of \ndollars and yet more new tax cuts, largely for those at the top. It \nrefuses to cut Pentagon spending in any significant way. It places \nalmost the entire burden of deficit reduction on programs that support \nthe middle class, seniors, people with disabilities, and those of low \nincome.\n  Americans are rightly asking some commonsense questions. If a \nprincipal source of our deficit problem has been deep tax cuts largely \nbenefitting those at the top, shouldn't a big part of our deficit \nreduction plan include allowing those unaffordable tax cuts to expire? \nIf ongoing domestic spending increases are only a minor source of our \ndeficit problem, why does this Republican budget take a slash-and-burn \napproach to these programs which are so important to the middle class \nand to working Americans? The answer, of course, is the tea party \nRepublican budget is not principally a deficit reduction plan. It is an \nideological manifesto that encompasses the entire party wish list, \neverything from more tax breaks for the rich to dismantling Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  I have a simple test for judging any budget plan. What does that plan \ndo to give hope and opportunity to middle-class Americans who have been \nhardest hit by the economic downturn?\n  To speak in terms specific to my State of Iowa, what did it do for \nWebster City? Webster City is a community\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nlike thousands of others across the United States. It is a town where \nmiddle-class families work hard, play by the rules, sacrifice for their \nchildren. But it is also a town where a decent middle class way of life \nis threatened. Recently, in Webster City, IA, the Electrolux plant that \nhas been the town's economic engine for over 80 years closed its doors. \nProduction was moved to Juarez, Mexico. In the final round of layoffs \nin March, 500 Iowans lost their well-paying, middle-class jobs.\n  This most recent factory closing comes on the heels of 222 plant \nclosings just in Iowa last year, destroying nearly 12,000 well-paying, \nmiddle-class jobs. As we all know, each of these plant closures \nreverberated on Main Street, with many local stores and restaurants \nfalling on hard times or going out of business themselves. Let's be \nclear, the wrong kind of budget plan, one that indiscriminately slashes \nfunding for education and job training, infrastructure and research, \nwill deepen the plight of Webster City and similar communities across \nAmerica. Indeed, by accelerating the erosion of the middle class in \nthis country, such a plan will make our fiscal situation even worse. \nThere can be no sustainable economic recovery in the United States \nwithout the recovery of the middle class. There can be no sustainable \nsolution to our budget challenges without a strong middle class, a \nmiddle class that is getting its fair share of rising national income.\n  As I said earlier, we are growing wealthier by the day in America. We \nare the wealthiest country in world history, and we are growing \nwealthier by the day. But what we ought to make sure is that the middle \nclass will get its fair share of that rising national income.\n  Again, I think the test of a budget plan is this: Will it strengthen \nthe middle class in America? Will it require shared sacrifice with a \npromise of shared prosperity in the long run? I have applied this test \nto the tea party Republican budget and it comes up woefully short.\n  This tea party Republican budget cuts the top tax rate for \nmillionaires and billionaires from 35 percent down to 25 percent. How \nwill that help laid-off workers in Webster City?\n  The Republican budget dismantling Medicare and replacing it with an \nabsurdly inadequate voucher system, will that strengthen the retirement \nsecurity of seniors in Webster City?\n  This budget of the Republican tea party people guts Medicaid. Will \nthat improve the lives of seniors and people with disabilities who \ndepend on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care and home health care \nassistance?\n  The tea party Republican budget slashes funding for Pell grants. Will \nthat improve the prospect for kids in Webster City who plan to go to \ncollege but whose parents are now unemployed and without resources?\n  The tea party Republican budget makes Draconian cuts to everything \nfrom food safety and law enforcement to environmental protection. How \nwill that improve the quality of life in Webster City and communities \nacross America? We know the answer to these questions. The bottom line \nis, the Republican's budget offers more pain and no gain to the people \nof Webster City. Instead of increasing opportunity, it sends a message \nof surrender and defeat. Indeed, let's speak the plain truth. With this \ntea party budget, Republicans have taken their class warfare to a new \nlevel. They have launched an unprecedented assault on middle-class and \nworking Americans. Their message to struggling folks in Webster City \nand communities like it across America is brutally clear: Tough luck. I \nhave mine. You are on your own.\n  This Republican tea party budget would drive down our standard of \nliving, shred the economic safety net, reduce access to health care and \nhigher education, and do damage to our public schools' ability to \nprepare our kids for the jobs of the future. We can and must do better.\n  I have come to the floor to propose an alternative approach to the \nFederal budget, a planned approach that will discipline the Federal \nbudget and bring deficits under control while continuing to make \ncritical investments in a stronger America. Best of all, we know this \napproach can work because it is consciously modeled on the successful \nbudget policies of the 1990s.\n  Under President Clinton's leadership, Congress passed a bold economic \nplan that combined tough-minded spending cuts with smart investments \nand, yes, revenue increases. This created large budget surpluses and \nput us on a track to completely eliminate the national debt within a \ndecade. It created a brief era of shared prosperity for the middle \nclass, with 22 million new jobs and 116 consecutive months of economic \nexpansion, the longest in American history.\n  I say to the people across America, we can do this again. The key to \nrenewing America and restoring our economy is to revitalize the middle \nclass. This means reducing deficits while continuing to invest in \neducation, innovation, and infrastructure, boosting American \ncompetitiveness. It means restoring a level playing field with fair \ntaxation, an empowered workforce, and a strong ladder of opportunity to \ngive every American access to the middle class.\n  We have the resources, both financial and human, to do these things. \nI repeat what I said earlier, the central falsehood in the tea party \nRepublican budget is its assumption that America is poor and broke; its \nassumption that we can no longer afford to invest in a prosperous and \nsecure middle class. Again, I say emphatically, we are not poor and we \nare not broke. We have the highest per capita income of any major \ncountry. As I said earlier, the problem is how our wealth is \ndistributed, how it is managed, and how it has been invested--or should \nI say ``misinvested.''\n  Income inequality in the United States has reached levels not seen \nsince immediately before the Great Depression. Middle-class Americans \nare working harder than ever, but they are falling behind. Real average \nincomes have not gone up since 1979, more than three decades ago. Let \nme repeat that: Average real incomes haven't gone up since 1979, more \nthan three decades ago. In fact, over the last decade, the average \nincome of working Americans has actually declined while those in the \ntop 10 percent of income earners and wealthy in America, their incomes \nand their wealth has soared to new levels. Vast wealth because of tax \nbreaks and other government preferences have flowed to millionaires and \nmoney manipulators who pay a tax rate that is lower than that paid by \ntheir chauffeurs and secretaries.\n  In 2007, the top 25 hedge fund managers took home an average income \nof $892 million--yes, you heard that right, $892 million each, average \nincome for 1 year. Over the last decade, the average income of the top \n1 percent in America increased by an average of more than one-quarter \nof a million dollars a year. Again, let me repeat: The top 1 percent of \nincome earners in America, their income increased by an average of more \nthan one-quarter of a million dollars a year for 10 years. I ask, who \nin their right mind believes these people need another giant tax cut?\n  People do not hate the rich. To the contrary, most Americans aspire \nto do well and to achieve financial independence. That is a big part of \nthe American dream. But Americans do resent it when the wealthy and \npowerful manipulate the political system to reap huge advantages at the \nexpense of working people and the middle class. Ordinary people think \nthe game is rigged and unfair, and you know what? They are right. Yet \nthis tea party Republican budget says to middle-class Americans again: \nHey, tough luck. I have mine. You are on your own. Your retirement \nsecurity is expendable. Your access to health care and college is \nexpendable. Your desire for quality public schools is expendable. Your \nquest for a modernized transportation system is expendable. All these \nthings, according to the Republican budget, are expendable in order to \ncreate a Tax Code even more favorable to the rich and the powerful and \nthe privileged.\n  This is deeply wrong. The middle class is the backbone of this \ncountry, and it is time our leaders showed the backbone to defend it. \nWe need an alternative, a budget that invests in education and \nopportunity for all Americans, a budget that invests in the retirement \nsecurity of the middle class and, yes, a budget that does not abandon \nthe less fortunate among us, including seniors and people with \ndisabilities.\n  As we saw in the 1990s, we can do these things at the same time we \nare bringing deficits under control. This will require smart, prudent \nreductions\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nin spending, and it will require reform of the Tax Code to make it \nfairer and more equitable, a Tax Code that asks more from those at the \ntop whose incomes have skyrocketed in recent decades.\n  Let me speak first about spending cuts. I hope I have set an example \nwith my own appropriations subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies of the \nAppropriations Committee. The fiscal year 2011 spending bill that was \nenacted last month cuts spending in these areas by almost $6 billion \nand eliminates dozens of individual programs. I also serve on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Of course, I believe we can \nmake major spending cuts without harming our national security. I agree \nwith Secretary Gates, who has urged us to terminate the additional C-17 \ncargo planes and a new amphibious fighting vehicle. I would also save \n$12 billion by terminating the V-22 Osprey, which even Dick Cheney \nlabeled a turkey and tried to cancel it.\n  I would also save $80 billion over the next decade by reducing the \nnumber of Active-Duty military personnel stationed in Europe and Japan.\n  Most importantly, it is time to save hundreds of billions of dollars \nby speeding up the return of our troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. It \ncosts an estimated $1 million a year to deploy and support each soldier \ndeployed in those wars. That is an extravagance we can do without.\n  We can also make cuts close to home. I represent a farm State, and I \nhave a strong record of supporting a true farm income safety net. \nHowever, in this time of strong commodity prices, record levels of net \nfarm income, the USDA--the Department of Agriculture--is still paying \nout nearly $5 billion a year in direct payments to farmers, having no \nrelationship to farm income or commodity prices or to what they are \neven planting. No question, we can save some money here while still \nmaking sure farmers have a good solid income safety net protection \nsystem.\n  We also must find additional deficit reduction in the area of health \ncare. Once again, the tea party Republican budget flunks the test. It \ndoes not reduce spending on health care, it just shifts costs. It \nshifts the costs to seniors and others by making them pay most of the \nbills themselves.\n  By contrast, the new health reform law actually cuts health care \ncosts. Again, according to CBO, it reduces the deficit by hundreds of \nbillions in the first decade and by more than $1 trillion--the health \nreform bill cuts the deficit by more than $1 trillion in the second \ndecade, while preserving and strengthening Medicare, not dumping it on \nthe backs of seniors. It does so by rewarding health care providers for \nthe quality of care, not the quantity. It does so by placing a sharp \nnew emphasis on wellness and prevention, keeping people out of the \nhospital in the first place. It does so by creating an independent \ncommission of doctors, nurses, medical experts, and consumers, to \nexamine patient data and recommend the best ways to reduce wasteful \nspending and ineffective procedures, while preserving the quality of \ncare.\n  We can and must build on the health care savings in the Affordable \nCare Act. But my friends on the other side of the aisle want to repeal \nthe Health Reform Act. But they do not say where they are going to get \nthe money to make up the $1 trillion hole it will blow in the budget in \nthe next decade.\n  The enormously successful deficit reduction campaign of the 1990s \ninsisted on a balanced approach: spending cuts and revenue increases. \nRevenue increases were concentrated on the most affluent Americans, \nthose who could most easily afford it, and who benefited the most from \nthe strong economy and the stock market that followed. This must be our \ntemplate as we raise necessary revenues to reduce future deficits.\n  By all means, we must allow the Bush era tax breaks for the \nwealthiest 10 percent of Americans to expire immediately. To put it \nbluntly, they do not need it, and we cannot afford it. The fact is, \nhigh-income Americans did extremely well in the 1990s under the higher \nrates of the Clinton years, and they will continue to do very well in \nthe future, while contributing their fair share to bringing deficits \nunder control.\n  I also strongly agree with President Obama's proposal to limit \nitemized deductions for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, a reform \nthat would reduce the deficit by $320 billion over 10 years. We need to \nend the outrageous gimmicks in our Tax Code. Just one example. The \n``carried interest'' loophole allows many hedge fund managers to pay \ntaxes at just a 15-percent rate on part of their bonuses, a far lower \nrate than middle-class Americans pay.\n  As I said earlier, in one recent year, the top 25 hedge fund mangers \ntook home an average income of $892 million a year each. Let's tax this \nincome the same way we tax the income of teachers and truckdrivers.\n  In addition, I strongly favor a modest speculation tax on certain \ntypes of financial transactions, a .25-percent tax--that is one-quarter \nof 1 percent tax--on each stock transaction, and a similar tax on \noptions, futures, and swap transactions.\n  In order to minimize the impact on ordinary American investors, this \nwould exclude transactions in tax-benefited pension accounts such as \n401(k)s and IRAs and defined benefit plans.\n  Some might say, well, this sounds kind of a pie in the sky. Well, \nGreat Britain currently levies a tax on stock transactions that is \ntwice as high as what I am proposing--twice as high as what I am \nproposing. There is no question that Wall Street can easily bear this \nmodest tax.\n  John Bogle, the legendary founder of the Vanguard Mutual Fund Group, \nhas long advocated such a speculation tax, a transaction tax, in order \nto ``slow the rampant speculation that has created such havoc in our \nfinancial markets.''\n  We also should be working to eliminate the tax provisions which \npromote the shifting of jobs to other countries. The President's budget \nproposes the elimination of over $100 billion in international tax \nbreaks in this area.\n  A prudent but aggressive mix of spending reductions and tax \nincreases, combined with stronger economic growth and an end to the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, will bring Federal deficits under \ncontrol. This will restore the fiscal discipline that was squandered in \nthe years after President Clinton left office.\n  Best of all, this restored fiscal foundation will allow us to \ncontinue making critical investments in transportation and \ninfrastructure, education and energy, investments that will put \nAmericans back to work, strengthen our global competitiveness, and \nprepare our workforce for the future.\n  Make no mistake, we have no time to waste. While the United States \nhas been distracted and weakened by foolish wars and speculative \nbubbles, our competitors have been charging ahead. We have lost major \nground to China and to other rapidly growing economies, including \nBrazil, South Korea. We are playing catchup and the stakes are \nenormous.\n  Across America, roads are crumbling, bridges are collapsing. Our \nformerly world-class interstate highway system is increasingly \noverwhelmed. Mass transit systems, including Washington's once proud \nMetro system, have fallen into disrepair. We have a backlog of nearly \n$300 billion in school construction and modernization.\n  In infrastructure, we currently invest less than one-third of what \nWestern Europe does as a percentage of GDP. China has tripled its \ninvestment in education, and is building hundreds of new colleges and \nuniversities at a time when we are slashing school budgets and laying \noff teachers.\n  The tea party Republican budget makes this investment gap far worse. \nIt proposes to cut funding for transportation by 25 percent, and for \neducation by 25 percent, and in future years would cut those \ninvestments even more deeply. Congressman Ryan has the audacity to tell \nus this is ``a path to prosperity.'' Common sense tells us it is a \nbridge to nowhere.\n  These statistics are not abstractions. Investments in education, \ninfrastructure, and innovation directly translate into more and better \njobs, higher incomes, stronger economic growth. That is why we need to \nget America moving again.\n  For starters, we need a massive new commitment to infrastructure \nexpansion and modernization, truly a Marshall plan for America. The \nfirst step is to adopt a solid 6-year surface transportation \nreauthorization bill that will allow us to modernize our transportation \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\n  We also need robust new investments in clean, renewable, domestically \nproduced energy. This will lower our energy costs in the long term, and \nwill reduce our dependence on some of the most unstable countries in \nthe world.\n  Early in the 20th century, we provided the emerging oil energy with \nsubsidies to accelerate its growth. Today, we must provide similar \npolicies to accelerate America's transition to a clean energy economy, \nincluding long-term tax credits for a renewable energy generation, and \nfor infrastructure investments for biofuels, as well as smart grid \ntechnologies to enable broader renewable energy use. The goal should be \n25 percent of our energy from renewable resources by 2025.\n  In the field of education, we need major new investments. This begins \nwith Federal support for universal preschool education to ensure that \nevery child is ready to learn and succeed in school. It means an \nambitious reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education \nbill that close the gap between world-class schools in affluent \nsuburbs, and struggling schools in poor urban and rural communities. It \nmeans providing resources to ensure that the goal of graduating \nstudents who are college and career ready applies equally to students \nwith disabilities.\n  In closing, in my remarks today I have offered not just an \nalternative approach to bringing deficits under control but an \nalternative vision of the role of the Federal Government. Going back to \nthe 1930s, the American people have supported and strengthened an \nunwritten social contract. That social contract says we will prepare \nour young and care for our elderly. That social contract says if you \nwork hard and play by the rules, you will be able to rise to the middle \nclass or even beyond. That social contract says a cardinal role of \ngovernment is to provide a ladder of opportunity, so every American can \nrealistically aspire to the American dream.\n  In one fell swoop, this tea party Republican budget rips up that \nsocial contract. It replaces it with a winner-take-all philosophy, \nagain, that tells struggling, aspiring people and communities across \nAmerica: I have got mine. You are on your own.\n  As I said at the outset, the Republican budget is premised on the \nidea that America is poor and broke, that our best days are behind us, \nthat we have no choice but to slash investment required in order to \nkeep our middle class strong. I totally disagree.\n  America remains a tremendously wealthy and resourceful nation. We are \nan optimistic, forward-looking people. We are a purposeful and can-do \npeople, and we expect our government to be on our side, the side of the \nmiddle class. We expect it to be an instrument of national greatness \nand purpose, allowing us to come together to achieve the big things we \ncannot achieve as individuals, things such as building an interstate \nhighway system, mapping the human genome, one day discovering a cure \nfor cancer.\n  Through our government, we come together to provide a ladder of \nopportunity to give every citizen a shot at the American dream, a \nladder of opportunity that includes quality public schools and \nuniversities, Pell grants, the GI bill, job training. Through our \ngovernment, we come together to ensure that our citizens have a secure \nretirement with guaranteed access to health care, and to ensure that \nthe less fortunate among us are not abandoned to the shadows of life.\n  I am convinced that the great majority of Americans share this \npositive can-do vision. We refuse to be dragged backward into a winner-\ntake-all society where the privileged and the powerful seize even a \ngreater share of the wealth, as the middle class struggles and \ndeclines.\n  Americans are a tough and resilient and optimistic people. We can and \nwill work together to meet the great challenges of our day. We can and \nwill, indeed we must, restore the middle class as the backbone of a \nstronger, richer and fairer America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Earlier today we had a cloture vote on the nomination of \nJack McConnell to be a United States District Judge for Rhode Island, \nand 63 Senators voted to cut off debate and to move then to a final \nvote on confirmation which will occur, I am told, around 5:30, shortly.\n  But first I wanted to come to the floor and expand a little bit on \nsome of my earlier comments with regard to this nomination and why I am \nso strongly opposed to it just to make a few other comments.\n\n  Thirty-three years ago I became a lawyer, a member of the legal \nprofession. While I have heard as many lawyer jokes as a person can \nstand in a lifetime, I am actually proud of the legal profession. What \nattracted me to it was study of the law, the rule of law, and the \nmajesty of law being made by elected representatives of the American \npeople speaking for the American people themselves; a profession that \nobserves a rule of ethics, that is not just who can get the most the \nfastest but one that actually requires lawyers to practice according to \na standard of ethics.\n  Third, the obligation and the responsibility that comes with \nrepresenting a client; in other words, it is not the lawyer who is \nspeaking on his or her own behalf but a lawyer who is speaking on \nbehalf of a client, whether they have been arrested and charged with a \ncrime, whether they have been injured in an accident and seeking \ncompensation for some wrongdoing and to deter future acts, similar \nactions in the future, whether it is a commercial dispute over a \ncontract or some other relationship. I believe it is the rule of law \nand our adherence to ethical standards and the fact that the legal \nprofession serves the interests of clients who need help, many of whom \ndon't have a voice themselves, or certainly the capability of \nrepresenting themselves, who need somebody who can help them.\n  But I have to tell my colleagues that it is because of my respect and \nadmiration for the legal profession that it makes me angry when I see \npeople making a mockery out of the foundational principles I just \nmentioned: the rule of law, ethics, and the fiduciary duty owed to a \nclient.\n  After I practiced law for a while, I had the great honor of being \nelected to and serving as a district judge in my home city of San \nAntonio. So not only did I represent clients as an advocate in court, I \nhad the responsibility of presiding over trials and making sure people \nwere treated impartially, the same, and according to the rule of law; \nthat it was not a matter of who they were or how much money they had \nbut that everybody could have access to our system of justice.\n  Later I was honored to be elected to serve on the Texas Supreme Court \nfor 7 years where I was an appellate judge and I wrote legal opinions, \nbasically grading the papers of some of those trial judges and making \nsure that indeed we had equal justice under the law. Then I served as \nattorney general for 4 years before I came here, during which time I \nbecame acquainted with a certain class of entrepreneurial lawyers whom \nI think threatened the very rule of law I have been talking about.\n  I previously talked about my objections to Jack McConnell's \nnomination and confirmation to serve as a Federal judge because I \nbelieve he intentionally misrepresented certain facts before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Mr. McConnell and his firm have been sued in Ohio \nfor stealing and maintaining custody of certain stolen documents in a \nlead paint lawsuit which I will speak about in a moment. As a matter of \nfact, earlier today I introduced an article which demonstrates that \nlegal dispute still is raging and is not yet resolved. Yet the Senate \nis moving ahead and will likely confirm someone to a life-tenured job \nas a Federal judge who may ultimately be found responsible. I don't \nknow, he could be vindicated. But why are we taking the risk that this \nindividual who will be given a lifetime job as a Federal judge might \nultimately be found culpable in something that is certainly \ndisqualifying if he is responsible for it?\n  But I wish to speak just a little bit more about--well, I wish to \ntell a story. I think it helps make the point I wish to convey.\n  Once upon a time there was an enterprising lawyer and some of his law \npartners who were trying to figure a new way to make a lot of money. \nOne of them said:\n  ``Well, I have a plan to do that. First, we have to pick a product or \nsector of\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nthe economy that is unpopular, even though it is legal. For example, \ntobacco.''\n  ``Exactly,'' one of the lawyers said. ``We pick a product like \ntobacco, and we sue the manufacturer and make a lot of money.''\n  ``The problem is we have already tried to do that in individual \nlawsuits that are designed to compensate victims and deter wrongdoing, \nbut we lost all of those lawsuits.''\n  ``Well,'' the enterprising young lawyer who suggested this plan said, \n``we did, but now we have a new legal theory. We have a new approach. \nAnd it is a legal theory that has never actually been embraced or \naccepted by the courts.''\n  One of the other lawyers said, ``Well, how does that work? What is \nthe theory?''\n  To which the other responded, ``Well, the theory really doesn't \nmatter because this case will never be tried, but it will be settled \nfor billions of dollars.''\n  That takes us to the second part of the plan. The truth is, the \nclient or the person who would be represented is not an individual \nvictim who was harmed as a result of some wrongdoing by the \nmanufacturer of the product, but instead of that it is the State--a \nState. How do you get hired to represent a State? Well, you have to get \nthe attorney general--my former job. You have to get the attorney \ngeneral, who is the chief law enforcement officer of the State, to \nbasically hire you and then to delegate to you the sovereign law \nenforcement power of the State--in this case to sue the makers of a \nproduct. Part of this scheme is you sue not just for damages to one \nindividual or a group of individuals, you sue for essentially everyone \nin the State, alleging billions of dollars in damages.\n  The key reason this is so important to this scheme, of course, is \nbecause this is a break-the-company lawsuit. By that I mean it is an \nexistential threat to the existence of this company, far bigger than \nany legal threat they may have faced in the past, because the damages \nare enormous. Every potential juror who would sit in judgment of the \ncase being a constituent, a resident of that State, would stand to \nbenefit in some way or another by any judgment rendered against this \ncompany. Then, of course, there is the power of the State itself to \nlaunch, perhaps, a negative publicity campaign against this company or \nsector to erode the stock value of this company in order to compel them \nor force them into a settlement posture.\n  Well, part of this scheme is that even though the chances of winning \nin court are very slim, even a small risk of losing everything--wiping \nout shareholders, retirees, pension funds, and employees--even that \nsmall risk is enough to cause the defendant to consider coming to the \nsettlement table. True, even if you have a chance--liability is very \nthin and you think you aren't responsible--you still have to navigate \nthe maze of litigation through the trial and the appellate and the \nSupreme Court. You know you might just win if you can outlast their \nadversaries. But in the meantime, as I indicated earlier, the stock \nprice takes a beating, management is consumed with defending the \nlawsuit rather than running the business, and millions of dollars are \nbeing spent on their own lawyers in order to defend this case.\n  Well, in this story the law partners of this enterprising young \nlawyer say: That sounds like a great plan. We could earn a lot of \nmoney.\n  The lawyer proposing this says: Well, we can earn more than you can \npossibly imagine because our compensation may well exceed $100,000 an \nhour.\n  Well, how do you do that? No one can charge $100,000 an hour as a \nlegal fee.\n  Well, this is the best part from their perspective. They would not \nactually negotiate an hourly fee under the supervision of a judge that \nreflects prevailing ethical standards. Instead, they will negotiate a \ndeal with this attorney general for the State on a contingency fee \nbasis in a no-bid, noncompetitive contract. So then they would get a \npercentage of any amount of money recovered in this bet-the-company \nlawsuit. Since there are no costs up front for the taxpayer, the State \nattorney general would look like a hero, even if the lawsuit was \nunsuccessful. But if he succeeds, these lawyers would get a significant \npercentage of an astronomical sum of money. No funds would be \nappropriated by the legislature to finance the litigation, so the State \nofficial can make the ethically fallacious and ethically dubious claim \nthat no tax dollars will be used to pay legal fees. The official enters \ninto this no-bid contract for legal services with lawyers whose future \npolitical support, including campaign contributions, is assured. The \nofficial can expect to be lauded as a popular hero in the press by his \nwillingness to take on an unpopular industry.\n  Now, as part of this scheme and story, to leverage the chances for \nsuccess, these lawyers then cherry-pick the court where the lawsuit is \nfiled, a court well known for being friendly to these sorts of claims. \nSeeing the handwriting on the wall, ultimately as part of this scheme, \nthe plan would be that the defendants, even though they are not--the \nchances of proving them responsible are very thin, the risk of losing \nand losing the company are so huge that they decide to go to the \nsettlement table.\n  Well, here is the deal. The plaintiff's lawyers say--under this \nscheme, and in some ways it turns out to be a lifeline to the \ndefendants--first, the good news: The defendants will survive. They \nwon't be at risk of losing the company--the employees, the stock price, \nthe pensioners, the retirees who depend on the existence of the \ncompany.\n  Secondly, the business will continue to operate and--here is the best \npart--the judgment that will be entered will ultimately, from the \nstandpoint of the company, bar any future lawsuits. The defendants \nagree rather than paying a lump sum settlement out of their current \nassets to pay hundreds of billions of dollars to these lawyers and the \nState out of future profits.\n  How do you make sure you don't have to dip into your current assets? \nWell, basically, the defendants agree under this arrangement to raise \nthe price of their product for consumers. So, ultimately, the consumers \npay, and the defendants will pay the attorney's fees out of this same \nincome stream.\n  Now, these lawyers in this story believe this is really a stroke of \ngenius. While no person who has allegedly been injured by this product \nwill receive a penny--and, indeed, as a result, the defendant will not \nbe deterred from engaging in that sort of conduct, nor will, as I say, \nany victim be compensated--the State recovers a windfall of damages \nwithout having to appear to raise taxes, although the increased price \nfor the product is passed along to consumers.\n  As a result of this deal, the defendant's stock price rebounds, they \ncan stay in business essentially as a partner with this law firm whose \nlegal fees will be paid out of future sales revenue, and the State \nofficial who agrees to this ingenious scheme is elected to higher \noffice in part on the strength of this David v. Goliath story. The only \nproblem with this story is that it is no fairy tale.\n  So who are these lawyers who dreamed up this ingenious scheme to \npartner with a State official to be able to be delegated the sovereign \npower of the State and collect fabulous wealth in the form of \nattorney's fees that no judge will award and no jury will award because \nit is part of this settlement? Jack McConnell, the nominee, and his law \nfirm.\n  His Web site says: McConnell played a central role in the historic \nlitigation against the tobacco industry in which $246 million in all \nwas recovered, it says, on behalf of the State attorneys general, \nserving as a negotiator and primary drafter of the master settlement \nagreement. As a result, Mr. McConnell told us in the Judiciary \nCommittee, he expects to collect between $2.5 million and $3.1 million \na year from now through 2024. What is more, Jack McConnell now finds \nhimself nominated to be a Federal judge in whose court future ingenious \nbut ethically dubious schemes can be expected to have a warm reception.\n  This is the type of thing Stuart Taylor--a well-respected legal \ncommentator--called, he said: The rule of law has now morphed into \nthese sorts of schemes into the rule of lawyers. He has talked about \nthe sequel to this litigation I have described in this story which was \nthe lead paint lawsuit, which we have talked about a little before, \nwhich was unanimously rejected by the Rhode Island Supreme Court--\nfrivolous litigation.\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. McConnell and his law firm were assessed \nfees of over $200,000. But Mr. Taylor said: It is litigation of this \ntype which has perverted the legal system for personal or political \ngain at the expense of everyone else. Strong words, hard words, but I \nthink the Senate needs to know the type of nominee we are voting on, \nand the American people need to know what the record of this nominee \nis, so then they can hold the Senators who vote for his confirmation \naccountable.\n  But this is not a partisan issue. It is not. This is not even about \nideology. This is about ethics. This is about upholding the rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the close of my \nremarks, a Wall Street Journal article, dated January 12, 2000, by \nRobert B. Reich, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Reich was Secretary of Labor during the Clinton \nadministration, and he wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal that \nI think is particularly appropriate to what I am talking about. The \nlead of the article from this prominent Democrat, a Cabinet Secretary \nunder Bill Clinton, is: ``Don't Democrats Believe in Democracy?'' That \nis the title. I will not read all of it, but I will read just a few \nsentences.\n  In talking about this kind of government-sponsored litigation by \noutsourcing the responsibilities of the sovereign government and the \nelected officials to contingency fee lawyers, whose only motive is \nmaximizing their personal profit, he said:\n\n       . . . the biggest problem is that these lawsuits are end \n     runs around the democratic process. We used to be a nation of \n     laws, but this new strategy presents novel means of \n     legislating--within settlement negotiations of large civil \n     lawsuits initiated by the executive branch. This is faux \n     legislation, which sacrifices democracy to the discretion of \n     administration officials operating in secrecy.\n\n  Well, I agree with Secretary Reich. I think this is a threat to our \ndemocracy. Again, I do not think it should be viewed as a partisan \nissue, even though he has that provocative headline and he is talking \nabout members of his own party who have endorsed and initiated some of \nthis type of litigation.\n  We had an earlier vote, as I said, where 63 Senators voted to close \noff debate, and we will have a vote here in short order. I know some \nSenators have indicated they voted to close off debate because they \nfelt that was the appropriate vote to make, but they were going to vote \nagainst Mr. McConnell's nomination. So we will see how many votes he \ngets. But we know if it is a party-line vote, there are 53 Democrats in \nthis body and 46 Republicans. If it is a party-line vote, Mr. McConnell \nis going to be a Federal judge. But I think it is important to make the \nRecord crystal clear as to the type of nominee Senators are voting on. \nI think it is my responsibility to my constituents, it is my \nresponsibility to the Senate, to express the strong objections I have \nto this nominee. Surely--well, I know there are better people for the \nPresident to nominate in Rhode Island. Two of them serve in the Senate. \nThere are other qualified people who could be nominated, and I believe \nthis ethically challenged nominee--who, according to the words of \nStuart Taylor, is among a class of lawyers who have perverted the legal \nsystem for personal and political gain at the expense of everyone \nelse--is the wrong person for this job. So I will be voting against the \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 12, 2000]\n\n                 Don't Democrats Believe in Democracy?\n\n                          (By Robert B. Reich)\n\n       If I had my way there would be laws restricting cigarettes \n     and handguns. But Congress won't even pass halfway measures. \n     Cigarette companies have admitted they produce death sticks, \n     yet Congress won't lift a finger to stub them out. Teenage \n     boys continue to shoot up high schools, yet Congress won't \n     pass stricter gun controls. The politically potent cigarette \n     and gun industries have got what they wanted: no action. \n     Almost makes you lose faith in democracy, doesn't it?\n       Apparently that's exactly what's happened to the Clinton \n     administration. Fed up with trying to move legislation, the \n     White House is launching lawsuits to succeed where \n     legislation failed. The strategy may work, but at the cost of \n     making our frail democracy even weaker.\n       The Justice Department is going after the tobacco companies \n     with a law designed to fight mobsters--the 1970 Racketeer \n     Influenced and Corrupt Organizations chapter of the Organized \n     Crime Control Act. Justice alleges that the tobacco companies \n     violated RICO by conspiring to create an illegal enterprise. \n     They did this by agreeing to a ``concerted public-relations \n     campaign'' to deny any link between smoking and disease, \n     suppress internal research and engage in 116 ``racketeering \n     acts'' of mail and wire fraud, which included advertisements \n     and press releases the companies knew to be false.\n       A few weeks ago, the administration announced another large \n     lawsuit, this one against America's gun manufacturers. \n     Justice couldn't argue that the gun makers had conspired to \n     mislead the public about the danger of their products, so it \n     decided against using RICO in favor of offering ``legal \n     advice'' to public housing authorities organized under the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, who are suing \n     the gun makers on behalf of their three million tenants. The \n     basis of this case is strict liability and negligence. The \n     gun makers allegedly sold defective products, or products \n     they knew or should have known would harm people.\n       Both of these legal grounds--the mobster-like conspiracy of \n     cigarette manufacturers to mislead the public, and the \n     defective aspects of guns or the negligence of their \n     manufacturers--are stretches, to say the least. If any \n     agreement to mislead any segment of the public is a \n     ``conspiracy'' under RICO, then America's entire advertising \n     industry is in deep trouble, not to mention health \n     maintenance organizations, the legal profession, automobile \n     dealers and the Pentagon. And if every product that might \n     result in death or serious injury is ``defective,'' you might \n     as well say goodbye to liquor and beer, fatty foods and sharp \n     cooking utensils.\n       These two novel legal theories give the administration \n     extraordinary discretion to decide who's misleading the \n     public and whose products are defective. You might approve \n     the outcomes in these two cases, but they establish \n     precedents for other cases you might find wildly unjust.\n       Worse, no judge will ever scrutinize these theories. The \n     administration has no intention of seeing these lawsuits \n     through to final verdicts. The goal of both efforts is to \n     threaten the industries with such large penalties that \n     they'll agree to a deal--for the cigarette makers, to pay a \n     large amount of money to the federal government, coupled \n     perhaps with a steep increase in the price of a pack of \n     cigarettes; and for the gun makers, to limit bulk purchases \n     and put more safety devices on guns. In announcing the \n     lawsuit against the gun makers, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo \n     assured the press that the whole effort was just a bargaining \n     ploy: ``If all parties act in good faith we'll stay at the \n     negotiating table.''\n       But the biggest problem is that these lawsuits are end runs \n     around the democratic process. We used to be a nation of \n     laws, but this new strategy presents novel means of \n     legislating--within settlement negotiations of large civil \n     lawsuits initiated by the executive branch. This is faux \n     legislation, which sacrifices democracy to the discretion of \n     administration officials operating in secrecy.\n       It's one thing for cities and states to go to court (big \n     tobacco has already agreed to pay the states $246 billion to \n     settle state Medicaid suits, and 28 cities along with New \n     York state and Connecticut are now suing the gun \n     manufacturers; it's quite another for the feds to bring to \n     bear the entire weight of the nation. New York state isn't \n     exactly a pushover, but its attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, \n     says the federal lawsuit will finally pressure gun makers to \n     settle. New York's lawsuit is a small dagger, he says. ``The \n     feds' is a meat ax.''\n       The feds' meat ax may be a good way to get an industry to \n     shape up, but its a bad way to get democracy to shape up. \n     Yes, American politics is rotting. Special-interest money is \n     oozing over Capitol Hill. The makers of cigarettes and guns \n     have enormous clout in Washington, and they are bribing our \n     elected representatives to turn their backs on these \n     problems.\n       But the way to fix everything isn't to turn our backs on \n     the democratic process and pursue litigation, as the \n     administration is doing. It's to campaign for people who \n     promise to take action against cigarettes and guns, and \n     against the re-election of House and Senate members who \n     won't. And to fight like hell for campaign finance reform. In \n     short, the answer is to make democracy work better, not to \n     give up on it.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \none of President Obama's most controversial nominees, Mr. Jack \nMcConnell, who has been nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island.\n  He has dedicated his professional career, and enriched himself in the \nprocess, by bringing dubious mass tort litigation. I believe he has \ndemonstrated a result-oriented view of the law. He has repeatedly \ndemonstrated that he is highly partisan. And given his history of \nintemperate and highly partisan remarks, I do not believe he is capable \nof being an impartial jurist.\n  First, Mr. McConnell is an active partisan, a little more so than \nmost nominees recently before the Senate. Mr. McConnell and his wife \nhave donated at\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nleast $700,000 to elect Democrats, over $160,000 in 2008 alone. He has \nserved as treasurer of the Rhode Island Democratic State Committee. He \nis a member of Amnesty International USA and has served as a director \nat Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island. Partisan political activity is \nnot disqualifying on its own. My concern is that Mr. McConnell is so \nsteeped in political activity and ideology that it may be impossible \nfor him to be an impartial jurist--even if he earnestly believes that \nhe can.\n  We can legitimately question whether his partisanship will influence \nhis judicial philosophy. He has made a number of sharp partisan \npolitical statements, including one in which he indicated that only \nDemocrats fight for ``economic and social justice and opportunity for \nall.'' He has called for a more ``active government'' and \nredistribution of wealth, and claimed that ``health care should be a \nright of citizenship.'' When Republican Gov. Lincoln Almond kept the \nRhode Island government open during a snowstorm in 1996, Mr. McConnell \ncommented to the press that the decision was ``typical of the cold-\nhearted Republican attitude of disregarding workers' needs.'' He went \non to argue against the Governor's appeal to the cost efficiency of \nkeeping agencies open by saying that ``[we] could bring child labor \nback, which would be cheaper, too.''\n  Mr. McConnell has often portrayed his mass tort cases as movements \nagainst societal injustices. He has said that these cases represent \n``wrongs that need to be righted and that is how I see the law.'' He \nhas said that he is ``an emotional person about injustice at any \nlevel--personal, societal, global.'' These statements indicate an \nactivist viewpoint. This is not what I want in a Federal judge.\n  Second, Mr. McConnell has a view of the law that I believe is outside \nthe mainstream of legal thought. Much of McConnell's career has been \ndevoted to bringing some of the most controversial mass tort litigation \nof recent years. He has pursued the manufacturers of asbestos, tobacco, \nand lead paint, whose actions he believes to be ``unjust.'' In bringing \nmany of these cases, Mr. McConnell has often stretched legal argument \nbeyond its breaking point. An example is the ``public nuisance'' theory \nhe pursued in the Rhode Island lead paint case. Well-respected \nattorneys have said Mr. McConnell's theory ``just [did not] mesh with \ncenturies of Anglo-American law'' and a former attorney general called \nthe lead-paint cases ``a lawsuit in search of a legal theory.''\n  The Rhode Island Supreme Court unanimously ruled against him in State \nv. Lead Industries Associates, Inc. In a well-reasoned opinion, the \ncourt found that there was no set of facts that he could have proven to \nestablish that the defendants were liable in public nuisance.\n  Mr. McConnell's reaction to that opinion illustrates my third major \nconcern--that he lacks appropriate judicial temperament. Although the \nopinion was based firmly in the law, Mr. McConnell saw fit to publicly \nand harshly criticize the court's decision in a Providence Journal \neditorial. But his criticism made little reference to points of law. \nRather, his major complaint was simply that, in his view, ``justice was \nnot served.'' His op-ed lambasted the court for ``let[ting] wrongdoers \noff the hook.'' Not only were these statements intemperate, even for an \nadvocate, but they reflect a results-oriented view of judging. Mr. \nMcConnell did not focus on the court's analysis or argue that it \nwrongly applied the law. He argued that the ``wrongdoers'' weren't \npunished. In other words, the result didn't fit with his notion of \njustice, so it was the wrong result.\n  Mr. McConnell was also deeply involved in State lawsuits against \ntobacco companies. However, beyond litigation, he has shown an open \nhostility to tobacco companies. He told the press in 1999 that he would \n``like Congress to put the Cigarette makers out of business.'' He has \neven gone so far as to compare people who opposed smoking bans in \nrestaurants to the supporters of racial segregation, saying ``some \npeople might like having all-White restaurants so they don't have to \nsit with Blacks, but we don't allow it.''\n  A fourth concern relates to the manner in which Mr. McConnell \nconducts his business. I am not suggesting illegal or unethical \nbehavior, but it is a bit unseemly. He and his firm, Motley Rice, have \noften brought these controversial mass tort litigations cases while \nrepresenting State attorneys general on no-bid contingency fee \ncontracts. According to an April 24, 2009, Wall Street Journal \neditorial:\n\n       Mr. McConnell and his firm helped pioneer the practice of \n     soliciting public officials to bring lawsuits in which \n     private lawyers are paid a percentage of any judgment or \n     settlement. The law firms front the costs of litigation and \n     are compensated if the suit is successful. But such \n     contingency-fee arrangements inevitably raise questions of \n     pay to play. And private lawyers with state power and a \n     financial stake in the outcome of a case can't be counted on \n     to act in the interest of justice alone.\n\n  There are numerous examples of campaign contributions by Mr. \nMcConnell and/or his wife in States where he or his firm was conducting \nor soliciting litigation. These include Rhode Island, Ohio, Washington, \nVermont, and North Dakota.\n  In another instance, as part of a settlement in the Rhode Island lead \npaint case, DuPont was to pay $2.5 million to the International \nMesothelioma Program at a Boston hospital, which is run by a former \nMotley Rice expert asbestos witness, Dr. David J. Sugarbaker. According \nto press reports, the payment was intended to satisfy a $3 million \npledge previously made by Motley Rice to Dr. Sugarbaker to secure a \nseat on the executive advisory board of the program.\n  My problem with this is the way the facts have dribbled out and the \nspin that Mr. McConnell has tried to put on this payment. Although both \nRhode Island and DuPont claimed that the agreement was not a legal \nsettlement, the agreement involved a commitment by DuPont to contribute \nover $12 million to charity and a commitment by the State of Rhode \nIsland to dismiss the case against DuPont. DuPont refused to pay any \nattorneys' fees because they were disputing the permissibility of the \nState's use of private counsel on a no-bid contingency-fee contract. \nNonetheless, DuPont agreed to make a sizeable donation to charity to \nsettle the case.\n  In my view, the donation to the Boston hospital is highly suspect. \nSettlement money that was supposed to help reduce lead poisoning in \nRhode Island in effect was diverted to offset a debt of Mr. McConnell's \nlaw firm. The chairman of the Rhode Island Republican Party described \nthe problem as follows: ``McConnell's law firm had a $3 million \nobligation to a Boston hospital, and so as part of the settlement, $2.5 \nmillion of that obligation was paid by DuPont.''\n  Mr. McConnell does not dispute this characterization of the $2.5 \nmillion payment. Despite claims by Attorney General Lynch that the \npayment would not satisfy Motley Rice's obligation to the hospital, he \nsaid ``I don't see why it shouldn't, and I don't see anything nefarious \nor wrong with that.'' The controversy regarding the settlement \nintensified when attorneys from another firm who had worked on the case \non a contingency fee basis disputed the payment, claiming it was a \n``legal fee'' that they were not being allowed to share in.\n  Fifth, I am concerned that Mr. McConnell has approached this \nconfirmation process with either a lack of diligence or a lack of \ncandor. I am particularly troubled by the way Mr. McConnell handled \nhimself before the committee. I believe Mr. McConnell, at best, misled \nthe committee when he testified about his familiarity with a set of \nstolen legal documents that his law firm obtained during the lead paint \nlitigation. When asked about these documents during his committee \nhearing, he testified that he saw the documents ``briefly,'' but that \nhe was not familiar with them ``in any fashion.''\n  But several months after his hearing, Mr. McConnell was deposed, \nunder oath, about those same documents. In his sworn deposition, Mr. \nMcConnell testified that he was the first lawyer to receive the \ndocuments. He drafted a newspaper editorial citing information that \ncame directly from those documents. He testified that he reviewed and \nsigned a legal brief that incorporated the stolen documents. And, even \nthough he told the committee that he was not familiar with the \ndocuments ``in any fashion,'' during his deposition he testified that \nhe did not see any indication on the documents that\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nthey were confidential or secret. How could he know the documents were \nnot confidential or secret, if, as he testified before the committee, \nhe was not familiar with them ``in any fashion''? Given these facts, it \nis hard to square Mr. McConnell's testimony before the committee with \nhis sworn deposition testimony a couple months later.\n  The litigation over these documents remains ongoing. We do not know \nhow it will conclude. We do not know whether Mr. McConnell and his law \nfirm will be held liable for the theft of these documents. But what is \nthe Senate going to do if we confirm this individual, and at some later \ndate he or his law firm is found liable for theft? At that point, it \nwill be too late. Members will not be able to reconsider their votes. \nThe Wall Street Journal recently opined that Mr. McConnell's ``changing \nstory about his lead paint advocacy is enough by itself to disqualify \nhim from the bench.'' I could not agree more.\n  In another instance, I asked in written questions the degree of \nawareness or notification that he or his law firm had regarding rallies \nthat were held outside or near the Superior Court in Providence during \nthe lead-paint trials in September 2002. He replied ``None.'' However, \nthere is email traffic that indicates Mr. McConnell was, in fact, aware \nof the demonstrations. This email was produced in the lead paint \nlitigation as part of Sherwin Williams's motion for a new trial. In \nother words, Mr. McConnell and his firm had this in their possession \nwhen he was asked about it by the committee.\n  Inconsistent answers were provided with regard to Mr. McConnell's \nrelationship with the ACLU as well. In response to the question ``Did \nyou, in fact, represent the ACLU in the matter?'' Mr. McConnell said \n``I entered an appearance as counsel.'' Yet in response to another \nquestion regarding any matters in which he provided legal services to \nthe ACLU or any affiliate thereof, he replied, ``I have never provided \nlegal services to the ACLU or any affiliate thereof.'' I find this \nanswer confusing at best.\n  These types of responses indicate, at a minimum, a careless approach \nin his response to the legitimate inquiries of this committee. They \ncould also be viewed as indicating a lack of candor. Either way, they \ndo not reflect the standard we should expect from an individual who \nseeks confirmation to the Federal judiciary.\n  These concerns lead me to believe this nominee is not qualified to \nserve as a U.S. district judge. Finally, I note Mr. McConnell received \na low rating from the ABA--a rating of substantial majority qualified, \nminority not qualified.\n  My concerns are shared by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and I take \ntheir views very seriously because the Chamber only rarely takes \npositions on judicial nominations. In a letter to this committee, the \nChamber wrote:\n\n       Mr. McConnell's actions during his career as a personal \n     injury lawyer and past statements demonstrate his disregard \n     for the rule of law, an activist judicial philosophy and \n     obvious bias against businesses.\n\n  For the reasons I have articulated--one, his active partisanship \nwhich I believe he will carry with him into the judiciary; two, his \nlegal theories being outside the mainstream; three, his lack of \njudicial temperament; four, his questionable business practices; and \nfive, his lack of candor with the committee--and other concerns which I \nhave not expressed today, I shall oppose this nomination.\n  I will conclude by saying this. I have supported the overwhelming \nmajority of President Obama's judicial nominees. If it were up to me, I \nwould not have nominated many of those individuals, but I supported \nthem nonetheless. Mr. McConnell is in an entirely different category. I \nbelieve he misled the committee when he testified before us. For that \nreason alone, I do not think he should be rewarded with a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench. Even if I did not have that concern, \nI could not support this nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate took a step \ntoward restoring a longstanding tradition of deference to home state \nSenators with regard to Federal District Court nominations. The Senate \nturned away from what Senator Reed rightly called a precipice. Eleven \nRepublican Senators joined in voting to end a filibuster of the \nnomination of Jack McConnell to the District Court for the District of \nRhode Island. A supermajority of the Senate came together to reject a \nnew standard, which I believe is being unfairly applied to President \nObama's district court nominees. Now, more than a year after his \nnomination, nearly a year after his confirmation hearing, and after \nhaving had his nomination reported positively by a bipartisan majority \nof the Judiciary Committee three times, the nomination of Jack \nMcConnell will finally have an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  The Senate should have debate on judicial nominations, and Senators \nshould be free to vote for or against any nomination. A few hours ago \nthe Senate voted to invoke cloture and now we are proceeding to hold a \nfinal confirmation vote on this nomination.\n  There was no need for cloture to be filed on this nomination. There \nwere no ``extraordinary circumstances'' that held up this nomination \nfor over a year. Why was the Senate not able to reach a time agreement \nto debate and vote on this nomination last year? It was the obstruction \nthat prevented us from doing so. It was wrong for the Senate to knuckle \nunder to business lobbies and it was right for the Senate to reject \nthat opposition.\n  In fact, in the days leading up to the filibuster vote and in the \nhours since, no great number of Senators has spoken in opposition to \nthis nomination. Only a handful of Senators from the minority \nleadership spoke at all. Only one such Senator has spoken in opposition \nsince cloture was invoked.\n  With judicial vacancies at crisis levels, affecting the ability of \ncourts to provide justice to Americans around the country, we should be \ndebating and voting on each of the 13 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. No one should be playing partisan games and \nobstructing while vacancies remain above 90 in the Federal courts \naround the country. With one out of every nine Federal judgeships still \nvacant, and judicial vacancies around the country at 93, there is \nserious work to be done.\n  I will support the nomination of Jack McConnell, just as I have each \nof the three times it was before the Judiciary Committee. Mr. McConnell \nis an outstanding lawyer. He is supported by his home State Senators, \nSenator Reed and Senator Whitehouse. Each has spoken passionately and \npersuasively in support of his nomination.\n  As I noted earlier, Mr. McConnell's nomination has been reported by a \nbipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee three times. His \nnomination also has bipartisan support from those in his home State. \nLeading Republican figures in Rhode Island have endorsed his \nnomination. They include First Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Bruce \nSelya; Warwick Mayor Scott Avedisian; Rhode Island Chief Justice Joseph \nWeisberger; former Rhode Island Attorneys General Jeffrey Pine and \nArlene Violet; former Director of the Rhode Island Department of \nBusiness Barry Hittner; former Rhode Island Republican Party Vice-Chair \nJohn M. Harpootian; and Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Michael \nFisher.\n  The strident opposition to this nomination has been fueled by the \ncorporate lobby, who oppose Jack McConnell because he is a good lawyer. \nThey oppose him because he successfully represented plaintiffs, \nincluding the State of Rhode Island, in lawsuits against lead paint \nmanufacturers. Some in the Senate may support the lead paint industry. \nSome in the Senate may oppose those who wish to hold lead paint \ncompanies accountable for poisoning children. That is their right. But \nas I said earlier in opposing the filibuster of this nomination, nobody \nshould oppose Mr. McConnell for doing what lawyers do--vigorously \nrepresent clients.\n  I also hope no Senator opposes this nomination based on what I \nbelieve to be a distortion of Mr. McConnell's testimony before the \ncommittee. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I take seriously the \nobligation of nominees appearing before the Committee to be truthful. I \nwould be the first Senator to raise an issue if there were any \nlegitimate question as to the accuracy of Mr. McConnell's testimony. \nBut there is not.\n  Far from establishing that Mr. McConnell was untruthful with the \ncommittee, the deposition transcript\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\ncited by some who oppose his nomination in fact validates Mr. \nMcConnell's testimony to the committee. There has been no inconsistency \nin Mr. McConnell's testimony, either to the committee or in sworn \ntestimony in a deposition. Jack McConnell is not a party to the \nlawsuit. He has been accused of no wrongdoing. There is no basis to \nbelieve that Mr. McConnell did not answer questions from members of the \ncommittee truthfully. Some Senators may feel strongly that Mr. \nMcConnell and his firm were wrong to sue lead paint companies, but \nthere is simply no basis for believing that Mr. McConnell was \nuntruthful with the committee. I hope other Senators will reject those \nconclusions.\n  With more than 25 years of experience as an outstanding litigator in \nprivate practice, Mr. McConnell has been endorsed by The Providence \nJournal, which wrote: ``In his legal work and community leadership [he] \nhas shown that he has the legal intelligence, character, compassion, \nand independence to be a distinguished jurist.'' This debate should \nfocus on Mr. McConnell's qualifications, experience, temperament, \nintegrity, and character. Any fair evaluation of his qualifications \nwould reveal a nominee worthy of confirmation.\n  I congratulate Jack McConnell and his family on his confirmation \ntoday. I commend Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse for their \nsteadfast support and all they have done to ensure that the Senate vote \non this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime postcloture be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination of John J. McConnell, Jr., to be a U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the District of Rhode Island; that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nomination; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; the Senate then resume legislative session and proceed \nto a period of morning business for debate only until 7:30 p.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is not going to surprise any of my \ncolleagues or the public at large that a lot of times I come to the \nSenate floor to speak about agriculture and to speak about ethanol. \nWhat brings me to the floor today is the ongoing crusade by the Wall \nStreet Journal, in an intellectually dishonest way, to put out a lot of \nfacts about ethanol that are not true.\n  The latest barrage comes from an interview published last Saturday in \nthe Wall Street Journal with C. Larry Pope, CEO of Smithfield Foods. In \nthis article, there are a lot of misstatements about ethanol and about \nethanol causing the price of food to rise dramatically. I take the \nfloor now to rebut some of those misstatements and also to set the \nrecord straight so that when a very fine CEO such as Mr. Pope, even \nthough I disagree with him on this article--he is a decent person, and \nhe is a good corporate executive--the next time, he will not speak. But \nI can also say I do not like to have confrontations with Smithfield \nFoods because they do provide a lot of good-paying jobs in the Middle \nWest, and they do a good job of adding value to agriculture.\n  There has been a tradition at Smithfield to kind of not appreciate \nAmerican agriculture. It goes back to some conversations I had with the \nprevious CEO by the name of Joe Luter. I remember Joe Luter coming to \nmy office to try to explain to me some things he thought I had \nmisinterpreted of what he was really talking about regarding the family \nfarmer and about the production of hogs and whether he was wanting to \nput the family farmer out of business.\n  I remember just as if it was said to me yesterday a statement he made \nwhen I said: You are running the family farmer, the family producer, \nthe independent producer out of the hog business, and you want to \ncontrol everything. He said to me something along the lines: I do not \nwant to put your farmers out of business; I just want them feeding my \npigs. He was basically saying he wanted the family farmer to be an \nemployee of Smithfield and not be an independent producer.\n  Another point he tried to argue with me--and I am referring to Mr. \nPope's predecessor, Mr. Luter--he also argued that Iowa farmers in a \nsense were not smart enough to run a packing plant. In fact, he offered \nto give a plant to a group of farmers and guaranteed it would be out of \nbusiness within 6 months.\n  I do not know whether I have fault with Mr. Pope as CEO of Smithfield \nand ethanol in this case as opposed to Mr. Luter, his predecessor, and \nwho is going to raise pigs, but there may be an institutional bias \nwithin the corporation of Smithfield.\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\n  Anyway, with that as background, I want to go to this article I \npointed out that was in the Wall Street Journal. The article says: ``It \nis Getting Hard to Bring Home the Bacon.'' Basically, what the paper is \nsaying in that headline is that because so much corn is used for \nethanol, we are raising the price of corn and that is driving up the \nprice of food.\n  Well, I am on the floor to say that is a bunch of hogwash. This \narticle was in the April 30 edition of the Wall Street Journal, so if \npeople want to read it and check it against what I have to say, I am \nhappy to provide that information. The article was based on an \ninterview with C. Larry Pope, CEO of Smithfield Foods, the largest pork \nproducer and the largest pork processor.\n  The opinion piece was intended to share Mr. Pope's view on rising \nfood prices and also on the price of pork. Mr. Pope puts much of the \nblame on the Federal ethanol program. But I wish to address a number of \nthe claims made by Mr. Pope, and claims made in the opinion piece \npresumably based on statements by Mr. Pope.\n  Mr. Pope claims, and I quote:\n\n       Now, 40 percent of the corn crop is directed to ethanol, \n     which equals the amount that is going into livestock food.\n\n  Right there, statistically, he is wrong. Let me point out how he is \nwrong. In 2010, 4.65 billion bushels of corn were used to produce 13 \nbillion gallons of ethanol. But ethanol production uses only the starch \nfrom a corn kernel. So I want to hold up a bag of corn kernels. It \nwould be better if I brought in an ear of corn, but this is the best \nway to transport it. These are corn kernels.\n  When ethanol uses only the starch from the corn kernel, the result is \nthat more than one-third, or 1.4 billion bushels of corn--and it is \ncalled dried distiller's grain, and this is what dried distiller's \ngrain is--was available as a high-value livestock feed. In fact, what \nis left over after you produce ethanol is of much more value than if \nyou would take the original corn kernels and use that by itself for \nanimal feed.\n  Let's go back to that quote.\n\n       Now, 40 percent of the corn crop is directed to ethanol, \n     which equals the amount that is going into livestock food.\n\n  Well, on a net basis now, ethanol production used only 23 percent of \nthe U.S. corn crop--far less than the 40 percent that ethanol \ndetractors claim. So once again, you have a bushel of corn--56 pounds. \nOut of that 56 pounds of corn, you get 2.8 gallons of ethanol. When you \nget done making the ethanol, you have 18 pounds of dried distiller's \ngrain that is left over. Anybody who isn't ignorant about ethanol \nunderstands there is still an animal feed product left over. So you \ncan't say you are making ethanol out of corn and using it all for \nethanol and nothing for food, because this is a very efficient process.\n  By the way, let me say this. You can tell about the ignorance over \nethanol in this town because a lot of people pronounce it E-E-E-T-H-A-\nN-O-L. It is ethanol. But people who are ignorant about it don't even \nknow how to pronounce it. I don't know whether Mr. Pope pronounced it \nright or not.\n  According to the USDA, feed use consumes 37 percent of the U.S. corn \nsupply, much more than the 23 percent consumed by ethanol production. \nSo I hope Mr. Pope will put that in his pipe and smoke it, because he \nis wrong on that point. Ethanol is not diverting corn away from feed \nuse.\n  Next, Mr. Pope claims:\n\n       Ethanol policy has impacted the world price of corn.\n\n  I am glad Mr. Pope raised that issue. He clearly has no idea how \nlittle an impact ethanol has on the global grain market. In fact, U.S. \nethanol use represents a mere 3 percent of the world's supply of coarse \ngrain. In addition, the global grain supply in 2010 to 2011 is 11 \npercent larger than the 2000 to 2001 supply.\n  U.S. farmers happen to be the most productive in the world. Since \n1975, American farmers have doubled U.S. corn production from under 6 \nbillion bushels to over 12 billion bushels last year, and they have \ndone it using essentially the same number of acres. Corn farmers today \ngrow five times as much corn as they did in 1930 on 20 percent less \nland.\n  So for all those people out there who think there isn't enough \nproductivity in the American farmer or in our land or in the efficiency \nof producing, I hope you understand that we are producing five times \nmore corn than we did in 1930 but doing it on 20 percent less land. Let \nme explain it another way. In 1910, you know what powered agriculture? \nHorses and mules. And in that day, it took 90 million acres of land to \ngrow the food to keep the animals that powered agriculture alive and \nproductive. That 90 million acres is equal almost to the 92 million \nacres that will be planted to corn in the United States this year.\n  Farmers are continuing to meet the growing demand of ethanol, \nlivestock feed, and exports. So I hope that Mr. Pope will put that in \nhis pipe and smoke it, because he needs to understand how productive \nthe American grain farmer is.\n  The author of the opinion piece then makes a claim that has \nabsolutely no basis in fact, so I guess I can't attribute this to Mr. \nPope. The article states:\n\n       The EPA has found ethanol production has a neutral to \n     negative impact on the environment.\n\n  I have always said that ethanol is good for the environment, but here \nwe have the EPA being quoted stating it has a neutral to negative \nimpact on the environment. The fact is, under the renewable fuels \nstandard created in 2007, corn ethanol was required to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline by at least 20 percent. \nCorn ethanol has exceeded that threshold. In other words, the law says \nsuch and such, and ethanol exceeds what the law even requires.\n  A reduction of more than 20 percent compared to gasoline is not \nneutral. So the EPA has found ethanol production has neutral to \nnegative impact on the environment. Not so. If you remove EPA's use of \nmurky science surrounding emissions from what is called indirect land \nuse--and that is kind of complicated, so I won't go into that--ethanol \nreduces greenhouse gas emissions by 48 percent compared to gasoline.\n  I have heard Senators in the last 2 months on the floor of the Senate \ntelling all of us that ethanol was bad for the environment, but a \nrecent peer-reviewed study published in the Yale Journal of Industrial \nEcology--all those Ivy League people in the Senate ought to have some \nallegiance to anything done by Yale University--says that ethanol \nreduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 59 percent compared to \ngasoline.\n  Mr. Pope also asserts that Pilgrim's Pride went bankrupt because of \nethanol. Pilgrim's Pride was a food processor. He stated:\n\n       The largest chicken processor in the United States, \n     Pilgrim's Pride, filed for bankruptcy. They couldn't raise \n     prices, so their cost of production went up dramatically.\n\n  Again, facts are stubborn things. On December 1, 2008, analysts cited \nthe primary cause of bankruptcy was their large debt load, the result \nof the acquisition of a $1.3 billion rival they purchased in 2007. \nOther factors included low chicken demand and prices resulting from the \nrecession and poor commodity hedging. But it had nothing to do with the \nprice of ethanol and corn prices being high. So I hope Mr. Pope will \nput that in his pipe and smoke it.\n  Another statement by Mr. Pope seems to place all the blame on corn \nfarmers for rising food prices. He said:\n\n       You eat eggs, you drink milk, you get a loaf of bread, and \n     you get a pound of meat. All of those are based on grains.\n\n  That last part of the statement is accurate. But let me tell you what \nis wrong with the relationship between rising food prices and the price \nof grain. Let us look at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The farm \nvalue of every food dollar is 19 cents. In other words, if you spend $1 \non food at the supermarket, only 19 cents of that goes into the pocket \nof the farmer. Of that 19 cents, the corn value of that farmer's income \nis 3 cents.\n  So let us look at some of these prices. You buy a box of corn \nflakes--12.9 ounces. Only 5.6 cents goes to a farmer if the corn is $4 \na bushel. If corn is $6 a bushel, the farmer gets 8.6 cents out of a \nwhole package of corn flakes.\n  Soft drinks: $4 a bushel, the farmer gets 6.6 cents. If it is $6 a \nbushel, he gets 10 cents.\n  Beef: The farmer gets 18.2 cents at the low end of corn prices, and \n27.8 cents at the higher end.\n  I could go on with pork and chicken and turkey and eggs and milk. But \nthe\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\npoint is, don't blame the farmer when you buy a box of corn flakes \nbecause the farmer gets a little over a nickel, or at most, if corn is \nhigher priced, 8.6 cents. So the farmer gets 19 cents in a global way. \nCorn only accounts for 3 cents out of $1 of food that you buy. The \nother 81 cents of that $1 goes to labor, goes to energy, goes to \ntransportation, goes to marketing, and goes to packaging.\n  The World Bank, in 2008, stated that biofuels were a large \ncontributor to rising food prices. And you know what, 2 years later, in \n2010, they released a more thorough analysis that essentially dismissed \nthat idea. So I want to quote from the World Bank report.\n\n       . . . the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as \n     large as originally thought. . . . the use of commodities by \n     financial investors may have been partly responsible for the \n     2007-2008 spike.\n\n  So, for Mr. Pope, I hope he puts that in his pipe and smokes it \nbecause he is wrong about the amount of corn and the price of corn and \nthe impact on food prices, and the World Bank dismisses that as well. \nWe even have the United Kingdom--I like to say Great Britain instead of \nUnited Kingdom--their Department for Environment, Food and Rural \nAffairs concluded in 2010 that ``available evidence suggests that \nbiofuels had a relatively small contribution to the 2008 spike in \nagricultural commodity prices.''\n  In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office evaluated the increasing \ndemand for corn to produce ethanol on food prices. Maybe I better start \nwith the 5.1-percent increase in food prices for the year 2009. Of that \n5.1 percent, just one-half of 1 percent, between that and eight-tenths \nof 1 percent--I better say it more accurately. We have a 5.1-percent \nincrease in food prices. Only one-half percent, maybe up to .8 percent \nof that 5.1 percent was due to the demand for ethanol, and about 10 \npercent of just the increased price of food was because of ethanol.\n  In 2007, Informa Economics concluded that ``it is statistically \nunsupported to suggest that high and/or rising corn prices are the \ncausative reason behind high and rising retail meat, egg and milk \nprices.''\n  Another point raised in this article by Mr. Pope needs to be \naddressed. He said, ``Over the last several years, the cost of corn has \ngone from a base of $2.40 a bushel to today at $7.40 a bushel.'' While \ntrue, this all needs to be put in context. Over that same period of \ntime, crude oil prices went from $50 a barrel to nearly $150 a barrel. \nToday, it is over $110 a barrel. Gold prices went from $500 an ounce to \n$1,500 an ounce today.\n  Mr. Pope would rather pay $2.40 a bushel for corn rather than $7.40. \nI understand that. But does he know what impact that would have on \nagriculture? If corn were only $2.40 a bushel, every farmer today would \nbe out of business because the cost of production is around $4 a \nbushel.\n  I can see he wants the farmers to subsidize Smithfield if he wants to \ncontinue getting corn for $2.40 a bushel, but a farmer cannot subsidize \nthe big corporations. Perhaps Mr. Pope would rather have us support \ngovernment subsidies so long as they would allow him to buy corn below \nthe cost of production.\n  I can tell you this: A lot of people say ethanol is the reason corn \nprices are high. It might be part of the reason. But let's suppose you \ndidn't have any ethanol and you had $2.40 a bushel for corn. You know \ndarn well that a lot more would be coming out of the Treasury to make \nsure the safety net for the family farmer was working than we give for \nan ethanol subsidy.\n  Regardless, at $7.40 a bushel, the corn costs in a gallon of milk is \nabout 46 cents; the cost of corn in a pound of chicken is about 34 \ncents; 1 pound of beef takes about 92 cents worth of corn; and relative \nto Smithfield because they are big in pork, 1 pound of pork requires \nabout 39 cents of corn. So if that $4.54-a-pound for bacon in the \ngrocery aisle contains only 39 cents worth of corn, perhaps Mr. Pope \nshould explain to all of us--and, most important, to the people who buy \nit, the consumer--where the other $4.15 or 91 percent of the retail \ncost is going.\n  In addition, after the steep rise in commodities in 2008, prices of \ncorn and other commodities retreated very significantly. I don't recall \nseeing from people like Smithfield, that when corn was $7 3 years ago \nand it went down to $3.58--I didn't see a very dramatic drop in prices \nat the grocery store after the corn prices dropped, which leads me, as \nI have so often said on the floor of the Senate, that these food \nprocessors need to scapegoat something to increase the price of their \nproduct to the retailer and the consumer. Then when the price goes \ndown, they have increased their price but the price doesn't go down \naccordingly.\n  Mr. Pope claims rising corn prices are hurting his business. He said, \n``Rising prices are already squeezing food producers 2 to 3 percent \nearnings margins.'' That is his quote. The statement is rather \nsurprising given the contradictory earnings report for Smithfield Foods \nthat came out March 10, 2011. Smithfield reported net income for the \nquarter of $202 million, an increase of $165 million over the same \nquarter in 2010. Mr. Pope stated at the time of the earnings report: \n``We are extremely pleased with the record performance of our company \nin the third quarter. Year to date, our earnings have surpassed that of \nour record year.''\n  The reality of Smithfield's record profits fails to validate the \nrhetoric. According to the article--and here I am quoting the article \nand not Mr. Pope:\n\n       Smithfield's economists estimate corn prices would fall by \n     a dollar a bushel if ethanol blending wasn't subsidized.\n\n  I guess if it is Smithfield's economists, it must be coming directly \nfrom the company, then. Smithfield may want to invest, then, in better \neconomists.\n  According to an April 2011 study issued by the Center for \nAgricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University, only 14 \ncents or 8 percent of the increase in corn prices from 2006 to 2009 was \ndue to ethanol subsidies. The study also found that without the ethanol \nsubsidy, corn prices would have averaged only 4 percent less over the \nsame period of time.\n  Finally, the article calls into question the value of ethanol to our \nNation's energy supply. It states:\n\n       The ethanol industry would supply only 4 percent of the \n     nation's annual energy needs even if it used 100 percent of \n     the corn crop.\n\n  This is a straw man. No one is arguing that ethanol will replace our \nNation's entire energy needs. Using just 23 percent of the corn crop, \nwe are displacing nearly 10 percent of our Nation's foreign oil \ndependence. Domestic ethanol production ranks behind only the United \nStates and Canadian oil production in terms of domestic transportation \nfuel supply.\n  It is obvious that Saturday's opinion piece in the Wall Street \nJournal was just another coordinated effort to undermine and scapegoat \nhomegrown ethanol and America's corn farmers to help deflect criticism \nfrom big food producers. Make no mistake, Smithfield's CEO, Larry Pope, \nis concerned with only one thing--Smithfield's bottom line.\n  While companies such as Smithfield perpetuate a smear campaign to \nboost their profits, American farmers and alternative-fuel producers \nare working hard to produce a reliable and safe supply of food, fiber, \nand feed for the Nation and the world.\n  That is the end of my reaction to what he, Mr. Pope, said, but I \nwould like to end by saying that the marketplace will take care of \nthis. You know, 30 years ago when we started an ethanol program, we \nproduced about 100 bushels of corn to the acre on average. Today, \nnationally, I think it is about 155 bushels of corn to the acre. In \nIowa, I think it is about 168; the year before, it was 182.\n  People who are experts in genetics can say we will be able to double \nthe production of corn over the next 50 years. That is one way we can \nsolve this problem. The other way is that there is a massive amount of \nland in a lot of places on this Earth, and a great part of it is in \nWest Africa, South Africa, and parts of East Africa, where, if people \nwould establish law guaranteeing property rights, title to land, there \nwould not be governmental disincentives to growing food, there would \nnot be a cheap food policy--there would be a massive production of \nfoodstuff in this world.\n  In the United States, we are going to continue to produce more. There \nare going to be 4 million more acres of corn grown this year than last \nyear.\n  There are even some odd things being done because the price of corn \nis $7.\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nFrom the Des Moines Register, this headline, from a northern small \ncommunity of Iowa: At the Whittemore Golf Club, the golf course is \ngoing to be plowed up and planted with corn. There are some extreme \nmeasures that will be taken here to respond to the demand for food or \nfiber or fuel.\n  Just remember, agriculture in America has the capability--the \ndemonstrated capability to produce it all. We don't grow crops just for \nfood. We have always grown for food and fiber, and for the last 30 \nyears, food, fiber, and fuel. We can continue to do it, and we are \ngoing to do it successfully, and the consumers of America are not going \nto pay for it. In fact, if we do not continue to do that and keep the \nfamily farmer of the United States healthy and strong--and ethanol is a \ncontribution to that--then we are not going to be able to meet the \nneeds of our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2679-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT CVAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute and bid a fond farewell to a remarkable \nphilanthropist, a proud Louisvillian, a great-grandmother of 29, and a \ndear friend. Sadly, Sara Shallenberger Brown--known by her friends as \n``Sally''--passed away this April 30 in Louisville, just after \ncelebrating her 100th birthday on April 14.\n  Sally was more than just a leading citizen of Louisville and of \nKentucky--she was a driving force of nature. Through her energy, \nspirit, and great generosity, she made our city and our Commonwealth \nbetter places to live.\n  Sally led a life that would not seem out of place in an epic movie or \nnovel. Born in Valdez, AK, in 1911, her father was a brigadier general \nwho fought in France during World War I and served with generals \nPershing and Patton. In 1931, Sally visited a friend from college in \nLouisville, and here she met her future husband, W.L. Lyons Brown. When \nLyons soon after wrote Sally's parents to tell them he was naming a \nrace horse ``Sally Shall,'' they knew it had been love at first sight.\n  The couple made their home in Louisville, where he was the president \nand chairman of Brown-Forman Corp., a Louisville-based company for over \n140 years and one of the largest American-owned spirits and wine \ncompanies. Sally became a generous benefactor to Louisville \ninstitutions such as the Speed Museum, Locust Grove, the Actors Theatre \nof Louisville and Waterfront Park.\n  She was instrumental in preserving Locust Grove, the final home of \nLouisville founder George Rogers Clark. Where the home had once been \nabandoned and in ill repair, today it is a museum and National Historic \nLandmark.\n  Sally cared deeply and throughout her long life for conservation and \npreservation. She founded a conservation program to preserve the \nnatural beauty of the Kentucky River. She advocated for the \npreservation of federal national wildlife refuges, and was present at \nthe bill signing by President Jimmy Carter that saw the culmination of \nher efforts. She was a delegate to U.N. conferences, and traveled \ninternationally to promote wildlife conservation.\n  But most of all, Sally will be remembered for her enjoyment of life. \nShe loved to be outdoors, working on her farm. Even in her later years \nyou could often see her riding around on top of her tractor. She was an \nartist, designer, and breeder of cattle, thoroughbreds and Cavalier \nKing Charles spaniels.\n  Sally inspired her family, friends and all who knew her as she forged \nahead with her many philanthropic and intellectual interests, all while \nsetting the example as the matriarch of the Brown family since her \nhusband's passing in 1973. Together they had four children, 12 \ngrandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren, and I want to express my \ncondolences to them and other family members at this great woman's \npassing.\n  Mr. President, the Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an \neditorial celebrating the life of Sally Brown. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was printed as follows:\n\n           [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, May 2, 2011]\n\n                     Sally Brown: A Force of Nature\n\n       Five years ago, when Kentucky Educational Television \n     produced a documentary about her life, Sara Shallenberger \n     Brown was called ``a force of nature.''\n       For most of the century through which she lived, she was \n     precisely that. And with her death on Saturday, the \n     environmental movement and the community have lost a \n     remarkable leader.\n       The daughter of an Army general who fought alongside George \n     Patton in World War II, Mrs. Brown witnessed important events \n     in history at close range. Born in Valdez, Alaska, in 1911, \n     decades later she would become a leader in the drive to save \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and stood \n     beside President Jimmy Carter when he signed the act \n     protecting it in 1980.\n       Widowed for almost 40 years from distillery executive W.L. \n     Lyons Brown, Sr., she rejected a comfortable, quiet life and \n     became an advocate for all sorts of causes related to the \n     environment. She traveled to Frankfort to testify about the \n     perils of strip mining and always came armed with a battery \n     of facts, which she eloquently expressed in precise terms.\n       She often said that to succeed as an advocate on political \n     issues a woman needs to ``act like a lady, look like a girl, \n     think like a man, and work like a dog.''\n       Besides her crusades, Sally Brown enjoyed life. She loved \n     to ride, shoot and take care of her farm. She was as much at \n     home on her tractor as she was in the corridors of power. She \n     took pleasure in the accomplishments of her children and \n     grandchildren and always challenged those she knew to push \n     harder.\n       She lived well on a grand stage, and with her departure, \n     our city has lost one of its visionary leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2679-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2679-S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DAVID AND IRENE MORRIS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \naccomplishments of two of the most dedicated and hard-working citizens \nof the Commonwealth, David and Irene Morris of Hager Hill, KY. Working \nas a team of husband and wife, David and Irene have worked tirelessly \nover the years to strengthen and improve the manufacturing industry in \nJohnson County and throughout the State through their work at the \nAtlantic India Rubber Company.\n  Although Irene and David's native roots are in Michigan, the couple \nmoved to Kentucky when the Atlantic India Rubber Company, a 92-year-old \ncompany, moved its operations here from Illinois and Ohio in 2003. \nDavid and Irene were hired to oversee the day-to-day operations of the \nfacility. Their son and one other employee joined them on their move, \nand the rest of their employees were hired locally.\n  David and Irene's decision to take on their responsibilities as \nmanager and executive came at a time when the State's manufacturing job \nrate was on a steady decline. In recent years, Kentucky has lost too \nmany of its manufacturing jobs, with some especially hard-hit counties \nlosing as many as one-third of their manufacturing employers. But \nthanks to David and Irene, this was not to be in Johnson County. The \ncouple lived in their warehouse while trying to establish the business, \nand had to have machines shipped from other locations since the local \nbusiness community was geared more towards the coal industry than \nmanufacturing, but they succeeded. As only one of nine manufacturing \nemployers in the county, they have raised the local area's \nmanufacturing employment rate, and have helped keep jobs from drifting \noverseas.\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\n  Last spring, after the couple had poured nearly 10 years of their \nlives into building the company, then-owner Jim Green announced that he \nwould be retiring. With none of the interested buyers having ties to \nJohnson County, David and Irene knew what they had to do. Later that \nfall the couple announced they were the new owners of the Atlantic \nIndia Rubber Company.\n  Because of their purchase, the rubber parts used on Harley Davidson \nmotorcycles, Arctic Cat snowmobiles, and Boeing jets would still be \nmade in the heart of the Commonwealth, and eight hardworking people \nwould still have their jobs. With combined help from the Southeast \nKentucky Economic Development Corporation and the Mountain Association \nfor Community Economic Development, David and Irene secured a $1.3-\nmillion loan to buy the company and the location.\n  Irene once said that at first she was hesitant to take on her \nresponsibilities at Atlantic India Rubber Company for fear of failure. \nWell, as she discovered, along with her employees and the residents of \nJohnson County, failure was simply not in the cards for the Morrises. \nIt is people like them, who have extraordinary aspirations and faith in \nthemselves and in Kentucky, that continue to make the Commonwealth a \nthriving and positive place to work and live.\n  Mr. President, the Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an \narticle highlighting the impressive careers of David and Irene, and I \nask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was printed as follows:\n\n                   [From Kentucky.com, Jan. 29, 2011]\n\n    Johnson County Couple Buys Out Employer, Keeps Jobs in Kentucky\n\n                          (By Dori Hjalmarson)\n\n\n                   ky. manufacturing employment woes\n\n                Percent Change in Employment, 2005-2009\n\n       United States--16.8\n       Kentucky--18.6\n       Johnson Co.--11.6\n       --Kentucky Office of Employment and Training\n       Hager Hill.--Irene and David Morris could have packed up \n     and taken jobs elsewhere, maybe back home in Ohio or \n     Michigan, when the owner of the manufacturing company retired \n     and sold out. If that had happened, Atlantic India Rubber Co. \n     grommets and parts might be made in China now.\n       But the Morrises--working as manager and executive--decided \n     they'd poured nearly 10 years of their life into building the \n     factory in Johnson County.\n       They cared about their employees, all hired locally when \n     the 92-year-old company moved from Illinois and Ohio in 2003. \n     They cared that the rubber parts used on Harley Davidson \n     motorcycles and Arctic Cat snowmobiles and Boeing jets are \n     made in the U.S.A. They wanted to save their jobs. And \n     ultimately, Irene Morris said, the company survived ``one of \n     the toughest years ever'' for manufacturers, so ``we knew the \n     business was sound.''\n       So the couple, whose children are grown and whose only debt \n     was a mortgage and a car loan, borrowed nearly $1.3 million \n     to buy out their employer last summer.\n       ``When we came on board here, we ran it like it was ours. \n     We put a lot of ourselves into it,'' Irene Morris said.\n       ``I think we're proud of what we do here.''\n\n\n                     Kentucky's manufacturing slide\n\n       Many manufacturers haven't fared so well. Since 2005, \n     Kentucky has lost more than 18 percent of its manufacturing \n     jobs. Some counties have lost as many as a third of their \n     manufacturing employers and more than 60 percent of \n     manufacturing jobs, according to the Kentucky Office of \n     Employment and Training. The Morrises' purchase of Atlantic \n     India Rubber helped Johnson County buck that trend.\n       The company is one of nine manufacturing employers in the \n     county. Atlantic India's eight employees count for less than \n     10 percent of the 135-strong manufacturing labor force in the \n     county.\n       But since 2005, Johnson County's manufacturing employment \n     has grown by nearly 12 percent.\n       The rubber company has an old brand name, but before it \n     moved to Johnson County, it was really just a distributor. \n     Contractors made all the parts, Irene Morris said.\n       ``We were a start-up in the sense that for probably 30 or \n     maybe more years, it was maybe just a distribution center,'' \n     she said. ``Distribution isn't all that much cost to set up; \n     manufacturing is because you've got all your presses.\n       ``Coming into this area, that was probably one of the \n     biggest challenges we've had. No one in this area had \n     experience.''\n       They brought two employees from Michigan, including their \n     son, who now manages a restaurant in Paintsville. But they \n     hired the rest of their employees locally.\n       The Morrises worked to improve the quality of their \n     products and relationships with customers. Atlantic India's \n     owner, Jim Green, was a former Johnson Countian who knew the \n     area but lived in Florida. He trusted Irene and David Morris \n     to run the business as though it were their own.\n       Irene Morris said her husband, who had served in Germany \n     and Spain in the Army, was the one who talked her into \n     pulling up her Michigan roots to move to Johnson County in \n     the first place.\n       ``I didn't have a lot of faith in my ability,'' Irene \n     Morris said.\n       She had gone to college to be a social worker but got a job \n     as a trimmer at another rubber company. She has learned the \n     business from the ground up over 20 years. She and David met \n     working for the same rubber company, before they were hired \n     by Atlantic India.\n       There were advantages to working in Johnson County: Their \n     boss knew the area and wanted to move; costs were lower than \n     those in factory-saturated Ohio and Michigan; the small-town \n     atmosphere and cost of living appealed to the couple.\n       But there were problems, too. The local business community \n     isn't geared toward manufacturing.\n       ``In Michigan,'' David Morris said, parts makers used to be \n     so plentiful ``you could just go around the corner and find \n     what you need.''\n       Now, the Morrises need a tool-and-die maker, for example, \n     but the market is so geared toward the coal industry, they \n     aren't sure where to start looking locally. Also, they are \n     pleased that one of their Oregon contractors might be opening \n     up facilities in Ohio, cutting travel and distribution costs.\n       When they first moved to Hager Hill, Irene and David Morris \n     lived in their warehouse while trying to establish the \n     business. They had to have machines shipped in and find \n     workers they could train to run them.\n       They still feel like outsiders in Johnson County, but local \n     leaders have welcomed them, Irene Morris said. She has a \n     relationship with the local chamber of commerce, the judge-\n     executive, state representatives. She said she personally \n     knows the local UPS and FedEx workers, as well as bankers and \n     suppliers.\n       ``They made us feel like a big deal, even though we were \n     small,'' Irene Morris said.\n\n\n                           Hands-on managers\n\n       The Morrises were managers, but they knew every job in the \n     business and were hands-on. They filled in for their workers, \n     and they trained a press operator to fill in for them. They \n     bought a house and two cars, and their son eventually moved \n     on to other jobs.\n       ``We're just ordinary people,'' Irene Morris said. She \n     didn't have aspirations to ``get rich'' or even to own her \n     own business until a couple of years ago, when her boss \n     decided to retire and sell.\n       There were interested buyers, but none with ties to Johnson \n     County. The economy was starting to slide, manufacturing jobs \n     nationwide were disappearing, and the Atlantic India brand \n     might have been valuable enough to those outside buyers \n     without keeping the manufacturing in Kentucky.\n       A few years earlier, a major Johnson County manufacturer, \n     American Standard plumbing parts, had sent hundreds of jobs \n     to Mexico. The Morrises feared Atlantic India would have had \n     a similar fate.\n       The couple made contacts with local government and non-\n     profit groups, as well as the state Cabinet for Economic \n     Development.\n       The Morrises are part of a trend, said Economic Development \n     Commissioner Erik Dunnigan.\n       In 2010, 84 percent of job growth and investment growth \n     came from existing local companies, as opposed to companies \n     new to Kentucky: ``That's redirecting our efforts,'' Dunnigan \n     said.\n       In September 2009, Atlantic India started talking with \n     Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, a \n     Berea non-profit. MACED and Southeast Kentucky Economic \n     Development, a London non-profit, began the year-long process \n     to help Atlantic India secure nearly $1.3 million in \n     financing to buy the company and the building they were \n     leasing.\n       Irene Morris had to write an application for the loan, a \n     three-year forecast, growth projections and a business plan.\n       She said she knew the manufacturing side of her work, but \n     she had to learn quickly about the financial side.\n       Half of the loan came from a federal Small Business \n     Administration program handled by SKED: the other half came \n     from MACED. If the couple defaults, the organizations would \n     seize the business and property.\n       The feeling, when they signed their names to the loan, was \n     both empowerment and trepidation.\n       ``We've never been that far ever in debt,'' David Morris \n     said.\n       But he believed in his wife. Irene Morris is officially the \n     51 percent owner, which gives the company a leg up in some \n     contracts because it can call itself a ``woman-owned'' \n     business.\n       The fact that the Morrises know the business so well made \n     them good candidates for a loan, said Justin Maxson, \n     president of MACED.\n       Irene Morris said she might have given up trying to get the \n     loan if not for such encouragement from MACED and Southeast \n     Kentucky Economic Development.\n       When she's ready to retire in 20 years, Morris said, ``I \n     would like to see a couple of our employees be able to buy \n     the business.''\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2681-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n    Lieutenant Matthew Ira Lowe and Lieutenant Nathan Hollingsworth \n                                Williams\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to two dedicated Navy officers who were tragically \nkilled in a training accident in my home State of California.\n  LT Matthew Ira Lowe and LT Nathan Hollingsworth Williams died on \nApril 6, 2011, after their F/A-18F Super Hornet crashed near the \nLemoore Naval Air Station in central California. Lieutenants Lowe and \nWilliams were assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron VFA-122, based at \nLemoore Naval Air Station.\n  LT Matthew Ira Lowe of Plantation, FL, had a lifelong passion for \nflying. He received an engineering degree from the University of \nCentral Florida in 2001. While in college, he also earned his pilot's \nlicense. He later joined the Navy and received his commission through \nOfficer Candidate School in February 2003. Most recently, Lieutenant \nLowe served as an instructor, and had been training to become a pilot \nfor the elite Blue Angels exhibition team.\n  A decorated pilot who earned the Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal \nand the National Defense Service Medal, Lieutenant Lowe will be \nremembered by those who served with him for his sense of humor and \noutgoing personality. Lieutenant Lowe is survived by his parents Ira \nand Pamela Lowe, and two elder siblings. He was 33 years old.\n  A native of Oswego, NY, LT Nathan Hollingsworth Williams attended the \nUniversity of Rochester on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps \nscholarship. Upon graduating with honors in mathematics in 2004, he \nreported for duty at Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training \nwhere he earned his naval flight officer wings. Lieutenant Williams was \ndeployed to Afghanistan, where he served aboard the U.S.S. Theodore \nRoosevelt, providing air support for U.S. ground troops. After \nreturning from Afghanistan, Lieutenant Williams was chosen as a flight \ninstructor at Lemoore Naval Air Station.\n  For his service, Lieutenant Williams received a number of awards \nincluding two Presidential Air Medals, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal \nwith Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Pistol Marksmanship \nMedal, and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. A dedicated Buffalo Bills \nfan, he will be remembered as a kind and caring person who was always \nwilling to lend a hand to those in need. Lieutenant Williams is \nsurvived by his wife Meredith; his parents Alan and Gay Williams; and \nhis brothers Jeffrey and Seth. He was 28 years old.\n  Nothing can fully account for the loss suffered by the families of \nLieutenants Lowe and Williams, and all those who loved them. But I hope \nthey can take comfort in the knowledge that they will be forever \nhonored and remembered by a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2681-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ARMENIAN GENOCIDE REMEMBRANCE DAY, 2011\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, each year we commemorate Armenian Genocide \nRemembrance Day. April 24 came during our recess this year and marked \nthe 96th anniversary of the date in 1915 when Turkish Ottoman \nauthorities ordered the rounding up and detention of hundreds of \nArmenian intellectual leaders, civic leaders, writers, priests, \nteachers, and doctors. Many of these leaders would eventually be \nexecuted. What followed between 1915 and 1923 was an organized campaign \nof deportation, expropriation, conscription, starvation, and other \natrocities that resulted in the deaths of over 1.5 million Armenians. \nLarge numbers of Armenians fled their homeland to seek safety \nelsewhere, including in Michigan and other communities in the United \nStates. We remember the tragic events of this period to honor those who \ndied and to show our respect and solace for those who survived the \nsuffering inflicted on the Armenian people.\n  We also remember the Armenian Genocide to remind ourselves of the \nevil which mankind is capable of and to reaffirm our collective \ncommitment to a future in which such mass atrocities will not be \nrepeated. While the horrific abuses suffered by the Armenians have been \ndescribed as the first genocide of the 20th century, they were soon \nfollowed by other genocides and mass atrocities, including the \nHolocaust, which Hitler said could be pursued because ``Who, after all, \nspeaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' As the tragedies \nin Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur and elsewhere show, when mankind turns a \nblind eye to an unfolding massacre, those who would use wholesale \nviolence against others are emboldened to believe they can act with \nimpunity.\n  More recently, the international community has come together to \nprevent a massacre of civilians from occurring in Libya. The memory of \nthe tragic consequences of mankind's collective failure to act in the \npast has helped to motivate world leaders to commit at the United \nNations to the protection of the Libyan people against the murderous \nthreats of the Qadhafi regime.\n  It is also important to remember the events of 1915-1923 with honesty \nand integrity for reconciliation and healing to occur. Some have sought \nto deny that these events constituted genocide. But the devastating \neffects of the Ottoman Turkish regime's systematic engagement in the \nkilling and deportation of the Armenian community cannot be denied. The \nconsequences of these acts are with us today among the Armenian \ndiaspora living and thriving throughout the world and in the tensions \nwithin the Caucasus region. The costs of these violent acts to the \nvictims and the survivors must not be discounted through denial.\n  These acts were not committed by the present day Republic of Turkey. \nOver the last few years, Armenia and Turkey have engaged in an \nimportant dialogue on normalizing relations. This process has \nunfortunately stalled, and should be reinvigorated to remove barriers \nand promote reconciliation between the two countries. In addition, \nTurkey, as a NATO ally, has played an important role in the enforcement \nof the U.N. resolutions regarding Libya and the protection of the \nLibyan people from brutal attacks by the Qadhafi regime.\n  So in honor of the 97th anniversary of Armenian Genocide Remembrance \nDay, let us rededicate ourselves to the prevention of mass atrocities \nand the principles of justice and understanding, which are essential \nfor the promotion of human dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2681-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2681-S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN ROBERT DUNCAN\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man who \ndeserves his own branch on the tree of Oregon politics.\n  Former Congressman Robert B. Duncan, died Friday in Portland at the \nage of 90. He will long be remembered for what he achieved in reviving \nthe Oregon Democratic Party in the years after World War II and being \nelected to represent two of Oregon's congressional districts during the \n1960s and 1970s where he championed such great causes as civil rights \nand the war on poverty.\n  He will also be remembered as someone who bravely took on two of \nOregon's iconic figures. Bob Duncan ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. \nSenate three times, narrowly losing to names that are familiar to \neveryone in this room--Wayne Morse and Mark Hatfield.\n  On a personal note, I might also add that Bob Duncan was the \nincumbent and my opponent in the 1980 primary race for Oregon's 3rd \nCongressional District. When I won that race I was afraid that I had \nmade an enemy for life out of someone who was revered in State \nDemocratic circles. I couldn't have been more wrong. He reached out to \nme and became both a friend and a supporter.\n  Throughout his life, Bob Duncan was a major force in Oregon politics, \nshaping the state through his various roles as speaker of the Oregon \nHouse to influential member of the House appropriations subcommittee on \ntransportation where he played a key role in bringing light rail to the \nstreets of Portland. His public life ended in 1987 when he stepped down \nas chairman of the Northwest Power Planning Council.\n  Bob's service in Congress covered a pivotal time in American politics \nthe war in Vietnam. In 1966, at the urging of President Lyndon Johnson, \nBob gave up his congressional seat from southern Oregon to run for the \nSenate against then-Governor Mark Hatfield. It was a nationally watched \nrace pitting Duncan, a proponent of the war,\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\nagainst Hatfield, one of the Nation's earliest opponents of the United \nStates' Vietnam policy.\n  Two years later, Bob lost by only about 10,000 votes when he ran \nagainst Wayne Morse in the Democratic primary for Oregon's other Senate \nseat. Morse eventually lost to Republican Bob Packwood. In 1972, he \nlost again to Morse in a Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate.\n  Never one to remain idle, Duncan having moved to Portland, won an \nopen congressional seat in 1974, making him the only person in Oregon \nhistory to represent U.S. House districts in different parts of the \nState.\n  But Bob Duncan's life should not be defined by races won and lost. He \nwas a tireless advocate for civil liberties, civil rights and \neliminating the scourge of poverty in America. His friends and you can \ncount me among them remember him as tenacious and hard working with a \nbrilliant legal mind.\n  I will always remember him as a larger-than-life figure who loved \ntelling stories and never let politics getting in the way of doing what \nhe felt was right. Despite running a hard-fought race against each \nother, Duncan and Mark Hatfield became close friends and working \npartners. Thanks to Hatfield's efforts, a government building in \ndowntown Portland now bears Duncan's name.\n  Please join me in extending my condolences to his wife Kathryn and \nhis children. All of Oregon shares in their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL VA RESEARCH WEEK\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments and discoveries of investigators and scientists at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, who have brought about critical \nadvances in health care delivery and medical knowledge through \ninnovative medical research. These researchers and the veterans that \nmake it all possible will be honored this week by National VA Research \nWeek, which celebrates the historic success of VA research \ncollaborations through this year's theme of ``Discovery and \nCollaboration for Exceptional Health Care.'' I would like to share some \nof the amazing breakthroughs that have resulted from VA research and \nthat have advanced the quality of health care for all Americans.\n  At the conclusion of World War I, it was clear that servicemembers \nreturning from a new type of warfare needed innovative medical \ntreatment. VA research began conducting hospital-based medical studies \nin 1925 and since then has continued to publish significant research \nstudies on a regular basis. While VA research studies have changed \ndramatically over the years to reflect the needs of veterans of each \nconflict, the goal of providing quality care has remained paramount.\n  This commitment to quality care has led to a litany of medical \nbreakthroughs and discoveries that are respected and have been utilized \naround the world. Without the tireless efforts of VA researchers, the \nmedical community would not have lifesaving tools such as the pacemaker \nand the heart stint. Without the breakthroughs of VA research, the \nworld may never have seen a successful liver transplant, a safer cure \nfor tuberculosis, or genetic mapping that may one day lead to the \neradication of Alzheimer's disease. The many successes of VA research \ncontinue today as ongoing projects close in on a possible cure for \ncancer, create new pharmaceutical solutions for serious mental illness, \nand build new prosthetics and assistive devices that make a return to \nnormal life possible for our wounded warriors.\n  VA research holds the promise to improve treatment and rehabilitation \nfor our Nation's veterans. From developing new prosthetics to \nunderstanding and treating traumatic brain injuries, veterans can be \ncertain that VA medical staff will always be prepared to best heal \ntheir wounds. Wounds, both visible and invisible, must receive the best \ncare and treatment possible, and I am proud that VA is leading the way \non new treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.\n  VA breakthroughs in the treatment of PTSD have not only helped \nthousands of veterans but have served as an example for both the \nAmerican and international mental health community. Most recently, VA \nhas been a resource for the people of Japan while they grapple with the \nmental wounds of the tragic earthquake and tsunami that so violently \nshook that country earlier this year. Today, while the first responders \nand the resilient people of Alabama and the areas affected by recent \ntornado destruction begin physically rebuilding their homes and \ncommunities, they can rely on the Psychological First Aid Field \nOperations Guide to provide tips on how to begin the healing process.\n  Medical and scientific advances from VA research have often come \nthrough collaboration. VA has the privilege of relying on one of our \nNation's greatest assets, the men and women who serve. These veterans \nunderstand that oftentimes, their participation in VA Research may not \ndirectly benefit their lives. Instead, they continue to serve their \nfellow Americans by trying to ensure better quality care for those who \nreturn from armed conflicts in the future. By partnering with 1 million \nveterans, VA is launching the Million Veteran Project, an effort to \nlearn more about how genetics affect health.\n  VA also has the ability to partner with some of the best medical \nresearch institutions through their relationship with the Association \nof American Medical Colleges. This year's theme marks the 65th \nanniversary of an agreement which allowed VA to join with medical \nschools and create innovative partnerships directly impacting the \nquality of care. This partnership is a significant reason for VA \nresearch being so successful at finding innovative solutions to health \ncare problems. Because of this collaboration, VA scientists and \nresearchers have access to both VA medical centers and various \nuniversity medical centers to conduct their research. This partnership \nbrings together the brightest minds of our medical and scientific \ncommunities and yields positive results for our veterans.\n  I am proud to have been a long-time, ardent supporter of VA research. \nI know that VA's world-class researchers could easily work elsewhere, \nbut they continue to work with the Department in fulfilling its \nobligations to constantly improve the quality of care for our veterans. \nAt a time when more and more veterans are coming home from war and \nrelying on VA for their health care needs, we here in Congress must \nmake sure we can lead the way with a strong investment in our veterans \nand the high quality care we are committed to providing them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2682-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2682-S2683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    60TH ANNIVERSARY OF BUENO FOODS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, ``red or green?'' That is the \nquestion. As anyone who has ever dined in my State well knows, this \ninquiry refers to whether one prefers the zesty green chile or the \npiquant red chile when ordering New Mexico's unique native cuisine. In \nfact, in my State of New Mexico ``red or green'' is our official State \nquestion, and as I understand it, New Mexico is the only State that has \ndesignated a State question.\n  For hundreds of years, chile has been central to the culture of New \nMexico. Early Spanish settlers brought the chile plant to New Mexico \nfrom the Valley of Mexico. Today, growing and processing chile peppers \nis New Mexico's signature industry providing about 5,000 jobs and a \ntotal value of about $400 million per year. The chile pepper and the \nfrijole--or pinto bean--are also the State's official vegetables.\n  Today I honor the Baca family of Albuquerque and the 60th anniversary \nof Bueno Foods. Just as chile peppers are integral to New Mexican \ncuisine, for generations Bueno Foods has been integral to the \npreparation of delicious products made from chile. The Baca family is a \npillar of New Mexico business and of the Barelas neighborhood in the \nSouth Valley of Albuquerque.\n  Three brothers, Joe, Ray, and August Baca, members of a long-\nestablished New Mexican family, returned to New Mexico in 1946 from \nserving in World War II. They opened a local grocery, the Ace Food \nStore in Barelas. Soon they started offering their mother's legendary \ncooking, adding a carry-out component to the store. At first, from the \nkitchen of their childhood home,\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nthey made corn and flour tortillas, tamales and posole.\n  The homemade traditional New Mexican dishes were an immediate hit. \nThen, the Baca brothers had an idea. They talked about it around the \nsupper table with their mother and father. They talked about it day and \nnight. It was the early 1950s and every household was getting a \nfreezer. Commercial frozen vegetables were becoming the rage. The \nbrothers asked themselves two questions: Why couldn't they take a piece \nof their heritage, New Mexico's fresh-roasted green chile, and preserve \nit? Why couldn't they start with an autumn tradition and use freezers \nto make it last until the following year's harvest?\n  Thus, the Baca brothers were the first to flame roast green chile and \nfreeze it on a commercial scale. No equipment existed, so they had to \nbuild it. No process existed, so they had to invent it. And on May 18, \n1951, Bueno Foods was born.\n  Bueno Foods has grown steadily from that small neighborhood grocery \nstore into a producer of 150 unique New Mexican and Mexican food \nproducts, spreading ``el sabor de Nuevo Mexico'' across the State and \nthe Nation. Now owned and operated by the second generation of the Baca \nfamily in the same South Valley neighborhood, Bueno Foods employs about \n220 people year-round and up to 350 during peak chile-roasting season. \nThe Baca family is also active in the New Mexico Chile Association, a \nnonprofit organization composed of growers and producers fighting to \nensure the chile industry remains and prospers in New Mexico.\n  The Baca family has always believed in giving back to its community. \nTo help mark the 60th anniversary celebration, Bueno Foods is focusing \non four elements that are important to the family and their company: \nimproving the environment by planting 60 cottonwood trees to replace \nthose destroyed in last year's bosque fire in Barelas; preserving their \nculture by giving away special Autumn Roast Chile grown in Hatch, NM; \nsupporting literacy and education by providing 600 copies of the \nchildren's book ``Tia Tamales'' to low-income schools in New Mexico; \nand contributing to 60 community charities that focus on the basic \nneeds of education, hunger, and stronger communities.\n  It is an honor to congratulate Jackie, Gene, Catherine, and Ana Baca \nand the Baca family on their 60 years of success with Bueno Foods, to \nthank them for all their good work in the South Valley and throughout \nNew Mexico, and to remember those far-sighted brothers who started it \nall with a good idea and a chile roaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2683-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ABRAHAM BREEHEY\n\n   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I \npay tribute to Abraham ``Abe'' Breehey, and I ask my colleagues to join \nme today in honoring his memory. Abe, who was a champion of the rights \nof America's working men and women, passed away suddenly last month \nfrom complications related to a brain tumor. He was just 34 years old.\n  Abe was a well-respected friend and colleague to many in the Senate. \nAs director of Legislative Affairs and special assistant to the \ninternational president of the International Brotherhood of \nBoilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers, he \ntirelessly represented workers across the country. He also served as \nchairman of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department's \nLegislative Task Force.\n  Abe worked closely with the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which I chair, in our efforts to promote clean energy jobs. \nHe represented labor interests with passion and intellect and was a \npowerful advocate for the role of workers in moving the U.S. toward a \nclean energy future.\n  He was, in the words of International Brotherhood of Boilermakers \nPresident Newton B. Jones, the union's ``point man on Capitol Hill,'' \nwho advanced many critical causes on behalf of working men and women \n``with boundless enthusiasm and determination.''\n  Abe's work was not limited to the U.S. Congress. He also worked \ninternationally on efforts to control global warming, representing the \nInternational Brotherhood of Boilermakers in international negotiations \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n  Abe received his bachelor's degree from Sienna College in \nLoudonville, NY, and his master's degree in public policy from the \nRockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the University of \nAlbany. He was also a graduate of the Trade Union Program at Harvard \nLaw School. Prior to joining the Boilermakers, he served as legislative \nassistant for Representative Doggett.\n  As anyone who worked with him can tell you, Abe was an extraordinary \nperson. Always full of cheer, he possessed a gift for finding common \nground on tough issues, and he was taken from this world far too early.\n  On Thursday, April 14, Abe passed away, leaving a loving wife, Sonya, \nand beloved daughter, Abigail. He is also survived by his parents Ray \nand Carol Breehey, sister Rachel Breehey Mollen, three nieces, and a \nnephew. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loving family and many \nfriends.\n  The U.S. Congress and workers across the country have lost a tireless \nadvocate, trusted colleague and friend, and Abe will be greatly missed. \nAlthough his life was short, Abe unquestionably left his mark and he \nmade a difference in the lives of working people everywhere.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a variable VEETC rate based on the price of crude oil, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by a \nnumber of my colleagues in introducing the Domestic Energy Promotion \nAct of 2011, an important piece of legislation that I believe is a good \nstarting point in how tax policies for ethanol should evolve. I am \njoined in this effort by Senators Conrad, Johanns, Klobuchar, Franken, \nTim Johnson, Harkin and Ben Nelson.\n  Over the years, I have supported domestic ethanol production as a \nmeans to improve the environment, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nincrease our national security, and bring economic activity to rural \nAmerica. Those efforts have undoubtedly been an enormous success. \nDomestic biofuels now supply more than 13 billion gallons of homegrown \nfuel, accounting for nearly 10 percent of our Nation's transportation \nfuel needs.\n  In 2010, Congress enacted a one-year extension of the Volumetric \nEthanol Excise Tax Credit, or VEETC, also known as the blenders' \ncredit. This 1-year extension has allowed Congress and the domestic \nbiofuels industry to determine the best path forward for Federal \nsupport for biofuels. The legislation we are introducing today is a \nserious, responsible first step to reducing and redirecting Federal tax \nincentives for biofuels.\n  This legislation will reduce VEETC to a fixed rate of 20 cents in \n2012, and 15 cents in 2013. It will then convert to a variable tax \nincentive for the remaining 3 years, based on the price of crude oil. \nWhen crude oil is more than $90 a barrel, there will be no blenders' \ncredit. When crude oil is $50 and below, the blenders' credit will be \n30 cents. The rate will vary when the price of crude is between $50 and \n$90 a barrel. When oil prices are high, a natural incentive should \nexist in the market to drive ethanol use.\n  It also would extend, through 2016, the alternative fuel refueling \nproperty credit; the cellulosic producers' tax credit; and the special \ndepreciation allowance for cellulosic biofuel plant property. The bill \nwould modify the alternative fuel refueling property credit to allow \nthe credit for ethanol blends from E20 to E85. The credit would apply \nto 100 percent of the cost of the property, so long as dual-use pumps \nare used partly for alternative fuels. Finally, the bill would extend \nthe ethanol import tariff, through 2016, stepping it down to 20 cents \nfor 2012 and 15 cents for 2013 through 2016.\n  This legislation is a responsible approach that will reduce the \nexisting blenders' credit and put those valuable resources into \ninvesting in alternative fuel infrastructure, including alternative \nfuel pumps. It would responsibly and predictably reduce the existing \ntax incentive, and help get alternative fuel infrastructure in place so \nconsumers can decide which fuel they would prefer. I know that when \nAmerican consumers have the choice, they will choose domestic, clean, \naffordable renewable fuel. They will choose fuel from America's farmers \nand ranchers, rather than oil sheiks and foreign dictators.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that it is time to end the \nincentives for biofuels immediately and entirely. Not only is this bad \nenergy policy, poor tax policy, and dangerous to our national security, \nit is also intellectually dishonest. I believe a discussion concerning \nour Nation's energy and tax policy should be debated in a comprehensive \nmanner. Biofuels are not the only form of energy that receives \nincentives or supportive policies from the Federal Government.\n  How about the incentives for wind, oil, natural gas, nuclear, and \ngeothermal? If the Senate intends to consider reforms to biofuels \nincentives, it should be in the context of a comprehensive review of \nall energy tax incentives. This bill is meant to serve as a first step \nin the process. This bill demonstrates a significant reduction in \nbiofuels incentives over the next 5 years. I challenge my colleagues to \nfind any other energy source that is contributing as much to our \neconomy and energy supply that is willing to step up and do that in the \ncurrent legislative debate.\n  Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under the only domestic \nrenewable energy source that is making significant contributions to our \nenergy supply. I thank my colleagues for their support, and I look \nforward to a comprehensive discussion to advance sensible, responsible \nenergy tax policies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 885. A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to reauthorize a provision relating to additional contract \nauthority for States with Indian reservations; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Udall of New Mexico to introduce the Indian School \nBus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2011. This bill continues an \nimportant federal program begun in 1998 that addresses a unique problem \nwith the roads in and around the Nation's single largest Indian \nreservation and the neighboring counties. Through this program, Navajo \nchildren who had been prevented from getting to school by roads that \nwere often impassable are now traveling safely to and from their \nschools. Because of the unusual nature of this situation, I believe it \nmust continue to be addressed at the Federal level.\n  I would like to begin with some statistics on this unique problem and \nwhy\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nI believe a Federal solution continues to be necessary. The Navajo \nNation is by far the nation's largest Indian Reservation, covering \n25,000 square miles. Portions of the Navajo Nation are in three states: \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. No other reservation comes anywhere \nclose to the size of Navajo. To give you an idea of its size, the state \nof West Virginia is about 24,000 square miles. In fact, 10 states are \nsmaller in size than the Navajo reservation.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about 9,700 miles of \npublic roads serve the Navajo nation. Only about 1/3 of these roads are \npaved. The remaining 6,500 miles, 67 percent, are dirt roads. Every day \nschool buses use nearly all of these roads to transport Navajo children \nto and from school.\n  About 6,200 miles of the roads on the Navajo reservation are BIA \nroads, and about 3,300 miles are State and county roads. All public \nroads within, adjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including \nBIA, State, and county roads are considered part of the Federal Indian \nReservation Road System. However, only BIA and tribal roads are \neligible for Federal maintenance funding from BIA. Moreover, the \nfunding for road construction from the Federal Lands Highways Program \nin SAFETEA is generally applied only to BIA or tribal roads. Thus, the \nstates and counties are responsible for maintenance and improvement of \ntheir 2,500 miles of roads that serve the reservation.\n  The counties in the three States that include the Navajo reservation \nare simply not in a position to maintain all of the roads on the \nreservation that carry children to and from school. Nearly all of the \nland area in these counties is under Federal or tribal jurisdiction.\n  For example, in my State of New Mexico, \\3/4\\ of McKinley County is \neither tribal or federal land, including BLM, Forest Service, and \nmilitary land. The Indian land area alone comprises 61 percent of \nMcKinley County. Consequently, the county can draw upon only a very \nlimited tax base as a source of revenue for maintenance purposes. Of \nthe nearly 600 miles of county-maintained roads in McKinley County, 512 \nmiles serve Indian land.\n  In San Juan County, Utah, the Navajo Nation comprises 40 percent of \nthe land area. The county maintains 611 miles of roads on the Navajo \nNation. Of these, 357 miles are dirt, 164 miles are gravel and only 90 \nmiles are paved. On the reservation, the county has three high schools, \ntwo elementary schools, two BIA boarding schools and four pre-schools.\n  The situation is similar in neighboring San Juan County, New Mexico, \nand Apache, Navajo, and Coconino Counties, Arizona. In light of the \ncounties' limited resources, I do believe the Federal Government is \nasking the States and counties to bear too large a burden for road \nmaintenance in this unique situation.\n  Families living in and around the reservation are no different from \nfamilies anywhere else; their children are entitled to the same \nopportunity to get to school safely and to get a good education. \nHowever, the many miles of unpaved and deficient roads on the \nreservation are frequently impassable, especially when they are wet, \nmuddy or snowy. If the school buses don't get through, the kids simply \ncannot get to school.\n  These children are literally being left behind.\n  Because of the vast size of the Navajo reservation, the cost of \nmaintaining the county roads used by the school buses is more than the \ncounties can bear without Federal assistance. I believe it is essential \nthat the Federal Government help these counties deal with this one-of-\na-kind situation.\n  In response to this unique situation, in 1998 Congress began \nproviding direct annual funding to the counties that contain the Navajo \nreservation to help ensure that children on the reservation can get to \nand from their public schools. In 2005, the program was reauthorized in \nSAFETEA through 2009, and now extended through 2011.\n  Under this program, $1.8 million is made available each year to be \nshared equally among the three states. The funding is provided directly \nto the counties in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah that contain the \nNavajo reservation. I want to be very clear: these Federal funds can be \nused only on roads that are located within or that lead to the \nreservation, that are on the State or county maintenance system, and \nthat are used by school buses.\n  This program has been very successful. For 14 years, the counties \nhave used the annual funding to help maintain the routes used by school \nbuses to carry children to school and to Headstart programs. I have had \nan opportunity to see firsthand the importance of this funding when I \nrode in a school bus over some of the roads that are maintained using \nfunds from this program.\n  The bill we are introducing today provides a simple 6 year \nreauthorization of that program, for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, \nwith a modest increase in the annual funding to allow for inflation and \nfor additional roads to be maintained in each of the three states.\n  I believe that continuing this program for 6 more years is fully \njustified because of the vast area of the Navajo reservation, by far \nthe nation's largest, and the unique nature of this need that only the \nFederal Government can deal with effectively.\n  I don't believe any child wanting to get to and from school should \nhave to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly in \nrural and remote areas, face enough hurdles to getting a good \neducation. I ask my colleagues to join me again this year in assuring \nthat Navajo schoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school \nsafely and get an education.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member \nInhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Vitter of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee, to incorporate this legislation once again \ninto the next comprehensive 6 year reauthorization of surface \ntransportation programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REAUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACT AUTHORITY FOR \n                   STATES WITH INDIAN RESERVATIONS.\n\n       Section 1214(d)(5)(A) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 202 note; 112 Stat. 206; 119 \n     Stat. 1460) is amended by striking ``$1,800,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2005 through 2009'' and inserting ``$2,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2017''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 886. A bill to amend the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 to \nprohibit the use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInterstate Horseracing Improvement Act. This legislation addresses an \nissue affecting interstate commerce and an iconic American animal. I am \npleased to be working on this in a bipartisan manner with \nRepresentative Ed Whitfield of Kentucky.\n  Although many recognize the horse as an iconic American animal, \nparticularly for the West, there are probably few who know how long \nhorseracing has been a part of our nation's history. My colleagues in \nKentucky, Maryland, and New York can boast of the Sport of Kings' long \ntradition in their States. Yet the first recorded horserace in what is \nnow the United States took place in New Mexico. In 1541, the Spanish \nexplorer Coronado challenged one of his officers to a match race while \nthey were camped near Bernalillo.\n  The Spanish brought not only horses, but also horseracing to what is \nnow the United States. Decades before the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth \nRock, Don Juan de Onate crossed into present day New Mexico with \nSpanish colonists who were not just settlers but caballeros, or \n``horse'' men. Native American petroglyphs record early encounters with \nthese new arrivals travelling on horseback. Horseracing became a \ntradition in the Southwest as it later did in Eastern states.\n  That tradition continues today at racetracks in New Mexico and over \n30 other States across the nation. With the Kentucky Derby this \nSaturday,\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nmany Americans will turn their attention to Churchill Downs for the \nmost exciting two minutes in sports. Some of the best of horseracing \nwill be on display. Away from the crowds, however, horseracing finds \nitself facing an unattractive reality. Too many of its equine athletes \nare overmedicated and doped. The Sport of Kings is no place for such a \ndrug problem.\n  American horseracing stands apart from the rest of the world when it \ncomes to permissive medication rules and tolerance of doping. Unlike \nother countries that ban race day medications, racing jurisdictions \nhere allow injecting horses just hours before post time. There are \ntrainers who violate medication rules multiple times, seemingly with \nimpunity. According to a recent Racing Commissioners International, \nRCI, letter, one trainer has been sanctioned at least 64 times for \nvarious rule violations, including medication violations involving the \nclass 2 painkiller mepivacaine and the class 3 drug clenbuterol. \nAccording to the New York Times, only two of the top 20 trainers, by \nracing purses won, have never been cited for a medication violation. \nThis tolerance of doping represents a shameful abuse of an iconic \nAmerican animal, and it is time to put an end to it.\n  Anyone who goes to the track outside of a Triple Crown or Breeders' \nCup race knows that attendance is down across the country. The decline \nis especially stark considering that horseracing was once the No. 1 \nspectator sport in the United States. One poll of sports industry \ninsiders found that most think horseracing is in decline or dying. With \nthe loss of fans, comes the loss of revenue that ultimately sustains a \n$40 billion industry and 400,000 jobs nationwide, including 10,000 jobs \nin my home State. As current fans leave the sport, many potential new \nfans will probably never come to the track while doping is rampant.\n  Although a horse may need therapeutic medication from time to time, \nthere is no excuse for injecting almost all thoroughbreds hours before \nthey race. As RCI Chairman William Koester rightly noted, that just \ndoes not pass the smell test with the public or anyone else. While \nmedicating sound horses on race day is concerning, the doping of sore \nhorses is appalling. Sore and lame horses should not be raced. Feeling \nno pain, an injured horse on drugs may continue to charge down the \ntrack, endangering every horse and jockey in the race. Drugs may \naccount for the fact that the U.S. horse fatality rate is more than \nthree times higher than in comparable British flat racing. Trainers or \nanyone else caught doping racehorses should face stiff penalties, \nincluding fines and meaningful suspensions.\n  This is a matter of concern to me as a senator from a state where \nquarterhorse and thoroughbred racing is an important industry. But it \nshould be of concern to all my Senate colleagues since Congress granted \na special privilege to horseracing that no other U.S. gambling \nenterprise enjoys: interstate and online wagering. The Interstate \nHorseracing Act of 1978, IHA, allows off-track, or ``simulcast,'' \nwagering across state lines. Internet wagering on horseraces subject to \nthe IHA was granted a special exemption from the Unlawful Internet \nGambling Enforcement Act of 2006, UIGEA. Given the benefits of the IHA, \nthe horse racing industry should not only protect the safety and \nwelfare of its animals and jockeys, but also ensure the integrity of \nthe sport.\n  I reluctantly believe that Congressional action is needed to address \nthis critical challenge facing the industry. Unlike other sports, \nhorseracing lacks a governing body that can issue uniform medication \nrules and ban performance enhancing drugs. That is why recent calls \nfrom the RCI and the Jockey Club to phase out race day medication are \nnot enough to save American horseracing. Despite repeated pledges from \nthe racing industry to address this issue, horseracing's drug problem \nhas festered for decades.\n  The legislation Representative Whitfield and I are introducing today \nwould amend the Interstate Horseracing Act to ban performance-enhancing \ndrugs and require stiff penalties for doping. Under the Interstate \nHorseracing Improvement Act, anyone who knowingly provides or races a \nhorse on performance enhancing drugs faces minimum fines and \nsuspensions. The winner of each race plus one additional horse must be \ntested for performance enhancing drugs. To ensure quality testing, the \nbill requires that test labs are accredited to quality standards. This \nlegislation envisions that individual state racing commissions would \ncontinue to enforce horseracing rules within their jurisdiction, \nincluding the new anti-doping rules. However, the Federal Trade \nCommission can also enforce the anti-doping rules if there is \ninadequate enforcement. The new rules would apply only to those races \nthat are already governed by the IHA.\n  In addition to the animal welfare issues that doping creates, I know \nhow important drug reform is for those who make their living from the \nsport. Passing this legislation will help bring integrity back to \nracing, benefitting everyone involved and, most importantly, the health \nand safety of the horses at the center of it all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Interstate Horseracing \nImprovement Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Congress enacted the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 \n     (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) to regulate interstate commerce with \n     respect to parimutuel wagering on horseracing in order to \n     protect and further the horseracing industry of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The horseracing industry represents approximately \n     $40,000,000,000 to the United States economy annually and \n     generates nearly 400,000 domestic jobs.\n       (3) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n     adversely affects interstate commerce, creates unfair \n     competition, deceives horse buyers and the wagering public, \n     weakens the breed of the American Thoroughbred, is \n     detrimental to international sales of the American \n     Thoroughbred, and threatens the safety and welfare of horses \n     and jockeys.\n       (4) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n     is widespread in the United States, where no uniform \n     regulations exist with respect to the use of, and testing \n     for, performance-enhancing drugs in interstate horseracing.\n       (5) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n     is not permitted in most jurisdictions outside the United \n     States.

Res. 162\n\n       Whereas adequate and secure housing for people with human \n     immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``HIV/AIDS'') is a challenge \n     with global dimensions, and adequate housing is one of the \n     greatest unmet needs of people in the United States with HIV/\n     AIDS;\n       Whereas growing empirical evidence shows that socioeconomic \n     status and structural factors such as access to adequate \n     housing are key determinants of health;\n       Whereas the link between poverty, disparities in the risk \n     of human immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``HIV'') infection, and health outcomes is well \n     established, and new research demonstrates the direct \n     relationship between inadequate housing and greater risk of \n     HIV infection, poor health outcomes, and early death;\n       Whereas rates of HIV infection are 3 to 16 times higher \n     among people who are homeless or have an unstable housing \n     situation, 70 percent of all people living with HIV/AIDS \n     report an experience of homelessness or housing instability \n     during their lifetime, and the HIV/AIDS death rate is 7 to 9 \n     times higher for homeless adults than for the general \n     population;\n       Whereas poor living conditions, including overcrowding and \n     homelessness, undermine safety, privacy, and efforts to \n     promote self-respect, human dignity, and responsible sexual \n     behavior;\n       Whereas people who are homeless or have an unstable housing \n     situation are 2 to 6 times more likely to use hard drugs, \n     share needles, or exchange sex for money and housing than \n     similar persons with stable housing, because the lack of \n     stable housing directly impacts the ability of people living \n     in poverty to reduce HIV risk behaviors;\n       Whereas, in spite of the evidence indicating that adequate \n     housing has a direct positive effect on HIV prevention, \n     treatment, and health outcomes, the housing resources devoted \n     to the national response to HIV/AIDS have been inadequate, \n     and housing has been largely ignored in policy discussions at \n     the international level; and\n       Whereas, in 1990, Congress recognized the housing needs of \n     people with HIV/AIDS when it enacted the AIDS Housing \n     Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. 12901 et seq.), commonly referred \n     to as the ``Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS \n     Program'' or ``HOPWA Program'', as part of the Cranston-\n     Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101-625; \n     104 Stat. 4079), and the HOPWA program currently serves \n     approximately 60,000 households: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) stable and affordable housing is an essential component \n     of an effective strategy for human immunodeficiency virus \n     prevention, treatment, and care; and\n       (2) the United States should make a commitment to providing \n     adequate funding for the development of housing as a response \n     to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/04/senate-section/article/S2692-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2692-S2693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 163--COMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n               UNITED STATES NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as a member of the Senate who has been \nvery interested in and involved with the areas of biomedical research, \nhealth care and the improvement of the public health, I want to draw \nthe attention of the Congress and the Nation to the 175th anniversary \nof the National Library of Medicine, NLM, located at the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH.\n  NLM has changed the way scientific and medical information is \norganized, stored, accessed and disseminated. Throughout its \ndistinguished history, the Library's hallmark has been information \ninnovation, leading to exciting scientific discoveries that ultimately \nimprove the public health.\n  From its modest beginnings as the Library of the U.S. Army Surgeon \nGeneral in 1836, the National Library of Medicine has grown to become \nthe world's largest medical library and the producer of electronic \ninformation resources used by millions of people around the globe every \nday.\n  The NLM has been fortunate to be led by Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D. \nsince 1984. Under Dr. Lindberg's leadership, the Library has \ndramatically advanced toward its goal of providing access to biomedical \ninformation--anytime, anywhere--for scientists, health professionals, \nand the public. During Dr. Lindberg's tenure, NLM has embraced the \nInternet as the primary mode of delivering its services and expanded \nits portfolio to include genetic sequence data, high-resolution \nanatomical images, clinical trials information, and a wide array of \nhigh-quality information for consumers. One wonders what astonishing \ndevelopments the next 175 years might bring.\n  Throughout its 175 years, NLM's work has been vital to facilitating \nand improving the effectiveness of biomedical research, getting \nimportant health information out to health professionals and consumers \nand conducting groundbreaking informatics research.\n  Index Medicus, a groundbreaking index of medical journal articles \nfirst published in 1879, evolved into MEDLINE, the first marriage of \nonline search technology and nationwide telecommunications, in 1971. \nAvailable free of charge since 1997 via the Internet, PubMed/MEDLINE is \ntoday the most frequently consulted medical database in the world.\n  NLM began providing toxicology and environmental health data for use \nin emergency response and disaster management in the mid-1960s. Today, \nit produces information services to help health professionals, disaster \ninformation specialists, and the general public cope with emergencies \nand disasters ranging from children swallowing household cleaners to \noverturned trucks carrying hazardous materials to the widespread \neffects of hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, and oil spills.\n  NLM established librarian training programs and the National Network \nof Libraries of Medicine in the late 1960s, to provide equal access to \nthe biomedical literature to persons across the country. Now with \nnearly 6,000 members, NLM and this network of academic, hospital, and \npublic libraries partner with community-based organizations to bring \nhigh-quality information services to health professionals and the \npublic--regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status or \nlevel of access to computers and telecommunications.\n  NLM has conducted and supported training programs and groundbreaking \ninformatics research and development for more than 40 years. The \nLibrary, its grantees, and its former trainees continue to play \nessential roles in the development of electronic health records, health \ndata standards, and the exchange of health information.\n  NLM is home to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, \nNCBI,\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nestablished in 1988 as a national resource for molecular biology \ninformation. Its work was essential to the mapping of the human genome. \nToday, NCBI is an indispensable international repository and software \ntool developer for genetic sequences and other scientific data, and a \npioneer and leader in linking data and published research results to \npromote new scientific discoveries.\n  NLM began intensive development of Web health information services \nfor the general public in 1998 with the release of MedlinePlus.gov. Now \navailable in English and Spanish, MedlinePlus is just one of many NLM \nconsumer health information products also available on mobile devices. \nAn award-winning free magazine, NIH MedlinePlus, is edited by NLM staff \nand is an important vehicle for sharing information from all of the NIH \nInstitutes and Centers, in language that consumers can easily \nunderstand. Copies of the magazine, both an English and Spanish-\nlanguage version, are distributed to doctors' offices, clinics, \ncommunity health centers and other sites around the Nation.\n  NLM released ClinicalTrials.gov in 2000. It is now the world's \nlargest source of information about clinical trials recruiting for \npatients and healthy volunteers, and also provides summary results of \nsome trials long before they appear in the published literature.\n  In 2003, the Library teamed with the National Institute on Aging to \nlaunch NIHSeniorHealth.
