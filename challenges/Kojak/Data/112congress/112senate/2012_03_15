Mr. President, this week the Senate has demonstrated that \nwhen Democrats and Republicans cooperate, we are capable of achieving \nsignificant results for this country. We passed a transportation bill \nthat will create or save almost 3 million jobs--and these are American \njobs--and rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Yesterday we \nchartered a course to confirm 14 new judges in the short term and a \npath for getting more done following that, and this is important \nbecause our Federal courts are overworked and understaffed.\n  We agreed that Congress should continue its work to improve the \neconomy. To that end, the Senate will move today to a piece of \nlegislation that will improve innovators' access to capital and give \nstartups the flexibility they need to hire and to grow. This bill \npassed the House by an overwhelming margin. President Obama supports \nthis measure, and both Democrats and Republicans are eager to get to \nwork to pass it next week.\n  In addition to the small business capital legislation, Democrats will \nalso advance a proposal to help American businesses sell more of their \nproducts overseas. Reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank--or Ex-Im \nBank, as it is called--will help small businesses export globally. Not \nonly will it help small businesses, it will help large businesses such \nas Caterpillar and Boeing. These companies really need this to continue \nthe job creation they have been involved in now for the last several \nyears. As an example, last year Ex-Im Bank financed almost 300,000 \nprivate sector jobs at more than 3,600 different American companies in \nmore than 2,000 communities throughout America. Foreign governments \noften provide the financing for companies that compete with American \nbusinesses. We need to do this to be more competitive. Ex-Im Bank \nlevels the playing field by being available to help American exporters \nwhen private lending is not available. Unless we reauthorize the bank, \nit will hit its lending limit this month, eliminating support for \nAmerican exporters.\n\n  The Export-Import Bank has always had strong bipartisan support, and \nthe Democrats' legislation reauthorizing this measure has the firm \nbacking of the Chamber of Commerce and organized labor. This is a \nstrong combination that equals one result; that is, jobs.\n  Advancing these two items--the Ex-Im Bank and the small business \ncapital bill--will continue the important bipartisan work we have done \nthis week to get our economy back on track.\n  I am pleased that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have been \nable to find common ground. President Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain \n     point and no further, but cooperation, which is the thing we \n     must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off.\n\n  I think we have shown this week that achievement comes when Members \nall strive, as President Roosevelt said, not to compete but to \ncooperate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1686-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, consumer protection has been a \npriority for me throughout my career, as I know it has been for the \nPresiding Officer. Both he and I served together as attorneys general, \nand now as Senators he and I have worked to give consumers a voice \nagainst companies that harm them through deceptive and dangerous or \nabusive practices.\n  This month we recognize consumers in two ways. National Consumer \nProtection Week, recognized the week of March 4 through 10, is led by \ngovernment and nonprofit groups and its focus is to encourage consumers \nto take full advantage of their consumer rights and make better \ninformed decisions for themselves in the marketplace. This month we \nalso recognize that many of the same consumer issues affecting \nAmericans every day in their lives impact consumers in every corner of \nthe world. So today we celebrate World Consumer Rights Day.\n  Every day ought to be Consumer Rights Day because, as President \nKennedy once said, we are all consumers and we are consumers every day \nof every year. Organizations here in America such as Consumers Union \nand other consumer groups around the world celebrate World Consumer \nRights Day as members of Consumers International, the nonprofit \norganization representing over 220 consumer groups in 115 countries.\n  Today also marks the 50th anniversary of a very special day in \nAmerican history for American consumers. On March 15, 1962, President \nKennedy sent a message to Congress calling for a national commitment to \nprotecting consumer interests. Fifty years ago today, President Kennedy \nspoke about the consumer right to safety, to be informed, to choose, \nand to be heard. These rights are the foundation of what we now know as \nthe Consumer Bill of Rights. The Consumer Bill of Rights has grown to \ninclude eight specific guarantees: the right to satisfaction of basic \nneeds; the right to safety; the right to be informed; the right to \nchoose; the right to be heard; the right to redress; the right to \nconsumer education; and the right to a healthy environment.\n  Today, I wish to propose another right, a ninth right: the right to \nprivacy. There is a growing need to defend individual rights to privacy \nin a multitude of areas. This country was founded--its basic bedrock--\non a desire for personal privacy, on the right to be left alone. It is \nthe reason people came to this country, avoiding unwanted and \nunwarranted intrusion on their personal space and on their rights and \nliberties. They came here out of a desire for religious freedom, \neconomic liberty, and the security of their person and property against \nintrusion. It is a unique, bedrock American right--the right to \nprivacy. Concerns about governmental invasion of personal privacy go \nback literally to the founding of our Republic and the protections \nguaranteed under the third amendment when the British lodged troops in \nour homes without permission, and the fourth amendment, when they \nsearched our homes and seized goods and property from them.\n  I have heard numerous complaints from Connecticut residents who are \nconcerned about their privacy. They are concerned about Federal and \nState intrusion into women's health care decisions. They are concerned \nabout government efforts to combat terrorism through tracking of \nindividuals by a GPS or cell phone tower location. Those potential \ninvasions of privacy are by the government, by official\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nforces. But people today are also understandably and rightly concerned \nabout corporate intrusion into their privacy. They are concerned about \ncompanies crawling the Web to collect consumers' personal information \nand selling it to marketers. They are concerned that mobile device apps \ncan access and acquire the device owner's photos and address book \nwithout his or her knowledge or consent. They are concerned that credit \nscores are being created from their use of medications, and that those \nscores are being used to set personal health insurance premiums. They \nare concerned about companies that are compiling dossiers on their use \nof social media sites and blogs and selling those reports to \nprospective employers. They are concerned because they are powerless to \nprevent the distribution of their contact information to marketers who \nthen deluge them with advertisements in the mail and by e-mail, and \nthey are concerned about companies who don't secure their personal data \nand the damages that result from improper breaches and disclosures with \nthe risk of identity theft and worse.\n  The Constitution was written to protect Americans from government \nintrusions into their privacy. I understand the difference between \ngovernment intrusions and private sector invasions. But if the \ngovernment were treating its citizens the way some companies are \ntreating their customers, people would be outraged. They would be up in \narms. They would be dumping tea in the Boston Harbor. The Supreme Court \nhas just ruled that it is not OK for the government to track people via \nGPS in their car without a warrant, so why would it be OK for a company \nsuch as OnStar to track drivers who canceled their subscriptions and \nsell that information on their movements to marketers?\n  Americans--many of us, and others--were questioning the PATRIOT Act \nand its provisions that allow government to access records of what \nbooks citizens borrowed from the library and what Web pages they \nvisited while they were there. Yet, companies are tracking consumers' \nevery movement on line, through dozens--even hundreds--of cookies that \nare secretly installed on consumers' computers whenever they visit a \nWeb site. We would be horrified if the government as a routine matter \nmonitored pictures people take and who they interact with. Yet, \naccording to news reports, mobile devices and apps are doing exactly \nthat.\n  I believe it is time we protect Americans from intrusions into their \npersonal privacy by companies or educational institutions or others who \nmay not be part of the government. Big Brother or Big Sister no longer \nneed wear a police uniform or a badge or a military uniform. It may \nwell be under the guise of a corporate seal or insignia, and I believe \nit is time we protect against those intrusions, as well as others. In \nfact, it is a bipartisan concern. One of the few areas where there is \nagreement in Congress is the need for better protection of consumers \nfor online privacy. We may differ on the substance; we may disagree as \nto what the contours and the specifics should be. I am concerned about \nthis issue and I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for attention \nto it. I was heartened by the President's recent call for a consumer \nprivacy bill of rights--a great beginning, a very positive step \nforward. I believe our approach to privacy must be comprehensive and \nrobust.\n\n  As a threshold matter, companies that collect or share information \nabout consumers should be required to get consumers' affirmative opt-in \nconsent for collecting or sharing that data. Not an opt-out but an opt-\nin--specific, informed consent. That should apply online as well as \noffline. We have seen a lot of attention paid to Internet tracking and \nbehavioral advertising. I think we ought to protect consumers from \nprivacy invasions that come from the mail or over the phone. They \nparticularly affect our seniors. If a company wants to collect, \naggregate, share, sell, or by any other means, it should get consumers' \npermission; otherwise, it shouldn't be permitted.\n  We also need to pay attention to the collection of information \nthrough consumers' use of mobile devices. As we have seen recently, \nsome mobile apps or operating systems are capable of tracking not just \nconsumers' Web browsing but also their text messages, what they \nphotograph, who they contact. Mobile devices need a systemwide, do-not-\ntrack option to allow consumers to control the distribution of their \ninformation.\n  Finally, the consumers' right to privacy also must encompass the \nright to prevent unauthorized distribution of that information. To that \nend, we need to establish requirements for companies that possess \nconsumers' personal information to ensure they have security features \nin place to prevent data breaches. Those protections must be \naccompanied by remedies, by fines and penalties that make those rights \nand protections real so that consumers have a private right of action \nas well.\n  Congress is working on these issues. There have been numerous \nhearings and legislation has been proposed. Having the President add \nhis voice to the call for privacy will only help. As with food safety, \nproduct safety, and Wall Street reform, companies themselves are \ndemonstrating the need for legislation and some of them are joining in \nthis effort very constructively.\n  So as we mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's call to \naction, let us heed the importance of his message to Congress. He said: \n``As all of us are consumers, these actions and proposals in the \ninterests of consumers are in the interests of us all.''\n  We should be proud in this body of having continued the fight for \nconsumer protection. It should be full-throated and full-hearted.\n  Americans went West to the Presiding Officer's State and to other \nStates seeking open spaces, economic opportunities, as well as personal \nopportunities, including the right to privacy and being alone. That \nAmerican right--that American spirit--is very much with us today. It is \n50 years after President Kennedy first articulated it, but I believe it \nis as real and necessary today as ever.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to start out this morning \nby saying I am glad we are turning to the bipartisan jobs bill that \npassed the House last week by such a lopsided margin. Here is a chance \nnot only to help entrepreneurs build their businesses and create jobs \nbut to show we can work together around here to get things done on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Unfortunately, some of our friends on the other side do not seem to \nlike that idea very much. Apparently, they would rather spend the time \nmanufacturing fights and 30-second television ads than helping to \ncreate jobs.\n  First, they tried to even keep us from bringing up this jobs bill for \ndebate in the Senate. Now we read they are trying to figure out ways to \nmake this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill controversial. They want to \npick a fight rather than get this bill to the President's desk, and \nthen they are going to use the same strategy on a number of other \nbills.\n  Their plan is not to work together to make it easier to create jobs \nbut to look for ways to make it easier to keep their own; then use it \nfor campaign ads in the runup to the November elections.\n  If we are looking for the reason this Congress has a 9-percent \napproval rating, this is it. One day after we read a headline in the \nCongressional Quarterly about Democrats moving to slow a jobs bill that \ngot 390 votes, we see a story today about how the No. 3 Democrat in the \nSenate is scheming to spend the rest of the year hitting the other \nside. It goes on to list all the ways he plans to do it, and then it \nsays this:\n\n       None of these campaign-style attacks allow for the policy \n     nuances or reasoning behind the GOP's opposition, and some of \n     the\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\n     bills stand no chance of becoming law. But that's not really \n     the point.\n\n  So at a moment of economic crisis, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate--\nthe Democrat in charge of strategy over there--is sitting up at night \ntrying to figure out a way to create an issue where there is not one, \nnot to solve our Nation's problems but to help Democrats get reelected.\n  I would like to have printed in the Record the Politico story I just \nreferred to entitled ``Schumer schemes to hit GOP'' and ask unanimous \nconsent to do so.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Mar. 14, 2012]\n\n                       Schumer Schemes To Hit GOP\n\n                             (By Manu Raju)\n\n       New York.--Sen. Chuck Schumer believes he has found a \n     political weapon in the unlikeliest of places: the Violence \n     Against Women Act.\n       Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but \n     instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast track the \n     bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats \n     to accuse Republicans of waging a ``war against women.''\n       It's fodder for a campaign ad, and it's not the only \n     potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate \n     leadership these days.\n       From his perch as the Democrats' chief policy and messaging \n     guru, Schumer wants to raise taxes on people who earn more \n     than $1 million, and many Democrats want to push the vote for \n     April 15, a move designed to amp up the ``income inequality'' \n     rhetoric just in time for Tax Day.\n       Schumer has a plan for painting Republicans as anti-\n     immigrant as well. He's called the author of the Arizona \n     immigration law to testify before his Judiciary subcommittee, \n     bringing Capitol Hill attention to an issue that's still \n     front and center for Hispanic voters.\n       None of these campaign-style attacks allow for the policy \n     nuances or reasoning behind the GOP's opposition, and some of \n     the bills stand no chance of becoming law.\n       But that's not really the point.\n       The real push behind this effort is to give Democrats \n     reasons to portray Republicans as anti-women, anti-Latino and \n     anti-middle class. In the aftermath of a fight over a payroll \n     tax cut for American workers and an Obama contraception \n     policy, Democrats are ready for this next set of wedge \n     issues.\n       ``If a party chooses to alienate the fastest-growing group \n     of people in the country [Latinos] and the majority of people \n     in the country, women, they do so at their peril,'' Schumer \n     said Wednesday. ``This is an important issue.''\n       The move carries some risk. The economy is still \n     struggling, with the jobless rate above 8 percent and \n     millions seeking work. Gas prices are skyrocketing. And \n     Schumer himself said last Sunday that Democrats would focus \n     like a ``laser'' on the economy, a comment Republicans \n     giddily pointed out as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-\n     Nev.) pushed for judicial confirmations this week.\n       Schumer and Reid have also shown little interest in \n     bringing forward a budget resolution this spring, saying that \n     overall spending levels have already been agreed upon. That \n     has opened them up to Republican charges they are steadfastly \n     avoiding tough votes on the budget in favor of election-year \n     point scoring.\n       Republicans see the latest chatter in the Senate as a \n     political ploy by Democratic leaders to steady the ship in \n     the face of a shaky political landscape.\n       ``Sounds like all politics all the time,'' said Sen. John \n     Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of his party's leadership who also \n     serves on the Judiciary Committee. He added that Republicans \n     would point out the ``cynical nature of what they're trying \n     to do that it's not based on substance.''\n       Cornyn added: ``We'll be prepared to address their false \n     narrative.''\n       The political strategy also risks inflaming partisan \n     tensions. Arizona Republican Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain \n     criticized Schumer for calling for a hearing on their state's \n     tough law that gives law enforcement new powers to target \n     prospective illegal immigrants, a subject of a Supreme Court \n     challenge.\n       Both men said they had no idea Schumer was inviting former \n     state Sen. Russell Pearce--the author of the law--to testify \n     at a hearing next month.\n       ``Generally, senatorial courtesy indicates you talk to the \n     member states,'' McCain said Wednesday. ``I have never seen \n     Sen. Schumer do anything unless it had a political agenda.''\n       Schumer's office rejects the contention, saying that the \n     New York Democrat notified Cornyn, the ranking Republican on \n     the subcommittee, weeks before the offer was made public.\n       ``This is a sunlight hearing,'' Schumer said Wednesday. \n     ``The more the public hears some of these views from the \n     people in Arizona, the more they'll ask for a more moderate \n     position.''\n       Still, Schumer said there are moments of bipartisanship in \n     which the two sides can come together, and he rejects the \n     notion that Democrats are skirting efforts to prop up the \n     economy, pointing to the passage of a highway bill Wednesday \n     and expected approval of a House-passed small-business bill. \n     Schumer said on the floor Wednesday that he hoped it was a \n     ``moment of greater comity.''\n       But it may not last longer than a few days.\n       As soon as next week, the Senate may begin debating a bill \n     to update expired provisions in the 1994 Violence Against \n     Women Act, which provides assistance to victims of domestic \n     abuse and other crimes. The bill, offered by Senate Judiciary \n     Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), was approved last month in \n     his panel on a party-line vote, a sharp shift from seven \n     years ago when the bill sailed through his committee.\n       ``Not to reauthorize this is a tragedy,'' Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Wednesday. ``This is one more step \n     in the removal of rights for women.''\n       Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the panel, \n     said while he supports a reauthorization of the law, he has \n     concerns with the Democratic bill because it would lead to \n     the issuance of thousands of additional visas under the U-\n     Visa program, which gives illegal immigrants who are victims \n     of crimes a chance to gain legal status if they cooperate \n     with law enforcement.\n       On top of that, Grassley said it would fail to resolve \n     immigration fraud and said grant money given to victims has \n     not been adequately tracked. At the committee meeting last \n     month, Grassley also raised concerns about language in \n     Leahy's bill to broaden some of the law's provisions to those \n     in same-sex relationships.\n       In response, Grassley introduced his own bill that included \n     stricter criteria for U-Visa eligibility. But Democrats \n     rejected that bill saying it would gut a key Justice \n     Department enforcement office and undermine the protections \n     in the law.\n       Republicans said Wednesday they might move their own bill \n     once the issue heads to the floor. And they pushed back on \n     Democratic criticisms that they were being insensitive to \n     women.\n       ``It's a politically popular bill, and if you try to \n     improve it, or change it, and make it more efficient, then \n     the complaint is you don't care about the issue,'' said Sen. \n     Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the committee. ``Nothing \n     can be further from the truth.''\n       But Schumer added, that if the Republicans take positions \n     that turn off voters, it'll be their own fault.\n       ``When the Democrats let the extreme left run the show, we \n     lose out. We've learned that lesson the hard way on many \n     occasions,'' he said. ``When Republicans let the hard right \n     run the show, they lose out.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It lays out the Democratic strategy. The American \npeople need to know what is going on in the Democratic-controlled \nSenate and, frankly, so should posterity. Fifty years from now, I would \nlike an American doing a research project to look back at what is \noutlined in this Politico article so they can understand what this \nDemocratic-controlled Senate is like, so they can understand what their \npriorities are. What did this country's leaders do to make America \nstronger for the next generation? Read this Politico piece. It provides \na unique insight for future generations of Americans to understand what \nthis Senate has done for the country. They can decide for themselves \nwhat they think of it and what its legacy should be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1688-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1688-S1693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STARTUP COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on some of the issues that \nwere just addressed by the Republican leader; that is, the legislation \nwe will hopefully turn to next about creating jobs.\n  There are a lot of occasions when legislation comes to the floor of \nthis Senate where I, similar to many Members, have a view on it, and we \nkind of weigh in on our positions. But this legislation, as it comes \nforward, is something for which I have more than just an intellectual \nor political or philosophical viewpoint. This legislation actually \ninvolves the business I was in for nearly 20 years.\n  I was proud of the fact that starting in the early 1980s--up until \nthe time I was elected Governor of Virginia--I was involved, originally \nas an angel investor and then as a venture capitalist, in helping start \ncompanies across this country. I am proud to have been involved as a \nventure capitalist in funding almost 70 companies--those companies that \ngrew to now employ tens of thousands of Americans.\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\n  As the Acting President pro tempore and some of the folks realize, a \nlot of those companies I was involved with were involved in \ntelecommunications. I was the cofounder of Nextel, although I cannot \nseem to turn my cell phone off at the appropriate times. But I think \nthat background gave me some sense of what it means to find a \nmanagement team to find the capital and get a company started, to allow \nit to grow, create jobs, create economic prosperity.\n  This issue around capital formation, encouraging startups, \nencouraging entrepreneurs, is an issue on which we ought to be able to \ncome together.\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, who I know is going to \nspeak in a few moments after I am finished. He and I have worked \ntogether on legislation called the Startup Act that has been endorsed \nby tech councils across the country, has been endorsed by and builds \nupon the work of the Kauffman Foundation, has been endorsed by and \nbuilds upon the work of the President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness.\n  This ought to be an area where we can find common ground. Some of the \nideas we are going to be discussing in this legislation are not only \nideas Senator Moran and I have worked on but I know Senator Coons and \nSenator Rubio and Senator Toomey and Senator Schumer have worked on, \nalso Senator Tester, Senator Merkley, and Senator Brown. There is a \nlist, actually, in terms of the sponsors or cosponsors on a number of \nthese bills--a number not in the single digits but literally in the \ndozens, probably in excess of 20 and, for the most part, almost every \none of these pieces of legislation is bipartisan.\n  Why do we need to do this? Because if we look where the jobs have \nbeen created in America over the last 20 years, for the most part we \nfind, unfortunately, the job growth from companies that are in the \nFortune 1000 has been flat, if not slightly negative.\n  So while we applaud and support America's largest businesses because \nof increased productivity, because of globalization, those are not the \ncompanies adding jobs.\n  While every Member of the Senate, when they stand, stands and \napplauds small business--and I know my colleagues on the floor support \nsmall business, the traditional small businesses--the butcher shop, the \nretailer, the hardware store--there has not been much job growth \namongst those companies as well.\n  So where have the jobs come from? The jobs have come from startup \nbusinesses, the kinds of businesses where an entrepreneur tries to \nscrape up a little bit of capital and takes an idea to market. Nearly \n80 percent, according to the Kauffman Foundation, of all the new jobs \ncreated in America in the last 20 years have come from these firms.\n  We oftentimes think of these firms as technology firms. Many of them \nare--the Facebooks and Googles. But there are also the companies that \nspan the reach of all kinds of different areas--the Lululemons, in \nterms of clothing stores, or Under Armour, a company that is in \nMaryland. These are the kinds of companies we need to do more to \nsupport in their growth, particularly right now when our economy is \nstill struggling.\n  So what are we trying to do in this legislation? To my mind, there \nare three or four areas these bills need to address.\n  First of all, we need to make it easier for these startup companies \nto raise capital. Over the last decade, a lot of the traditional \nsources of capital raising have actually diminished, particularly since \nthe financial crisis. The number of venture capital firms that exist, \nthat fund companies, has actually decreased.\n  The ability for a company to go public--for which, perhaps, we got a \nlittle too excessive in the late 1990s, when we saw dot.com companies \nrush to go public and then that dot.com bubble burst and those \ncompanies failed--but that access to the public markets has been \nseriously constrained, partially because of added regulations, \npartially because of added reporting requirements, and partially \nbecause there has been a recognition that going public may not have \nbeen the right route for all these companies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The result is, many of these startup companies end up \nhaving to sell to a larger company, and many of the ideas and many of \nthe job-creation opportunities are then constrained.\n  We need to make it easier for these companies to access capital. Some \nof the ideas that are going to be proposed in the legislation will do \nthat. Some of the reforms to reg A, reg D--trying to look at raising \nthe number of investors a startup company can have before they have to \nreport--all are sensible, appropriate incentives to help these startup \ncompanies get going.\n  I understand the very important requirements put in place by the so-\ncalled Sarbanes-Oxley legislation a few years back, but the cost of \ngoing public for startup companies now, on average, is $3 million to $4 \nmillion. Those costs are not costs that many of these startup companies \ncan absorb. So some of the sensible reforms that have been proposed by \nSenator Toomey and Senator Schumer that I have been a proud cosponsor \non, on a so-called on-ramp for startup companies, I think make sense as \nwell.\n  There are also other tools we can use to help startup companies as \nthey try to access capital.\n  We have seen a dramatic transformation of the Internet over the last \n20 years. Every business, every part of our life has been changed. \nThere is now the ability to use the Internet as a way for small \ninvestors to get the same kind of deals that up to this point only \nselect investors have gotten that have been customers of some of the \nbest known investment banking firms, where we can now use the power of \nthe Internet, through a term called crowdfunding. There has to be \nappropriate investor restraints under this and investor protections, \nbut crowdfunding using the Internet is another source of capital.\n  I hope that will be included in the legislation we are looking at, \nand I wish to commend Senator Bennet and Senator Merkley and Senator \nBrown for working hard on that.\n  But there are other pieces of this legislation we have to take on if \nwe are going to compete and win in this global competition for talent \nand ideas and have these jobs created in America. That is why I was so \nproud to work with Senator Moran in our startup legislation that says \nattracting capital is one part of making a company successful. Another \npart of making a company successful is winning the worldwide \ncompetition for talent. Unfortunately, time and again what we are doing \nin this country is losing that competition for the best talent. There \nare literally tens of thousands of jobs that are going unfilled right \nnow because we do not have enough American-born scientists, engineers, \nand mathematicians with graduate degrees.\n  Because we have the world's best system of higher education, we train \nmany of the world's best and brightest. But with our current \nimmigration policies, we train those folks at the Virginia Techs, the \nUniversity of New Mexicos, get them that Ph.D. in engineering, and then \nwe send them home when they have an opportunity to get a job in this \ncountry. We cannot talk to a tech company anywhere in America that says \nwe are losing the competition for talent.\n  So what does our legislation do? We actually do what tech firms have \ncalled for for years, which is, in effect, to staple that green card to \nthose individuals who get not a bachelor's degree but a master's or \nPh.D. in the science, technology, engineering or math field, the so-\ncalled STEM fields, if they have a job opportunity in America.\n  We allow that intellectual capital and talent to actually reside and \nhelp create jobs. What we do as well is create a new category--in \neffect, an entrepreneur's visa. We have a very narrow category within \nour immigration policies right now that allows certain immigrants who \nwant to come, invest in other companies in this country, and hire \nAmericans, to get access to a visa. We would expand that category.\n  So if an individual can demonstrate that they have raised capital and \nare willing to hire a number of Americans, why do we not allow them to \nstart that job in America rather than going somewhere else to do it? So \nI believe we put\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nin place small changes to our immigration policies that will, again, \nallow us to compete.\n  Our startup legislation looks at how we can encourage our \nuniversities because we need capital, we need talent, but we also need \nthe intellectual capital, and that comes from ideas. Our universities \nacross this country do a good job of doing basic research. Our \nuniversities do not do as good a job as they could and should in moving \nthose ideas from the laboratory into the marketplace.\n  I know my time is about to expire so I will wrap up. What we do in \nour legislation as well is we do not add additional funding, but we \ntake a small sliver, fifteenth-tenths of 1 percent of our existing \nresearch and development dollars, and actually use that as incentive \nfunds to get ideas out of the laboratory into commercialization.\n  So I know we are going to move to this legislation shortly. I do \nbelieve there were a number of Members, particularly newer Members, who \nhave been working on this legislation across the aisle. That was an \nattempt to put together a broad bipartisan bill. I am not sure that is \ngoing to come to pass on the Senate floor, unfortunately, because on \nthis issue I do agree with the Republican leader. This should not be \nRepublican or Democratic legislation. This should be a bipartisan piece \nof legislation that would actually encourage startups to get the \ncapital, to get the talent, to get the ideas, so we can actually make \nsure we move forward on job creation.\n  The data is clear. The jobs over the last 20 years have come from \nthese kinds of startup companies, the kind I was proud to help fund in \nmy 20 years of identifying funding and working on these startup \nventures. We need to do all we can to support them. We need to move \nthis legislation as quickly as possible. My hope is that we can move \nbeyond the rather narrowly drawn capital formation legislation that we \nare going to look at and look at these other areas around crowdfunding, \naround appropriate visa policies, around commercialization of \nintellectual capital to move these forward.\n  I am going to yield the floor for my friend and colleague, someone \nwho has been a leader on this issue as well, someone whom I know has \nbeen criss-crossing the country--over the last couple of days, \nrecently, he came back from Austin, TX, where he was celebrated as a \nstartup guru--and that is my friend, the Senator from Kansas. Let me \nalso acknowledge the Senator from South Dakota who has been a leader, \nparticularly on the regulation D reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Moran.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do appreciate the opportunity to join \nwith my colleague, Senator Moran from Kansas, to speak in support of \nthe bill that is before us, H.R. 3606, the Jumpstart Our Business \nStartups, or JOBS Act. The JOBS Act is a bipartisan bill that passed \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 390 to 23. It has also been \nendorsed by the White House.\n  Small businesses are the engines of our economy, but government \nredtape is currently preventing these businesses from creating even \nmore jobs. This commonsense bill would enable small businesses in South \nDakota and across the country to better access much needed capital so \nthey can make investments and add employees.\n  There is no reason it should not receive similar support in the \nSenate. Creating jobs should be one of our top priorities in the \nSenate. We owe it to the American people and to small businesses across \nthis country that are counting on us to do something that will make it \neasier, less expensive, and less difficult to create jobs.\n  Too often what we see coming out of Washington, DC, are policies that \nput up obstacles and barriers and impediments to our small businesses, \nmaking it more difficult and more costly to create jobs. We see that \ndaily with regulations coming out of many of the agencies in \nWashington, DC. The Senator from Kansas and I have been on the floor \npreviously talking about regulations proposed by the Department of \nLabor--85 pages worth of regulations--that would, in a very \nprescriptive way, tell farmers and ranchers how young people can work \nin their farming and ranching operations.\n  It is amazing to me the level of detail to which those regulations go \nand how prescriptive they are with regard to something that has \nhistorically in this country and traditionally been very much a part of \nour heritage; that is, the young people growing up on farms, being \ninvolved in those farming and ranching operations, making them \nprofitable. We have a Federal agency now that thinks it knows better. \nSo these 85 pages of regulations came out and suggested that there are \ncertain things young people on farms and ranches should not do--not \nonly suggested them, it says they cannot do. They cannot herd cattle \nfrom the back of a horse, cannot work around grain bins and stockyards, \ncannot work with animals that are more than 6 months old, cannot work \nat elevations or heights more than 6 feet.\n\n  These are all things the Department of Labor, in its infinite wisdom, \nhas determined they know better about farming and ranching operations \nin this country than do the people who work there. It would transform \nthe way in which family farm and ranch operations are conducted. It \nadds additional cost and barriers to these farmers and ranchers who \nwork so hard to make a living. They are the quintessential small \nbusinesses in our country. They work hard. They have a tremendous work \nethic. They are people who make their living on the land, and all they \nsimply ask from their government is that they not impose these types of \nbarriers and regulations and impediments to them doing what they do \nbest; that is, to feed the world and to create a strong and vibrant \nfarm economy.\n  So the JOBS bill that is before us takes us in a different direction \nthan all of the regulations I just referred to, which makes it more \ndifficult and more expensive for people in this country to create jobs \nand to grow their businesses. This package of bills that came over from \nthe House of Representative, which, as I mentioned, passed by a vote of \n390 to 23--there were only 23 dissenting votes in the House, an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority in support of this legislation. And it \nis because these are such commonsensical things--so commonsensical that \nthe White House has endorsed most of these bills, if not all of these \nbills.\n  They passed in the House of Representatives individually before they \nwere packaged into this particular piece of legislation that was sent \nto us by that 390-to-23 vote. They were passed individually by huge \nvotes. There is a piece of legislation, a bill that was passed in the \nHouse of Representatives, that Senator Toomey has the companion bill in \nthe Senate that passed 421 to 1.\n  We had one of those bills that passed in the House of Representatives \nby a voice vote and the legislation--the bill I have as a part of this \npackage passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 413 to 11 \nlast November. That was also included in this JOBS bill that has come \nover to us now from the House.\n  So what we want to do is make it easier for small businesses, which \nliterally are the engine and the backbone of our economy, to create \nmost of the new jobs in our economy; to do that, to create jobs, to \ninvest capital, to put their capital to work, and to make our economy \ngrow. So I would just say, by way of introduction, that I hope we \ncannot only get to this bill, get on this bill, but move quickly to \npass it through the Senate, and get it on the President's desk because \nwe do not have a lot of time to waste.\n  We all know what the statistics are. We know the high unemployment \nrate we have seen, the sluggish economic growth. We need to get this \neconomy growing again. We need to make it easier, not harder, for small \nbusinesses to create jobs and to get access to capital. Many of these \nbills in this package--this small business jobs package--really do \nfocus on the issue of capital\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nformation and allowing small businesses to have easier access to the \ncapital that will allow them to grow their companies and to grow jobs.\n  So what I would like to do--my colleague from Kansas is here. As I \nsaid, he is someone who, as a member of the Senate Banking Committee, \nhas been a leader on this legislation and on many of these issues, and \na leader, as I mentioned earlier, in fighting regulations coming out of \nWashington, DC, that make it harder and more difficult and more \nexpensive to create jobs, in particular, as I mentioned earlier--we had \nthis discussion a couple of weeks ago with regard to these Department \nof Labor regulations impacting family farms and ranchers--just one of \nmany regulations, the proliferation of regulations coming out of \nWashington, DC, that consistently are overreaching in terms of their \nimpact and what they do to create additional burdens for our small \nbusinesses.\n  So I would like to yield to my colleague from Kansas for his \nobservations and thoughts with regard to the JOBS bill that is before \nus, and what we as a Senate ought to be doing to try to create better \nconditions and a more favorable environment for our small businesses to \ncreate jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I am pleased that \nwe are here finally on a topic of significant importance to the \ncountry. We have heard for a long time about the necessity of creating \njobs, of creating an opportunity for Americans to succeed. In fact, I \nwould guess that is the primary motivation for why many of us serve in \nthe Senate: so that every generation, those who follow us, but those \neven today have the opportunity to pursue the American dream.\n  I think our goal is not to create a circumstance in which no one \nfails, but the goal is to create a circumstance in which many succeed. \nSo while it has been very disappointing that the Senate has failed for \nso long to get to the important topic that we should be addressing, job \ncreation, we are finally here today.\n  I commend the leaders of both parties for reaching an agreement that \nallows us to begin the discussion and ultimately, hopefully, pass the \nJOBS bill in a form just like the House passed a few days ago.\n  I came to this issue of job creation and innovation and \nentrepreneurship with a realization that this Congress is failing--this \nadministration is failing to address the issue of the deficit and the \nfinancial condition of our country. I believe my kids and those \nAmericans who follow us are going to be in much worse shape because the \nadministration and Congress have failed to address the issue we face \ntoday, which is our country is broke. We are spending money we do not \nhave.\n  We cannot seem to resolve that issue in a way that puts us on a path \ntoward a balanced budget. I will not ever walk away from my belief that \nis necessary. I will continue to work as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and in every capacity I have to see that we \nget our spending under control and that we are on that path toward \nbalancing the budget. Because of the failure of the administration and \nthe leadership of the Senate to address this issue of the deficit, I \nstarted looking for ways in which we could approach the deficit in \nperhaps a way that is easier for us to grasp, easier for us to deal \nwith.\n  And that is job creation, because the more people who are working the \nmore taxes that are collected and the more money comes into the coffers \nof the U.S. Treasury to pay down this tremendous debt. These two issues \nare actually related. I have tried to figure out how to explain to \nKansans why the deficit matters in whether they have a job or can \npursue a better job. The answer is that no business is going to expand, \ngrow, or invest in capital and plant and equipment and hire new people \nif they are concerned that the United States might be the next Greece--\nthe next country in which our creditors decide that we are no longer \ncapable of paying back this tremendous debt that has accrued over a \nlong period of time now and escalated in the last few years.\n  The goal of paying down the debt is certainly worthy in and of \nitself. But if we can do that, we also have the opportunity to create \nan environment in which business feels comfortable in hiring more \nemployees and adding plant and equipment and investing in their \nbusiness and growing it.\n  Today we come to the floor in support of the JOBS bill, as passed by \nthe House of Representatives, in hopes that the Senate will do so in \nshort order. It is the opportunity we have to make a tremendous \ndifference so that Americans can, today and in the future, pursue that \nAmerican dream.\n  We, over a long period of time, have created many impediments toward \nthe success of that job creation. The Senator from South Dakota talked \nabout the regulatory environment, and we have highlighted on the Senate \nfloor a major overreach that fundamentally alters the way we live our \nlives back home in Kansas in regard to family farms. Farming and \nranching in our State is a family operation. Yet the Department of \nLabor believes it is their role to tell parents what that relationship \nshould be with their own children and their ability to work on their \nown family farm. It is just an example of this mindset in our Nation's \ncapital that exists today that says we know better than the American \npeople, better than the moms and dads, about the families, about what \nis the role for a young person working on a family farming operation in \nKansas and across the country. That is an example.\n  Those regulations are there today and they are being proposed all the \ntime. In my view, if the Federal Government believes it has this \nsignificant role to play in defining the relationship between moms and \ndads and working on a farm, what can't the Federal Government tell us \nback home what we can and cannot do? If they can go so far as to--I \nguess I should say, who more than a parent cares more about the safety \nof their own children, whom they are working side by side with or \nworking with a neighboring farm? This is but one example in which we \nhave decided that the government knows best, the Department of Labor \nknows better than moms and dads.\n  Once we reach that kind of conclusion, then there is nothing off \nlimits for the Federal Government to say we know better than the \ncitizens of our country. That is a misguided approach to the Federal \nGovernment, the role that we are to play. But it is a handicap and \nhindrance toward the ability of the American people, the entrepreneurs, \nand those who believe in the free enterprise system--it is an \nimpediment to them ever pursuing that opportunity to create jobs and an \neconomy that encourages job creation.\n  I appreciate earlier Senator Warner, the Senator from Virginia, being \non the floor talking about legislation he and I are working on called \nthe Startups Act. We continue to believe there is a great opportunity \nfor entrepreneurs. In fact, research from the Kaufman Foundation shows \nthat startups less than 5 years old have accounted for nearly all of \nthe net jobs created in the United States from 1980 to 2005. In fact, \nstartups create 3 million new jobs every year.\n  What we are about today is a portion of this legislation that Senator \nWarner and I have introduced, the Startups Act, about the capital \nformation provisions of the bill. We have been working with Senators \nCoons and Rubio and others to blend these provisions into the Startups \nAct, but a portion is now on the Senate floor. I am here to commend the \nopportunity that we have today to pursue that portion of job creation. \nIt is not enough, but it is certainly a great beginning point for us in \nthe Senate to follow the lead of the House of Representatives and \ncreate an opportunity for capital formation.\n  This legislation creates tax incentives that will spur investments in \nstartups, reduce the regulatory burden and barriers that make it harder \nfor startups to grow, and win the battle for us to see that the United \nStates remains a highly competitive, innovative, entrepreneurial \nenvironment in which businesses succeed. I suppose what we say about \nbusinesses succeeding--it is not about necessarily the business success \nbut about the consequences of that success, which is that Americans \nwill have jobs, the opportunity to put food on the families' tables, \nsave for their kids' education, save for their retirement, and meet the \nresponsibilities we have as parents and members of the family.\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n  I join the Senator from South Dakota in my strong support for moving \nforward and passing this JOBS legislation. I also ask the Senate to \nconsider further legislative initiatives, such as the one Senator \nWarner and I have, to make sure we do more to create that circumstance, \nthat opportunity in America, where everybody has that opportunity to \nsucceed, and that many will.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question on jobs and the \neconomy?\n  Mr. MORAN. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the Senator's legislation. I hope it is acted \non. It is a rare day indeed when you have legislation that has \nbipartisan support, and in the case of the JOBS bills, also supported \nby the White House. That is a tremendous rarity here and one we ought \nto take advantage of. We should move the JOBS package quickly. I hope \nthe Senator's bill will enjoy similar bipartisan support and will be \nsomething we can act on as well.\n  These are the types of things that right now I think the American \npeople--certainly the people of South Dakota and the people of Kansas--\nwant to see us focus on. They want us to do things that will make it \neasier, less expensive, and less difficult to create jobs in the \ncountry and put people back to work and grow this economy and provide \nmore opportunities for Americans.\n  The question I have for the Senator from Kansas, because it bears \ndirectly on the issue of the economy and has to do with regulations and \npolicies coming out of Washington, is this: We are talking about a \npackage of legislation that would enable access for job creators and \nsmall businesses to the capital they need to invest and grow their \nbusiness and create jobs. It is enabling, in a sense, allowing better \nconditions for capital formation, especially for small businesses, \nwhich is where most of the jobs are created. There are other things the \nFederal Government is not doing that it should be doing to help the \neconomy grow and drive down input costs for people in the country.\n\n  I want to refer to the issue of fuel prices. In a State such as mine, \nwhere you have an agricultural economy, it is very dependent upon \nenergy, in terms of diesel fuel, fertilizer, and all those things that \nare incredibly dependent upon energy. It is also a rural State with a \npretty big geography, where people have to drive long distances. When \nyou see gas approach the $4 range--and in my State, it is not there \nyet, but in other States it is--that is a very serious impediment.\n  There are things we ought to be doing to open more domestic \nproduction, to allow people who want to invest in energy to do so. We \nhave lots of laws and regulations that make it more difficult, that \nprohibit it. We have what I would call some low-hanging fruit or easy \nopportunities to do that. The Keystone Pipeline is one that would bring \nabout 800,000 barrels a day into this country, where it would be \nprocessed and refined and put Americans to work and lessen the \ndependence we have on foreign oil.\n  I am curious how that impacts a State such as Kansas and how it \nimpacts job creation and small businesses, when we talk about Federal \npolicies that have a direct bearing on our economy and people's \neveryday lives, and particularly with regard to small businesses, which \nwe are talking about today.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have no doubt that the ability to have an \neconomic recovery and create jobs is, in so many ways, determined by \nwhat happens with our actions in regard to an energy policy and the \ndevelopment of our own resources.\n  Certainly, while we are here to talk about jobs today, there is a \nnational security, military stance issue that is, unfortunately, \nrelated to our strong dependence upon foreign energy supplies. This \nCongress, this administration, in my view, needs to get out of the way \nand let the private sector begin the process of meeting our country's \nenergy needs.\n  When we talk about high prices and complain about the price at the \npump, what we are complaining about is that the supply is insufficient \nto meet the demand. The supply is not increased and the demand goes up, \nand the resulting consequence is increasing prices. You can remedy that \nby increasing the supply of energy in this country. We have a vast \narray of those resources that, because of the regulations, environment, \nand the policies of the Federal Government, we are unable to pursue. \nThe market would send the message that we need more supply, but the \nregulators are in the way of making that happen.\n  In a State such as ours, as the Senator from South Dakota says, we \nhave to drive long distances. Agriculture is dependent upon natural gas \nfor fertilizer and fuel, for irrigation, and diesel fuel matters to us; \nand we have many industries that consume energy in the creation of \nmanufactured products. Every time the price goes up, the ability to \ncreate a new job goes down.\n  This country desperately needs an energy policy that is focused on \nthe production of energy, using our own resources to meet our own \ncountry's needs. It is a significant and critical component if we are \ngoing to get the economy back on track and have jobs created.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I believe sincerely--\nand I think he does--that we need a real all-of-the-above strategy. We \nought to be developing all forms of American energy, homegrown energy, \ndomestic energy. I appreciate it when the President of the United \nStates seizes upon that slogan and talks about supporting an all-of-\nthe-above strategy, but his policies tell another story. If you look at \nthings the Senator raised, such as increasing our domestic supply, \nhomegrown production, there are a series of things that would do that. \nApproving the Keystone Pipeline would be the first one. It is right \nthere--20,000 shovel-ready jobs. It is a $7 billion initial investment, \nwith 800,000 barrels of oil coming to us from Canada, as opposed to \ncoming from Venezuela and Hugo Chavez and the Middle East. It is such a \nno-brainer hanging out there for us to immediately act on.\n  Unfortunately, the administration said no to that. They also said no \nto development in Alaska, no to offshore development, no to oil shale \ndevelopment, no to streamlining permits, and no to new leases. All have \nbeen put off limits, which are the very things that would increase the \nsupply and thereby address the issue the Senator mentioned, which is \nthat we have too much demand chasing too little supply and, therefore, \ntoo high of a price, which bears on the pocketbooks of every single \nAmerican, every small business, every family.\n  We need a real all-of-the-above strategy, not just lipservice to it, \nwhich is what we get out of this administration. It is an example----\n  [Disturbance in the Gallery.]\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sergeant at Arms will restore \norder in the Senate.\n  Mr. THUNE. This is an example of where public policy directly \ninfluences economic outcome. There is no way you cannot argue that more \nsupply would lead to lower prices at the pump. For sure, more domestic \nsupply would lead to more American jobs. That is what we are talking \nabout today with jobs in the economy. That is why this issue bears \ndirectly on it.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Kansas pointing out the impact it has \nin his State on small businesses, farmers, and ranchers, who generally \nhave to drive long distances.\n  I will wrap up by simply saying again that we need to focus like a \nlaser on jobs. That is why I was pleased we were able to get the \nmajority leader and, after some time our leader to move to jobs. We \nhave lots of strategies mentioned that were going to be considered on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The real issue in the minds of the American people, in terms of \ngetting people back to work, is putting policies in place that will \nenable and make it easier and less difficult and less costly to create \njobs.\n  Briefly, in addition to the bill the Senator from Kansas talked \nabout--his bill--my legislation, which is included in the JOBS package, \npassed by 413 to 11. What it does is makes it easier for small and \ngrowing businesses to solicit investors to help them raise the capital \nthey need to create jobs and, in the process, help our economy grow.\n  Specifically, it would remove a regulatory roadblock that is \ncurrently preventing small businesses from reaching out to potential \naccredited investors and thereby allowing these job creators to more \neasily raise capital from accredited investors nationwide.\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\n  This is commonsense legislation that will enable small businesses and \nstartup companies to better access the capital they need to expand and \ncreate jobs.\n  My provision has a lot of support from American job creators around \nthe country. The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council called it \n``a long overdue solution that will widen the pool of potential funders \nfor entrepreneurs . . . to seek and secure the capital they need to \ncompete and grow. . . . Our economy will improve once entrepreneurs are \nprovided the tools, opportunities and incentives they need to hire and \ninvest.''\n  There are 175 Democrats in the House of Representatives who have \nsupported this bill as a stand-alone bill. It has been endorsed by the \nSEC's Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies. When it was \nincluded in the broader JOBS bill in the House, it passed, as I said, \nby a vote of 390 to 23. If job growth is our priority here in the \nSenate, we should not delay on moving forward with this important job-\ncreating legislation.\n  I thank my colleague from Kansas for joining me on the floor today to \ntalk about the need to pass this JOBS Act and get it on the President's \ndesk, as he said he wanted in his State of the Union Address back in \nJanuary. It represents exactly what we should be doing here in \nWashington; that is, creating a stable and productive economic \nenvironment by easing regulatory burdens and unleashing economic \npotential without adding to the national debt.\n  The Senator from Kansas very ably addressed in his remarks earlier \nthe importance of getting spending and debt under control, because that \ndoes also create conditions that are favorable to small businesses to \ninvest. If there is uncertainty out there about what the Federal \nGovernment is going to be doing in terms of borrowing and spending, it \ncreates a cloud under which it is very difficult for job creators to \ncreate jobs.\n  I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will support this \nimportant piece of legislation and ensure job creators across the \ncountry have access to the capital they need to hire and invest and \nthat we will start taking steps to address the impediments, the \nbarriers, the obstacles that are in place right now to the development \nof domestic energy production that will ease the price at the pump and \nmake it more affordable for small businesses to invest in this country.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, just to conclude, I would like to thank and \ncommend the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership on these \nissues and again express my pleasure that we are finally taking up \nlegislation that will make it easier for new businesses to raise \ncapital, creating a phase-in period for small, growing companies to \ncomply with government regulations that will help young businesses \nexpand and could ease the decision to go public, and, finally, to \nupdate our securities laws that have been in place since the 1930s to \nreflect a 21st-century marketplace so they can expand access to capital \nfor entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. And all this is done with \nthe goal of creating the circumstance where many will succeed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. COONS pertaining to the introduction of S. 2194 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COONS.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the cloture motion which \nthe clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 3606, an Act \n     to increase American job creation and economic growth by \n     improving access to the public capital markets for emerging \n     growth companies.\n         Harry Reid, Ben Nelson, Jon Tester, Charles E. Schumer, \n           Joe Manchin III, Patty Murray, Mark R. Warner, \n           Christopher A. Coons, Robert Menendez, Thomas R. \n           Carper, Joseph I. Lieberman, Debbie Stabenow, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Tom Udall, Jim Webb, Barbara Boxer.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum required \nunder rule XXII be waived for the cloture motions just filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me take a moment to review what has \ntranspired this morning.\n  Last week the House passed the pending small business capital \nformation bill by a vote of 390 to 23. President Obama has endorsed the \nbill very publicly; thus, this is a measure the Senate should consider \nexpeditiously and pass in short order.\n  The Republican leader and I have had preliminary conversations about \nhow to process this bill. Initial indications are that the Senate would \nnot be able to agree to a time agreement providing for a limited number \nof amendments; so I proceeded today to ensure consideration of at least \ntwo amendments. So, on Tuesday, the Senate will vote first on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Reed of Rhode Island amendment. That \namendment is sponsored also by Landrieu, Levin, and Brown of Ohio, \nwhich is a substitute, as I have indicated.\n  After disposition of that amendment, the Senate will next vote on a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the bipartisan Cantwell, Johnson, Graham, \nShelby Export-Import amendment. This Ex-IM Bank amendment is very \nimportant. The legislation just last year created 300,000 jobs and \naffected 2,000 communities in America. These jobs I am talking about \nare all American jobs.\n  After disposition of that amendment, the Senate would then vote on a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the underlying bill. In the meantime, I am \nalways open to unanimous consent agreements to aid in disposition of \nthe bill. So I look forward--if there are things I can help with, I \nwill be happy to do this.\n  I will say this. I spoke before my presentation here today to my \nfriend from Colorado Senator Udall. I have worked with him not for \ndays, not weeks, not months but years on an issue that is extremely \nimportant to our country; that is, an issue to help credit unions, \nwhich have been so important to our country over the years.\n  During this economic meltdown we have had around the country, in \nNevada credit unions have been a lifeblood for small businesses and \nindividuals. We have tried and worked to get this matter on the floor. \nThere is always some reason for not doing it. I understand the \nanxiousness of my friend from Colorado to have it on this bill. I will \nbe happy to see if there is a way of doing this by consent, but there \nis no other way of doing it except by consent because it is not germane \nto the bill before us.\n  As I told him, I am starting today, on my own, to begin the \nprocedural efforts to have this brought before the Senate. I think we \nhave waited long enough. There is never a good time. There is always \nsome reason of somebody that we have to do this now. This is a bill \nthat presents problems for people because a number of the banks don't \nwant this to happen. But I do, and I am going to do everything I can to \nhave this brought before the Senate.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from Colorado. If he has any \nquestions of me, I will be happy to respond to those or, if he has \nanything I can respond to in the way of any consent agreement that he \nwants or whatever, I am here at his disposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the \nmajority leader and the great work he has put forth on this important \nopportunity we have. I know the majority leader has some additional \ncomments he would like to make. But I intend to stay after the majority \nleader concludes and make my case, once again, for why this is so \nimportant.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from \nColorado, he has talked about the work I have done. I haven't done \nmuch. He has been the leader, and I have been with him all the way. \nThis is truly his issue. He is right. I have supported him from the \nvery beginning, and I admire his resilience. Each time he brings this \nup, he is pushed back for some other reason. Personally, as I told him \ntoday, it is to the point now where we are going to have a vote on \nthis.\n  There will be people coming to me, Why are you doing this? We are \ngoing to have a vote on this. Democrats and Republicans are going to \nhave to make a decision where they stand for American credit unions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, if I might, I am going to \nexpound on what the majority leader just shared with the body.\n  The whole point of what we are going to do on the JOBS Act is to \nexpand access to capital for businesses across our great country. But \nthe legislation I have introduced on a bipartisan basis that also has a \nbipartisan twin in the House of Representatives is aimed at truly small \nbusinesses. I would like to explain a little bit more about what I \nmean.\n  What we would do is, in effect, lift a regulation. We have talked \nabout deregulation in Washington, unleashing the creativity in our \nbusiness sector. What this legislation would do is deregulate an \nindustry that is raring to go to help small businesses.\n  Before I get into the specifics, I would like to thank my Republican \ncosponsors, who include Senators Olympia Snowe, Rand Paul, and Susan \nCollins. The legislation in the House has been introduced by Republican \nEd Royce, with whom I served when I was a Member of the House, and he \nhas over 40 Republican cosponsors in the effort on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  In sum, this is a bipartisan, commonsense way to create jobs and help \nour small businesses without costing taxpayers a dime. When we add the \nelements in what we are trying to do, there are positives across the \nboard.\n  The reason this is so important is that there continues to be a \nphenomenon in our country where small businesses are starving for \ncredit, but the Federal Government is standing in the way of them \nprocuring that credit. As I said to start my remarks, I am talking \nabout the smallest of small businesses. These are the men and women who \nneed $50,000, $100,000, maybe even $200,000 to move from their garage \nto a retail storefront, to renovate their sales floor or to upgrade or \npurchase equipment and, in the process, they will expand. Too often, \nfrankly, they are too small to be worth the time of banks or they don't \nfit the lending guidelines of the bank's corporate headquarters. But \ncredit unions are standing ready to lend money to these Americans to \nsupport their businesses and create jobs.\n  The leader just moved to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act; the \nacronym is the JOBS Act. That is appropriate. The House passed it last \nweek. This bill is aimed at increasing the availability of startup \ncompanies by expanding and easing the process of undergoing an IPO. \nThat is an acronym for initial public offering. That is a noble goal, \nespecially as our economy still struggles to create jobs. But the \nproblem is we are still leaving small businesses behind. Why is that? \nThe JOBS Act is aimed at companies with revenue under $1 billion. Let \nme repeat that: $1 billion, with a B. These companies may well need \nhelp with an IPO, but I am talking about offering relief to Main \nStreet.\n  In light of this, I am still committed--and I appreciate the majority \nleader's comments. I have been very persistent. I am still committed to \nallowing credit unions to increase the amount of money they can lend to \nsmall businesses and our bipartisan Small Business Lending Enhancement \nAct was the first amendment filed to this bill and I still hold hope \nthat we will find a way to include it in the bill. We ought to pass it \nimmediately. We would see immediate results if we did so.\n  Let me share a couple examples of why I think this is so important, \nand they are Colorado centric. I know the Presiding Officer makes a \npoint to talk about his home State on an ongoing basis and to highlight \nOhioans who make a difference. So let me talk about two small business \nowners in Colorado who made a difference with the help of credit \nunions.\n  Stacy Hamon owns the 1st Street Salon in Thornton, and Lisa Herman of \nBroomfield owns Happy Cakes Bakeshop in Denver's Highland Square. They \nwere turned away from their banks. In the breach, credit unions arrived \nand they lent to these two small businesswomen and they were able to \ngrow their businesses and hire their fellow Coloradans to help them in \nthose business enterprises. They didn't need a billion-dollar IPO. They \nneeded a small bridge loan. We could be making a huge difference in \nmany communities with mere pennies on the dollar of what the JOBS Act \nis focused on. If my amendment were to be considered in this JOBS Act, \nit would actually help small businesses directly create jobs.\n  Credit unions, simply put, specialize in these small business loans \nto small business. In fact, the Federal Reserve has told us that many \nbanks have quit considering loans such as those under $200,000 because \nthey aren't worth the bank's time. Credit unions know these small \nbusiness owners, and they have money to lend to them. Unfortunately, \nFederal law still limits the amount of small business loans a credit \nunion can extend to these businesses to 12 percent of their assets. \nOver 500 credit unions nationally have had to stop or slow down their \nbusiness lending because of this--I can't think of any other word but \n``strange''--strange Federal limit on helping small businesses. It is \nhard to believe. Government is telling these financial institutions \nthey can't help create jobs in their local communities, and that is why \nmy bipartisan amendment would double the amount of money credit unions \ncan offer to small businesses.\n  We have heard from the banks over the years they think it is unfair \nthey have to compete with credit unions. But the fact is, it is not \nabout banks or credit unions; it is about small businesses. I have to \nsay these two different kinds of financial institutions serve very \ndifferent small business populations. Credit unions serve the smallest \nof small businesses that often must resort to their credit cards, \nliterally, to invest in their businesses and keep their cash flow \ngoing, but in the process they create jobs. These are business owners \nwho have been, by and large, turned away by the banks. I am not talking \nabout taking business away from anyone. I am suggesting, at the very \nleast, we let the credit unions loan to these small business owners \nwhom the banks don't want to do business with because they are too \nsmall.\n  Credit unions have been in existence for over 100 years, and today \nthey only represent about 5 percent to 6 percent of all small business \nloans. Even if they were to increase their lending, if credit union \nlending were to increase and their market share were to double as a \nresult, they would still only have 7 to 9 percent of market share, and \nbanks would have nearly 90 percent of the markets for themselves.\n  Let me rebut another concern that has been expressed. The banks say \nthis proposal is unproven or somehow an unsound way of increasing small \nbusiness loans, but as I have said, the credit unions have been making \nsmall business loans since the early 1900s. There were not any limits \non how much credit unions could lend until 1998. The credit union \nsector has a regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, and \nit has endorsed lifting or even eliminating the small business lending \ncap. It just makes sense to do this, and I cannot believe we are going \nto let these squabbles between the banks and credit unions keep job \ncreators from going to work in the small small business sector.\n  There is a rush to pass the JOBS Act, which would help billion-dollar \ncompanies with their IPOs. But how about we take a little bit of time \nto help small business owners, such as Stacy and Lisa, by passing our \nbipartisan amendment? After all, if we are going to tell\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nthe American people this bill is about increasing access to capital, \nlet's start by helping the small business owners on Main Street that \nfuel our job engine. This is what we would do in Colorado. It is how we \nwould apply our commonsense approach to business.\n  I plead with my colleagues to consider the important effect this \nwould have. So, in summary, our bipartisan amendment is projobs, it is \nderegulatory, and it would not cost the taxpayers a dime. It would \nrelease $10 billion in capital across our country and, conservatively, \n100,000 new jobs would be a result.\n  Let's take this up. Let's fuel the economic engine with the capital \nof our small business sector.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nnoon in a colloquy with the distinguished majority whip. Senator Ayotte \nand a number of other Senators will join us during the next 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1696-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1696-S1711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know Senator Durbin, Senator Ayotte, and \nothers will be coming to the Senate floor, but let me get it started. \nAccording to the United Nations, more than 8,000 Syrians have been \nmurdered in attacks by the desperate regime of President Bashar al-Asad \nof Syria.\n  We continue to receive press reports on a daily basis about Asad's \nforces summarily executing, imprisoning, and torturing demonstrators \nwho want nothing more than what we take for granted, which is to live \nin freedom in a democracy. This week we learned that dozens of Syrian \nwomen and children--some infants as young as 4 months old--were \nstabbed, shot, and burned by government forces in Homs. I know it is \ndifficult for most of us to comprehend--and most of us would be so \nrepulsed by it, we would not want to comprehend the kind of brutality \nAsad is perpetrating against his own people. Yet in the face of these \natrocities, Russia continues to prop up the Asad regime by providing \narms that are being used to slaughter these innocent Syrian civilians.\n  Russia is the top supplier of weapons to Syria and reportedly sold \nSyria up to $1 billion or more worth of arms just last year. Western \nand Arab governments have pleaded with Russia to stop supplying these \nweapons to the Asad regime, but it has refused so far.\n  Russia is not just passively supplying weapons to the Asad regime, it \nhas recently admitted to having military weapons instructors on the \nground in Syria training Asad's Army on how to use these weapons. \nRussian weapons, including high-explosive mortars, have been found at \nthe site of atrocities in Homs.\n  This picture taken by Al Arabiya and Reuters reads:\n\n       Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, why don't you visit \n     Homs to see your weapons and their effectiveness in the \n     bodies of our children!\n\n  The Syrian people recognize Russia's role in their current misery, as \nreflected by this picture and by this statement to Russian Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov. Rosoboronexport is Russia's official arms \ndealer. This company handles about 80 percent of Russia's weapons \nexports, according to its Web site, and it is spearheading Russia's \ncontinuing effort to arm the Asad regime, which, in my mind, makes them \nan accessory to mass murder.\n  I see the distinguished majority whip has come to the floor, and I \nwant to give him a chance to make any appropriate remarks he cares to \nmake and engage in a colloquy with him.\n  First, let me close my comments on this concern I have. Not only is \nRussia selling arms to Syria to kill innocent civilians, but you can \nimagine my shock and dismay when I found out that our own Department of \nDefense has a no-bid contract with this same Russian arms merchant that \nis helping arm the Asad regime.\n  This is a no-bid contract to provide approximately 21 dual-use Mi-17 \nhelicopters for the Afghan military. As I said, this is a no-bid Army \ncontract that was awarded last summer that is reportedly worth as much \nas $900 million. So the only thing I can conclude is that the U.S. \ntaxpayer is providing money to a Russian arms dealer to purchase \nRussian helicopters for the Afghan military, and the very same arms \nmerchant is arming President Asad's regime and killing innocent \nSyrians.\n  I, along with 16 of my colleagues, have sent a letter to Secretary \nPanetta expressing our alarm and concern over these arrangements, \nasking for further information and urging them to reconsider this \ncontract with Rosoboronexport.\n  I want to stop on this point: We must keep the pressure on the \nDepartment of Defense to reconsider this contract and on the Russians \nto cease all arms sales to the Asad regime.\n  I am hopeful that the upcoming debate on the repeal of Jackson-Vanik \nwill provide an opportunity for the Senate to further examine these \nserious issues.\n  Again, let me state my appreciation to Senator Durbin, the \ndistinguished majority whip, for his participation in expressing alarm \nand concern over these circumstances and ask him to make any comments \nhe cares to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my honor to join my colleague and \nfriend, the Senator from Texas. We are on opposite sides of the aisle, \nbut we are on the same side of this issue.\n  Listen to what America has said about what is happening in Syria: \nAlmost 8,000 innocent people have been killed in the streets of Syria \nby Bashar Asad, the dictator. The people who expressed their concern \nand objection to his policies are mowed down and killed in the streets, \ntheir homes are bombed, and nothing is being done. Sadly, the United \nStates tried to engage the United Nations Security Council to join the \nArab League and others condemning what Asad is doing to these innocent \npeople. Our efforts were stopped by China and Russia.\n  The relationship between Russia and Syria is well documented. They \nhave been close allies for many years. We also know they are providing \nabout $1 billion in Russian military aid to the Syrian dictator to kill \nhis own people in the streets. That is part of this.\n\n  I have to join Senator Cornyn in saying how concerned we were when we \nlearned that one of the leading military exporters of Russia, \nRosoboronexport, is not only doing business in Syria but with the U.S. \nGovernment. Now, I understand the history. We are buying Russian \nhelicopters to help the Afghans defend their country against the \nTaliban. The helicopter of choice in Afghanistan today is, I believe, \nthe old Soviet M 17 or M 18 helicopter. So our government is buying \nthese Russian helicopters to give to the Afghan Government to fight the \nTaliban.\n  We are, in fact, doing business with the very same company and \ncountry that is subsidizing the massacre in Syria. It is right for us, \nas Members of Congress, to make that point to Secretary Panetta and the \nDepartment of Defense. I think it is also appropriate for us to ask why \nwe are not converting the Afghan defense forces, their security forces, \nto another helicopter.\n  Can I be so bold as to suggest it be made in the United States of \nAmerica since we are paying for it? Why aren't we doing that? Why \naren't we creating jobs in America and training these Afghans on \nhelicopters that come from our country, that are as good or better than \nanything the Soviets ever put in the air? I don't have a preference on \nan American helicopter. I don't have any producers in my State, so I am \nnot into that particular bidding war. I would not get into it. But I do \nbelieve sending a word to the Russians immediately that our \nrelationship of buying these helicopters for Afghanistan and \nsubsidizing their military sales to Syria should come to an end. That \nis what this letter is about.\n  We cannot pass resolutions on the Senate floor condemning the \nbloodshed in Syria and ignore the obvious connection: Russian military \nis moving arms into Syria that are used to kill innocent people.\n  I noticed the Senator from Texas brought a photograph with him. This \nphotograph I am going to show is one of a Russian warship, an aircraft \ncarrier, docked at the Syrian port of Tartus on January 8 of this year. \nWhat we could not turn into a poster is the video clip showing the \nRussian warship\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\ncaptains being greeted like royalty by the Syrian Minister of Defense \nwho went out to welcome the ship. This Russian aircraft carrier was \nlaunched from a port used by the same export company.\n  I cannot go any further in saying that the particular company \ninvolved sent goods on this particular ship, but the fact is obvious. \nRussia has become a major supplier of military arms to the Syrian \ndictator who is killing innocent people. We are doing business with \nthat same military company, Rosoboronexport.\n  It is time for us to step back and say to the Russians: We can no \nlonger continue this relationship. If you are going to subsidize the \nkilling of innocent people, we cannot afford to do business with you.\n  America, we have to acknowledge the obvious. No matter what they are \npaying, it is not worth the loss of innocent life in Syria.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for joining me. I think we have 16 or \n17 colleagues who are joining us in the bipartisan effort to raise this \nissue.\n  I hope the Russians will understand that once and for all they can't \nplay both sides of the street, and we in the United States should draw \nthe line.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is the Senator aware the very same arms merchant, \nRosoboronexport, has also been documented selling weapons to Iran and \nVenezuela? As a matter of fact, according to one published report, as \nlate as 2005, Rosoboronexport sold Iran 29 Tor-M1 anti-air missile \nsystems worth $700 million. And Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps \nsuccessfully tested this anti-air missile system in 2007. It is also \nreported that in 2012, Russia will deliver T 72 tanks, BMP3 infantry \nfighting vehicles, and BTR 80A armored personnel carriers to \nVenezuela--just at our back yard in South America. Also, in the last 5 \nyears in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, a dictator with strong ties to Cuba \nand Fidel Castro, bought $11 billion worth of arms through \nRosoboronexport.\n  I wonder if the Senator finds that surprising or alarming.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Texas, a point the Senator said \nearlier, and I think bears repeating at this moment in our dialogue, is \nthat Rosoboronexport is a Russian state-controlled arms export firm. \nThis is no so-called private company. This is a firm run by the Russian \nGovernment. As the Senator from Texas goes through the litany of \ncountries they are supplying, he is going through a litany of countries \nthat have never in recent times had the best interests of the United \nStates at heart. If the Russians, through their government company, \nwant to supply Iran--which we know is an exporter of terrorism not only \nin the Middle East but around the world and in the United States--if \nthey want to supply them, if they want to supply sniper rifles and arms \nto the Syrians to kill their own people--why in the world are we doing \nbusiness with them? There ought to be a line we draw at some point. We \nhave no moral obligation to do business with a firm that is, in fact, \nsupplying those who are killing innocent people and our enemies around \nthe world.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for raising those points.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would also ask the distinguished \nmajority whip whether he is aware of the testimony within the last \ncouple of weeks before the Armed Services Committee of Secretary \nPanetta and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The testimony \nfocused a lot of attention on Iran, the principal state sponsor of \ninternational terrorism in the world today, and its destabilizing \ninfluence in the Middle East. Iran is seeking, as they are, a nuclear \nweapon which would at the very least create a nuclear arms race in the \nMiddle East and a consequential destabilizing effect in that region.\n  I know the Senator is aware that Syria is one of the principal \nproxies for Iran. General Dempsey and Secretary Panetta both said if \nSyria were to go by the wayside, as various other countries have in the \nArab spring, that it would be a serious blow to Iran's aspirations for \nhegemony in the Middle East and something that is dangerous to the \npeace and stability of that important region. I know the Senator is \naware of the close relationship between Syria and Iran, and I wonder if \nthe Senator cares to comment on that connection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Texas--and I am sure he \nhas studied this, as I have--it is hard to parse out the elements in \nthe Middle East and decide who is fighting for which team. But when it \ncomes to Syria, they have consistently aligned themselves with Iran, \nand in that alliance Iran has been very supportive of Syria and \nHezbollah, another terrorist group that is operating primarily through \nSyria. So that close connection is a matter of concern to me.\n  Our goal in the Middle East is to create stability and to stop the \nmarch of these dictators in the Middle East who are killing innocent \npeople and denying them their most basic rights. We have tried \neverything short of military intervention, which I would not call for \nin the Syrian situation. But we have tried everything else--diplomatic \nand economic--to put pressure on Syria. We should continue to, and we \nshould join with other nations and continue the efforts of the United \nNations.\n  But we can't get this job done when Russia plays the roll of outlier, \nsupplying both Syria and Iran with military arms and support. If they \nwant to truly join us in a stable situation in the Middle East, they \nshould tell Asad it is over--and it clearly is over. This man could \nnever legitimately govern Syria from this point forward after killing \nso many innocent people.\n  I hope what we are doing today is suggesting to this administration \nand Secretary Panetta another avenue to let the Russians know that we \nfind it unacceptable for them to supply arms to what is a destabilizing \ninfluence in that part of the world.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I can't recall whether I asked unanimous \nconsent, but if I haven't done it up to this point, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter we are referring to that 17 Senators sent to \nSecretary Panetta be printed in the Record at the close of these \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know there are other Senators and \nsignatories of this letter who may well be coming to the floor to talk \nmore about this issue, but I wish to express my gratitude to Senator \nDurbin. It is important that the United States speak out on behalf of \npeople who have no real voice in defense of their most basic human \nrights. I would point out that President Asad and his regime are not \nonly killing innocent civilians, but also are being supplied by Russia, \nwho also--maybe not coincidentally--vetoed the sanctions the U.N. was \nconsidering with regard to Iran.\n  So it is very important that we not only speak up on behalf of the \npeople who have no voice and no defense, but also make sure the U.S. \nGovernment, at a very minimum, isn't doing business with the very same \narms merchants that are supplying weapons to President Asad with which \nto kill innocent Syrians.\n  I am advised that Senator Ayotte was planning on coming. She is a \nsignatory to this letter and a member of the Armed Services Committee \nwho shares many of these same concerns. However, she is not going to be \nable to come at this time. I am sure she will be coming to speak on \nthis later.\n  So with that, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Texas for speaking with me on \nthis issue. We have been working on it together.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2012.\n     Hon. Leon R. Panetta,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Panetta: We write to express our grave \n     concern regarding the Department of Defense's ongoing \n     business dealings with Rosoboronexport, the same Russian \n     state-controlled arms export firm that continues to provide \n     the Syrian government with the means to perpetrate widespread \n     and systematic attacks on its own people. According to the \n     United Nations, over 7,500 Syrian civilians have reportedly \n     been killed in the attacks by the desperate regime of\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n     Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and we continue to receive \n     grisly accounts that his government forces are summarily \n     executing, imprisoning, and torturing demonstrators and \n     innocent by-standers.\n       Russia remains the top supplier of weapons to Syria, \n     selling reportedly $1 billion or more worth of arms to Syria \n     in 2011 alone. Its arms shipments to Syria have continued \n     unabated during the ongoing popular uprising there. According \n     to Thomson Reuters shipping data, since December 2011, at \n     least four cargo ships have travelled from the Russian port \n     used by Rosoboronexport to the Syrian port of Tutus. Another \n     Russian ship that was reportedly carrying ammunition and \n     sniper rifles, weapons which Syrian forces have used to kill \n     and injure demonstrators, reportedly docked in Cyprus in \n     January and then went on to deliver its cargo directly to \n     Syria. In addition, recent reports from human rights \n     monitoring organizations confirm that Russian weapons such as \n     240mm F 864 high explosive mortars have been found at the \n     site of ongoing atrocities committed against civilians in \n     Homs, Syria. In January of this year, Rosoboronexport \n     reportedly signed a new deal with the Syrian government for \n     36 combat jets.\n       Even in the face of crimes against humanity committed by \n     the Syrian government during the past year, enabled no doubt \n     by the regular flow of weapons from Russia, the United States \n     Government has unfortunately continued to procure from \n     Rosoboronexport. It is our understanding that the DoD, \n     through an initiative led by the U.S. Army, is currently \n     buying approximately 21 dual-use Mi 17 helicopters for the \n     Afghan military from Rosoboronexport. This includes the \n     signing of a no-bid contract worth $375 million for the \n     purchase of aircraft and spare parts, to be completed by \n     2016. Media reports indicate that the contract included an \n     option for $550 million in additional purchases, raising the \n     contract's potential total to nearly $1 billion.\n       While it is certainly frustrating that U.S. taxpayer \n     funding is used to buy Russian-made helicopters instead of \n     world-class U.S.-made helicopters for the Afghan military, \n     our specific concern at this time is that the Department is \n     procuring these assets from an organization that had for \n     years been on a U.S. sanctions list for illicit nuclear \n     assistance to Iran and in the face of the international \n     community's concern is continuing to enable the Assad regime \n     with the arms it needs to slaughter innocent men, women, and \n     children in Syria. Other options are very Rely available as \n     demonstrated by the fact that the first four Mi 17 \n     helicopters that the U.S. Navy purchased for Afghanistan came \n     through a different firm. We ask that the DoD immediately \n     review all potential options to procure helicopters legally \n     through other means.\n       U.S. taxpayers should not be put in a position where they \n     are indirectly subsidizing the mass murder of Syrian \n     civilians. The sizeable proceeds of these DoD contracts are \n     helping to finance a firm that is essentially complicit in \n     mass atrocities in Syria, especially in light of Russia's \n     history of forgiving huge amounts of Syria's debt on arms \n     sales, as occurred in 2005 during President Assad's state \n     visit to Moscow.\n       President Obama has called on President Assad to step down, \n     and he has declared that ``Preventing mass atrocities and \n     genocide is a core national security interest and a core \n     moral responsibility of the United States.'' As such, we urge \n     you to use all available leverage to press Russia and Russian \n     entities to end their support of the Assad regime, and that \n     includes ending all DoD business dealings with \n     Rosoboronexport, which is within your authority as Secretary \n     of Defense. Continuing this robust business relationship with \n     Rosoboronexport would undermine U.S. policy on Syria and \n     undermine U.S. efforts to stand with the Syrian people.\n       This is a serious policy problem, and we ask for your \n     personal attention to help solve it Thank you for your \n     service to our nation and your dedication to the members of \n     our Armed Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Cornyn; Kirsten E. Gillibrand; Richard J. Durbin; \n           Kelly Ayotte; Richard Blumenthal; James E. Risch; David \n           Vitter; Sherrod Brown; Chuck Grassley; Marco Rubio; Jon \n           Kyl; Robert Menendez; Roger F. Wicker; Robert P. Casey, \n           Jr.; Mark Kirk; Ron Wyden; Benjamin L. Cardin.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been in the House and Senate for a \nnumber of years. After a while, we detect certain trends. One of the \nthings I am wary of, having seen over the years the abuses associated \nwith it, are these freight train bills that seem as though they are \nmoving so fast, with big majority support--bills that oftentimes will \npass one Chamber or the other and come roaring into the other Chamber \nand maybe pass too quickly and usually with regret.\n  At a later point someone stops and reflects and says: We went too \nfar. We didn't read into this all the things that could occur. We \nshould have taken a little more time because at the end of the day a \nlot of innocent people suffer.\n  The Senate historically has been the Chamber--I served in the House, \nbut the Senate historically has been the Chamber that has, as George \nWashington characterized it, been the saucer that cools the tea. As I \nsaid, I served in the House of Representatives, and with elections \nevery 2 years, as the Presiding Officer knows, many Members of the \nHouse move quickly on issues because here comes another election \ncampaign and Members don't want to miss an opportunity. The Senate, \nwith longer terms and a different set of rules, tries to be more \ndeliberate--sometimes too deliberate, I might add, but at least has \nthat charge under our Constitution.\n  The reason I am raising this point is we have a bill that is coming \nover from the House, and the Republican leader has been frantic to \nbring this bill to the Senate floor. It is characterized by the \nRepublicans as a House jobs bill. It is, in fact, a bill which relates \nto startups, new businesses, and the regulatory requirements of these \nbusinesses. The bill basically exempts a large number of new startup \ncompanies from basic regulation.\n  I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord, dated March 13 of this year, by Mary Schapiro who is the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Securities and Exchange\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Shelby: Last week, \n     the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606, the \n     ``Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.'' As the Senate \n     prepares to debate many of the capital formation initiatives \n     addressed by H.R. 3606, I wanted to share with you my \n     concerns on some important aspects of this significant \n     legislation.\n       The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission is \n     three-fold: protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly \n     and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. \n     Cost-effective access to capital for companies of all sizes \n     plays a critical role in our national economy, and companies \n     seeking access to capital should not be hindered by \n     unnecessary or overly burdensome regulations. At the same \n     time, we must balance our responsibility to facilitate \n     capital formation with our obligation to protect investors \n     and our markets. Too often: investors are the target of \n     fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities. As \n     you know, if the balance is tipped to the point where \n     investors are not confident that there are appropriate \n     protections, investors will lose confidence in our markets. \n     and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult \n     and expensive.\n       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of a \n     bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation \n     and includes certain promising approaches, I believe that \n     there are provisions that should be added or modified to \n     improve investor protections that are worthy of the Senate's \n     consideration.\n\n\n                 Definition of Emerging Growth Company\n\n       The ``IPO On-Ramp'' provisions of H.R. 3606 provide a \n     number of significant regulatory changes for what are defined \n     as ``emerging growth companies''. While I share the view that \n     it is important to reduce the impediments to smaller \n     businesses conducting initial public offerings in the United \n     States, the definition of ``emerging growth company'' is so \n     broad that it would eliminate important protections for \n     investors in even very large companies, including those with \n     up to $1 billion in annual revenue. I am concerned that we \n     lack a clear understanding of the impact that the \n     legislation's exemptions would have on investor protection. A \n     lower annual revenue threshold would pose less risk to \n     investors and would more appropriately focus benefits \n     provided by the new provisions on those smaller businesses \n     that are the engine of growth for our economy and whose IPOs \n     the bill is seeking to encourage.\n\n\n             Changes to Research and Research Analyst Rules\n\n       H.R. 3606 also would weaken important protections related \n     to (1) the relationship between research analysts and \n     investment bankers within the same financial institution by \n     eliminating a number of safeguards established after the \n     research scandals of the dot-com era and (2) the treatment of \n     research reports prepared by underwriters of IPOs.\n       H.R. 3606 would remove certain important measures put in \n     place to enforce a separation between research analysts and \n     investment bankers who work in the same firm. The rules \n     requiring this separation were designed\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\n     to address inappropriate conflicts of interest and other \n     objectionable practices--for example, investment bankers \n     promising potential clients favorable research in return for \n     lucrative underwriting assignments--which ultimately severely \n     harmed investor confidence. In addition, H.R. 3606 would \n     overturn SRO rules that establish mandatory quiet periods \n     designed to prevent banks from using conflicted research to \n     reward insiders for selecting the bank as the underwriter. I \n     am concerned that the changes contained in H.R. 3606 could \n     foster a return to those practices and cause real and \n     significant damage to investors.\n       In addition, the legislation would allow, for the first \n     time, research reports in connection with an emerging growth \n     company IPO to be published before, during, and after the IPO \n     by the underwriter of that IPO without any such reports being \n     subject to the protections or accountability that currently \n     apply to offering prospectuses. In essence, research reports \n     prepared by underwriters in emerging growth company IPOs \n     would compete with prospectuses for investors' attention, and \n     investors would not have the full protections of the \n     securities laws if misled by the research reports.\n\n\n              Disclosure. Accounting and Auditing Matters\n\n       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to make \n     scaled disclosures, in an approach similar to that currently \n     permitted under our rules for smaller reporting companies, \n     and would provide other relief from specific disclosure \n     requirements, during the 5-year on-ramp period. While there \n     is room for reasonable debate about particular exemptions \n     included in the disclosure on-ramp, on balance I believe \n     allowing some scaled disclosure for emerging growth companies \n     could be a reasonable approach.\n       H.R. 3606, however, also would restrict the independence of \n     accounting and auditing standard-setting by the Financial \n     Accounting Standards Board (``FASB'') and the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB''). These provisions \n     undermine independent standard-setting by these expert \n     boards, and both the FASB and the PCAOB already have the \n     authority to consider different approaches for different \n     classes of issuers, if appropriate.\n       Moreover, H.R. 3606 would exempt emerging growth companies \n     from an audit of internal controls set forth in Section \n     404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act during the five-year on-ramp \n     period. IPO companies already have a two-year on-ramp period \n     under current SEC rules before such an audit is required. In \n     addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently exempted smaller \n     public companies (generally those with less than $75 million \n     in public float) from the audit requirement, which already \n     covers approximately 60 percent of reporting companies. I \n     continue to believe that the internal controls audit \n     requirement put in place after the Enron and other accounting \n     scandals of the early 2000's has significantly improved the \n     quality and reliability of financial reporting and provides \n     important investor protections, and therefore believe this \n     change is unwarranted.\n\n\n                     ``Test the Waters'' Materials\n\n       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to ``test \n     the waters'' to determine whether investors would be \n     interested in an offering before filing IPO documents with \n     the Commission. This would allow offering and other materials \n     to be provided to accredited investors and qualified \n     institutional buyers before a prospectus--the key disclosure \n     document in an offering--is available.\n       There could be real value to permitting these types of pre-\n     filing communications: it could save companies time and \n     money, and make it more likely that companies that file for \n     IPOs can complete them. Indeed, there are some SEC rules that \n     permit ``test the waters'' activities already. However, \n     unlike the existing ``test the waters'' provisions, the \n     provisions of H.R. 3606 would not require companies to file \n     with the SEC and take responsibility for the materials they \n     use to solicit investor interest, even after they file for \n     their IPOs. This would result in uneven information for \n     investors who see both the ``test the waters'' materials and \n     the prospectus compared to those who only see the prospectus. \n     In addition, as with the provisions relating to research \n     reports, it could result in investors focusing their \n     attention on the ``test the waters'' materials instead of the \n     prospectuses, without important investor protections being \n     applied to those materials.\n\n\n           confidential filing of ipo registration statements\n\n       H.R. 3606 would permit emerging growth companies to submit \n     their registration statements confidentially in draft form \n     for SEC staff review. This reduction in transparency would \n     hamper the staff's ability to provide effective reviews, \n     since the staff benefits in its reviews from the perspectives \n     and insights that the public provides on IPO filings. It also \n     could require significant resources for staff review of \n     offerings that companies are not willing to make public and \n     then abandon before making a public filing. SEC staff \n     recently limited the general practice of permitting foreign \n     issuers to submit IPO registrations in nonpublic draft form \n     because of these concerns, and expanding that program to all \n     IPOs could adversely impact the IPO review program.\n\n\n                              Crowdfunding\n\n       H.R. 3606 also provides an exemption from Securities Act \n     registration for ``crowdfunding,'' which would permit \n     companies to offer and sell, in some cases, up to $2 million \n     of securities in publicly advertised offerings without \n     preparing a registration statement. For the past several \n     months, the staff has been analyzing crowdfunding, among \n     other capital formation strategies, and also has discussed \n     these strategies with the Commission's newly created Advisory \n     Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.\n       I recognize that proponents of crowdfunding believe this \n     method of raising money could help small businesses harness \n     the power of the internet and social media to raise small \n     amounts of very early stage capital from a large number of \n     investors. That said, I believe that the crowdfunding \n     exemption included as part of H.R. 3606 needs additional \n     safeguards to protect investors from those who may seek to \n     engage in fraudulent activities. Without adequate \n     protections, investor confidence in crowdfunding could be \n     significantly undermined and would not achieve its goal of \n     helping small businesses.\n       For example, an important safeguard that could be \n     considered to better protect investors in crowdfunding \n     offerings would be to provide for oversight of the industry \n     professionals that intermediate and facilitate these \n     offerings. With Commission oversight, these intermediaries \n     could serve a critical gatekeeper function, running \n     background checks, facilitating small businesses' provision \n     of complete and adequate disclosures to investors, and \n     providing the necessary support for these small businesses. \n     Commission oversight would further enhance customer \n     protections by requiring intermediaries to protect investors' \n     and issuers' funds and securities, for example by requiring \n     funds and securities to be held at an independent bank or \n     broker-dealer.\n       Investors also would benefit from a requirement to provide \n     certain basic information about companies seeking \n     crowdfunding investors. H.R. 3606 requires only limited \n     disclosures about the business investors are funding. \n     Additional information that would benefit investors should \n     include a description of the business or the business plan, \n     financial information, a summary of the risks facing the \n     business, a description of the voting rights and other rights \n     of the stock being offered, and ongoing updates on the status \n     of the business.\n\n\n            Changes to Section 12(g) Registration Thresholds\n\n       H.R. 3606 also would change the rules relating to the \n     thresholds that trigger public reporting by, among other \n     things, increasing the holder of record threshold that \n     triggers public reporting for companies and bank holding \n     companies. The current rules have been in place since 1964, \n     and since that time there have been profound changes in the \n     way shareholders hold their securities and in the capital \n     markets.\n       Last spring, I asked our staff to comprehensively study a \n     variety of capital formation-related issues, including the \n     current thresholds for public reporting. At this point, I do \n     not have sufficient data or information to assess whether the \n     thresholds proposed in H.R. 3606 are appropriate. I do \n     recognize that a different treatment may be appropriate for \n     community banks that are already subject to an extensive \n     reporting and regulatory regime.\n\n\n                               rulemaking\n\n       H.R. 3606 requires a series of new, significant Commission \n     rulemakings with time limits that are not achievable. For \n     example, the rulemaking for the crowdfunding section has a \n     deadline of 180 days, and it specifically requires the \n     Commission to consider the costs and benefits of the rules. \n     Given (1) that much of the data that would be used to perform \n     such analyses is not readily available and (2) the complexity \n     of such analyses, this time frame is too short to develop \n     proposed rules, perform the required analyses, solicit public \n     comments, review and analyze the public comments, and adopt \n     final rules. I believe a deadline of 18 months would be more \n     appropriate for rules of this magnitude.\n       I stand ready to assist Congress as it addresses these \n     important issues. Please call me, at (202) 551 2100, or have \n     your staff call Eric Spitler, Director of the Office of \n     Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 551 2010, \n     should you have any questions or comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Schapiro,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Securities and Exchange Commission is a Federal \nagency created under the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nafter the Great Depression. When the stock market cratered in the Great \nDepression, Franklin Roosevelt stepped up and said: We need an agency \nthat will oversee and regulate Wall Street so that people who would \ncare to invest in American companies can have confidence they are \ninvesting in a company and a process that follows a rule of law. There \nwill be transparency and disclosure by these companies on a regular \nbasis, by formula, as to what they are earning, what they are losing, \nand what their assets may be.\n  That has continued for almost 80 years. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission has created in the process a credible market in the United \nStates of America for the sale of equities and\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nsecurities. Now comes this bill from the House of Representatives, this \nso-called jobs bill, which wants to change that. They are suggesting \nwhen certain companies get started--startup companies--they be excused \nfrom requirements under the law from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. The argument is that there is too much paperwork, too many \nregulations, and smaller startup companies can't get started because \nthere are too many legal requirements.\n  Well, we first took a look at what they consider to be smaller \ncompanies getting started, and they define them as companies with $1 \nbillion a year in annual revenue--$1 billion. Unfortunately, those who \nmake over $1 billion in revenue in a year comprise only about 10 \npercent of American businesses. That means by definition they are \ncharacterizing 90 percent of American businesses and startups as small \nbusinesses that need a special break when it comes to regulation.\n  So over the years we got into a debate--whether it is the regulation \nof banks or the regulation of these startup companies or those that are \ngoing public, selling securities--over the years we got into a debate \nabout whether the government has gone too far. Are there too many \nrules? I am open to that suggestion. I think we should be open to it. \nIf there is a way to protect the public and investors and still create \nbusinesses in this country that generate jobs, I want to hear about \nthem and I want to support them. But too often we go too far. When we \ngo too far and are not careful, some terrible things occur.\n  The letter I have now entered into the Record from Mary Schapiro of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission addresses this bill. She said:\n\n       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of \n     bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation \n     and include certain promising approaches, I believe that \n     there are provisions that should be added or modified to \n     improve investor protections that are worthy of the Senate's \n     consideration.\n\n  The administration has said they are open to the idea of changing \nsome of these laws. What Mary Schapiro, the Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, has suggested is that we put provisions in the \nbill in the Senate which will protect investors.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the testimony before the committee. I commend \nto my colleagues the statement of Professor John Coffee, Adolf A. \nBerle, professor of law from Colombia University Law School, at a \nhearing before the Senate Banking Committee on December 1, 2011.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues, many of whom have just seen a \nfew press accounts of this bill, to consider carefully the statement \nmade by Professor Coffee. He has analyzed this bill and raised some \nimportant questions about whether it goes too far.\n  I will be joining some of my colleagues in offering a substitute \nwhich improves the law for startup companies but also makes certain \nthat we protect investors and makes certain as well that at the end of \nthe day we don't end up with egg on our faces. How many times has \nCongress been called on, when the private sector runs amok, goes too \nfar, and starts failing in every direction, to bail them out? We saw it \nmost graphically with the bailout of the major banks not that many \nyears ago. We have seen it in the past with the bailout of the savings \nand loan industry. We have seen it happen time and time again.\n  Who ends up holding the bag when government regulation is not \nadequate to make sure people don't go overboard? The American \ntaxpayers. They end up holding the bag, not to mention innocent victims \nalong the way.\n  I understand we have to change the law, but I am hoping we can change \nit in a constructive way. Opening the sale of stocks and securities to \neveryone who can pull up a chair and open a laptop is not in the best \ninterests of investors across America. It is certainly not in the best \ninterests of many Americans who would find themselves losing their \nlife's savings and any investment funds they might have in the process. \nMaking certain the people who sell these stocks are, in fact, \nregistered and credible; making certain the statements they make can be \nbacked with hard evidence as opposed to a promise; and making sure, as \nwell, that we have, in the process of business undertaking, the \nsafeguards in place so there will not be excessive--as I said \nyesterday--irrational exuberance that leads to the failure of any \nmarketplace or securities--that, to me, is the best thing we can \nachieve.\n  I think these two items to which I have referred--both from Mary \nSchapiro, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well \nas Professor Coffee--establish the case for being careful. Let's not \njump on this freight train and watch it as it plows into a barricade. \nLet's make certain that what we do is thoughtful, that it does engender \neconomic growth but not at the expense of the integrity of America's \nfinancial markets or at the expense of innocent investors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The senior Senator from Minnesota \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nbe permitted to speak as in morning business for the next 90 minutes, \nwith the majority controlling the first 45 minutes--with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each--and the \nRepublicans controlling the final 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am honored to be here today with \nthe women Senators to talk about the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--a law that has a history of passing this Chamber \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  I would note that there are many authors of this bill--I think up to \nsomething like 58 authors currently--and the women who are speaking \ntoday include myself and Senators Feinstein, Hagan, Murkowski, Shaheen, \nMurray, and Boxer. Also sponsoring the bill are Senators Collins, \nSnowe, McCaskill, Gillibrand, Cantwell, Landrieu, Mikulski, and \nStabenow. The bill is led by Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo. So we are \nhere today to pledge our support for this bill and to ask our \ncolleagues to move forward with this bill.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was a landmark bill when it first \nbecame law back in 1994. Back then, it started a sea change in \nattitudes about violence against women, and it sent a strong message to \nthe country saying that sexual assault and domestic violence are \nserious offenses that will not be tolerated. We heard that message \nloudly and clearly in my State, and I am proud to say that our State \nhas always had a strong tradition of standing against these crimes. In \nfact, no conversation in our State about domestic abuse would be \ncomplete without mentioning former Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife \nSheila, whom we miss dearly. The Wellstones put so much time and energy \ninto bringing these issues out of the shadows and taking a subject that \nmany people considered at the time a ``family matter'' and saying: You \nknow what, domestic violence is not something we can just sweep under \nthe rug; it is a crime. It hurts families, it hurts children, and we \nare going to do something about it.\n  While I led the prosecutor's office in Hennepin County, MN, for 8 \nyears, we put a lot of focus on the victims' needs and particularly the \nchildren's needs in domestic violence cases because it does not take a \nbruise or a broken bone for a child to be a victim of domestic \nviolence. Kids who witness domestic violence are victims too. In fact, \nwe had a poster on the wall in our office. It was a poster of a woman \nwith a bandaid on her nose, holding a baby, and it said: Beat your wife \nand your kid will go to jail. Do you know why? The statistics show that \nkids who grow up in violent homes are 76 times more likely to commit \nacts of domestic violence themselves. It is a sobering number, and \noverall the statistics for these kinds of crimes are staggering. More \nthan one in three women in the United States have experienced rape, \nphysical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their \nlifetime. Every year, close to 17,000 people lose their lives to \ndomestic violence.\n  So, once again, this is not just a family matter, this is a matter of \nlife and death--and not just for the victims but oftentimes for the law \nenforcement officers who are all too often caught in the line of fire. \nI have seen this in my\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nown State. In fact, I saw it just a few months ago when I attended the \nfuneral of Shawn Schneider, a young police officer in Lake City, MN.\n  Officer Schneider died after responding to a domestic violence call. \nA 17-year-old girl was being abused by her boyfriend. When Officer \nSchneider arrived at the scene, he was shot in the head. He literally \ngave his life to save another. I attended his funeral, and I still \nremember those three little children--the two boys and the little girl \nwith the blue dress with stars on it--going down that aisle of the \nchurch. When you see that, you realize that the victims of domestic \nviolence are not just the immediate victims, it is an entire family, it \nis an entire community.\n  We know all too well just how devastating domestic violence and \nsexual violence can be to victims, as well as to entire communities, \nwhich is why it was such a good thing that 6 weeks ago we passed a VAWA \nreauthorization bill out of the Judiciary Committee and that the bill \nhas the support of 58 Senators, including 6 Republicans. I am glad this \nbill has continued to attract bipartisan support. I wish it was \nunanimous. Just 7 years ago, in fact, the reauthorization bill passed \nthe House by a vote of 415 to 4, and it passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent with 18 Republican cosponsors. I know this year some of my \nRepublican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are not supportive of \nthis bill, but it is my hope that while they may disagree with the \nbill, they will not stop this bipartisan bill from advancing. Combating \ndomestic violence and sexual assault is an issue on which we should all \nbe able to agree.\n  Many of the provisions in the reauthorization bill made important \nchanges to current law. The bill consolidates duplicative programs and \nstreamlines others. It provides greater flexibility in the use of grant \nmoney by adding more ``purpose areas'' to the list of allowable uses. \nIt has new training requirements for people, providing legal assistance \nto victims. And it takes important steps to address the \ndisproportionately high domestic violence rates in Native American \ncommunities.\n  The bill also fills some gaps in the system, and I am pleased to say \nit includes legislation I introduced with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nto address high-tech stalking--cases where stalkers use technology such \nas the Internet, video surveillance, and bugging to stalk their \nvictims. The bill will give law enforcement better tools for cracking \ndown on stalkers. Just as with physical stalking, high-tech stalking \nmay foreshadow more serious behavior down the road. It is an issue we \nneed to take seriously. We need the tools for our law enforcement to be \nas sophisticated as what is used by those who are breaking the law.\n  I know Senator Feinstein is coming soon, and we have a number of \nwomen who are going to be speaking today. I want to remind everyone in \nthis Chamber that domestic violence takes its toll. One of the most \nmemorable cases I had was when our office prosecuted the case of a \nwoman who was killed in Eden Prairie, MN. She was a Russian \nimmigrant. Her husband was a Russian immigrant. They did not have many \nfriends in the community. She was fairly isolated. She was most likely \na domestic violence victim for many, many years. Well, one day this man \nkilled his wife. He then took her body parts down to Missouri. He left \nsome of the body parts there. And the entire time, he had their 4-year-\nold daughter in the car with him. He then drove back to Minnesota and \nconfessed to the crime.\n\n  When they had the funeral, there was only me, our domestic violence \nadvocate, the grandparents who had come from Russia, and this woman's \nidentical twin sister. What had happened at the airport when they \narrived was that this little 4-year-old girl--who had never seen her \naunt, who had never seen her mother's identical twin sister--ran down \nthat hallway when she saw her aunt for the first time and hugged her \nand said: Mommy, mommy, mommy, because she thought her mom was back.\n  It reminds us all that domestic violence is not just about one \nvictim; it is about children, it is about family, and it is about a \ncommunity.\n  We all know this bill has always enjoyed broad bipartisan support. \nThe women of the Senate know it. There are already three Republican \nwomen on this bill and many others, I hope, to come. We believe in this \nbill. We ask our colleagues to support this bill.\n  I see my colleague Senator Feinstein is here. I know as a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee--she and I are the only two women members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee--she has taken a lead on this issue for \nmany, many years.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor her remarks. For a long time, I had been the only woman on the \nJudiciary Committee, and I am just delighted that she is there as well \nand that we share the same point of view with respect to this bill.\n  I rise today to urge the Republican leadership of the Senate to allow \nthis piece of legislation that protects American women from the \nplague--and it is a plague--of domestic violence, stalking, dating \nviolence, and sexual assault to come to the floor of this Senate for a \nvote.\n  I was in the Judiciary Committee, and I voted for the original \nViolence Against Women Act. It was authorized for 6 years. We \nreauthorized it. It served another 6 years. And now the bill is up for \nreauthorization. It came out, surprisingly, from the Judiciary \nCommittee on a split vote. Unfortunately, that was a party-line vote. I \nmight say, I was stunned by this vote because never before had there \nbeen any controversy--in more than a decade and a half, in all of this \ntime--about this bill.\n  This act is the centerpiece of the Federal Government's effort to \ncombat domestic violence and sexual assault, and it has positively \nimpacted the response to these crimes at the local, State, and Federal \nlevels, and I hope to show this.\n  The bill authorizes a number of grant programs administered by the \nDepartments of Justice and Health and Human Services to provide funding \nfor emergency shelter, counseling, and legal services for victims of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  As a matter of fact, I was thinking last night, when I was mayor of \nSan Francisco back in the early 1980s, I started the first home for \nbattered women, which is La Casa de las Madres. We were able to fund it \nbecause it was such a critical need. Women being battered had no place \nto go and therefore, often stayed in the home where they were battered \nagain and again.\n  This bill also provides support for State agencies, rape crisis \ncenters, and organizations that provide services to vulnerable women.\n  American women are safer because we took action. Today, more victims \nreport incidents of domestic violence to the police, and the rate of \nnonfatal partner violence against women has decreased by 53 percent \nsince this bill went into effect in 1994. These figures are from the \nDepartment of Justice. So here we have a 53-percent decrease in the \nrate of nonfatal partner violence.\n  The need for the services was highlighted in a recent survey by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that, on \naverage, 24 people per minute are victims of rape, physical violence, \nor stalking by an intimate partner in the United States--24 a minute by \nan intimate partner in the United States. Over the course of the year \nnow, that equates to more than 12 million women and men.\n  In California, my State, 30,000 people accessed crisis intervention \nservices from one of California's 63 rape crisis centers in 2010 and \n2011. These centers primarily rely on Federal Violence Against Women \nAct funding--not State funding--to provide services to victims in \ncommunities.\n  In 2009 alone, there were more than 167,000 cases in California in \nwhich local, county, or State police officers were called to the scene \nof a domestic violence complaint. Madam President, 167,000 cases--that \nis many.\n  Despite the fact that the underlying bill has 58 cosponsors from both \nparties, not a single Republican member of the Judiciary Committee \nvoted to advance the legislation.\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n  Now, the bill that came out of Judiciary does have some changes, and \nI want to talk about them for a moment. It creates one very modest new \ngrant program. It consolidates 13 existing programs. It reduces \nauthorization levels for all other programs by nearly 20 percent. And \nthe savings--17 percent. The bill is reduced in cost by 17 percent. \nThat is $136 million. It encourages effective enforcement of protective \norders. That is a big problem. Women get protective orders, and they \nare violated because they are not enforced. And it reduces the national \nbacklog of untested rape kits. It is a real problem if a jurisdiction \ncannot test a rape kit.\n  Yet there are some who refuse to support it because it now includes \nexpanded protections for victims. Let me put this on the table. The \nbill's protections extend to lesbian and gay victims of domestic abuse. \nIt includes undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. \nThe bill also gives Native American tribes better prosecutorial tools \nto fight crimes of domestic violence. In my view, these are \nimprovements. Domestic violence is domestic violence.\n  I ask my friends on the other side, to the victim in a same-sex \nrelationship, is the violence any less real, is the danger any less \nreal because you happen to be gay or lesbian? I do not think so. If a \nfamily comes to the country and the husband beats his wife to a bloody \npulp, do we say: ``Well, you are illegal. I am sorry. You do not \ndeserve any protection?'' No, we do not. And 9 1 1 operators and police \nofficers do not refuse to help victims because of their sexual \norientation, or the country in which they were born, or their \nimmigration status. When you call the police in America, they come \nregardless of who you are.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011 is supported \nby 50 national religious organizations, including the Presbyterian \nChurch, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the \nNational Council of Jewish Women, the National Council of Catholic \nWomen, the United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church.\n  I go back to my days as mayor of San Francisco when I saw over and \nover again, up close and personal, what happens because of domestic \nviolence. I saw police getting killed when they intervened in \nsituations involving domestic violence. We had a number of funerals for \npolice officers in Oakland which I attended. It all stemmed from \ndomestic violence.\n  To defeat this bill is almost to say that we do not need to consider \nviolence against women, that it is not an important issue. It is. It is \nnot a partisan issue. It never has been in this body, which is why, \ncandidly, I am surprised I find myself on the floor urging that this \nbill be brought to the floor, because it has been historically, through \ntwo reauthorizations, and is a bipartisan bill.\n  You can't help but notice that this is not the first time a policy \nwhich would specifically imperil the health and safety of American \nwomen has compelled some of us to come to this floor and speak out on \nbehalf of American women.\n  I hope that opposition to this bill is not part of a march, and that \nmarch, as I see it, over the past 20 years has been to cut back on \nrights and services to women. And I mean that most sincerely. I have \nnever seen anything like it. When I came here, there were discussions \nabout Roe v. Wade. When I first went on the Judiciary Committee, which \nwas in 1993, I heard it. There were debates over Supreme Court \nopinions--Casey, et al.--and then there were debates over partial \nabortion. Then this year we fought against the Blunt amendment which \nwould have effectively allowed employers to arbitrarily decline to \nprovide critical preventive health care services for women.\n  You know, we had to fight for the simplest things. I think young \nwomen forget that it took until 1920 for women to get to vote in this \ncountry. It was only because women fought for it. And we have fought \nsince the country was established for the right to vote, for the right \nto inherit property, for the right to go to school. Now we fight for \nour rights to have sufficient services from the government with respect \nto our health.\n  Now I am here to fight for a bill that strengthens laws and protects \nwomen against domestic violence and sexual assault. To me, this bill is \na no-brainer. It has the support of both sides of the aisle. It is \nbipartisan. It saves lives. It is a lifeline for women and children who \nare in distress, who have no place to go or to stay and have to submit \nto domestic violence abuse. And no one can say I am exaggerating. Trust \nme, I have seen it. I have seen the bruised bodies up close and \npersonal.\n  This bill has reduced the number of domestic assaults on women. The \nrecord indicates that. It should be continued. It is a no-brainer. I \nhope it is brought to the floor. I hope we maintain a bipartisan vote. \nI hope it is reauthorized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much. We have now been joined by the \nSenator from Washington Mrs. Murray, who has spent a long time fighting \nfor domestic violence bills.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, \nfor her longtime advocacy, and our colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar, for leading the effort to reauthorize this critically \nimportant bill to protect women in this country from violence.\n  I was very proud to be here with the Senator from California back in \n1994 when we first passed the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, as \nwe call it. We created a national strategy for dealing with domestic \nviolence, and since we took that first historic step, VAWA has been a \ngreat success in coordinating victims' advocates, social service \nproviders, and law enforcement professionals to meet the immediate \nchallenges of combating domestic violence.\n  This law has helped provide lifesaving assistance to hundreds of \nthousands of women and their families. It has been supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans, along with law enforcement officers, \nprosecutors, judges, victim service providers, faith leaders, health \ncare professionals, advocates, and survivors. VAWA has attained such \nbroad support for one reason: It has worked. Since it became law 18 \nyears ago, domestic violence has decreased by 53 percent. And while \nincidents have gone down, reporting of violence and abuse has gone up. \nMore victims are finally coming forward and more women and families are \ngetting the support and the care they need to move themselves out of \ndangerous situations. As a result of the language in this law, every \nsingle State has made stalking a crime. They have all strengthened \ncriminal rape statutes.\n  We have made a lot of progress since 1994, but we still have a long \nway to go. Every single minute, 24 people across America are victims of \nviolence by intimate partners--more than 12 million people a year--and \n45 percent of the women killed in this country die at the hands of \ntheir partner. In 1 day last year, victims of domestic violence made \nmore than 10,000 requests for support and services that could not be \nmet because the programs did not have the resources.\n  That is why I was so proud to cosponsor and strongly support the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act, and that is why I join my \ncolleagues today in proudly expressing our hope that we can move this \ncritical legislation when possible. This is a bipartisan bill which \nwill advance our efforts to combat domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assaults, and stalking. It will give our law enforcement \nagencies the support they need to enforce and prosecute these crimes. \nIt will give communities and nonprofits the much needed resources to \nsupport victims of violence and, most important, to keep working to \nstop violence before it ever starts.\n\n  This bill was put forward in a bipartisan fashion. It is supported by \nhundreds of national and local organizations that deal with this issue \nevery day. It consolidates programs to reduce administrative costs. It \nadds accountability to make sure tax money is well spent. It is \nbuilding on what works in the current law, improves what does not, and \nwill help our country continue on the path of reducing violence toward \nwomen.\n  It should not be controversial. We reauthorized this law last time \nhere in the Senate unanimously by voice vote, and President Bush signed \nit into law\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nwith Democrats standing there with him. So I am hopeful that the \nbipartisanship approach to this issue continues today as we work to \nreauthorize this law once again because this should not be about \npolitics. Protecting women against violence should not be a partisan \nissue.\n  I thank the Democrats and Republicans who worked together to write \nthis bill. I am very glad it passed through committee. I stand ready to \nsupport this bill when it comes to the floor, and I truly hope we can \nget it to President Obama for his signature in a timely fashion so \nwomen and families across this country can get the resources and \nsupport this law will deliver.\n  Finally, many of us women have come to the floor so many times over \nthe last few weeks to fight back against attempts to turn back the \nclock when it comes to women's health care, as the Senator from \nCalifornia just talked about. I am disappointed that these issues keep \ncoming up, but I know I stand with millions of men and women across \nAmerica who remain ready to defend the gains we have made over the last \n50 years and who think we should be moving forward, protecting and \nsupporting more women and families, and not moving backward. That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I thank our Presiding Officer for \nbringing this forward, and the comments from the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from California are really highlighting the \nissues we are talking about.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues to support the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act. I stand here today during National Women's \nHistory Month to urge my colleagues to take swift action on a bill that \nis critical to the well-being of women, our families, and our country.\n  As Hillary Clinton declared more than 15 years ago in Beijing at the \nFourth World Conference on Women, ``Human rights are women's rights, \nand women's rights are human rights. If we take bold steps to better \nthe lives of women, we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of \nchildren and families too.''\n  It is disheartening in the last several months that petty \npartisanship and gamesmanship have held up policies critical to women's \nhealth, including this act. Since its original passage in 1994, the \nbill has made tremendous progress in protecting women from domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking. The bill has transformed our \ncriminal justice system and victim support services. It has encouraged \ncollaboration among law enforcement, health and housing professionals, \nand community organizations to prevent and respond to domestic partner \nviolence. It has funded programs such as services-training-officers-\nprosecutors grants, or STOP grants, which are used to provide \npersonnel, training, technical assistance, and other equipment to \nbetter apprehend and prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes \nagainst woman.\n  Unfortunately, until Congress takes action on the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act, the well-being of women across our country \nhangs in the balance. I see this as a serious lapse in our \nresponsibility as Senators. As a mother of two daughters, I am here to \ntell you that this reauthorization cannot wait.\n  The rate of violence and abuse in this country is astounding and \nunacceptable. According to a 2010 CDC survey, domestic violence alone \naffects more than 12 million people each year. In the year leading up \nto the CDC study, 1.3 million women were raped. And this study showed \nthese women are severely affected by sexual violence, intimate partner \nviolence, and stalking, with one in four women falling victim to severe \nphysical violence by an intimate partner. Domestic violence also has a \nsignificant impact on our country's health, costing our health care \nsystem alone over $8.38 billion each year.\n  The reauthorization of this act strengthens and streamlines crucial \nexisting programs that really protect women. In fact, title V of the \nreauthorization includes a bill that I sponsored titled ``Violence \nAgainst Women Health Initiative,'' and this legislation consolidates \nthree existing health-focused programs, while strengthening the health \ncare system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking. This initiative fosters public health responses \nto domestic violence and sexual violence. It provides training and \neducation to help health professional respond to violence and \nabuse, and it supports research on effective public health approaches \nto end violence against women.\n\n  Since my time in the North Carolina State Senate, where I served 10 \nyears, I have been dedicated to combating violence against women. While \nI was a State senator, I led the effort to ensure that local law \nenforcement tested rape kits to convict the perpetrators of sexual \nassault. It was astounding to me to discover that after a woman had \nbeen raped and she had an examination where DNA was collected, that \nrape kit test would actually sit on a shelf in a sheriff's office or \npolice station and would not be analyzed. Sadly, the evidence would \nonly be analyzed if a woman could identify her attacker. What other \nvictims in America have to identify their attacker before law \nauthorities will take action?\n  When I first discovered this and brought it up, I was told there was \nnot enough money for every rape kit to be tested. We soon found the \nmoney. But there are States today that still have these rape kits \nsitting on shelves unanalyzed.\n  For all the progress we have made, combating violence against women \nmust continue to be a priority and must be a priority in every State in \nthe country.\n  As I take the floor in support of the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, it is fitting to recognize one of our fiercest \nadvocates for women's rights--my colleague and mentor Senator Barbara \nMikulski, who, on Saturday, will become the longest serving female \ncongressional Member in history.\n  For more than 35 trailblazing years, Senator Mikulski has been a \nstrong and unwavering voice for women, families, and the people of \nMaryland. She shepherded through the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which helps \nensure that no matter your gender, race, religion, age, or disability, \none will receive equal pay for equal work. She fought tenaciously for \nher important amendment to the health care reform legislation, ensuring \nthat women's preventive care would be covered with no added out-of-\npocket expense.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her mentorship, her leadership, and her \nfierce advocacy for women's rights. I look forward to continuing to \nwork alongside Senator Mikulski and my colleagues to promote policies \nthat support our women, our children, and our families and put them on \na path to a brighter future. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct is central to that goal, and I urge my colleagues to take up this \nbill and pass it without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we have now been joined by Senator \nMurkowski of Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am proud to be able to stand to \nspeak about the Violence Against Women Act, joining with some of my \ncolleagues on the floor.\n  This is legislation I have supported in the past and look forward to \nsupporting again. As we talk about those issues women care about, it is \nno surprise to most that we are talking about what is happening with \nthe price of gas or the cost to fill the car tank and we are talking \nabout the quality of our children's education and we are talking about \nthe Postal Service in Alaska. We had a military townhall, and I met \nwith some military spouses. They were quite concerned that some of the \nfacilities they access are perhaps in jeopardy. We care about the \nsecurity of our jobs and our spouses' jobs, and our friends' and \nneighbors' jobs and all that goes into working in a small business. We \ncertainly care about our country's fiscal situation and the very dire \nsituation we are in.\n  There is something else we all care about, which is the violent \nassaults women often endure--sisters, daughters, neighbors. The \nViolence Against\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nWomen Act is an important commitment to victims of domestic violence \nand sexual abuse. This is a promise that resources and expertise are \navailable to prosecute those who would torment them. Also, it is a \nreason to believe that one can actually leave an abusive situation and \ntransition to a more stable one. It is of the greatest importance that \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault are confident there is \na safety net available to address them and their immediate survival \nneeds, as well as the needs of their children. Only on this level of \nconfidence can one muster the courage to leave an abusive situation. \nThese are some of the promises that are contained within the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  There are additional reasons I feel as strongly as I do about the \nreauthorization of this act which relate to the safety of the people in \nAlaska. Unfortunately, as beautiful as the State is that I live in, our \nstatistics as they relate to domestic violence and sexual assault are \nhorrific. They are as ugly as they come.\n  Nearly one in two Alaskan women has experienced partner violence. \nNearly one in three has experienced sexual violence. Overall, nearly 6 \nin 10 Alaskan women have been victims of sexual assault or domestic \nviolence. In Alaska, our rate of forcible rape between 2003 and 2009 \nwas 2.6 times higher than the national rate. Unfortunately, very \ntragically, about 9 percent of Alaskan mothers reported physical abuse \nby their husbands or partner during pregnancy or in the 12 months prior \nto pregnancy.\n  We have to do all we can to get a handle on these tragic statistics. \nAs we know, they are more than just statistics; these are the lives of \nour friends, our neighbors, and our daughters. The Violence Against \nWomen Act presents the tools to do so. In the villages of rural Alaska, \noftentimes, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence face some \npretty unique challenges. Many of these villages have no full-time law \nenforcement presence whatsoever--nobody to turn to, no safe house, no \nplace to go. A single community health aid must tend to every crisis \nwithin the community, including caring for victims of sexual assault \nand domestic violence. Oftentimes, they don't have the tools they \nneed--the rape kits, the training.\n  Oftentimes, we will have a situation where weather can be an \nimpediment to getting the victim on a plane and to a rural hub. In most \nof my communities--80 percent of them--there is no road out, no way to \nget out. If someone has been violated, and there is no law enforcement \nor shelter or nowhere to go, what do they do? Basically, the victim is \nstranded in their own community with the perpetrator for, potentially, \ndays before help can arrive.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is a ray of hope for those victims of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault within our villages. It devotes \nincreased resources to rural and isolated communities, and it \nrecognizes Alaska's Village Public Safety Officer Program as law \nenforcement so VAWA funds can be directed to providing a full-time law \nenforcement presence in places that currently have none. It establishes \na framework to restart the Alaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement \nCommission, which is an important forum for coordination between law \nenforcement and our Alaska Native leaders to abate the scourge of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault.\n  I too believe the Senate needs to take up the Violence Against Women \nAct. I do feel strongly that we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. I \nam a cosponsor of the bill. Some of my colleagues do have some \nconcerns. I have said we need to take these concerns into account so we \ncan have--and we should have--an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill. This \nis too important an issue for women and men and families to not address \nit.\n  I know others wish to speak. I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleagues.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we thank the Senator from Alaska. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I will yield our remaining time to \nSenators Mikulski and Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I strongly urge that the Violence \nAgainst Women Act come up on the floor so we can look at the issues and \ndebate them in an open and public forum. If people have amendments to \neither add or subtract from the bill or improve the bill, let's do it \nbecause this is a compelling situation.\n  I have been here since we passed the first bill in 1994. The original \narchitect of it was Senator Joe Biden, who is now our Vice President. \nWhy did we do it? It is a compelling need. One in four women will be \nthe victim of domestic violence; 16 million children are exposed to \ndomestic violence each year; 23 million will be a victim of physical or \nsexual violence--20,000 in my State of Maryland.\n  Since we created the legislation in 1994, the national hotline has \nreceived over 1 million calls when women felt they were in danger. So \nthose 1 million people had a chance of being rescued. Who has the \nbiggest request for passing the Violence Against Women Act? It is not \nonly the women of America; it is also local police. One out of four \npolice officers killed in the line of duty is responding to domestic \nviolence calls. When they go to a home, they have a checklist to \ndetermine how dangerous the situation is. Is it simply a spat or a \ndispute or are they in a danger zone?\n  We debate big issues--war and peace, the deficit, and all these are \nimportant--but we have to remember our communities and our families. I \nthink if someone is beaten and abused, they should be able to turn to \ntheir government to either be rescued and to put them on a safe path \nand also to have those very important programs early on to do \nprevention and intervention. We fund this bill. I stand ready to \nsupport the passage of the bill and putting the money in the checkbook \nto support it.\n  I will leave time now for other Senators. I will yield the floor, but \nI will not yield on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on \nthe floor to support this crucial legislation to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act. It provides essential services to women and \nfamilies across the United States.\n  I have seen in my home State of New Hampshire where one program I \nwish to talk about funds Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors. \nIt is called STOP. It provides law enforcement the tools they need to \ncombat domestic violence. This was a lifesaving service for a women \nnamed Kathy, who was in an abusive relationship for 6 years.\n  Kathy was being abused as often as twice a week, frequently leaving \nher with black eyes and bruises. Once her partner Mark threw her down \nthe stairs. Things worsened after the couple had their house foreclosed \non. One day, Mark grabbed Kathy by the throat, lifted her off the floor \nand dropped her and began punching her again and again in front of \ntheir 3-year-old child. That was the last straw.\n  Kathy finally mustered the courage to contact a friend who helped her \ncall the local police. Kathy obtained a temporary domestic violence \nrestraining order and Mark was charged with assault.\n  As is often the case, the criminal and civil procedures overwhelmed \nand frustrated Kathy. At times, she even considered dropping the whole \nthing. But, fortunately, funding from the Violence Against Women Act \nmade it possible for Kathy to have an attorney who could help her. \nThanks to this assistance from STOP and the Violence Against Women Act, \nKathy was able to obtain sole custody of her children, as well as \nsupport payments, and ultimately she was able to make a fresh start, \nfree from abuse.\n  Some critics of this legislation have said that the Violence Against \nWomen Act ``has done little or no good for real victims of domestic \nviolence.'' They have said that these funds ``have been used to fill \nfeminist coffers and to lobby for feminist objectives.'' I think Kathy \nwould disagree.\n  This body should not be divided on this issue, and I am so pleased \nthat Senator Murkowski has joined us today. Ending the horrific, \ndegrading and painful cycle of domestic abuse is an effort that must \ntranscend party affiliation.\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\n  We know these programs work, and I know that we have a strong and \neffective leader in Susan Carbon, who is a former judge and now the \nDirector of the Office of Violence against Women at the U.S. Department \nof Justice. Susan Carbon is from New Hampshire and in my time as \nGovernor of New Hampshire, I was privileged to have Susan as a member \nof the Governor's Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence, and she \nchaired our Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee.\n  Susan has been in the trenches. She has seen what happens when women \nare unable to obtain help for themselves and for their families, and \nshe knows that VAWA helps save lives. She needs these essential \nprograms to be reauthorized as quickly as possible in order to continue \nher great work.\n  There are too many victims who need our help. It is time to tell \nthem, ``We hear you and we know you're out there even if you're not \nspeaking up right now. We want to help you find your voice.'' We have \nthe chance to make a difference, and the American people are depending \non us to act.\n  Madam President, I urge the leaders to bring the Violence against \nWomen Reauthorization Act to the floor, and I implore my colleagues to \nunite around this important effort.\n  This body should not be divided on this issue. As I said, I am so \npleased to have Senator Murkowski join us on the Senate floor today to \npoint out that this is a bipartisan issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is hard to believe we are having this \ndebate about protecting women from violence in 2012, but we are.\n  But then again, we have spent much of this year fighting attempts to \nlimit women's access to contraception and preventive healthcare; we \nhave seen a woman called names for fighting for women's health.\n  Here we are again on the floor because the women of the Senate are \nnot going to stop standing up and speaking out to protect the health \nand lives of women in our country.\n  Let's be clear: The Violence Against Women Act has always been \nbipartisan. It has always had overwhelming support.\n  And I would know. In 1990, then-Senator Joe Biden came to me and \nasked me to be the House author of his bill, the Violence Against Women \nAct. At that time, violence against women was a silent epidemic and I \nwas so grateful that he asked me to help bring this issue out of the \nshadows.\n  It was a slow but steady path to victory, and by the time it passed \nas part of the 1994 crime bill, I was a member of the Senate, proudly \nworking by Senator Biden's side to get the votes we needed. It was one \nof my most memorable moments in the Senate. We finally had a law to \nhelp local law enforcement and the legal system combat violence against \nwomen and provide essential services for women struggling to rebuild \ntheir lives.\n  The results have been breathtaking. Since the Violence Against Women \nAct became law, incidents of domestic violence have decreased 53 \npercent, reporting of domestic violence has increased as much as 51 \npercent, and more victims are coming forward and getting life-saving \nhelp. One survey found that more than 67,000 victims were served by \ndomestic violence programs--on one day alone.\n  So it was no surprise that in 2005 the Senate voted unanimously to \nreauthorize this important law. Not one Senator objected to its \npassage. It has always been bipartisan. So why the change now?\n  After all these years, after all the victims who have been helped and \nthe criminals who have been prosecuted, why on Earth are some \nRepublicans holding this up? What is it about this bill that they \nsuddenly don't like?\n  Is it the funding for shelters to protect women from harm, abuse, \neven death? Do they object to provisions that ensure that abusive \nspouses will be arrested after committing family violence? Do they \nobject to measures that declare that all people in the United States \nshould have the same right to be free from crimes of violence motivated \nby gender? Do they oppose safety provisions that protect women on \npublic transit and in public parks? Do they object to the fact that the \nbill consolidates programs within the VAWA office--reducing \nadministrative costs?\n  It is hard to imagine that anything other than politics is at work \nhere--and victims of domestic violence deserve better.\n  The women of America are watching us. They expect all of us--men, \nwomen, Democrats, Republicans and independents--to come together as we \nhave before to stop domestic violence, to punish the perpetrators and \nhelp the victims rebuild their lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                JOBS Act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me return to the pending business \nbefore the Senate--the JOBS Act. At the same time, when millions of \nAmericans are looking for work, we have an opportunity to do something \nin a bipartisan way that will actually help job creators and \nentrepreneurs.\n  Despite all the hype about economic improvements, we are still \nexperiencing the slowest and weakest recovery since the Great \nDepression. More than 45 million Americans are on food stamps. \nUnemployment has been higher than 8 percent for 3 years. There are \n700,000 fewer jobs today than when President Obama took office. I \nrepeat: 700,000 fewer jobs today. On top of that, of course, gas prices \nare skyrocketing.\n  As I noted on Monday, I believe the President is painting a too rosy \npicture of the economy when he is out campaigning. He stated there have \nbeen 24 consecutive months of private sector job growth. But I would \nlike to note how the numbers tell a different story. Economists \ngenerally agree that for employment to just hold even, about 150,000 \njobs need to be created each month in order to employ the new people, \nthe new entrants, into the job market or the workforce, and these \ninclude people such as those who have recently graduated, those who \nhave concluded military service or other family obligations. Again, \nabout 150,000 each month need to be created just to stay even.\n  The logical question to ask is, How many of the last 24 months saw a \njob growth above 150,000? The answer is, only 10 of those 24 months. In \nother words, job creation has been high enough to keep pace with the \nnew force entrants only 10 months out of the last 2 years. In fact, \nprivate sector job creation was actually lower this last February than \nit was in January. This is according to a chart on the President's own \ncampaign Web site.\n  So we clearly need better public policy to put people back to work--\nlegislation that will actually spur job creation. Practically every \nbill that has come to the floor in the last 3 years has been labeled a \njobs bill, but to an Orwellian effect. Even bills such as ObamaCare and \nDodd-Frank, which imposed massive new costs on businesses, were called \njobs bills by their supporters. But, finally, with the JOBS Act now \npending, we have a rare occasion to pass a bill that Republicans and \nDemocrats agree will help create jobs.\n  The House overwhelmingly passed the bill 390 to 23--majorities in \nboth parties, and the President has issued a Statement of \nAdministration Policy endorsing the legislation. So this is something \nwe should move forward with. The JOBS Act will demonstrate to \nentrepreneurs and job creators that we value what they do, that we want \nto make it easier for them to innovate, to gain access to capital to \ngrow and to lift others up as they become more successful.\n  America has many dynamic companies and fast-growing businesses with \nthe potential to create many more. The people behind successful \ncompanies are driven by the satisfaction that comes from creating and \ninnovating and solving problems, and in many cases they are making \nproducts or providing services that improve our quality of life. This \nis a good thing. It deserves our support.\n  Good public policy--hurdles to opportunity, on the other hand--can \nhelp people accomplish their goals, and this bill will help to solve \nsome of this by getting those hurdles out of the way. For example, the \nJOBS Act will help to cut some of the redtape that burdens startup \ncompanies. One of the best overhauls is a reduction in the costly \nregulatory burdens contained in the infamous Sarbanes-Oxley section \n404(b) accounting rules. Reducing this burden means growing companies \ncan spend\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nless time on paperwork and more time on raising capital and growing \ntheir businesses. These are companies that have the potential to be the \nnext Groupon, Yelp, or LinkedIn--three companies that didn't exist a \ndecade ago and all of which recently had initial public offerings.\n  Here is what the Chamber of Commerce had to say in support of the \nHouse-passed bill.\n\n       The JOBS Act would enhance capital formation needed to \n     build new businesses, expand existing businesses and create \n     jobs. . . . [It] would put into place several important and \n     in some cases overdue reforms that would incentivize initial \n     public offerings (IPOs).\n\n  Part of the beauty of this bill is we don't even know who will \nbenefit from its policy reforms. It applies to everybody. It is the \nopposite of the crony capitalism that provided government funds to \ncompanies such as Solyndra and General Motors. Indeed, this is \nlegislation that will demonstrate what the private sector can do when \ngovernment promotes freedom and opportunity. It will show we don't need \ngovernment to try to create jobs or make ham-fisted attempts to play \nventure capitalist.\n  Because this is such good bipartisan legislation, it is deeply \ntroubling to hear it is being stalled right here in the Senate. The \nfront-page headline of the Congressional Quarterly this morning reads: \n``Democrats Move to Slow `Jobs' Bill.''\n  The article notes that passage appears unlikely this week as \nDemocrats try to add controversial provisions to the bill which do not \nhave broad bipartisan support.\n  If this bill does not pass, or if the Senate Democrats add poison \npills, it will be quite obvious this is part of a broader political \nstrategy--one that relies on a ``do-nothing Congress.'' That is the \ncampaign theme the President has been running on.\n  If Congress actually does something in a bipartisan way that helps \nmany Americans, well, it will undermine his narrative. He is relying on \ncongressional dysfunction to keep that narrative going, and that is why \nwe have to rise above it.\n  Yes, this is a cynical conclusion, but if this bipartisan bill is \nderailed, it will be hard to draw any other. It was our understanding, \nwhen we all agreed to go to the bill, it would be considered under \nregular order. This bill is too important to play procedural games, \nsuch as filing cloture and filling the parliamentary tree and the like.\n  I urge my colleagues not to stall this bill or to jeopardize its \npassage with partisan provisions. Let's get this bill to the \nPresident's desk. Our first priority should be helping Americans get \njobs, not strategizing to save the President's job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sunshine Week\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this is Sunshine Week--a week that is \nobserved annually to point out the public's business ought to be public \nand that government, except in the cases of national security, should \nbe open to public inspection. This week coincides with the birthday of \nJames Madison, the Founding Father known for his emphasis on checks and \nbalances in government and advocacy of open government.\n  Open government and transparency are essential to maintaining our \ndemocratic form of government. Although it is Sunshine Week, I am sorry \nto report that contrary to the proclamations President Obama made when \nhe took office 3 years ago--and he made them, in fact, within hours \nafter his swearing in--that 3 years later the Sun still isn't shining \non the public's business in Washington, DC. So there is a real \ndisconnect between the President's words and the actions of his \nadministration.\n  On his first full day in office, President Obama issued a memorandum \non the Freedom of Information Act. This memo went to the heads of \nexecutive agencies. In it, the President instructed these executive \nagencies to ``adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to \nrenew their commitment to the principles embodied in the Freedom of \nInformation Act, and usher in a new era of open government.''\n  We all know actions speak louder than words. Unfortunately, based on \nhis own administration's actions, it appears the President's words \nabout open government and transparency are words that can be ignored. \nIf not ignored by the President--and maybe well-intended on the part of \nthe President--being ignored down to the bowels of the bureaucracy.\n  Given my experience in trying to pry information out of the executive \nbranch, and based on investigations I have conducted, and inquiries by \nthe media, I am disappointed to report that President Obama's \nstatements about transparency are not being put into practice. In other \nwords, it is a little bit like ``business as usual.'' I had the same \nproblems when we had Republican Presidents. But based upon the \nPresident's pronouncements after his swearing in, I expected things to \nbe totally different in this administration, and I don't find them to \nbe any different. Federal agencies under the control of the President's \npolitical appointees have been more aggressive than ever in withholding \ninformation from the public and from the Congress.\n  Throughout my career, I have been actively conducting oversight of \nthe executive branch, regardless of who controls the Congress or what \nparty controls the White House. When the agencies I am reviewing get \ndefensive, and when they refuse to respond to my requests, it makes me \nwonder what they are trying to hide. Over the last year, many of my \nrequests for information from various agencies have been turned down \nagain and again either because I am ranking member or because I am not \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Agencies within the executive \nbranch have repeatedly cited the Privacy Act as a part of the rationale \nfor their decision not to grant requests even though the Privacy Act \nexplicitly says it is not meant to limit the flow of information from \nthe executive branch to the Congress.\n  This disregard by the executive branch for the clear language of the \nlaw is disheartening, and so it is quite appropriate during Sunshine \nWeek we bring out the truth. Citing another example, since January \n2011, Chairman Issa and I have been stonewalled by Attorney General \nHolder and by other people in the Justice Department regarding our \ninvestigation of Operation Fast and Furious. This deadly operation let \nthousands of weapons ``walk'' from the United States into Mexico.\n  Despite the fact the Department of Justice inspector general \npossesses over 80,000 relevant documents, Congress has received only \naround 6,000 in response to a subpoena from the House Oversight \nCommittee. Even basic documents about the case have been withheld by \nthe Justice Department. Yet the Department insists on telling us--and \nbefore they tell us, they seem to tell the press--that they are \ncooperating with Senator Grassley and Congressman Issa. The Sun must \nshine on Fast and Furious so the public can understand how such a \ndangerous operation took place and what can be done to prevent such \nstupid actions of our government in the future.\n  I have also worked hard to bring transparency to the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. This is an executive branch agency that \ndesperately needs more sunshine. Over the past 2 years, I have been \ninvestigating rampant fraud, waste, and abuse at public housing \nauthorities throughout the country. I have discovered exorbitant \nsalaries paid to executive staff, conflicts of interest, poor living \nconditions, and outright fraud, waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars. \nMany of these abuses have been swept under the rug, and Housing and \nUrban Development has been slow at correcting the problems.\n  HUD cannot keep writing checks to these local housing authorities and \nthen blindly hope the money gets to those Congress intended to help. I \nwill continue to work to bring sunshine to the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development as well.\n  In April of last year, I requested documents from the Federal \nCommunication Commission regarding a valuable regulatory waiver it \ngranted to a company called LightSquared. LightSquared was attempting \nto build a satellite phone network in a band of spectrum adjacent to \nglobal positioning systems.\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n  The problem is that LightSquared's network causes interference with \ncritical GPS users such as the Department of Defense, the Federal \nAviation Administration, and NASA.\n  The FCC responded to my document request by saying they don't give \ndocuments to anyone but the two chairs of the committee with direct \njurisdiction over the Federal Communications Commission. How idiotic. \nBecause that means that if someone is not chairman of a committee--in \nother words, if a person is in the 99.6 percent of the Congress which \ndoes not chair a committee--with direct jurisdiction, then as a Member \nof Congress they are out of luck and can't fulfill their \nresponsibilities of constitutional oversight and can't be a check, as \nenvisioned by Madison writing the Constitution, on the executive branch \nof government.\n  In this letter to me from Chairman Genachowski, he told me he would \nmake his staff available even if I didn't get the documents. So I could \ninterview the staff. But when I took him up on his offer and asked him \nto interview members of his staff, my request was refused.\n  Once again, actions speak louder than words. People can get away with \nlying, and there is stonewalling, pure and simple. It seems obvious \nthat the FCC is embarrassed and afraid of what might come from \nuncovering the facts behind what the Washington Post called the \nLightSquared debacle. If there is nothing to hide, then why all the \nstonewalling? The FCC seems determined to stonewall any attempt at \ntransparency.\n  But it is not just the executive branch that needs more transparency. \nThe judiciary should be transparent and accessible as well. That is why \nover a decade ago I introduced the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, a \nbipartisan bill which will allow judges at all Federal courts to open \ntheir courtrooms to television cameras and radio broadcasts. By letting \nthe Sun shine in on Federal courtrooms, Americans will have an \nopportunity to better understand the judicial process.\n  The sunshine effort has no better friend than whistleblowers. Private \ncitizens and government employees who come forward with allegations of \nwrongdoing and coverups risk their livelihoods to expose misconduct. \nThe value of whistleblowers is the reason I continue to challenge the \nbureaucracy and Congress to support whistleblowers.\n  For over two decades, I have learned from, appreciated, and honored \nwhistleblowers. Congress needs to make a special note of the role \nwhistleblowers play in helping us fulfill our constitutional duty of \nconducting oversight of the executive branch. The information provided \nby whistleblowers is vital to effective congressional oversight. \nDocuments alone are insufficient when it comes to understanding a \ndysfunctional bureaucracy. Only whistleblowers can explain why \nsomething is wrong and provide the best evidence to prove it. Moreover, \nonly whistleblowers can help us truly understand problems with the \nculture at government agencies.\n  Whistleblowers have been instrumental in uncovering $700 being spent \non toilet seats at the Department of Defense. These American heroes \nwere also critical in our learning about how the FDA missed the boat \nand approved Vioxx, how government contracts were inappropriately \nsteered at the General Services Administration, and how Enron was \ncooking the books and ripping off investors.\n  Similar to all whistleblowers, each whistleblower in these cases \ndemonstrated tremendous courage. They stuck out their necks for the \ngood of us all. They spoke the truth. They didn't take the easy way out \nby going along to get along or looking the other way when they saw a \nwrongdoing.\n  I have said it for many years--without avail, of course--I would like \nto see a President or this President of the United States have a Rose \nGarden ceremony honoring whistleblowers. This would send a message from \nthe very top of the bureaucracy to the lowest levels about the \nimportance and value of whistleblowers. We all ought to be grateful for \nwhat they do and appreciate the very difficult circumstances they often \nhave to endure to do so, sacrificing their family's finances, their \nemployability, and the attempts by powerful interests to smear their \ngood names and intentions.\n  I have used my experience working with whistleblowers to promote \nlegislation that protects them from retaliation. Legislation such as \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the False \nClaims Act recognize the benefits of whistleblowers and offer \nprotection to those seeking to uncover the truth. For example, \nwhistleblowers have used the False Claims Act to help the Federal \nGovernment recover more than $30 billion since Congress passed my qui \ntam amendments in 1986.\n  These laws are a good step; however, more can be done. For example, \nthe Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act will provide much needed \nupdates to Federal whistleblower protections. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor, and I believe the Senate should move this important \nlegislation immediately. This bill includes updates to the \nWhistleblower Protection Act to address negative interpretations of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act from both the Merit System Protection \nBoard and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I started my remarks by quoting James Madison, the Founding Father \nwho is one of the inspirations for Sunshine Week. Madison understood \nthe dangers posed by the type of conduct we are seeing from President \nObama's political appointees. Madison explained that:\n\n       [a] popular government without popular information or the \n     means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a \n     tragedy, or perhaps both.\n\n  I will continue doing what I can to hold this administration's feet \nto the fire, to protect whistleblowers, to get the truth out, and to \nsave the taxpayers' money.\n  I hope my colleagues will help work with me so we can move toward \nrestoring real sunshine, in both words and actions, in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. McCaskill). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                             Energy Prices\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, there is a lot of discussion about \nenergy going on. The President spoke about it this morning.\n  It is nice to hear us all saying the same thing; that this country \nshould have an all-of-the-above energy policy. It is a phrase I have \nused for years now, and I suppose it is the highest form of flattery to \nhave that scooped by others and carried. But I think it is important \nfor us to remember that policies have to translate from mere words into \naction. With the President's comments today, unfortunately, I am not \nconvinced he is intending to help turn our all-of-the-above policy into \nreality.\n  I think if he was serious about doing that, he would acknowledge that \nthere is far more our country can do to increase our supply when it \ncomes to oil and oil production. I think he would admit that with oil \nprices above $100 a barrel, gasoline edging up every day close to $4 a \ngallon, this is not a political opportunity for anyone; this is a \nlegislative imperative--a legislative imperative--for us all. The \nquestion that needs to be asked is, What can we do?\n  I would agree with the President that there is no one silver bullet. \nThere is no one quick fix. We can't snap our fingers and have the price \nat the pump go down. But I think it is important to talk honestly about \nwhat is going on with supply and with production in this country.\n\n  With much discussion over these past several months about the \nKeystone project out of Canada and that pipeline, it continues to amaze \nme, it makes me crazy to think we have an opportunity to have our \nclosest neighbor and our best trading partner supply us with oil \ninstead of receiving oil from OPEC. Keystone could come online very \nquickly, bring oil to our refineries and to our gas tanks. If the \nadministration supports construction of a pipeline from Oklahoma to \nTexas, as they have suggested, I don't see why we can't allow \nconstruction of a pipeline from Alberta and North Dakota and then all \nthe way down. I am confident there are enough construction workers who \nare ready and waiting to start on both ends. When you say it needs more \nconsideration, more review, I would remind people this has been a \nproject that has had at least 4 years of environmental review.\n  So this is one of those choices that I think is pretty clear and \npretty stark.\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nMost Americans, I believe, would much rather get their oil from Canada \nthan from OPEC. Yet some of what we are seeing come out of this \nCongress from Members of the Senate, the suggestion is that instead of \ngoing to Canada, we should go, tincup in hand, to Saudi Arabia and ask \nthem for increased production. I can't imagine--I cannot imagine why it \nwould be more preferable to producing more American oil or allowing \nmore oil from Canada. This is a pretty clear choice for me. But, again, \nit is an argument we continue to have, and we don't seem to be making \nthe necessary headway on it.\n  Earlier this week, the President said the best we can do about gas \nprices is reduce our dependence on foreign oil, which will reduce the \nprice of gasoline over time. One year ago, he said producing more oil \nin America can help lower our oil prices. But, again, that is talk that \nis going on right now and talk that is not necessarily matching \nreality.\n  Yesterday, I was involved in two hearings of the Appropriations \nsubcommittees. In one, we had a Department of Interior official who \nconfirmed that the oil production on Federal lands is down and not up. \nThere has been a lot of conversation, a lot of discussion about how we \nin this country are seeing more oil and gas production than ever \nbefore. But the fact is, we are seeing an increase in oil; we are \nseeing an increase in natural gas. But we are not seeing it on our \nFederal lands. We are seeing these increases on State lands and on \nprivate lands. When it comes to onshore oil, we have actually gone down \nby 14 percent from last year. When it comes to offshore oil, we have \ngone down from 17 percent last year. So to suggest somehow that we are \ndoing astonishingly, when in fact in the area where the Federal \nGovernment does have some ability to incent some production, we are \nseeing production decrease.\n  We also heard confirmation in a hearing yesterday that producers are \nleaving the Federal lands--which, again, are the only lands the \nadministration has control over--not because the resources are \nnecessarily greater somewhere else but because of Federal taxes, of the \nFederal royalties, the bureaucracy, the permitting process that make \nState and private lands more attractive. It was quite clear in the \ntestimony that it does indeed cost more to produce on Federal lands, \nand they do worry about that migration to go to State lands and private \nlands.\n  This is a chart I have about the number of applications for permits \nto drill on Federal lands. If we look at the timeline, we are going up \nand up and up. This is 2001, during the Bush administration, when we \nincreased 92 percent. We hit 2008, and the number of permits to drill \nthat have been approved during this administration is down 36 percent. \nAgain, this is in the area where the Federal Government has control. So \nplease, I think we need to get beyond the idea that we are allowing \ndrilling everywhere.\n  America's largest untapped oilfields onshore and offshore are still \noff-limits. In Alaska, we have more than 40 billion barrels of oil that \nare trapped beneath Federal lands, and the administration is making \nclear they intend to keep much of that off-limits to development.\n  Again, we have money buried in the ground, literally, in Alaska, \nready, waiting, and willing to advance not only the resource for \nAmerican consumption, bringing the jobs, but also bringing important \nrevenues to our Treasury.\n  I think it is quite apparent that supply matters. Again, I mentioned \nthe request from one of our colleagues that we go to Saudi Arabia for \n2.5 million barrels per day. I don't think that is an appropriate \npolicy on which we should embark.\n  Since at least the mid-1990s, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have claimed that since oil exploration takes a long time to \nbring online, we shouldn't do it. It was the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts who, back in 2002, said:\n\n       If you open the refuge today, you are not going to see oil \n     until about 2012, maybe a couple years earlier.\n\n  Here we are at 2012. If we had started then, we wouldn't perhaps be \nhaving this discussion now. This argument has gone on for so long that \neven Jay Leno is making jokes about it on TV. It is amazing to me that \nwe continue to say it is going to take too long to bring on, so we \nshouldn't start today.\n  I have two separate bills that allow access to the nonwilderness \nareas of ANWR, the 1002 area, to be carefully opened for development. \nThat field would bring on roughly 1 million barrels of oil to market \neach day. Right now, had this not been blocked back in 1995, that would \nhave been good for American workers, good for the price of oil, good \nfor the Federal Treasury, and I believe it could have been conducted \nand completed without impact to the environment.\n  When we talk about our abilities, I think it is fair to say we do \nhave a lot of oil in this country, and we can bring more of it to \nmarket. If we were to increase our domestic production by the 2.5 \nmillion barrels a day that has been suggested that we get from Saudi \nArabia, if we were to access Alaskan oil along with the Keystone oil, \nthat would double world spare capacity and insulate us almost entirely \nfrom OPEC.\n  When we talk about a way we can move ourselves as a nation away from \nthe stranglehold OPEC holds over us, I think it is important to \nconsider what our options are.\n  I know we will have more to add on this later. Some of my colleagues \nare coming to the floor later to speak on this matter. But at this time \nI yield the floor for my colleague from Louisiana, the energy \nbreadbasket down there in the gulf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I am happy and honored to join my \ncolleague from Alaska, and also our colleague Senator Barrasso to talk \nabout a vital issue, U.S. energy--doing something about the price at \nthe pump, including by accessing more of the vital U.S. energy we have \nright here within our shores.\n  As the Senator from Alaska has said, at least I give the President \nkudos for using the right language, saying the right things, even if \nhis policies have not caught up with that yet. He is talking about an \n``all-of-the-above'' energy strategy, something we have been advocating \nfor years.\n  He is also talking about a release from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. I disagree with that policy, but at least it acknowledges that \nsupply matters. If we increase supply we would lower the price.\n  I think the important way we need to do that, of course, is to \nproduce more energy at home. A lot of Americans do not realize it, but \nwe are the single most energy rich country in the world, bar none. No \none else comes close. When we look at all of our energy resources \ncompared to all of the energy resources of other countries, we are the \nrichest country in terms of energy resources.\n  Why don't most Americans think of ourselves that way? It is because \nwe are the only country in the world that takes well over 90 percent of \nthose resources and puts them off-limits. Through Federal law, \nparticularly under this Obama administration, America says no. No.\n  The Obama administration says no. No, you can't drill off the east \ncoast. No, you can't drill off the west coast. No, you can't touch the \neastern gulf, at least for now. No, you can do little to nothing \noffshore Alaska. No, you cannot touch the Alaska National Wildlife \nRefuge. No, we are going to do less instead of more on Federal land. \nAnd, no, we are going to reexamine hydraulic fracturing, which is a key \nprocess to the development of our rich shale resources even though \nthere is no scientific basis for that attack on hydraulic fracturing.\n  This administration has said no; no, in terms of policy. The \nPresident is saying ``all of the above.'' The President is admitting \nsupply matters. But the policy has not caught up, and it has to catch \nup.\n  What am I thinking of? On the Outer Continental Shelf we are rich in \nresources, in oil and gas. Yet President Obama's 5-year plan, which he \nis required to submit under law--his 5-year plan for developing that \nOuter Continental Shelf is only half as much as the previous 5-year \nplan. We are backing up. We are headed in the wrong direction, not the \nright direction of accessing more of our own energy.\n  Permitting in the Gulf of Mexico, where I live--since the BP \ndisaster,\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\npermitting first stopped but now has started again, but only at a \ntrickle, and we are still 30 percent to 40 percent below the pace of \npermitting compared to before the incident. We need to get back to that \npace of permitting and then surpass it.\n  Federal lands, the area that the Federal Government controls most \ndirectly--production activity on Federal lands is down from a few years \nago. It is not up; it is down 14, 17 percent offshore and onshore--less \nthan a few years ago.\n  Of course, the Keystone Pipeline was mentioned. That is not quite \nU.S. energy, but it is as close as we can get to that. It is dependable \nCanadian energy from a very firm, strong ally. President Obama is \nsaying no to that.\n  I am happy to hear that his rhetoric has changed in an election year. \nBut when are those policies going to change--on the Outer Continental \nShelf, on permitting in the gulf and elsewhere, on Federal land, on the \nKeystone Pipeline? That is what needs to change.\n  We need to say yes to solid, dependable American energy. It will \nincrease our energy independence. It will increase our supply and \nstabilize prices at the pump. It will build great American jobs, jobs \nwhich, by the way, cannot be outsourced to China and India if they are \ndomestic energy jobs. It will even bring more revenue into the Federal \nGovernment, lowering the deficit and debt.\n  Let's say yes. Let's say yes, yes to that. I know my colleague, \nSenator Barrasso, is vitally interested in these issues as well. I turn \nto him, through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I agree with my colleague from \nLouisiana who is an expert in these areas and spent so much time on \nenergy and the need for affordable energy. People are noticing the pain \nat the pump and saying: Why is this? They don't have to look any \nfurther than the President's policies, the President's efforts, in my \nopinion, to make it harder for us to explore for energy. What does he \ntry to do?\n  In a Reuter's report this morning, ``U.S.-Britain to agree to \nemergency oil stocks release'' from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nThis is there for emergencies, for disruption of supply, not for a \npolitical disaster.\n  What the President has on his hands now is a political disaster. The \nfact is, the price at the pump has gone up about a penny a day for \nabout the last 30 days. People are paying more. They realize if they \nare trying to also deal with bills and mortgage and kids, it is much \nharder. It is a direct impact on their quality of life. Yet the \nPresident continues, as he has done today, to give speeches about \ngasoline prices and to blame everyone other than himself.\n  It is discouraging to see the President looking to the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. He tapped it last year, 30 million barrels. At that \ntime he drew down our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and still has not \nrefilled it. So any effort to draw down from it today will take it down \neven further, again putting us more at risk for a true supply \ndisruption.\n\n  Those are the things we are facing today as a nation, a President \nwith a poorly planned energy approach and having to rely on something \nthat was placed there for true emergencies. But the President continues \nto make his claims as he did today and he did last week. One of his \nclaims is that America only has 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. \nThe truth is, proven and undiscovered oil resources total seven times \nthat amount. The President does not seem to want to face that fact.\n  The President claims an ``all-of-the-above'' energy strategy, but the \ntruth is the President's policies truly seem to be hostile to low-cost \ndomestic fuels, especially gasoline and other products from oil. We saw \nthis when the Secretary of the Interior was a Member of the Senate and \nsaid he would oppose offshore exploration for gas even at $10. He said \nusing less gasoline will lower prices.\n  Isn't that a supply and demand issue? The President ignores supply. \nWe need to increase supply. One of the ways to do that is by exploring \nmore offshore, on Federal land, and in Alaska, and by bringing supply \nfrom Canada to the United States with the Keystone XL Pipeline instead \nof saying to Canada: No, sell that to China.\n  Continuing to look at the incredible needs of this Nation for fuel, \nour ability to increase supply, and the President's efforts to do just \nabout everything else, people at home are concerned.\n  I visit with people every weekend in Wyoming. I did last weekend; I \nwill again this weekend. I hear what my colleague from Louisiana is \nhearing, what my colleague from Alaska is hearing; that is, there are \nlots of opportunities to increase the supply, opportunities that are \navailable and should be used in this country. We are so dependent on \noverseas, so dependent on OPEC, so dependent on long shipping routes \ncoming through the Strait of Hormuz. Our solution? Take care of the \nproblem at home. Work on energy security for our Nation.\n  The Democrats' proposal--and we heard it from Senator Schumer from \nNew York, who said: Just ask Saudi Arabia to produce more, 2 million \nbarrels more a day.\n  Rely on a country far away? OPEC countries whose interests are not \nnecessarily our own? That is not the solution for America. The American \npeople want energy security which begins at home. North American energy \nsecurity includes the availability of oil from Canada, the availability \nof oil offshore on Federal land as well as in Alaska. It is time for \nthe President to adopt those proposals and those approaches rather than \ntalking about his approach which leads people who listen and listen \ncarefully to realize he is intentionally distorting the facts and \nmisleading the American people in speech after speech.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. We are as in morning business; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, first, I want to thank my colleagues for \ncoming to the floor today and talking about the issue of energy and \nenergy independence and the rising cost of energy. It is critically \nimportant. I wish to talk about something else, if I could, for just a \nfew minutes, something I think is of critical importance, eternal \nimportance; that is, the issue of human rights.\n  As Americans, we have to remind ourselves our Nation was founded on \nthe principles of human rights. If we read back to the earliest \ndocuments, the Declaration of Independence first says very clearly at \nthe outset that one of the founding principles that led to the creation \nof this Nation, and the Republic and Constitution that followed that, \nwas the notion that all of us are created equal. Every human being on \nthe planet who was ever born, ever will be born anywhere in this world, \nwas born with certain rights, and the source of those rights is our \nCreator.\n  Think about that for a moment. That is not a common belief. For \nalmost all of our history people believed our rights as people came not \nfrom our Creator, they came from the government, from our leaders. Our \nrights are what the government allows us to have. That is not what \nfounded our country. This country was founded on the very powerful idea \nthat the source of our rights and our value as a human being came from \nour Creator.\n  Of course, that manifested itself in all sorts of things in this \ncountry, a constitution, for example, that in recognition of those \nrights created a system of government that said the job of the \ngovernment was to protect these rights, not to grant them. And, of \ncourse, the American miracle has plenty of witnesses, myself included, \nand is well documented in the annals of history, particularly in the \nlast half century, the American century, the 20th century, which is \nshown as an example to the world. Yet the issue of human rights \ncontinues to be a central one around the world and one of the places \nwhere I think an American example can make the biggest difference.\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\n  One of the issues that has interested me since I got to the Senate--\nmy background before I got here just a year ago was in State \ngovernment, and before that it was in local government. One of the \ngreat things about being in the Senate is you have access to sources of \ninformation and individuals with information that I didn't have before. \nOne of the issues that has fascinated me on a global scale is how human \nrights are still summarily violated all over the planet and how, in \nfact, these powerful ideas that are at the core of our founding as a \ncountry are still not widely accepted in many parts of the world.\n  This is a great time of year to be in Washington. People are on \nspring break, and they are bringing their kids up here to learn about \nour Republic. So I think it is a great time to remind ourselves that \none of the things that made us different from the rest of the world is \nthat we are one of the few countries on the planet that really believe \nthat every single person who has ever been born has rights they are \nborn with. We take that for granted. If you have been born here and \nlived here your whole life, you think that is the way it is everywhere. \nIt is not. There are so many societies and countries around the world \nwhere people are told: You don't have any rights unless we give you \nrights. Unless your government or your leaders or your laws give you \ncertain rights, you don't have these rights. In America, we almost take \nthat for granted because we believe we are born with these rights. And \nthe American example to the world has been what can happen when you \nactually believe that every single human being has worth and value and \nrights that they are born with and that you have no right to deny them.\n  Sadly, there is no shortage of examples around the world where those \nfundamental rights are violated. I think no nation on this planet has a \nlarger obligation to speak out against it than ours. So what I intend \nto do over the next few weeks is come to the floor and highlight some \nof these egregious human rights violations because I think they go to \nthe core of our exceptionalism. They go to the heart of who we are as a \npeople and as a nation. They go to the center of what makes us \ndifferent from other countries around the world and in many respects \nare at the heart of what is in debate at this very moment in the world.\n  As we enter this new 21st century, there are a handful of nations \nacross the globe that do not want the issue of human rights to be \ncentral. They don't want this issue to be on the front burner because \nthey don't believe in these things. What they seek is a new \ninternational order where the violation of human rights is nobody's \nbusiness.\n  You see that today in Syria, where people are being murdered, where \nunarmed civilians are being pursued and shelled by an army, where there \nare horrifying examples of human rights violations on a daily basis. At \nleast two countries--Russia and China--have taken the position that it \nis nobody's business, and one of those countries is the topic I want to \ntalk about today; that is, China--an emerging power on the world stage \nthat some people I think falsely claim will replace America on the \nworld stage. I think that is an exaggeration.\n  By the way, we welcome the economic progress China has made. I think \nit is great news that there are millions of people in China who a \ndecade ago were riding around on a bike and now have a car. Only a \ndecade ago millions of people were living in deep poverty and today are \npart of the middle class. I think that is fantastic. But don't get \nahead of yourself in believing that China is going to replace America \non the world stage. This is still the richest, most powerful country in \nthe world. This is still the most important economy on the planet, and \nour people are as smart and as creative as they have ever been, and \nthat is not going to change.\n  But I think we have to look at China because if, in fact, they are \nthis rising power, if they are going to be a growing influence on the \ninternational stage, we have to ask ourselves, What is their commitment \nto human rights? Sadly, it is not a very good one.\n  If you look at the issue of Tibet, it is a perfect example. These are \npeace-loving people who have sought a certain level of autonomy. They \nwant to preserve their culture and their way of life. They have gone as \nfar as to say: We are OK being under Chinese rule, but we want to \nprotect some of the things that are innate and indigenous to our own \nculture and values. And China is systematically trying to erase their \nculture and their heritage through processes of re-education, through \nthe jailing of people, through the oppression of people, through the \ndestruction of a free press and systems of communication. It manifests \nitself today. I think yesterday was the latest incident of people in \nTibet setting themselves on fire. By the way, we should not encourage \nthat. It is horrifying to see that. We hope it stops. It just leads to \nan understanding of the level of desperation that exists in Tibet.\n  Let me ask you a question. If China is a growing influence on this \nplanet, are these the values that are going to replace American values \non the world stage? Are these the values that are going to replace our \nbelief that all individuals were created equal, with certain rights \nthat come from their Creator? Are we prepared to retreat from the world \nstage and allow that to happen without at least speaking against it?\n  We should not be surprised that China stands by and says: Do nothing. \nDon't even sanction. Don't even put out a nasty letter about Syria. We \nshould not be surprised because a nation that doesn't care about the \nhuman rights of their own people is never going to care about the human \nrights of others. As Americans, the question we have is, Are we \nprepared to retreat from the world stage and, in fact, allow nations \nsuch as that to play a growing role in the world? Are we prepared to \nsilence our own voice at the expense of their voice? I hope not.\n  So when we debate in this Chamber about issues of economic policy, we \nare debating issues about America's influence in the world. And I would \nsay to you that if America is diminished on the world stage, whether it \nbe by choice or by accident, if we fail to confront the issues this \nnation faces and we choose to decline, it won't be just the Americans \nwho pay the price, it will be people all over the world, including the \npeople who live in Tibet, because then there will be no voice on this \nplanet that condemns human rights violations the way we do, because \nthere will be no nation in the world that can prove that, in fact, you \ncan have a functional society where the innate worth and the value and \nrights that our Creator gives every human being are respected. That is \nwhat is at stake when we debate America's influence and America's \nstanding in the world.\n\n  Over the next few weeks, I hope to come to this floor and continue to \nhighlight these egregious violations of human rights. Tragically, there \nis no shortage of them. In the weeks to come, we will talk about the \nproblems of human trafficking that exist in our own country, in our own \nhemisphere, and all around the world. We will talk about the violations \nof religious liberties that exist in societies all over the planet. We \nwill talk about how women have no rights whatsoever in many of these \ncountries. There are some nations where a woman is counted as one-\nfourth of a man in terms of their worth or their ability to speak out. \nWe will talk about other countries where people are systematically \njailed, as they are in our own hemisphere, for putting out pamphlets \nthat criticize the government. We will talk about what is happening in \nSyria and Tibet.\n  Human rights is at the core of who we are as a nation. It is at the \ncore of our identity as a people and as a power on the global stage. It \nis an issue that doesn't belong to the right or to the left, to \nRepublicans or Democrats; it is an issue that should unite us all in \nthis Chamber and in this country, and we hope to be an effective voice \nin that regard in the years that God permits me to serve here in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            Groh Nomination\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the good Senator from Missouri for her \ncourtesy.\n  Madam President, I rise today to express my very strong support for \nthe confirmation of Gina Marie Groh to serve as a U.S. district judge \nfor the Northern District of West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\n  Gina Groh is absolutely qualified for this position and deserving of \nevery Senator's support. She has more than 22 years of legal \nexperience, of which 14 have been devoted to serving the people of West \nVirginia, first as a prosecutor and now as a trial judge. In these \nroles, Judge Groh has exhibited a superior intellect and an unwavering \ncommitment to fairness and to justice. Lawyers describe her as \nmeticulously prepared as a judge, and they describe her as somebody who \nadministers justice in a timely and equitable manner. Because of her \nsuperior qualifications, she was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by an unopposed voice vote and has been waiting patiently for \n5 months for an up-or-down vote.\n  Judge Groh will be ready for the job on the day she assumes the \nbench, provided, of course, that she passes through this body. She \nknows how to make tough decisions. She knows how to issue thoughtful \nopinions and to protect the rights and liberties that are guaranteed to \nall Americans under our laws and our Constitution.\n  I am very proud to urge all Senators to support Judge Groh's \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                         Fitzgerald Nomination\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof Michael Fitzgerald as the Senate prepares to vote on his \nconfirmation to become a district court judge. I had the great \nprivilege of recommending Mr. Fitzgerald to President Obama for \nnomination. He is a respected member of the Los Angeles legal \ncommunity. He will make an excellent addition to the Central District \nof California.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald served as a Federal prosecutor, where he handled cases \ninvolving international drug rings and money laundering, including what \nwas at the time the second largest cocaine seizure in California \nhistory. Since he has left the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Fitzgerald \nhas been in private practice handling complex criminal and civil cases. \nHe received a rating of ``unanimously well qualified'' by the American \nBar Association.\n  He is a historic choice, and a vote on Mr. Fitzgerald's nomination is \nlong overdue. He was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously 133 days ago on November 3, 2011. It really should not take \nthis long to confirm such a highly qualified nominee as Mr. Fitzgerald, \nespecially because this seat has been designated a judicial emergency. \nSo we have a seat that has been designated a judicial emergency, and we \nhave a highly qualified gentleman who is ready for this challenge and \nwho was voted out of the committee unanimously last year, 133 days ago.\n  I want to close with great hope that we will confirm Mr. Fitzgerald. \nWith that, I want to, in advance--and I hope I am proven right--\ncongratulate him and his family on this momentous day. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join with me in voting for this highly \nqualified nominee.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1711-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1711-S1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF GINA MARIE GROH TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                 THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL WALTER FITZGERALD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n              JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nominations of Gina Marie Groh, of \nWest Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of West Virginia; and Michael Walter Fitzgerald, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the order? I had understood I was \nto be recognized at 1:45. Am I incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 15 minutes for debate equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that the Majority Leader and the Republican \nleader came to an understanding yesterday and a path forward so that we \ncan finally consider the two judicial nominations the Senate will vote \non today. With a judicial vacancies crisis that has lasted years, and \nnearly one in 10 judgeships across the Nation vacant, the Senate needs \nto continue to work to have a positive impact and reduce judicial \nvacancies significantly before the end of the year.\n  In light of the agreement reached between the leaders, the Senate \nwill finally be allowed to consider the nomination of Judge Gina Groh \nof West Virginia. Judge Gina Groh currently serves as a Circuit Judge \nin the 23rd Judicial Circuit for the State of West Virginia, the first \nfemale circuit judge in the eastern panhandle region of West Virginia. \nShe is one of only three women serving as a circuit judge throughout \nthe state. Judge Groh was nominated to the state court in 2006 on the \nrecommendation of a bipartisan merit selection panel, and won a \nsuccessful retention election in 2008. Prior to joining the bench, \nJudge Groh served for eight years as state prosecutor and nine years in \nprivate practice. Her nomination, which has the support of both of West \nVirginia's Senators, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Manchin, and was \nreported with the support of every Democrat and every Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee last October. She has been waiting for this \nconfirmation vote for more than five months while her nomination has \nbeen stalled along with so many others.\n  The Senate will also finally be able to consider the nomination of \nMichael Fitzgerald to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Central \nDistrict of California. His nomination has the strong support of his \nhome state Senators, Senators Feinstein and Boxer. If confirmed, Mr. \nFitzgerald will be the first openly gay man confirmed to the Federal \nbench in the state of California. Mr. Fitzgerald has worked in private \npractice for more than two decades, and before that, served as a \nFederal prosecutor. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated him ``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court, its highest possible rating. His nomination was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last November. He has \nbeen waiting four and one half months for this vote.\n  Unlike the 57 of President Bush's District Court nominations \nconfirmed within a week of being reported by the Judiciary Committee \nduring President Bush's first term, these qualified, consensus nominees \nhave been needlessly stalled from final consideration. The application \nof the ``new standard'' the junior Senator from Utah conceded \nRepublicans are applying to President Obama's nominees continues to \nhurt the people of West Virginia and California, who should not have to \nwait any longer for judges to fill these important Federal trial court \nvacancies.\n  The nominations of Judge Groh and Mr. Fitzgerald are two of the 22 \ncircuit and district court nominations ready for Senate consideration \nand a final confirmation vote. They were all reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee after thorough review. All but a handful are by any \nmeasure consensus nominations. There was never any good reason for the \nSenate not to proceed to votes on these nominations. It should not have \ntaken cloture petitions to get agreement to schedule votes on these \nqualified, consensus judicial nominations. In addition to the two \nnominations we consider today, another 10 of the nominations on which \nagreement has now been reached have been stalled for months and were \nreported last year.\n  Among the nominees included in the leaders' agreement are two \noutstanding\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nwomen nominated to fill vacancies on important circuit courts that have \nbeen delayed since last year--Stephanie Dawn Thacker of West Virginia, \nnominated to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia, nominated to fill one of the many judicial emergency \nvacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Ms. Thacker, an experienced litigator \nand prosecutor, has the strong support of her home state Senators, \nSenators Rockefeller and Manchin. Judge Nguyen, whose family fled to \nthe United States in 1975 after the fall of South Vietnam, was \nconfirmed unanimously to the district court in 2009 and would become \nthe first Asian Pacific American woman to serve on a U.S. Court of \nAppeals. Both were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear and both should be confirmed by the Senate without additional \ndamaging delays.\n  All 22 of the nominees awaiting a vote by the Senate are qualified \njudicial nominees. They are nominees whose judicial philosophy is well \nwithin the mainstream. These are all nominees supported by their home \nstate Senators, both Republican and Democratic. The consequence of \nthese months of delays is borne by the nearly 160 million Americans who \nlive in districts and circuits with vacancies that could be filled as \nsoon as Senate Republicans agree to up or down votes on the 22 judicial \nnominations currently before the Senate awaiting a confirmation vote.\n  We must continue with the pattern set by yesterday's agreement to \nmake progress beyond the 14 nominations in that agreement and beyond \nthe 22 nominations currently on the calendar. There are another eight \njudicial nominees working who have had hearings and are working their \nway through the Committee process. In addition, there are another 11 \nnominations on which the Committee should be holding additional \nhearings during the next several weeks. By working steadily and by \ncontinuing the resumption of the regular consideration of judicial \nnominations I hope the understanding between the leaders signals, we \ncan do as we did in 2004 and 2008 to ensure that the Federal courts \nhave the judges they need to provide justice for all Americans without \nneedless delay. In those presidential election years, we worked \ntogether to reduce judicial vacancies to the lowest levels in decades.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait three years before a judge hears \nthe case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  We 100 Senators stand in the shoes of over 300 million Americans. It \nis good to see the Senate agreeing to end the partisan stalling and \nschedule votes on these long-delayed and much-needed judges.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this week the judicial confirmation \nprocess was a bit off track. The 17 threatened cloture motion votes \nwere unnecessary. I am pleased the majority leader determined to not \nmove forward with that plan.\n  The Senate has now returned to its regular order of processing \njudicial nominations in a careful and deliberate manner--just exactly \nwhat we ought to do when we are talking about confirming people to \nlifetime appointments. This means nominees are called up, debated, and \nvoted upon, just as we have been doing. In fact, we have done that 131 \ntimes for President Obama's judicial nominees. Of course, on rare \noccasions, as within the traditional rules and practices of the Senate, \nthere will be difficulty in moving forward with consent to proceed on \njust a very few.\n  So I view what happened yesterday not as some deal but as a rejection \nof a political stunt in favor of returning to regular order, as we are \ndoing today. I have worked with the chairman and members of the \nJudiciary Committee, as well as my colleagues throughout the Senate, to \nensure nominees are treated fairly, and I will continue to do so.\n  In the meantime, I am pleased the Senate has turned to the JOBS bill. \nIt is imperative that the Senate keep its focus on what the people back \nat the grassroots level think we ought to be working on--jobs, the \neconomy, energy, and other critical issues facing our Nation.\n  Today we turn to two judicial nominations under regular order and the \nprocedure of the Senate: Gina Groh, who is nominated to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Northern District of West Virginia, and Michael \nFitzgerald, who is nominated to be a U.S. district judge for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Earlier this week, I heard remarks blaming the judicial vacancy rate \non Republican obstructions. What was failed to be discussed--not even \nmentioned--was that 44 of the judicial vacancies have no nominee. Of \nthe 35 judicial vacancies designated as judicial emergencies, the \nPresident has failed to submit a nomination for 19 of those seats. So \nwhat about the other 16? What about the other 39 of the 83 I just \nmentioned? It is a fact of life; we can't proceed to process judicial \nnominations if the President doesn't send them to us. So the President \nneeds to hurry if he wants to get some consideration.\n  That has been the pattern for most of this administration--failure or \ndelay in submitting nominations to the Senate. For example, look at the \nnomination of Gina Groh, a nomination we are considering today. Yes, \nher nomination has been before the Senate for 5 months, but this seat \nbecame vacant in December 2006. President Bush submitted a nomination \nfor this seat on May 24, 2007. That nominee never even had a hearing \nbut languished in committee for 19 months before being returned to the \nPresident. This is just 1 of 53 nominees of President Bush's who were \nsubjected to what some have characterized as a ``pocket filibuster'' or \notherwise went unconfirmed.\n  Even after President Obama's election, it took until May 19, 2011, \nfor him to nominate Ms. Groh. The President took 848 days to submit the \nnomination--nearly 2 years and 4 months. I have to ask, Where was the \nnomination? Where was the outrage of the other party during all of this \ntime of dillydallying around at the White House?\n  Again, we are moving forward under regular order and procedures of \nthe Senate. This year, we have been in session for about 28 days, \nincluding today. During that time, we have confirmed nine judges. That \nis an average of about one confirmation for every 3 days. With the \nconfirmation today, the Senate will have confirmed 72 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations.\n  Gina Marie Groh is nominated to be United States District Judge for \nthe Northern District of West Virginia. Judge Groh graduated summa cum \nlaude with a B.A. from Shepherd University in 1986, and with a J.D. \nfrom West Virginia University College of Law in 1989. From 1989 to \n1998, she worked as a litigation associate for three separate firms. \nFrom 1989 to 1991, she was with Steptoe & Johnson and then she moved to \nMell, Brownwell & Baker, where she worked until 1995. Finally she \nworked at Semmes, Bowen, & Semmes until 1998. During this period, her \npractice primarily involved civil litigation, including workers \ncompensation and personal injury defense.\n  From 1998 to 2006, she served as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. \nShe served in this capacity with the Berkeley County Prosecuting \nAttorney's Office until 2002 and then with the Jefferson County \nProsecuting Attorney's Office. As an assistant prosecutor, she \nprimarily prosecuted felony cases on behalf of the State of West \nVirginia. While with the Jefferson County Attorney's Office, she also \nrepresented the county government in civil matters. While an assistant \ncounty prosecutor, she estimates she tried about 500 cases to verdict.\n  In December 2006, Governor Manchin appointed Judge Groh as a circuit \njudge in the 23rd Judicial Circuit of West Virginia. In November 2008 \nshe was elected to the same position. As a judge serving on a court of \ngeneral jurisdiction, she presides over a variety of civil and criminal \ncases and manages the grand jury in Morgan and Jefferson counties, \nwhich meets three\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\ntimes per year in each county. She estimates that she has presided over \n93 cases that have either gone to verdict or judgment. In addition, she \nhas issued orders in over 3,400 cases.\n  Michael Fitzgerald is nominated to be United States District Judge \nfor the Central District of California. He is a 1981 graduate of \nHarvard University and received his J.D. in 1985 from the University of \nCalifornia, Berkley--Boalt Hall--School of Law. After graduating from \nlaw school, Mr. Fitzgerald clerked for the Honorable Irving R. Kaufman \non the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  From 1986 1987, he was an associate at O'Donnell & Gordon where he \nrepresented individuals and small companies in civil litigation. In \n1988, he became an Assistant United States Attorney where he served on \nthe Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force/Major. With the \ntask force he primarily prosecuted cocaine rings. He also worked with a \nmoney laundering task force comprised of IRS criminal agents and Los \nAngeles Police Department narcotics officers. From 1991 1995 he worked \nas an associate at Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe LLP, on commercial \nlitigation.\n  In 1995, Mr. Fitzgerald joined the Law Offices of Robert L. Corbin, \nP.C. as an associate attorney, and became a partner in 1998, when the \nfirm was renamed Corbin, Fitzgerald & Athey LLP. Initially he \nrepresented small businesses and individuals in small to medium-sized \ncivil cases, as well as a variety of criminal cases in Los Angeles \nSuperior Court. He also was involved in federal civil and criminal \ncases. For the past six years, the focus of his firm has been \nrepresenting clients who are under investigation by federal agencies. \nThese investigations have concerned securities, defense contracting, \nenvironmental law, health care, antitrust, tax and financial crisis.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald reports that he has appeared in court regularly for \nmost of his career. However, since 2004, he has only appeared in court \noccasionally. He has tried 26 cases to verdict.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, when I hear concerns that the Republican \ndelays are all the fault of President Obama, it sort of makes me think \nof some of the dialogue from the movie ``Casablanca''. I should tell my \ncolleagues that there are 83 vacancies, sure. Several of them are \nwithout a nomination because this President is trying to work with home \nState Senators, including 24 vacancies involving a Republican home \nState Senator who hasn't agreed to anybody. There are seven nominations \non which the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot proceed because \nRepublican Senators haven't returned blue slips indicating their \nsupport. We had somebody else who we were going to consider in \nCommittee. Two Republican Senators had returned blue slips; they \nwithdrew them and we had to take that name off the agenda.\n  So we try to protect Republicans' rights in the committee and, \nsuddenly, we are at fault because they are blocking people who have \ngone through unanimously. Well, none of these complaints would give any \nexcuse for failure to move on nominees that went through with every \nsingle Republican, every single Democrat voting for them.\n  Instead of being voted on in a week, as 57 did during President \nBush's first term, these nominees sit here for month after month after \nmonth.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the \nnomination of Michael Walter Fitzgerald, a highly qualified nominee to \nthe United States District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  The vacancy Mr. Fitzgerald would fill has been declared a judicial \nemergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Central \nDistrict is the ninth-busiest court in the country in terms of filings \nper judgeship, and it has several vacancies that need to be filled.\n  I wish it had not taken four and a half months to see Mr. Fitzgerald \nconfirmed, but I am very grateful that the Senate is able to make \nprogress on his nomination today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald was born in Los Angeles in 1959 and attended \nCalifornia's public schools. He received a scholarship to attend \nHarvard College, from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1981.\n  After graduating from Harvard, Mr. Fitzgerald taught at Anaheim High \nSchool. He then attended Boalt Hall Law School at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, where he was managing editor of the Industrial \nRelations Law Journal and graduated Order of the Coif in 1985.\n  Following law school, he clerked for Judge Irving R. Kaufman on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald has over 25 years of experience practicing law. After \none year in private practice he became an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the Central District of California, where he served from \n1988 through 1991.\n  During that time, he served on the Organized Crime and Drug \nEnforcement Task Force and with the Major Narcotics Section. He led an \ninvestigation that resulted in the seizure of 2,241 pounds of cocaine \nand the conviction of a major drug trafficking kingpin.\n  Since his service as a federal prosecutor, Mr. Fitzgerald has worked \nas an attorney in private practice, first at the law firm Heller Ehrman \nWhite & McAuliffe and now at Corbin, Fitzgerald, and Athey LLP.\n  He has represented plaintiffs and defendants in civil cases, as well \nas criminal defendants. He also has represented major corporations and \ncorporate officials in investigations by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Department of Justice. For example, he represented a \nsenior Boeing manager in a Federal grand jury investigation, as well as \nBank of America.\n  He also has been active in pro bono work. For example, Mr. Fitzgerald \nrepresented an FBI special agent, Frank Buttino, who had security \nclearance revoked after his sexual orientation was revealed to his FBI \nsuperiors. The case resulted in a settlement, in which the FBI revoked \nits policy of treating sexual orientation as a negative factor in \nsecurity clearance determinations.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald also served as a deputy counsel on the Rampart \nIndependent Review Panel, which was appointed by the Los Angeles Police \nCommission to investigate a major corruption scandal in the Rampart \nDivision of the Los Angeles Police Department. He also served as a \ncounsel to the Special Advisor to the Webster Commission, which \ninvestigated the L.A.P.D.'s response to the L.A. riots in 1992.\n  In short, Mr. Fitzgerald has an impressive record--strong academic \ncredentials, an appellate clerkship, service as a Federal prosecutor, \nand over two decades in private practice.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald is also the first openly gay nominee to a California \nFederal Court--an important milestone on the road to equality.\n  I am confident he will be a superb addition to the district court, \nand I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe we have reached the time for the \nvote. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator is correct.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gina Marie Groh, of West Virginia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of West Virginia?\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The junior Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Groh Nomination\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the confirmation of \nJudge Gina Marie Groh to the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of West Virginia.\n  As then-Governor of West Virginia, I was honored to have the first \nfemale from the Eastern Panhandle, with the highest of credentials, \nJudge Groh, brought to my attention. I was so proud to appoint her to \nthe 23rd Judicial District in 2006, and she has served with great \ndistinction ever since.\n  I am also very pleased my colleague and friend Senator Jay \nRockefeller saw the same qualities in Judge Groh that I did and \nrecommended her for this prestigious position on the Federal bench. I \nthank him for his steadfast support.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate some of Judge Gina \nGroh's fine qualities and the reasons I know she will be an exceptional \njudge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West \nVirginia.\n  Judge Groh is a well-respected and recognized member of her community \nin the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, as I have known her for many \nyears. In addition to being the first female circuit judge to serve in \nthe Eastern Panhandle, Judge Groh is only the third female circuit \njudge to be selected in all of West Virginia.\n  Prior to her circuit court appointment, Judge Groh served as \nassistant prosecuting attorney at the prosecuting attorney's offices in \nBerkeley County and Jefferson County, WV. During her 8 years as \nprosecutor, she established a strong record of protecting her fellow \nWest Virginians by tirelessly pursuing convictions for such crimes as \nmurder, robbery, rape, child abuse, drunk driving, and drug-related \noffenses.\n  Judge Groh has not only excelled professionally but has also risen to \nbecome a true pillar of her community in the Eastern Panhandle of West \nVirginia. She dedicates her time to countless foundations and serves on \na number of boards. For many years, she has worked for such programs as \nRobes to School and the Meals with Love Ministry and has been very \ninvolved with her alma mater, Shepherd University, serving both with \nthe Wellness Center and as a member of the alumni board.\n  Judge Groh graduated summa cum laude from Shepherd University in \n1986, with a bachelor of science degree. She earned the university's \nhighest academic honor as a McMurran Scholar, in addition to serving as \neditor-in-chief of the newspaper and vice president of her graduating \nclass. Judge Groh went on to earn her J.D. from West Virginia \nUniversity's College of Law in Morgantown, WV.\n  I believe Judge Groh's experience, intellect, leadership, \nimpartiality, and deep roots in the community make her a prudent choice \nfor the vacancy in the Northern District of West Virginia. She \nexemplifies not only the qualities of a talented jurist but also the \nhigh moral character and sense of justice necessary to make a great \njudge.\n  I know it has been exasperating for Judge Groh and her family waiting \nfor this confirmation, knowing that she came out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without any opposition. It has been very difficult \nthat we as a body have gotten to the point of slowing down these \nnominations, and I believe very strongly our system needs to be changed \nso we can get quality judges such as Judge Gina Groh on the bench as \nquickly as possible so they can work to protect the people of the \nUnited States.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for confirming an exemplary candidate \nfor the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, \nJudge Gina Marie Groh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has just passed \nH.R. 3606, which is styled as a capital formation bill, but it is \nfundamentally flawed. As more and more people have looked closely at \nthe bill, they have found more and more problems with it--problems that \ncould roll back key consumer protections and dramatically decrease the \ntransparency of our capital markets.\n  One of the fundamental misconceptions in this bill is that we can \nhave robust capital formation without good\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\ninvestor protections. My view is we can't have one without the other; \nthat the strength of our market is the reliance investors have that \nthey will have the right information and know enough about the entity \nthey are investing in to make judicious, sound economic judgments. The \nCantor bill would roll back many investor protections, would deny \ninvestors critical information that is essential to making sound \njudgments, and would ultimately not lead to the proposed goal of the \nbill--providing more access to capital, particularly for small, \nemerging companies.\n  Serious concerns have been raised about the Cantor bill by current \nand former regulators in the last 2 weeks: Mary Shapiro, Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission; the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association; Arthur Levitt, former Chairman of the SEC \nand head of AMEX; and Lynn Turner, former chief economist of the SEC.\n  Some of the largest pension plans in the entire country have been \nweighing in through the Council of Institutional Investors, and these \nare the entities most people want to have invest in their companies as \nlong-term investors. They have real concerns about the House action.\n  We have been getting phone calls and letters from a diverse array of \nconsumer groups, such as the AARP, the Consumer Federation of America, \nthe AFL CIO, and SAFER, the Economists' Committee for Stable, \nAccountable, Fair, and Efficient Financial Reform.\n  Academic experts, such as Professor John Coffee of Columbia \nUniversity School of Law, for one, have called the Cantor bill the \n``Boiler Room Preservation Act'' because it will mean more pump-and-\ndump schemes, where people are pressured to invest in highly risky \nfirms and products. Two other noted securities experts from Harvard \nUniversity Law School and Business School, respectively, John Coates \nand Robert Pozen, have said the bill does more than, in their words, \n``trim regulatory fat; parts of it cut into muscle.'' We need to slow \ndown this process and get it right. H.R. 3606 can be improved and \nshould be improved. That is why I--together with Senators Mary \nLandrieu, Carl Levin, Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, Daniel Akaka, \nSheldon Whitehouse, Al Franken, Tom Harkin, and Dick Durbin--am \nintroducing a substitute amendment to this bill today. We hope our \nlegislation can serve as a base bill for the Senate to discuss and \namend as we move forward.\n  What are some of the most serious flaws we are trying to address in \nthe Cantor bill? First and foremost, this bill is unlikely to create \njobs, despite the title the House has bestowed upon it. In fact, it may \nactually have the opposite effect. By weakening investor confidence, it \ncould actually decrease the number of IPOs and lead to fewer \ninvestments in our capital markets.\n  Currently, our markets are considered the most transparent and liquid \nin the world, which has been one of its great strengths--the confidence \nthat when an investor puts money into an American financial product and \nAmerican market, he or she has detailed information about the current \nstatus and the prospects of that investment. Under the Cantor bill, our \nmarkets would become less transparent and more opaque. Fewer \nprotections will be provided to investors. This could actually lead to \nfewer investors investing in the United States, since we are in a \nglobal economy or increasing competition with capital markets in \nLondon, Paris, Hong Kong, and Singapore--to name just a few.\n  Again, one of the great hallmarks of our markets, starting in 1933 \nwith the securities legislation of the New Deal, was the feeling that \ninvestors would be protected, that there would be standards in place, \ninformation would be made available to them, and they could have \nconfidence--as much confidence as they could get--in their investments. \nIf we undermine that confidence, eventually we will undermine both our \nappetite and capacity to invest.\n  The Cantor bill has more problems. It tries to create a way that \ncrowdfunding can be used to raise money for small enterprises, but it \ndoes this with very few protections for investors and would allow \nunregulated Web sites to peddle stock to ordinary investors without any \nmeaningful oversight or liability.\n  Crowdfunding is a very interesting new approach to raising capital. \nOur colleagues, Senators Merkley and Bennet have spent a lot of time \ndeveloping very positive legislation which balances improving small \nbusiness access to capital, by tapping into social networks and small \ninvestors but, at the same time, gives those investors adequate \nprotections. The House has not taken this approach. They have \nlegislation that could, indeed, create a situation where crowdfunding \nis plagued by fraud, by manipulation, and by people who simply want to \nmake a quick buck and move on, hoping they will just disappear into the \nInternet.\n\n  The Craigslist or eBay model may work to enable people to sell \nunwanted clothing, bikes, and other goods, but it certainly doesn't \nwork for a financial security that requires a much more careful \nanalysis than simply kicking the tires. People with more credit card \ndebt than savings will be tempted to put their money into these mass-\nmarketed, get rich schemes--money which they can't afford, in many \ncases. As the economy continues to grow, stocks will rise--we have seen \nsome interesting and very positive developments on Wall Street over the \nlast several weeks--but this ride up could be accompanied by bubbles \nwith these types of crowdfunding schemes, where people are putting \nmoney in for a quick return based on, perhaps, the success of one or \ntwo companies but not having the information, not having the \nappropriate controls on the intermediaries so they can make a sound, \nvalid investment.\n  There is another aspect of the House legislation, in addition to this \ncrowdfunding approach, which is the House IPO on-ramp provisions. An \nIPO, of course, is an initial public offering. This approach, to try to \nstreamline access to the public markets for emerging companies, has \ngreat merit. But once again, what has happened in the House bill is \nthey have done this at the expense of necessary protections for \ninvestors.\n  Relaxing standards for very large, new public companies, when no \nevidence supports the idea those standards stand in the way of these \nIPOs and much evidence suggests the standards prevent serious \naccounting problems, is not the way to go. The basic essence of their \napproach--this on-ramp approach--is a very large company, with up to $1 \nbillion in revenue, for a period of 5 years or so, can avoid some of \nthe now standard requirements for public companies. This is not an \ntargeted approach for small companies. Companies with $1 billion of \nrevenue are substantial economic enterprises. The protections that have \nbeen put in place over the years not only protect the investors but \nalso ensure appropriate audit procedures are in place. Ensuring \nappropriate managerial behavior for a company of that size should not \nbe indefinitely waived or waived for a period of 5 years.\n  We could literally roll back the clock to pre-Enron, pre-WorldCom, \nwhere because of creative accounting, because of the lack of adequate \naudit procedures within the company, real abuses occurred. The result \nwas Enron collapsed and their shareholders were left with virtually \nnothing. One of the more tragic ironies is that many of their \nshareholders were their employees who had their entire pensions \ninvested in the company, particularly in the case of Enron. Ultimately, \nthe pain to these people, caused by the lack of good standards--which \nhave since been put in place--was significant. If we proceed on this, \nwe might, once again, have a situation where we are repeating \nindustry--and a history we have seen already.\n  Again, as the economy rebounds, as stocks rise, I think there will be \na variable increase in new public offerings--IPOs. If we look at the \ndata, the number of IPOs goes up and down. But the most significant \nfactor is simply economic activity. As economic activity goes up, new \ncompanies have opportunities, IPOs go up. In this boom, there could be \nthe temptation for these companies, given these new, very relaxed \nstandards, to ignore the problem because they do not have to disclose \nthem adequately or to deliberately mislead investors because there is \nno real check on what is being said. The relaxed standards in the House \nbill could allow companies to engage in deception, to raise and waste \nmore investment money more quickly.\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\n  There is a way we can dial back this excessive legislation in a way \nthat will provide capital formation but will also provide protections \nfor investors, and I hope we can proceed in that manner. Increasing \nIPOs is a valuable goal, but it should be done much more cautiously, in \nmy estimation, with reforms focused on much smaller companies than \nthose with $1 billion in annual revenue, as is indicated in the Cantor \nbill.\n  During the course of three hearings in the Senate Banking Committee \non these issues, it has become even more clear there are problems with \nthe way shareholders are being counted. This is another aspect of the \nHouse bill that is problematic. They have indicated they would like to \nmove beyond a number--500--which requires a company register under the \n1934 Securities and Exchange Act with the SEC. This trigger is \nsomething that should be considered in terms of present-day standards. \nThe House bill raises this trigger point to 2,000 very quickly, without \ndealing with the so-called beneficial owners problem. If the provision \nin the House bill was in force in the past, two-thirds of current \npublic companies would not have been required to register under the \n1934 Act. Let me say that again.\n  If you reach a certain number of shareholders, you are required to \nregister and begin to give those shareholders required information on a \nquarterly basis. You are required to file other forms. You are required \nto be subject to other rules and regulations of the SEC.\n  If this new House standard of 2,000 shareholders was in place, two-\nthirds of current public companies would not have to register with the \n'34 Act. They would be operating in the dark. They would be operating \nwith whatever minimal information they might be required to divulge to \ntheir shareholders under State corporate law or, in some cases, State \nsecurities law. That is an astounding number of companies.\n  Most investors take for granted that when you reach a critical size \nin the number of shareholders, et cetera, that you will begin to \nreport. Again, these reports are the lifeblood of the investing \ncommunity because they rely upon them for their information about what \nis going on in the company, and they rely upon them for the standards \nthat company has to follow.\n  Over time, most investors as a result of registration under the '34 \nAct are entitled to receive regular disclosures. Again, these \nprovisions raising up the level to 2,000 shareholders would undermine \nthe other stated goal of the Cantor bill, to make it easier for \ncompanies to go public and easier to disclose information. In fact, \nsome would describe this as sort of a bipolar piece of legislation.\n  On the one hand, they want to relax the standards for going public, \nand on the other hand they want to relax the standards and allow more \ncompanies to go private. I think we have to be careful in each instance \nto ensure that investors are protected, as well as capital formation is \nenhanced.\n  The House bill will eliminate an SEC rule on general solicitation, \nallowing companies to advertise risky, less regulated, unregistered \nprivate offerings to the public using, for example, billboards along \nhighways, cold calls to senior living centers, or other mass marketing \nmethods. It also will tear down protections that were put in place \nafter the late 1990s Internet stock bubble burst that prevented \nconflicts of interest from tainting the quality of research about \ncompanies.\n  What we found in the wake of the dot-com bubble--with many \nprotections in place that would be taken out by this legislation--was \nthere were analysts who were touting companies at the same time other \nparts of their business were trying to sell those companies' shares. \nThis conflict of interest with someone you hope is giving an objective \nopinion would be encouraged, not discouraged, under the House bill.\n  The Cantor bill would allow extremely large corporations to avoid SEC \noversight. It also would allow banks, with even hundreds of billions of \ndollars in assets, to deregister and stop being subject to SEC \noversight and critical investor protections.\n  Finally, the Cantor bill actually doesn't include provisions that are \nmore likely to create jobs for Americans. For example, the House bill \ndoes not include reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. Time is of the \nessence, by the way, to get this Ex-Im Bank reauthorized. The bank's \ntemporary extension expires at the end of May and is close to exceeding \nits operating level of $100 million by the end of this month.\n  Renewing the Ex-Im Bank's charter with increased lending authority is \npractically the only way of countering the predatory financing \npractices of other trading nations. We spend a lot of time on this \nfloor pointing the finger at companies that are using their sovereign \ninstitutions to undermine American jobs, to get them overseas. Yet one \nof the major institutions in our country that helps American products \nto be sold overseas is literally in danger of going out of business. \nThat is something that will, in fact, enhance job creations, and it is \nnot in the House bill. In fact, it has been suggested that Ex-Im Bank \nactivities supports almost 300,000 jobs in the United States each year.\n  It also doesn't include two other programs that would result in the \ncreation of more jobs, and these two programs are particularly the \nresult of the hard and aggressive and thoughtful work of Senators \nLandrieu and Snowe. One program expands the capacity of the Small \nBusiness Investment Company program, SBIC. They have proposed \nlegislation that would allow another $1 billion in equity-like \nfinancing for smaller, fast-growing firms. The other program would \nextend for 1 year the SBA's 504 refi loan program to help firms \nrefinance commercial real estate into long-term, fixed-rate loans.\n  These modifications have created and saved hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs at no cost to the taxpayers. These are tried and true \nways to increase jobs in America without running the risk of \nundermining the information that investors need to make sound choices \nabout where to invest their dollars.\n  It is very tempting to suggest we simply have to cut a couple of \nregulations and jobs will expand. That was the theme that was rampant \nhere during the Bush administration and, for a while, frankly, it \nlooked like it was working. But then, with the sudden and colossal \ncollapse, we knew that was not the path to long-term sustained job \ncreation. Sound investment based on adequate information in companies \nthat produce jobs in the United States is the way to proceed.\n  We need to listen to those individuals charged with the supervision \nof our capital markets, the SEC, and now we have both the current \nchairman and a former chairman saying the legislation the House \nproposed is a threat to all investors in this country. The stakes are \nhigh if we get some of these things wrong. We have been trying to focus \non these issues intensely for the last few months to bring legislation \nto the floor that will balance capital formation with investor \nprotections. You can't get one at the expense of the other. You have to \nhave both.\n  So I encourage all my colleagues to take a close look at the Reed-\nLandrieu-Levin substitute. I believe it is a substantial improvement to \nthe House bill. My colleague from Louisiana will speak and, once again, \nI must commend her passion for protecting investors, particularly small \ninvestors, and her passion for creating jobs through the SBA and other \norganizations as remarkable, commendable, and indeed exceptional.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank Senator Reed and Senator Levin \nwho have helped to lead this effort to make a bill that is coming over \nfrom the House much better and much safer for investors, as well as to \ngenerate opportunities for more capital to flow to some of the good and \nsolid ideas that are out there in our marketplace to create jobs.\n  I am pleased to join these two Senators and about a dozen to date and \npotentially dozens more of our colleagues as people learn the \ndifferences--and they are substantial--between the House version of \nwhat they call an IPO bill and the Senate version we have worked on \nvery diligently and carefully over the last 48 hours.\n  The three of us are prepared to vote against the House bill as it \nstands now. The only hope of getting our support, and many others here, \nis to try to amend the House bill. That is what our efforts are.\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\n  We are not trying to say no to everything that is in the House bill \nbecause there are some excellent ideas. Even the President himself and \nthe White House and some of the Democrats voted for that bill because \nthere are some good ideas in the bill, and some ideas that have come \nfrom some of the brightest entrepreneurs in our country. We are not \ntrying to say no to those ideas. We are trying to say yes to those \nideas, but do it in a way that protects investors--older investors, \nyounger investors, sophisticated investors, and your average sort of \nnonsophisticated investors because the Internet has opened a whole new \nopportunity.\n  When these security laws were written 40 years ago, 50 years ago, 60 \nyears ago and amended, the Internet wasn't what it is today. So that is \nwhy this crowdfunding bill--which is, in essence, a way for the \nInternet to be used to raise capital that is illegal generally today, \nand there are very specific rules about how people can raise capital \nfor their businesses. Some of those regulations are too onerous; some \nof them are right on. But this whole idea of, oh, my goodness, now the \nInternet is here--look what opportunities could be. We can get our \nideas to the marketplace without having to go through middlemen. We \nhave a great idea, a wonderful patent. We want to be able to raise \nmoney. We are very excited about this. But there is a right way to do \nthis and there is a wrong way to do this.\n  With the House bill, we know that we are on a little bit of rocky \nground when they don't really have a name for it. They have called it \neverything from an IPO bill to a jobs bill to a capital expansion bill. \nWhat I am calling it today--and I will have a poster made over the \nweekend--is an ill-advised political opportunity bill. That is what IPO \nstands for, in my mind.\n  It is ill-advised because the safeguards that are required to make \nsure these new ideas happen the way they should are absent from their \nlegislation. That is why, when I found out, surprisingly, that the \nSenate of the United States was getting ready to take that bill and \njust adopt it whole hog, I said: Absolutely not. We have to slow this \ndown, try to amend it--not kill it but amend it. The reason is because \nthere are very respected groups out there that started sending letter \nafter letter after letter to the Senate urging us to do just that.\n  This isn't about a conservative-liberal fight. This is about the \nright regulations that are necessary before we take a good idea and \nmess it up. Crowdfunding is a good idea. It is an exciting idea. There \nare great entrepreneurs out there. The Internet could be a very \npowerful tool. But everyone knows if you enter into new territory \nwithout caution and care, you can fall off a cliff that you didn't even \nknow was there. That is exactly what the House bill is going to do.\n  If you don't want to take my word for it, let's talk about what AARP \nsays about it. This is the first letter. I am going to put a dozen \nletters into the Record in the next 10 minutes to try to get the \nattention of the people on the other side of the aisle. This is all an \nattempt to get their attention over the weekend, and I hope the press \nwill write about these letters so when they come back on Monday they \ncan say: Oh, my gosh. We have a good bill that came from the House, but \nthere are some real flaws and we should fix it before we create another \nWall Street debacle or before we see people ripped off again like we \njust went through in the last 6 years.\n  How short is our memory about investors getting stripped, going \nbankrupt because of exactly the same thing: just not being careful, not \nhaving the right rules in place, not having the right enforcements in \nplace. This was like yesterday. That is why when the leadership said we \nwere just going to take up the House bill, I said: Wait a minute. No, \nno, no.\n  This is what the AARP said, Joyce Rogers:\n\n       I am writing to reiterate our opposition to the lack of \n     investor protections in H.R. 3606--\n\n  Again, the House-passed, ill-advised political opportunity bill. That \nis what I am calling it. That is what it is--\n\n     that soon will be considered on the floor of the Senate \n     floor. AARP's primary concern is that this legislation \n     undermines vital investor protections and threatens market \n     integrity.\n\n  So AARP doesn't urge the Senate to kill the bill.\n\n       AARP urges the Senate to take a more balanced approach, \n     recognizing both an interest in facilitating access to \n     capital for new and small businesses and in preserving \n     essential regulations. . . . We believe the amendment to be \n     offered by Senators Reed, Landrieu and Levin, moves closer to \n     achieving this balance and deserves your support.\n\n  It goes on to say that sometimes the people who are taken advantage \nof are the elderly. So wake up, Senators from Florida. Wake up, \nSenators from Michigan. Wake up, Senators who have big senior \npopulations. The AARP is against the House bill, the ill-advised \npolitical opportunity bill.\n  North American Securities Administrators Association--they sent a \nletter yesterday, from Jack Herstein. It is seven pages long. They go \ninto great detail:\n\n       On behalf of the North American Securities Administrators \n     Association--\n\n  I don't think this is a liberal think tank. I think this is a very \nwell respected, not a leftwing, regulate-everything-that-moves kind of \ngroup. I think that is correct. He says:\n\n       I am writing to express concerns regarding several \n     provisions, most notably our strong concern with the \n     extraordinary step of pre-empting state law for \n     ``crowdfunding'', contained in [the ill-advised political \n     opportunity bill which was passed by the House.]\n       State securities regulators support efforts by Congress to \n     ensure that laws facilitating the raising of capital are \n     modern and efficient, and that Americans are encouraged to \n     raise money to invest in the economy. However, it is critical \n     that in doing so, Congress not discard basic investor \n     protections.\n\n  I am going to submit this letter, without objection, I hope, to the \nRecord.\n  This is from the Council of Institutional Investors, ``a nonprofit, \nnonpartisan association of public, corporate and union pension plans.'' \nLet me repeat, not just union pension plans but public and corporate \npension plans. They are writing with questions about the House ill-\nadvised political opportunity bill, and it goes into great detail. I am \nputting this into the record hoping people will actually read the \nCongressional Record.\n  Another letter to Speaker Boehner and Nancy Pelosi. This was \ndelivered to the House. It may be a little different from the one to \nthe Senate, so I would like to put that into the Record. These are very \nimportant letters received just recently. That is why I am asking \npeople to wake up, pay attention.\n  Securities and Exchange Commission, March 13. This is to Chairman \nJohnson and Ranking Member Shelby basically saying:\n\n       Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606. . \n     . . As the Senate prepares to debate many of the capital \n     formation initiatives addressed by H.R. 3606, I want to share \n     with you some of my concerns on some important aspects of \n     this significant legislation.\n\n  That is by Mary Schapiro, Chairman, outlining a dozen of her concerns \nbecause, of course, she thinks there is going to be a debate. She would \nexpect a debate on a bill of this nature and magnitude and diversion \nfrom the ordinary. But we were not going to have a debate. We were just \ngoing to be told to take the House bill or leave it until a few of us \nsaid: No, slow this train down. This is no way to run a railroad.\n  We are not trying to kill the bill. We are not trying to delay. We \nare trying to have at least a 2- or 3-day debate on an important piece \nof legislation that, if it is not done right, is going to absolutely \nruin the best chance we have had in decades to actually get capital \ninto the hands of businesses.\n  Everyone here should now know me well enough as chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee to know I have spent literally nights, days, and \nweekends on the floor of this Senate trying to figure out ways to get \ncapital into the hands of small businesses. Why would I stand here and \ntry to stop that? I have spent my whole time as the Senate chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee trying to do that. But, again, there is a \nright way to do that and a wrong way.\n  If we take the wrong path and fall off of a cliff, we are going to \nruin the chance we have with this new Internet tool, this very exciting \nopportunity, and we are going to ruin our chance to get this done.\n  Who is going to suffer? The same people who suffer all the time, the \nsmall businesses and the exciting opportunities and entrepreneurs who \nneed our help.\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\n  Any bill that is a major bill can stand the scrutiny of time before \nthe public, and amendment. If it cannot stand that scrutiny, then I \nsuggest there is something terribly flawed with it. That is what we are \ntrying to provide, scrutiny.\n  This letter comes from the AFL CIO, from Jeff Hauser, an e-mail:\n\n       America needs jobs. Yet Congress cannot enact such basic \n     legislation as the reauthorization of the surface \n     transportation bill--\n\n  Which we passed, but it has not been completed. He goes on to say:\n\n       Workers' retirement savings will be in greater risk of \n     fraud and speculation if securities market deregulation once \n     again is railroaded through Congress. Once again our economy \n     will be at risk from the folly of policy makers promoting \n     financial bubbles and ignoring the needs of the real economy. \n     The AFL CIO calls on Congress to set aside the politics of \n     the 1 percent, the old game of special favors for Wall \n     Street.\n\n  They are very strong in their language, probably a lot stronger than \nthese other organizations. But I think they have reason to be. Many of \ntheir members were taken to the cleaners by scams on Wall Street. They \nhave yet to recover. Their 401s have yet to recover. Even yesterday, or \nlast week, in the paper I saw one of the big companies that failed. I \nthink it was MF Global. Did you all see that in the newspaper? They \nfailed. Of course, it was a terrible debacle. Lots of people lost \nmoney. But the CEO is walking away with a $7 million bonus.\n  People who work hard all day have a very hard time understanding how \nwe in the Congress can allow the CEO to walk away with a bonus of $7 \nmillion when he bankrupted thousands of people. That is a good \nquestion. Are we going to do that again with this House bill? I hope \nnot.\n  Let's put the AFL CIO on record saying slow down.\n  This is the next message I want to put in from the secretaries of \nstate--and I want to read off who they are: the secretary from \nMissouri, Robin Carnahan; the secretary from Massachusetts, William \nFalvin; the secretary from New Hampshire, William Gardner; the \nsecretary from Mississippi--I believe is a Republican--Delbert \nHosemann; the secretary from North Carolina, secretary of state Elaine \nMarshall; the secretary from Nevada, Ross Miller; the secretary of \nstate from Indiana, Charles White; and the secretary of state from \nIllinois, Jesse White.\n  Jesse White says the same thing: Beware of the House bill. It is \nflawed. It has some good ideas in it, but those flaws need to be \ncorrected.\n  That is what the Reed-Landrieu-Levin et al amendment does. We are not \ntrying to kill these wonderful, exciting ideas. We are trying to fix it \nso it is better. I hope our Members on the other side will join us in \ndoing that, and I would like to submit this to the Record.\n\n  There are two more. Actually, I am sorry, four more--we have so many. \nThe next one is from my office of financial institutions from Baton \nRouge, my commissioner, banking commissioner, who wrote me. He is \ngenerally in favor of some of the things in the House bill. But he \nsaid:\n\n       I am writing to urge you to oppose the preemption of \n     Louisiana law to protect investors.\n\n  I would like to put that into the Record.\n  The American Sustainable Business Council. It is signed by David \nLevine. Again, I don't believe this is a left-leaning group. I think it \nis a pretty centrist organization. They urge us to take a hard look at \nthe House bill.\n  Finally, Madam President, I want to have printed in the Record--this \nis when I got nervous: when I started receiving letters in my office \nfrom crowdfunders themselves against the House bill. The people who \ngave the idea to start up crowdfunding have now said the House bill is \nflawed. Here is what they say:\n\n       I write in favor of the bipartisan compromise CROWDFUNDING \n     Act proposed recently by Senators Merkley, S. Brown, Bennet \n     and Landrieu.\n\n  That is the crowdfunding act that is in this substitute.\n\n       Yesterday evening's introduction--\n\n  This was last week--\n\n     of the first bi-partisan Senate crowdfunding bill is a big \n     step forward in our fight to get equity crowdfunding passed \n     through Congress. I have been to Washington, DC 7 times since \n     mid-November, discussing [this legislation]. The offices of \n     the Senators on the Banking Committee have been very \n     receptive to input from the entrepreneurial community and \n     have adopted many of our suggestions.\n\n  But they go on to say:\n\n       This latest bill . . . is important because, unlike \n     previous bills, for the first time we have a Senate bill with \n     bipartisan sponsorship, a balance of state oversight and \n     federal uniformity, industry standard investor protections, \n     and workable funding caps. This bill has a legitimate chance \n     at quieting those who were previously trumping up fears of \n     fraud [and] bad actors. . . . To date the main issues the \n     opposition raised were regarding fraud and state oversight.\n\n  What they are saying is we are the ones who helped invent this \nconcept. We don't think the House bill is where it should be. We are \nsupporting the Merkley-Bennet approach, which is in this bill.\n  Launcht, we hear you, and we are trying to respond.\n  Finally, Motaavi--again, a crowdfunder advocate. People, very \nentrepreneurial, coming up with these ideas saying the same thing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                   March 15, 2012.\n     Re Investor Protection, Market Integrity and the JOBS Act.\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of AARP, I am writing to \n     reiterate our opposition to the lack of investor protections \n     in H.R. 3606, the House-passed JOBS bill that soon will be \n     considered on the Senate floor. AARP's primary concern is \n     that this legislation undermines vital investor protections \n     and threatens market integrity. The goal of facilitating \n     access to capital for new and small businesses is a worthy \n     one. However, we do not believe that the best way to create \n     jobs is to weaken essential regulatory protections that were \n     put in place to address specific marketplace problems that \n     otherwise would still exist.\n       This debate is critical to older Americans, who with a \n     lifetime of savings and investments are disproportionately \n     represented among the victims of investment fraud. We share \n     the concerns--raised by SEC Chair Mary Schapiro, the North \n     American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), law \n     professors, investor advocates, and others--that absent \n     safeguards ensuring proper oversight and investor protection, \n     the various provisions in H.R. 3606 may well open the \n     floodgates to a repeat of the kind of penny stock and other \n     frauds that ensnared financially unsophisticated and other \n     vulnerable investors in the past. The absence of adequate \n     regulation in the past has undermined the integrity of the \n     markets and damaged investor confidence while having no \n     positive impact on job creation.\n       AARP urges the Senate to take a more balanced approach, \n     recognizing both an interest in facilitating access to \n     capital for new and small businesses and in preserving \n     essential regulations that protect investors from fraud and \n     abuse, promote the transparency on which well-functioning \n     markets depend, and ensure a fair and efficient marketplace. \n     We believe the amendment to be offered by Senators Reed, \n     Landrieu and Levin, moves closer to achieving this balance \n     and deserves your support.\n       We urge you to vote yes on the Reed-Landrieu-Levin \n     amendment.\n       If you have any further questions, please feel free to \n     contact me, or have your staff contact Mary Wallace of our \n     Government Affairs staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Joyce A.

Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators \n     Association (NASAA), I am writing to express concerns \n     regarding several provisions, most notably our strong concern \n     with the extraordinary step of pre-empting state law for \n     ``crowdfunding'', contained in H.R. 3606, the Jumpstart Our \n     Business Startups Act, which was passed by the House of \n     Representatives on March 8, 2011. While NASAA applauds \n     Congress' desire to facilitate access to capital for new and \n     small businesses, the version of the bill that passed the \n     House is deeply flawed. The Senate must now address these \n     problems.\n       State securities regulators support efforts by Congress to \n     ensure that laws facilitating the raising of capital are \n     modern and efficient, and that Americans are encouraged to \n     raise money to invest in the economy. However, it is critical \n     that in doing so, Congress not discard basic investor \n     protections. Investment fraud is real, and it can be \n     particularly pervasive in small exempted offerings.\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\n       Expanded access to capital markets for startups and small \n     businesses can be beneficial, but only insofar as investors \n     can be confident that they are protected, that transparency \n     in the marketplace is preserved, and that investment \n     opportunities are legitimate. State securities regulators are \n     acutely aware of today's difficult economic environment, and \n     its effects on job growth. Small businesses are important to \n     job growth, and to improving the economy. However, by \n     weakening investor protections and placing unnecessary \n     restrictions on the ability of state securities regulators to \n     protect retail investors from the risks associated with \n     smaller, speculative investments, Congress is on the verge of \n     enacting policies that, although intended to strengthen the \n     economy, will in fact only make it more difficult for small \n     businesses to access investment capital.\n       The JOBS Act that was passed by the House is a repackaging \n     of what were originally seven bills, reorganized into a \n     single bill, with six distinct Titles and twenty-one \n     sections. While NASAA believes virtually every Title of this \n     bill would benefit from greater scrutiny, we will confine our \n     comments today to those Titles and Sections of H.R. 3606 that \n     pose the most urgent risk to average, ``Main Street'' \n     investors that are NASAA's principal concern.\n\n  Title I: The Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging Growth \n                             Companies Act\n\n       Title I contains a number of troubling provisions. It \n     creates a new category of issuer referred to as an ``emerging \n     growth company'', defined as a company with annual gross \n     revenues of less than $1 billion in its most recent fiscal \n     year. This status continues until five years after an initial \n     public offering or until the issuer has an annual gross \n     revenue exceeding $1 billion or is designated a ``large \n     accelerated filer.'' Particularly troublesome to NASAA are \n     the exemptions applicable to such companies: for example, \n     they are exempted from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley \n     Act of 2002 (SOX) which requires an independent audit of an \n     assessment of a company's internal controls as well as the \n     requirement to provide three (instead of two) years of \n     audited financials statement in a company's registration \n     materials. S. 1933 also allows brokers and dealers to publish \n     research about emerging growth companies prior to an initial \n     public offering, even where they will participate in the \n     offering itself.\n       Title I would give all but the very largest companies \n     direct access to average, unsophisticated investors without \n     being required to provide the normal types of financial and \n     risk disclosures applicable to public reporting companies. \n     The typical retail investor, unlike larger business \n     financiers, does not have the ability to conduct an \n     independent investigation of an emerging growth company and \n     make fully informed investment decisions. Such investors rely \n     on published financial and research data. Section 404(b) of \n     SOX was enacted in response to major accounting scandals that \n     cost investors billions of dollars; rolling back these \n     requirements for companies with annual gross revenues of less \n     than $1 billion could, once again, have devastating \n     consequences.\n       Similarly, weakening the standards applicable to research \n     analysts and tearing down the Chinese walls implemented in \n     response to the ``Global Settlement'' scandal could create a \n     conflict of interest resulting in devastating losses for Main \n     Street investors. These barriers were put into place in \n     response to enforcement actions brought by a number of state \n     and federal regulators. Leading brokerage firms agreed to \n     severely limit interactions between equity research analysts \n     and investment bankers, due to conflicts of interest that \n     tainted the investment process. Recent experience teaches us \n     now is the time to strengthen the protection of investors, \n     not weaken these standards.\n\n          Title II: The Access to Capital for Job Creators Act\n\n\n                 Section 201: Modification of Exemption\n\n       Sec. 201 of the JOBS Act would repeal the SEC's ban on \n     general solicitation under Regulation D Rule 506 to allow \n     general solicitation in transactions ``not involving any \n     public offering, whether or not such transaction involves \n     general solicitation or general advertising.''\n       Current law requires securities offered to the general \n     public to be registered with the SEC. Regulation D was built \n     upon the premise that certain offerings should be given \n     special treatment because they are non-public, or \n     ``private.'' This means that the investment is marketed only \n     to people with whom the company has a preexisting \n     relationship. Given their knowledge of the company and its \n     operations, these investors are in a better position than the \n     general public to gauge the risks of the investment. They, \n     therefore, have less need for the protections that flow from \n     the securities registration process. This concept of giving \n     preferential treatment to private offerings is embedded \n     throughout state and federal securities law, and a reversal \n     of this fundamental condition of Rule 506 would have far-\n     reaching repercussions.\n       The removal of the ``general solicitation'' prohibition \n     contemplated by Section 201 would represent a radical change \n     that would dismantle important rules that govern the offering \n     process for securities. NASAA has repeatedly expressed its \n     concern to Congress about allowing general solicitation in \n     rule 506 (Regulation D) offerings. Since the enactment of the \n     National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, \n     Regulation D, Rule 506 offerings have received virtually no \n     regulatory scrutiny, and have become a haven for investment \n     fraud. Moreover, unlike other types of Regulation D \n     offerings, where the size of the offering is capped, the \n     amount of money that an issuer can raise under Rule 506 is \n     unlimited, and hence the opportunity for fraud on a massive \n     scale is especially acute in this area. Given state \n     experience with Regulation D offerings, and the significant \n     fraud and investor losses associated with them, NASAA opposes \n     Section 201.\n       Because many states already allow issuers to use general \n     advertisements to attract accredited investors, NASAA does \n     not oppose outright the underlying goal of Title II. However, \n     NASAA believes such an expansion should be accomplished by \n     the establishment of a new exemption with provisions to \n     protect investors and the markets.\n\n\n       Section 201: Explanation of Exemption (McHenry Amendment)\n\n       During consideration of H.R. 3606 the House adopted an \n     amendment to Section 201, sponsored by Rep. Patrick McHenry \n     (R NC) that will exempt from registration as a broker or \n     dealer any trading-platform that serves as intermediary in an \n     exempted Rule 506 offering. The significance of the McHenry \n     Amendment is to prevent ``intermediaries'' that facilitate \n     the sale of securities through ``crowdfunding'' from \n     requirements to register or be regulated as a broker.\n       NASAA appreciates that the question of how crowdfunding \n     intermediaries may best be regulated is complex, however \n     categorically exempting these sellers from broker \n     registration requirements, in the absence of a sensible \n     alternative for their licensing and regulation, is foolish \n     and reckless. As amended, Section 201 will leave \n     intermediaries open to conflicts, such inducements to list, \n     de-list, or promote certain offerings. Moreover, as amended, \n     Section 201 will deny any regulator effective means to \n     examine or discipline these sellers.\n\n           Title III: The Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act\n\n       Title III of the JOBS Act is identical to H.R. 2930, the \n     Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act, which was approved by the \n     House last fall. Two separate ``crowdfunding'' bills have \n     been sponsored in the Senate: S. 1791, sponsored by Sen. \n     Scott Brown (R MA), and S. 1970, sponsored by Sen. Jeff \n     Merkley (D OR).\n       While intending to promote an internet-based fundraising \n     technique known as ``crowdfunding'' as a tool for investment, \n     this legislation will needlessly preempt state securities \n     laws and weaken important investor protections. NASAA \n     appreciates that the concept of crowdfunding is appealing in \n     many respects because it provides small, innovative \n     enterprises access to capital that might not otherwise be \n     available. Indeed, this is precisely the reason that states \n     are now considering adopting a model rule that would \n     establish a more modest exemption for crowdfunding as it is \n     traditionally understood.\n\n\n                Section 301: Individual Investment Limit\n\n       Section 301 contemplates a hard-cap on individual \n     crowdfunding investments that goes far beyond anything that \n     is being contemplated by the states, or even by the \n     overwhelming majority of advocates of crowdfunding. By \n     setting an individual investment cap of 10 percent of annual \n     income, or $10,000, Section 301 will create an exemption that \n     will expose many more American families to potentially \n     devastating financial harm.\n       NASAA recognizes that for certain very wealthy individuals, \n     or seasoned investors, a cap of $10,000 may make sense. \n     Unfortunately, Sec. 301 fails to distinguish between these \n     few wealthy, sophisticated investors, and the general \n     investing public, imposing a $10,000 cap on both groups. \n     Given that most U.S. households have a relatively modest \n     amount of savings, a loss of $10,000, in even a single case, \n     can be financially crippling.\n       NASAA believes a superior method of limiting individual \n     investment amounts would be a scaled approach that would cap \n     most investments at a modest level, but allow experienced \n     investors, Who can afford to sustain higher losses, to invest \n     up to $10,000.\n\n\n                 Section 301: Aggregate Offering Limit\n\n       Section 301 would also permit businesses to solicit \n     investments of up to $2 million, in increments of $10,000 per \n     investment. Such a high cap on aggregate investment makes the \n     bill inconsistent with the expressed rationale for the \n     crowdfunding exception.\n       Registration and filing requirements at both the state and \n     federal level exist to protect investors. A company that is \n     sufficiently large to warrant the raising of $2 million in \n     investment capital is also a company that can afford to \n     comply with the applicable registration and filing \n     requirements at both the state and federal level.\n\n\n                  Section 303: Preemption of State Law\n\n       Section 303 would preempt state laws requiring disclosures, \n     or reviewing exempted investment offerings, before they are \n     sold to the public. The authority to require such filings is \n     critical to the ability of states to get ``under the hood'' \n     of an offering to make sure that it is what it says it is. \n     Moreover, as a matter of principle and policy, NASAA ardently \n     believes that the review of offerings of this size should \n     remain primarily the responsibility of the states. State \n     regulators are closer, more accessible, and more in\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n     touch with the local and regional economic issues that affect \n     both the issuer and the investor in a small business \n     offering.\n       Congress would be rash to preempt states from regulating \n     crowdfunding. Preempting state authority is a very serious \n     step and not something that should be undertaken lightly or \n     without careful deliberation, including a thorough \n     examination of all available alternatives. In this case, \n     preemption for a very new and untested concept to raise \n     capital, without a demonstrable history of reliability, is \n     especially unwarranted, as the states have far more \n     experience with crowdfunding than Congress or the SEC, and as \n     the states have historically been the primary ``cops on the \n     beat'' in the regulation of all areas of small business \n     capital formation.\n       For a clear example of the dangers of preempting state \n     securities look no further than the effect of the National \n     Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA). As a result of \n     this Congressional action, private offerings receive \n     virtually no regulatory scrutiny. State securities regulators \n     are prohibited from reviewing these offerings prior to their \n     sale to investors, and federal regulators lack the resources \n     to conduct any meaningful review, so the offerings proceed \n     unquestioned. Today, the exemption is being misused to steal \n     millions of dollars from investors through false and \n     misleading representations in offerings that provide the \n     appearance of legitimacy without any meaningful scrutiny of \n     regulators. In essence, the private offering provisions of \n     Rule 506 are being used by unscrupulous promoters to evade \n     review and fly under the radar of justice.\n       Instead of preempting states, Congress should allow the \n     states to take a leading role in implementing an appropriate \n     regulatory framework for crowdfunding. Based on the small \n     size of the offering, the small size of the issuer, and the \n     relatively small investment amounts, it is clear that the \n     states are the only regulators in a position to police this \n     new market and protect its participants. Moreover, and as has \n     already been noted, the states are now in the midst of \n     developing a Model Crowdfunding Exemption.\n       As the securities regulators closest to the investing \n     public, and in light of their distinguished record of \n     effective regulation, the States are the most appropriate \n     regulator in this area. State securities regulators are not \n     only capable of acting, but, indeed, are acting in this \n     critical area, and Congress should continue to allow the \n     states to do so.\n\n           Title IV: The Small Company Capital Formation Act\n\n       Title IV of the JOBS Act is identical to S. 1544, which has \n     been sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Jon Tester (D MT) and \n     Pat Toomey (R PA).\n       Given the risky nature of these offerings, NASAA believes \n     that state oversight is critically important for investor \n     protection. At the same time, NASAA recognizes the costs and \n     difficulty of the typical registration process, and the \n     particular burden it places upon small companies. Indeed, for \n     this reason the states have adopted a streamlined process for \n     an issuer to use in an offering under Regulation A.\n       NASAA had significant concerns regarding the original \n     version of this legislation because it stripped away investor \n     protection by preempting state review of Regulation A \n     offerings that are sold through broker-dealers. However, \n     Title IV of H.R. 3606 does not include the preemptive \n     provisions that were in the original version of the bill. \n     While NASAA remains concerned about the dollar amount of \n     potential offerings under Title IV, as well as the bill's \n     nonsensical requirement that the SEC automatically increase \n     the ceiling in the future, every two years, in perpetuity, we \n     believe that the states' ability to review these offerings, \n     along with the SEC's proper exercise of discretion in \n     creating reasonable reporting requirements for issuers, will \n     prove to achieve a proper balance of the issuers' needs with \n     investor protection.\n\n        Title V: The Private Company Flexibility and Growth Act\n\n       Title V of H.R. 3606 would raise the threshold for \n     mandatory registration under the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') from 500 shareholders to 1,000 \n     shareholders for all companies. This bill would also exclude \n     accredited investors and securities held by shareholders who \n     received such securities under employee compensation plans \n     from the 1,000-shareholder threshold.\n       Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to \n     register equity securities with the SEC if those securities \n     are held by 500 or more record holders and the company has \n     total assets of more than $10 million. After a company \n     registers with the SEC under Section 12(g), it must comply \n     with all of the Exchange Act's reporting requirements.\n       The states are primarily interested in the issues related \n     to the regulation of small, non-public companies. We give \n     considerable deference to the SEC in the regulation of public \n     companies and secondary trading. However, we do have concerns \n     about drastic changes in the thresholds for reporting \n     companies or the information they must disclose.\n       The primary reason for requiring a company to be ``public'' \n     is to facilitate secondary trading of the company's \n     securities by providing easily-accessible information to \n     potential purchasers. The principal concern for states is the \n     facilitation of this secondary trading market with adequate \n     and accurate information. It may be possible to achieve this \n     without full-blown Exchange Act registration and periodic \n     reporting, but the states are wary of changes that may lead \n     to the creation of less informed markets.\n       No matter what threshold number is chosen before a company \n     becomes ``public,'' it makes little sense to exclude any \n     investor from the count of beneficial holders. Those that \n     purchased from the issuer were protected by the requirements \n     of the Securities Act. Both the seller and the purchaser \n     benefit from the robust marketplace facilitated by the \n     Exchange Act registration. Accordingly, NASAA believes the \n     registration threshold should be based upon the need to \n     provide for a legitimate secondary trading market. Regardless \n     of where the threshold is set, everyone who is a potential \n     seller in the market should be counted. This would include \n     all beneficial owners, not just holders of record.\n\n                      Title VI: Capital Expansion\n\n       Title VI of H.R. 3606 would raise the threshold for \n     mandatory registration under the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 from 500 shareholders to 2,000 shareholders for all \n     banks and bank holding companies, and raises the shareholder \n     deregistration threshold from 300 shareholders to 1,200 \n     shareholders.\n       NASAA understands the purpose of Title VI is to remedy a \n     specific problem that is today confronting certain community \n     banks. Specifically, as a result of the increasing costs of \n     public company registration, many community banks have \n     determined that deregistration is in the best interests of \n     their shareholders. But in order to deregister, community \n     banks must have fewer than 300 shareholders. As a result, \n     community banks must often buy back shares to deregister, \n     which reduces the access of small banks to capital and \n     deprives small communities of an opportunity to invest in \n     local companies.\n       Given the narrow scope of this Title and its application to \n     only banks and bank holding companies, NASAA has no position \n     on Title VI.\n       Finally, in view of the significant changes that H.R. 3606 \n     would make to our securities laws, and of the fundamentally \n     experimental nature of many of this bill's provisions, NASAA \n     urges that H.R. 3606 proceed through the Senate under regular \n     order, and that the bill be subject to the scrutiny of the \n     Senate Banking Committee and it Securities Subcommittee. \n     Securities regulators, legal scholars, investor advocates, \n     and others have cautioned the Senate about the impact H.R. \n     3606 could have on investors and on our capital markets. The \n     Senate must answer these questions and concerns, thoroughly \n     and to its satisfaction, before it votes on H.R. 3606 or \n     similar legislation.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these important issues. \n     If you have any questions, please feel free to contact \n     Michael Canning, Director of Policy, or Anya Coverman, \n     Assistant Director of Policy, at the NASAA Corporate Office.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Jack E.

With that commitment in mind, and in \n     anticipation of your upcoming March 6 hearing entitled \n     ``Spurring Job Growth Through Capital Formation While \n     Protecting Investors, Part II,'' we would like to share with \n     you some of our concerns and questions about S. 1933, the \n     ``Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging Growth \n     Companies Act of 2011.''\n       Our questions and concerns about S. 1933 are grounded in \n     the Council's membership approved corporate governance best \n     practices. Those policies explicitly reflect our members' \n     view that all companies, including ``companies in the process \n     of going public should practice good corporate governance.'' \n     Thus, we respectfully request that the Committee consider \n     changes to, or removal of, the following provisions of S. \n     1933:\n\n\n                              Definitions\n\n       We question the appropriateness of the qualities defining \n     the term ``emerging growth company'' (EGC) as set forth in \n     Sec. 2(a) and 2(b).\n       As you are aware, under Sec. 2(a) and 2(b) a company would \n     qualify for special status for up to five years, so long as \n     it has less than $1 billion in annual revenues and not more \n     than $700 million in public float following its initial \n     public offering (IPO). The Council is concerned that those \n     thresholds may be too high in establishing an appropriate \n     balance between facilitating capital formation and protecting \n     investors.\n       For example, we note that some of the most knowledgeable \n     and active advocates for\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n     small business capital formation have in the past agreed that \n     a company with more than $250 million of public float \n     generally has the resources and infrastructure to comply with \n     existing U.S. securities regulations. We, therefore, urge the \n     Committee to reevaluate the basis for the proposed thresholds \n     defining an EGC.\n\n\n                         Disclosure Obligations\n\n       We have concerns about Sec. 3(a)(1) because it would \n     effectively limit shareowners' ability to voice their \n     concerns about executive compensation practices.\n       More specifically, Sec. 3(a)(1) would revoke the right of \n     shareowners, as owners of an EGC, to express their opinion \n     collectively on the appropriateness of executive pay packages \n     and severance agreements.\n       The Council's longstanding policy on advisory shareowner \n     votes on executive compensation calls on all companies to \n     ``provide annually for advisory shareowner votes on the \n     compensation of senior executives.'' The Investors Working \n     Group echoed the Council's position in its July 2009 report \n     entitled U.S. Financial Regulatory Reform: The Investors' \n     Perspective.\n       Advisory shareowner votes on executive compensation and \n     golden parachutes efficiently and effectively encourage \n     dialogue between boards and shareowners about pay concerns \n     and support a culture of performance, transparency and \n     accountability in executive compensation. Moreover, \n     compensation committees looking to actively rein in executive \n     compensation can utilize the results of advisory shareowner \n     votes to defend against excessively demanding officers or \n     compensation consultants.\n       The 2011 proxy season has demonstrated the benefits of \n     nonbinding shareowner votes on pay. As described in Say on \n     Pay: Identifying Investors Concerns:\n       Compensation committees and boards have become much more \n     thoughtful about their executive pay programs and pay \n     decisions. Companies and boards in particular are \n     articulating the rationale for these decisions much better \n     than in the past. Some of the most egregious practices have \n     already waned considerably, and may even disappear entirely.\n       As the Committee deliberates the appropriateness of \n     disenfranchising certain shareowners from the right to \n     express their views on a company's executive compensation \n     package, we respectfully request that the following factors \n     be considered:\n       1. Companies are not required to change their executive \n     compensation programs in response to the outcome of a say on \n     pay or golden parachutes vote. Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC) rules simply require that companies discuss \n     how the vote results affected their executive compensation \n     decisions.\n       2. The SEC approved a two-year deferral for the say on pay \n     rule for smaller U.S. companies. As a result, companies with \n     less than $75 million in market capitalization do not have to \n     comply with the rule until 2013, thus the rule's impact on \n     IPO activity is presumably unknown. We, therefore, question \n     whether there is a basis for the claim by some that advisory \n     votes on pay and golden parachutes are an impediment to \n     capital formation or job creation.\n       We also have concerns about Sec. 3(a)(2) because it would \n     potentially reduce the ability of investors to evaluate the \n     appropriateness of executive compensation.\n       More specifically, Sec. 3(a)(2) would exempt an EGC from \n     Sec. 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which \n     would require a company to include in its proxy statement \n     information that shows the relationship between executive \n     compensation actually paid and the financial performance of \n     the issuer.\n       We note that the SEC has yet to issue proposed rules \n     relating to the disclosure of pay versus performance required \n     by Sec. 14(i). As a result, no public companies are currently \n     required to provide the disclosure. We, therefore, again \n     question whether a disclosure that has not yet even been \n     proposed for public comment is impeding capital formation or \n     job creation.\n       Our membership approved policies emphasize that executive \n     compensation is one of the most critical and visible aspects \n     of a company's governance. Executive pay decisions are one of \n     the most direct ways for shareowners to assess the \n     performance of the board and the compensation committee.\n       The Council endorses reasonable, appropriately structured \n     pay-for-performance programs that reward executives for \n     sustainable, superior performance over the long-term. It is \n     the job of the board of directors and the compensation \n     committee to ensure that executive compensation programs are \n     effective, reasonable and rational with respect to critical \n     factors such as company performance.\n       Transparency of executive compensation is a primary concern \n     of Council members. All aspects of executive compensation, \n     including all information necessary for shareowners to \n     understand how and how much executives are paid should be \n     clearly, comprehensively and promptly disclosed in plain \n     English in the annual proxy statement.\n       Transparency of executive pay enables shareowners to \n     evaluate the performance of the compensation committee and \n     the board in setting executive pay, to assess pay-for-\n     performance links and to optimize their role in overseeing \n     executive compensation through such means as proxy voting. It \n     is, after all, shareowners, not executives, whose money is at \n     risk.\n\n\n                   Accounting and Auditing Standards\n\n       We have concerns about Sec. 3(c) and Sec. 5 because those \n     provisions would effectively impair the independence of \n     private sector accounting and auditing standard setting, \n     respectively.\n       More specifically, Sec. 3(c) would prohibit the independent \n     private sector Financial Accounting Standards Board from \n     exercising their own expert judgment, after a thorough public \n     due process in which the views of investors and other \n     interested parties are solicited and carefully considered, in \n     determining the appropriate effective date for new or revised \n     accounting standards applicable to EGCs.\n       Similarly, Sec. 5 would prohibit the independent private \n     sector Public Company Accounting Oversight Board from \n     exercising their own expert judgment, after a thorough public \n     due process in which the view of investors and other \n     interested parties are solicited and carefully considered, in \n     determining improvements to certain standards applicable to \n     the audits of EGCs.\n       The Council's membership ``has consistently supported the \n     view that the responsibility to promulgate accounting and \n     auditing standards should reside with independent private \n     sector organizations.'' Thus, the Council opposes legislative \n     provisions like Sec. 3(a) and Sec. 5 that override or unduly \n     interfere with the technical decisions and judgments \n     (including the timing of the implementation of standards) of \n     private sector standard setters.\n       A 2010 joint letter by the Council, the American Institute \n     of Certified Public Accountants, the Center for Audit \n     Quality, the CFA Institute, the Financial Executives \n     International, the Investment Company Institute, and the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce explains, in part, the basis for the \n     Council's strong support for the independence of private \n     sector standard setters:\n       We believe that interim and annual audited financial \n     statements provide investors and companies with information \n     that is vital to making investment and business decisions. \n     The accounting standards underlying such financial statements \n     derive their legitimacy from the confidence that they are \n     established, interpreted and, when necessary, modified based \n     on independent, objective considerations that focus on the \n     needs and demands of investors--the primary users of \n     financial statements. We believe that in order for investors, \n     businesses and other users to maintain this confidence, the \n     process by which accounting standards are developed must be \n     free--both in fact and appearance--of outside influences that \n     inappropriately benefit any particular participant or group \n     of participants in the financial reporting system to the \n     detriment of investors, business and the capital markets. We \n     believe political influences that dictate one particular \n     outcome for an accounting standard without the benefit of \n     public due process that considers the views of investors and \n     other stakeholders would have adverse impacts on investor \n     confidence and the quality of financial reporting, which are \n     of critical importance to the successful operation of the \n     U.S. capital markets.\n\n\n                        Internal Controls Audit\n\n       We have concerns about Sec. 4 because that provision would, \n     in our view, unwisely expand the existing exemption for most \n     public companies from the requirement to have effective \n     internal controls.\n       More specifically, Sec. 4 would exempt an EGC from the \n     requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n     2002 (SOX). That section requires an independent audit of a \n     company's assessment of its internal controls as a component \n     of its financial statement audit.\n       The Council has long been a proponent of Section 404 of \n     SOX. We believe that effective internal controls are critical \n     to ensuring investors receive reliable financial information \n     from public companies.\n       We note that Section 989G(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) already \n     exempts most public companies, including all smaller \n     companies, from the requirements of Section 404(b). We also \n     note that Section 989G(b) of Dodd-Frank required the SEC to \n     conduct a study on ``how the Commission could reduce the \n     burden of complying with section 404(b) . . . while \n     maintaining investor protections. . . .''\n       The SEC study, issued April 2011, revealed that (1) there \n     is strong evidence that the provisions of Section 404(b) \n     ``improves the reliability of internal control disclosures \n     and financial reporting overall and is useful to investors,'' \n     and (2) that the ``evidence does not suggest that granting an \n     exemption [from Section 404(b)] . . . would, by itself, \n     encourage companies in the United States or abroad to list \n     their IPOs in the United States.'' Finally, and importantly, \n     the study recommends explicitly against--what Sec. 4 attempts \n     to achieve--a further expansion of the Section 404(b) \n     exemption.\n\n\n      Availability of Information about Emerging Growth Companies\n\n       Finally, we have concerns about Sec. 6 of S. 1933 because \n     it appears to potentially create conflicts of interest for \n     financial analysts.\n       More specifically, we agree with the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce that the provisions of Sec. 6 as drafted ``may be a \n     blurring of boundaries that could create potential conflicts \n     of interests between the research and investment components \n     of broker-dealers.'' The Council membership supports the \n     provisions of Section 501 of SOX and the Global\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n     Research Analyst Settlement. Those provisions bolstered the \n     transparency, independence, oversight and accountability of \n     research analysts.\n       While the Council welcomes further examination of issues, \n     including potential new rules, relating to research analysts \n     as gatekeepers, it generally does not support legislative \n     provisions like Sec. 6 that would appear to weaken the \n     aforementioned investor protections.\n       The Council respectfully requests that the Committee \n     carefully consider our questions and concerns about the \n     provisions of S. 1933.

Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Shelby: Last week, \n     the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3606, the \n     ``Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.'' As the Senate \n     prepares to debate many of the capital formation initiatives \n     addressed by H.R. 3606, I wanted to share with you my \n     concerns on some important aspects of this significant \n     legislation.\n       The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission is \n     three-fold: protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly \n     and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. \n     Cost-effective access to capital for companies of all sizes \n     plays a critical role in our national economy, and companies \n     seeking access to capital should not be hindered by \n     unnecessary or overly burdensome regulations. At the same \n     time, we must balance our responsibility to facilitate \n     capital formation with our obligation to protect investors \n     and our markets. Too often, investors are the target of \n     fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities. As \n     you know, if the balance is tipped to the point where \n     investors are not confident that there are appropriate \n     protections, investors will lose confidence in our markets, \n     and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult \n     and expensive.\n       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of a \n     bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation \n     and includes certain promising approaches, I believe that \n     there are provisions that should be added or modified to \n     improve investor protections that are worthy of the Senate's \n     consideration.\n\n\n                 Definition of Emerging Growth Company\n\n       The ``IPO On-Ramp'' provisions of H.R. 3606 provide a \n     number of significant regulatory changes for what are defined \n     as ``emerging growth companies.'' While I share the view that \n     it is important to reduce the impediments to smaller \n     businesses conducting initial public offerings in the United \n     States, the definition of ``emerging growth company'' is so \n     broad that it would eliminate important protections for \n     investors in even very large companies, including those with \n     up to $1 billion in annual revenue. I am concerned that we \n     lack a clear understanding of the impact that the \n     legislation's exemptions would have on investor protection. A \n     lower annual revenue threshold would pose less risk to \n     investors and would more appropriately focus benefits \n     provided by the new provisions on those smaller businesses \n     that are the engine of growth for our economy and whose IPOs \n     the bill is seeking to encourage.\n\n\n             Changes to Research and Research Analyst Rules\n\n       H.R. 3606 also would weaken important protections related \n     to (1) the relationship between research analysts and \n     investment bankers within the same financial institution by \n     eliminating a number of safeguards established after the \n     research scandals of the dot-com era and (2) the treatment of \n     research reports prepared by underwriters of IPOs.\n       H.R. 3606 would remove certain important measures put in \n     place to enforce a separation between research analysts and \n     investment bankers who work in the same firm. The rules \n     requiring this separation were designed to address \n     inappropriate conflicts of interest and other objectionable \n     practices--for example, investment bankers promising \n     potential clients favorable research in return for lucrative \n     underwriting assignments--which ultimately severely harmed \n     investor confidence. In addition, H.R. 3606 would overturn \n     SRO rules that establish mandatory quiet periods designed to \n     prevent banks from using conflicted research to reward \n     insiders for selecting the bank as the underwriter. I am \n     concerned that the changes contained in H.R. 3606 could \n     foster a return to those practices and cause real and \n     significant damage to investors.\n       In addition, the legislation would allow, for the first \n     time, research reports in connection with an emerging growth \n     company IPO to be published before, during, and after the IPO \n     by the underwriter of that IPO without any such reports being \n     subject to the protections or accountability that currently \n     apply to offering prospectuses. In essence, research reports \n     prepared by underwriters in emerging growth company IPOs \n     would compete with prospectuses for investors' attention, and \n     investors would not have the full protections of the \n     securities laws if misled by the research reports.\n\n\n              Disclosure, Accounting and Auditing Matters\n\n       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to make \n     scaled disclosures, in an approach similar to that currently \n     permitted under our rules for smaller reporting companies, \n     and would provide other relief from specific disclosure \n     requirements, during the 5-year on-ramp period. While there \n     is room for reasonable debate about particular exemptions \n     included in the disclosure on-ramp, on balance I believe \n     allowing some scaled disclosure for emerging growth \n     companies could be a reasonable approach.\n       H.R. 3606, however, also would restrict the independence of \n     accounting and auditing standard-setting by the Financial \n     Accounting Standards Board (``FASB'') and the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB''). These provisions \n     undermine independent standard-setting by these expert \n     boards, and both the FASB and the PCAOB already have the \n     authority to consider different approaches for different \n     classes of issuers, if appropriate.\n       Moreover, H.R. 3606 would exempt emerging growth companies \n     from an audit of internal controls set forth in Section \n     404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act during the five-year on-ramp \n     period. IPO companies already have a two-year on-ramp period \n     under current SEC rules before such an audit is required. In \n     addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently exempted smaller \n     public companies (generally those with less than $75 million \n     in public float) from the audit requirement, which already \n     covers approximately 60 percent of reporting companies. I \n     continue to believe that the internal controls audit \n     requirement put in place after the Enron and other accounting \n     scandals of the early 2000's has significantly improved the \n     quality and reliability of financial reporting and provides \n     important investor protections, and therefore believe this \n     change is unwarranted.\n\n\n                     ``Test the Waters'' Materials\n\n       H.R. 3606 would allow emerging growth companies to ``test \n     the waters'' to determine whether investors would be \n     interested in an offering before filing IPO documents with \n     the Commission. This would allow offering and other materials \n     to be provided to accredited investors and qualified \n     institutional buyers before a prospectus--the key disclosure \n     document in an offering--is available.\n       There could be real value to permitting these types of pre-\n     filing communications: it could save companies time and \n     money, and make it more likely that companies that file for \n     IPOs can complete them. Indeed, there are some SEC rules that \n     permit ``test the waters'' activities already. However, \n     unlike the existing ``test the waters'' provisions, the \n     provisions of H.R. 3606 would not require companies to file \n     with the SEC and take responsibility for the materials they \n     use to solicit investor interest, even after they file for \n     their IPOs. This would result in uneven information for \n     investors who see both the ``test the waters'' materials and \n     the prospectus compared to those who only see the prospectus. \n     In addition, as with the provisions relating to research \n     reports, it could result in investors focusing their \n     attention on the ``test the waters'' materials instead of the \n     prospectuses, without important investor protections being \n     applied to those materials.\n\n\n           Confidential Filing of IPO Registration Statements\n\n       H.R. 3606 would permit emerging growth companies to submit \n     their registration statements confidentially in draft form \n     for SEC staff review. This reduction in transparency would \n     hamper the staff's ability to provide effective reviews, \n     since the staff benefits in its reviews from the perspectives \n     and insights that the public provides on IPO filings. It also \n     could require significant resources for staff review of \n     offerings that companies are not willing to make public and \n     then abandon before making a public filing. SEC staff \n     recently limited the general practice of permitting foreign \n     issuers to submit IPO registrations in nonpublic draft form \n     because of these concerns, and expanding that program to all \n     IPOs could adversely impact the IPO review program.\n\n\n                              Crowdfunding\n\n       H.R. 3606 also provides an exemption from Securities Act \n     registration for ``crowdfunding,'' which would permit \n     companies to offer and sell, in some cases, up to $2 million \n     of securities in publicly advertised offerings without \n     preparing a registration statement. For the past several \n     months, the staff has been analyzing crowdfunding, among \n     other capital formation strategies, and also has discussed \n     these strategies with the Commission's newly created Advisory \n     Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.\n       I recognize that proponents of crowdfunding believe this \n     method of raising money could help small businesses harness \n     the power of the internet and social media to raise small \n     amounts of very early stage capital from a large number of \n     investors. That said, I believe that the crowdfunding \n     exemption included as part of H.R. 3606 needs additional \n     safeguards to protect investors from\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\n     those who may seek to engage in fraudulent activities. \n     Without adequate protections, investor confidence in \n     crowdfunding could be significantly undermined and would not \n     achieve its goal of helping small businesses.\n       For example, an important safeguard that could be \n     considered to better protect investors in crowdfunding \n     offerings would be to provide for oversight of the industry \n     professionals that intermediate and facilitate these \n     offerings. With Commission oversight, these intermediaries \n     could serve a critical gatekeeper function, running \n     background checks, facilitating small businesses' provision \n     of complete and adequate disclosures to investors, and \n     providing the necessary support for these small businesses. \n     Commission oversight would further enhance customer \n     protections by requiring intermediaries to protect investors' \n     and issuers' funds and securities, for example by requiring \n     funds and securities to be held at an independent bank or \n     broker-dealer.\n       Investors also would benefit from a requirement to provide \n     certain basic information about companies seeking \n     crowdfunding investors. H.R. 3606 requires only limited \n     disclosures about the business investors are funding. \n     Additional information that would benefit investors should \n     include a description of the business or the business plan, \n     financial information, a summary of the risks facing the \n     business, a description of the voting rights and other rights \n     of the stock being offered, and ongoing updates on the status \n     of the business.\n\n\n            Changes to Section 12(g) Registration Thresholds\n\n       H.R. 3606 also would change the rules relating to the \n     thresholds that trigger public reporting by, among other \n     things, increasing the holder of record threshold that \n     triggers public reporting for companies and bank holding \n     companies. The current rules have been in place since 1964, \n     and since that time there have been profound changes in the \n     way shareholders hold their securities and in the capital \n     markets.\n       Last spring, I asked our staff to comprehensively study a \n     variety of capital formation-related issues, including the \n     current thresholds for public reporting. At this point, I do \n     not have sufficient data or information to assess whether the \n     thresholds proposed in H.R. 3606 are appropriate. I do \n     recognize that a different treatment may be appropriate for \n     community banks that are already subject to an extensive \n     reporting and regulatory regime.\n\n\n                               Rulemaking\n\n       H.R. 3606 requires a series of new, significant Commission \n     rulemakings with time limits that are not achievable. For \n     example, the rulemaking for the crowdfunding section has a \n     deadline of 180 days, and it specifically requires the \n     Commission to consider the costs and benefits of the rules. \n     Given (1) that much of the data that would be used to perform \n     such analyses is not readily available and (2) the complexity \n     of such analyses, this time frame is too short to develop \n     proposed rules, perform the required analyses, solicit public \n     comments, review and analyze the public comments, and adopt \n     final rules. I believe a deadline of 18 months would be more \n     appropriate for rules of this magnitude.\n       I stand ready to assist Congress as it addresses these \n     important issues. Please call me, at (202) 551 2100, or have \n     your staff call Eric Spitler, Director of the Office of \n     Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 551 2010, \n     should you have any questions or comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L.

Yet Congress cannot enact such basic \n     legislation as the reauthorization of the Surface \n     Transportation Bill that would create hundreds of thousands \n     of jobs. Instead, this week Congress once again is looking to \n     deregulate Wall Street--this time in the form of the \n     cynically named JOBS Act, which would weaken the ability of \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate our \n     capital markets and allow companies to sell stock to the \n     public without providing three years of audited financial \n     statements, without having adequate internal controls and \n     without complying with key corporate governance reforms in \n     the recently passed Dodd-Frank Act.\n       We still have millions of unemployed workers as a direct \n     result of decades of financial deregulation. Workers' pension \n     funds have yet to recover from the effects of the last time \n     we created a bubble in IPOs during the late 1990s. And yet \n     members of both parties in Congress seem bent on repeating \n     these experiences, even as congressional Republicans block \n     any initiative that might really create jobs and set our \n     economy toward the path of long-term prosperity.\n       In case our own ugly history with stock bubbles and \n     financial fraud is not enough, Congress should heed the \n     warnings from other developed countries that recently have \n     experimented with deregulated securities markets. In the \n     1990s, Canadian regulators condemned the ``continuing \n     occurrence of shams, swindles and market manipulations'' on \n     the Vancouver Stock Exchange of loosely regulated small \n     company stocks. More recently, the London Stock Exchange's \n     Alternative Investment Market has been described as a \n     ``casino'' for its highly speculative small company stock \n     listings.\n       Workers' retirement savings will be in greater risk of \n     fraud and speculation if securities market deregulation once \n     again is railroaded through Congress. Once again our economy \n     will be at risk from the folly of policymakers promoting \n     financial bubbles and ignoring the needs of the real economy. \n     The AFL CIO calls on Congress to set aside the politics of \n     the 1%, the old game of special favors for Wall Street, and \n     turn to the business of real job creation. The labor movement \n     strongly opposes the JOBS Act and any other effort to weaken \n     the Dodd-Frank Act.\n       We support the efforts of Senate Democrats such as Jack \n     Reed, Carl Levin, and Mary Landrieu to amend the ``JOBS Act'' \n     to lessen the harm it does to investors, pension funds, and \n     the U.S. economy.\n       We want jobs, not cynical Wall Street scams.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     A Message From Secretaries of State on Crowdfunding Regulation\n\n\n                             March 14, 2012\n\n     Re Crowdfunding and H.R. 3606, the Jumpstarting Our Business \n         Startups Act.\n\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n         Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby and Members of \n     the Committee: As Secretaries of State with primary \n     securities regulatory jurisdiction, we welcome this \n     opportunity to discuss the developments in ``crowdfunding'' \n     as a useful tool in small business capital formation, and the \n     work of the U.S. Senate to ensure that such a mechanism \n     remains viable for small businesses and safe for investors.\n       Crowdfunding is an online, typically grass-roots, money-\n     raising strategy that allows the public to use websites to \n     contribute small amounts of money to help artists, musicians, \n     filmmakers and other creative people finance their projects. \n     Recently, crowdfunding financing has been applied to small \n     businesses and start-ups, facilitating their attempts to get \n     their ventures off the ground.\n       We applaud the work of Congress, via H.R. 3606, aimed at \n     allowing small businesses greater access to crowdfunding \n     financing through the Internet. We are keenly aware of how \n     critical small businesses are to job growth and to improving \n     the economy.\n       However, Congress' attempt to enact laws meant to \n     reinvigorate the economy could, in fact, have a detrimental \n     effect. If passed as currently drafted, Title III of H.R. \n     3606, would prohibit the States from working proactively to \n     enforce laws designed to protect investors.\n       State securities regulators are proud of their 100-year \n     history of effectively regulating smaller businesses seeking \n     to raise capital. States securities laws protect investors by \n     requiring registration of securities offerings and preventing \n     the exploitation of investors through unjust or incomplete \n     offerings. State securities regulators are uniquely able to \n     protect investors in that they are not only present in the \n     state, but they are also attuned to the particular state's \n     economic conditions. It would therefore be impractical and a \n     disservice to investors to remove state regulators entirely \n     from this important role. To that end, we recommend the \n     following adjustments to current legislation concerning \n     crowdfunding.\n       Currently-proposed Federal legislation would limit state \n     authority to protect their investing citizenry. Specifically, \n     Title III of H.R. 3606--which is identical to H.R. 2930, the \n     crowdfunding bill passed by the House last November--leaves \n     enormous gaps in investor protection. Small businesses and \n     investors alike have suffered from the fraudulent activities \n     of unregistered brokers and unqualified business advisers \n     who, escaping regulatory oversight, seek only to profit by \n     exploiting the legitimate capital formation community and \n     ultimately harm its investors through unchecked and improper \n     practices. Website operators functioning as intermediaries, \n     among others, should complete at least minimal filings with \n     regulators and demonstrate minimum competencies. Congress \n     should preserve the States' ability to address this issue.\n       We commend Congress's efforts to be responsive to small \n     business owners' capital formation needs, but we are \n     concerned that Title III of H.R. 3606, by preventing states \n     from acting proactively to deter fraud in this new market, \n     would have precisely the opposite effect.\n       The states are currently developing a framework for \n     encouraging and facilitating the formation of small business \n     capital. Last fall, NASAA voted to establish a special \n     committee to propose steps that state securities regulators \n     can take collectively to facilitate small business capital \n     formation. In January, this special committee completed work \n     on an initial draft of a model rule which state securities \n     regulators may adopt to responsibly encourage small business \n     capital formation through a crowdfunding exemption. The NASAA \n     model crowdfunding rule completed the first phase of the \n     rulemaking process, an internal comment period, on February \n     7, and NASAA expects to\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\n     publish a revised version of the rule for public comment as \n     early as latter this month. We believe that federal \n     legislation should be crafted in a fashion that complements \n     these efforts, and that it can best do so by ensuring that \n     the role of state regulators in this area is addressed in \n     broad parameters.\n       State securities regulators understand that technology has \n     vastly improved the methods by which entrepreneurs can \n     communicate with potential investors. We also understand, \n     however, that securities offerings made through the \n     Internet--which Title III of H.R. 3606 is based on--are \n     fraught with risk. In such cases, the need for the state \n     securities laws becomes even more urgent for the protection \n     of investors and legitimate, worthwhile small business \n     offerings. We urge Congress to resist preemption and preserve \n     state securities regulators' authority to protect their \n     investors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                             Office of Financial Institutions,\n\n                                  Baton Rouge, LA, March 14, 2012.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am writing to urge you to oppose \n     the preemption of Louisiana law to protect investors in any \n     ``crowdfunding'' legislation that comes before the Senate. By \n     preempting state law for a new crowdfunding exemption, \n     Congress would be creating a massive hole in the investor \n     protection safety net by needlessly prohibiting the Office of \n     Financial Institutions from working proactively to enforce \n     laws designed to protect Louisiana investors.\n       I want to echo the concerns expressed in the March 12, 2012 \n     letter sent by North American Securities Administrators \n     Association (NASAA) President Jack Herstein on this important \n     investor protection issue to the Senate leadership. I agree \n     with NASAA that ``preempting state authority is a very \n     serious step and not something that should be undertaken \n     lightly or without careful deliberation, including a thorough \n     examination of all available alternatives.''\n       Crowdfunding would give unproven start-up companies, \n     offering risky speculative investments, direct access to \n     small unsophisticated investors, potentially creating a haven \n     for fraud. If state regulatory authority is preempted, states \n     would not be able to review crowdfunding investment \n     opportunities before they are offered to investors. Post-sale \n     anti-fraud remedies provide little comfort to an investor who \n     has lost a significant sum of money that is unrecoverable.\n       Expanded access to capital markets is beneficial only when \n     investors remain confident that they are protected, when \n     transparency in the marketplace is preserved, and when \n     investment opportunities are legitimate. As Columbia Law \n     School Professor John Coffee stated, in testimony to the \n     Senate Banking Committee, ``one of these bills (S. 1791) \n     could well be titled `The Boiler Room Legalization Act of \n     2011.'' Such legislation, according to Professor Coffee, ``is \n     likely to be used by early stage issuers that do not yet have \n     an operating history or, possibly, even financial statements. \n     Such issuers are flying on a `wing and prayer,' selling hope \n     more than substance.''\n       I appreciate that the concept of crowdfunding is appealing \n     because it provides small, innovative enterprises access to \n     capital that might not otherwise be available. Indeed, this \n     is precisely why states are now considering adopting a model \n     rule that would establish a more modest exemption for \n     crowdfunding as it is traditionally understood, with \n     individual investments capped at several hundred dollars per \n     investor.\n       Instead of preempting states, Congress should allow the \n     states to take a leading role in implementing an appropriate \n     regulatory framework for crowdfunding. States are the most \n     appropriate regulator in this area and Congress should allow \n     states the opportunity to continue to protect retail \n     investors from the risks associated with smaller, speculative \n     investments.\n       I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further \n     and to work together to craft legislation that is beneficial \n     to small business as well as the investing public in \n     Louisiana and throughout the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Ducrest,\n     Commissioner of Securities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Sustainable\n\n\n                                             Business Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2012.\n     Hon.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Office of the Minority Leader, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) supports the \n     CROWDFUND Act, S. 2190, authored by Senators Merkley, Bennet, \n     Brown and Landrieu and encourage the Senate to use this bill \n     as the vehicle to move forward on crowdfunding.\n       The American Sustainable Business Council is a growing \n     coalition of business organizations and businesses committed \n     to advancing a framework and policies that support a just and \n     sustainable economy. The organizations that have joined in \n     this partnership represent over 100,000 businesses and more \n     than 200,000 business professionals covering the gamut of \n     local and state chambers of commerce, microenterprise, social \n     enterprise, green and sustainable, local living economy, \n     women business leaders, economic development and investor \n     organizations.\n       In 2010 ASBC was one of the very few organizations \n     supporting crowdfunding as a vehicle for small businesses to \n     access capital investment without the prohibitive cost and \n     time presently required by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC) regulations. That original proposal was to \n     have small individual investments from a large number of \n     people with a relatively low aggregate investment cap. This \n     would minimize individual investor loss and systemic fraud. \n     While the current legislation allows for larger individual \n     and aggregate investments than the original proposal, our \n     initial crowdfunding goals have been addressed.\n       While we support appropriate SEC oversight over significant \n     investments, we recognize there will always be risks in the \n     marketplace. This legislation strikes an appropriate balance \n     between those risks and regulatory protection.\n       The winners with S. 2190 will not only be individual \n     businesses that will have new avenues to access to capital, \n     but also the national economy by enabling small and medium \n     sized businesses to grow and create jobs. Small businesses \n     are responsible for creating the majority of net new jobs in \n     the country and deserve our support to rebuild the U.S. \n     economy.\n       We applaud the leadership of Senators Merkley, Bennet, \n     Brown and Landrieu on this critical issue for small and \n     medium sized businesses. We look forward to working with the \n     U.S. Senate to successfully pass S. 2190 and see its \n     enactment into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Levine,\n     Co-Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n     Re Crowdfunding Intermediary in favor of the CROWDFUND Act \n         (S. 1970).\n\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid, I write in favor of the bipartisan \n     compromise CROWDFUND Act proposed recently by Senators \n     Merkley, S. Brown, Bennet, and Landrieu.\n       Yesterday evening's introduction of the first bi-partisan \n     Senate crowdfunding bill is a big step forward in our fight \n     to get equity crowdfunding passed through Congress. I have \n     been to Washington DC seven times since mid November \n     discussing equity crowdfunding legislation directly with key \n     Senate offices. The offices of the Senators on the Banking \n     Committee have been very receptive to input from the \n     entrepreneurial community and have adopted many of our \n     suggestions in the latest bill.\n       This latest bill, the CrowdFund Act, is important because, \n     unlike previous bills, for the first time we have a Senate \n     bill with bipartisan sponsorship, a balance of state \n     oversight and federal uniformity, industry standard investor \n     protections, and workable funding caps. This bill has a \n     legitimate chance at quieting those who were previously \n     trumping up fears of fraud/bad actors as well as the various \n     state oversight concerns. To date the main issues the \n     opposition raised were regarding fraud and state oversight of \n     our new industry. While the opposition is mainly from those \n     protecting the interests of large banks, the earlier House \n     Bill and two partisan Senate bills did little to address the \n     legitimate concerns raised by the opposition. As a \n     compromise, this bill has a real chance at becoming law.\n       I hope to see your support of this bipartisan effort in the \n     Senate to pass a functional and balanced CROWDFUND Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Freeman White,\n     CEO, Launcht.com\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      Motaavi,\n\n                                       Durham, NC, March 14, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We are a crowdfunding \n     intermediary based in Durham, NC. We understand the Senate \n     will take up the JOBS Act shortly. We are very concerned \n     about language in Title III of While we appreciate the broad \n     exemption written by the House, the language does not protect \n     investors and puts the crowdfunding industry at risk of \n     significant fraud. However, more responsible language does \n     exist. The CROWDFUND Act, cosponsored by Senators Jeff \n     Merkley (OR), Michael Bennet (CO), Scott Brown (MA), and Mary \n     Landrieu (LA), represents an ideal crowdfunding statutory \n     framework.\n       The crowdfunding language in the JOBS Act lacks critical \n     investor protection features. It does not require offerings \n     to be conducting through an intermediary, which opens the \n     door for fraudulent activity similar to what was experienced \n     when Rule 504 was changed to allow offer and solicitation in \n     the mid-1990s. It also does not require appropriate \n     disclosures or inspections. The bill does not require the \n     issuer to inform investors of dilution risk or capital \n     structure. There are no provisions for misstatements or \n     omissions that relate specifically to this exemption. \n     Crowdfunding is premised on openness. Without disclosure, \n     investors cannot protect themselves or accurately price the \n     securities they are buying. If issuers are not\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\n     willing to provide information over and above what is \n     required, the JOBS Act language does not provide investors \n     with other alternatives short of giving up on crowdfunding \n     altogether.\n       The CROWDFUND Act addresses our concerns. This bill strikes \n     the right balance between disclosure and flexibility. The \n     language is tightly integrated with existing securities laws \n     to provide investor protection. It places easily met \n     obligations on the issuer and the intermediary to ensure that \n     investors have the information they need to make sound \n     decisions. This bill has many provisions for appropriate \n     rulemaking, and is written in a way that reflects how \n     crowdfunding actually works. We think crowdfunding can be \n     valuable and integral part of the capital formation process. \n     The CROWDFUND Act is the right bill to make this happen.\n       We understand that introducing a significant amendment to \n     the JOBS Act may slow down the reconciliation process, but we \n     think the benefits are worth the effort. We urge you to adopt \n     the CROWDFUND Act as the Senate language on crowdfunding and \n     believe the House will also see the value in this well \n     written, investor focused bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Nick Bhargava, J.D.\n                                                     Motaavi, LLC.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Again to recap so people can see on this chart, AARP \nhas written us against the House bill. Consumer Federation of America--\nagainst the House bill. The AFL CIO--against the House bill. Yes, those \nare some of the left leaning organizations.\n  But we also have centrist and right leaning organizations. I am \ntalking about the former Securities and Exchange Commissioners' Chief \nAccountant, this is what they say\n\n       There are always paths to improvement for any complex \n     system, the American Stock Exchange included. But how quickly \n     these Congressmen seem to have forgotten why many such \n     regulations were enacted in the first place. Last month \n     marked the 10-year anniversary of the collapse of Enron.\n\n  It has not been 10 years and we are going back to where we were when \nEnron took money out of the pockets of thousands of people in America. \nWhy are we doing that\n\n       Regulations that prevent capital multiplying companies that \n     want to go public from doing so are bad. Ones that prevent \n     capital destroying ones from becoming public nuisances are \n     good. No job creation will be generated through the process \n     of socializing capital destruction to the general public.\n\n  But he is saying that the House bill goes too far.\n  Again, Eric Schureunberg, editor of Inc.com--they are a very well \nrespected voice in the small business community in America today. They \nare saying the House bill is flawed.\n  I know we are going to be criticized on the other side by saying it \nis just the same old left wing groups that want more regulation and \nmore regulation. But that is not true. That is why I am putting all of \nthis in the record today so people can carefully consider it tomorrow, \nand over the weekend on Monday, before we come back here; to look and \nread what is being said about the House bill and to be open and honest \nin our efforts to try to reform it. Again, for the record, Mary \nShapiro, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said: \nWhile I recognize that H.R. 3606--the ill-advised political opportunity \nbill, those are my words--is the product of a bipartisan effort \ndesigned to facilitate capital formation and include certain promising \napproaches, I believe there are provisions that should be added or \nmodified to improve investor protections that are worthy of the \nSenate's consideration.\n\n  So that is what we have done. We took the bill from the House and \nlooked at it very carefully and on Monday I am going to hand this out \nto everyone and we are sending it to everyone's offices now. It has \nkind of become a famous small business blue line that is very easy for \neveryone to understand. It shows the differences between the Senate \nbill and the House bill. As we can see, both bills raise the cap on \nregulation A offerings from $5 million to $50 million. We are happy to \ndo that. We improve the transparency of regulation A by requiring an \naudited financial statement.\n  You don't need to have graduated from a master's program at Stanford \nor Harvard to understand that if you are getting ready to invest--\nwhether it is $1,000, $10,000 or $100,000--having an audited financial \nstatement about the company you are getting ready to invest in would be \na basic thing to do. I think we learned about this when we were in \nseventh or eighth grade. You don't have to go to Harvard to know this.\n  The audited financial statement requirement is absent from the House \nbill. There is no requirement in the House bill for an audited \nfinancial statement, so we put an audited financial statement in our \nbill. I don't think that is a radical amendment. It is a simple one; it \nis an important one. In the House version of this IPO on-ramp, they \nexempt companies up to $1 billion in annual revenue. Madam President, \n$1 billion is a lot of money, so everybody wake up. The House bill says \nif you are less than $1 billion, you basically don't have to adhere to \nmost of the rules and regulations; you can just go on your merry way.\n  That sign is great--``ill-advised political opportunity.'' That is \nwhat I am calling the House bill. Let me check to see how many \ncompanies went public that were over $1 billion last year. Only 22 \npercent of companies that went public last year were over $1 billion. \nSo if my math is correct, the House bill is going to eliminate 78 \npercent of the companies from regulation that raise money in the \npublic. That is going too far. It is unnecessary. We bring that number \ndown to $350 million in our bill, and the author of this provision in \nthe Senate has signed on as a supporter, Chuck Schumer. The reason he \ndid that is because he realizes--even as the sponsor of this on-ramp \nprovision--that the House bill went too far. I am not going to go into \nall the rules and regulations, but it is not that complicated because--\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--there are only about eight big differences, but \nthey are important differences.\n  I am going to wrap up by saying: Please study the record. Please look \nat it. In our Senate bill, which the Chair has been very supportive of, \nas has Senator Cantwell, and I wish to thank both of them publicly, as \nwell as Senator Klobuchar--we have the Export-Import Bank in our bill, \nwhich is not in the House bill. The Chamber of Commerce has written us \nasking us to please support the Export-Import Bank. We also expand the \nSBIC, which is the small business investment program, which the \nPresident included in his State of the Union Address to authorize that \nprogram to move from $3 billion to $4 billion. Why? Because we are \nhaving such success, through the SBIC programs that exist in all our \nStates, getting money out to Main Street, to small businesses. So that \nis included in our bill--and one the Chair has particularly been a lead \non, and that is at no cost to the taxpayer. These things do not cost \nany additional money. There is the SBA 504 refinancing that is going to \nallow to extend for 1 year the ability of the small business loan \nprogram that has thousands of outstanding loans to extend for another \nyear the opportunity to refinance their commercial loans.\n  So we have added three provisions to the House bill that make it more \nbalanced and better for small business, and we have put a couple \noversight measures into their provisions that I think--in the words of \nmany of even the advocates of this bill--``make the bill better.''\n  I don't know if we will be successful, but this is worth a try \nbecause the damage that could be done in venturing out so far into a \nnew way of financing without the proper safeguards could set us back \ndecades. We don't want to go backward; we want to go forward. We don't \nwant to go back to the days of Enron and Bernie Madoff. Why would \nRepublicans, in the face of these scandals, come up with--and some \nDemocrats voted for it. I am not quite sure how that happened, but we \nare going to find out. Why would they want to go back to those days? We \nwant to go forward with the right protections.\n  I see my friend Senator Levin on the floor. He most certainly \nunderstands this issue in many ways better than I do on the technical \nside of it. He has helped write this bill. I am hoping he will give an \neven better explanation than I have been able to give, but I think I \nhave covered it pretty broadly, and he can go into a lot more detail \nabout the possibility of fraud in here if it is not locked down.\n  I am going to end with a word to my community banks because I have \ntried to become a champion for them. I think they can appreciate it. I \nam not\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n100 percent sure. I believe in community banks. The Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America sent a letter supporting the House bill. I \nam going to call them over the weekend and talk with them specifically \nabout my concerns and ask them to reconsider their position. I think \nour compromise is very good for our community bankers. I don't know \nwhether they will. I know they want to get rid of some of the onerous \nrequirements that were placed on them in the Sarbanes-Oxley \nlegislation, and I appreciate it. I helped sponsor some of the \namendments on their behalf.\n  But I think this House bill is going too far. I am going to reach out \nto them. We will see what their view is. I do respect the views of my \ncommunity bankers. We are going to have a lot more to talk about next \nweek.\n  Again, I thank Senator Levin and Senator Reed for joining with me and \nSenator Jack Reed for leading this effort to help put a bill before the \nSenate that is quite balanced and provides the investor protections and \nalso opens some exciting opportunities for capital to create new \nbusinesses in America that are the backbone of our extraordinary--and \nnot to be matched--entrepreneurship spirit in the world. We honor that, \nbut we want to do it in the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before the Senator from Louisiana leaves \nthe floor, let me thank her for her leadership in this area and the \npassion she has brought to it. This is a train which has moved with \ngreat speed from the House of Representatives--much too great a speed--\nand her ability, just by the expression of her will and her \ndetermination to bring this to a point where we can debate it at least \nover a few days and the weekend, is critically important, I believe, to \nfuture of investors in this country.\n  There is no State that has suffered more from the job losses of the \ngreat recession than my State of Michigan. We don't have to ask a \nMichigander twice if he or she believes Congress should take action to \nincrease the speed of the jobs recovery. So I am ready to consider any \nlegislation that promises more opportunity for the workers of this \ncountry, but unfortunately the legislation the House has sent to us, \nwhich is promoted as a job creation bill, is no such thing. In the name \nof job creation, the House bill would severely weaken investor and \ntaxpayer protections in our securities laws.\n  In the name of putting Americans to work, the House bill would hand a \nseries of special favors to influential special interest groups. It \nalso reflects a disturbing failure to learn the lessons of the recent \nand all-too-painful past. It defies belief that after the worst \nfinancial crisis in generations, a crisis brought on by the failure to \neffectively police our financial markets, Congress would consider \nremoving vital obstacles to fraud and abuse. The House bill would take \na series of steps that would undermine the integrity of our financial \nmarkets. We should not go down that road. We need not go down that \nroad. In working with Senator Jack Reed, Senator Landrieu and Senator \nSherrod Brown and others, I participated in an effort to make some \nchanges in that bill that would give small, innovative companies more \ntools to access the capital they need. We want to do that. We all want \nto do that. But we do that in our bill without putting the stability of \nour economy and the interest of American investors and taxpayers at \nrisk.\n  I wish to lay out some of the problems with the House bill and how \nour Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment would address those problems. The \nHouse bill would lower barriers to fraud that are now present in the \nso-called regulation A stock offerings. These are offerings that are \nexempt from the SEC registration requirements. The House bill would \nexpose retail investors--those with no expertise and no resources--to \nassess the risks of participating in the unregulated market to massive \npotential fraud and abuse.\n  The bill does not even require that companies making offerings under \nregulation A provide audited financial statements. The regulation A \nprocess is appropriate for very small companies, but the House bill \nprovides few meaningful limits to its use. Instead, it would allow \nlarger companies to avoid meaningful oversight year after year.\n  I have worked with colleagues to fix this problem by ensuring that \nthese offerings are limited, so they are only used once every 3 years--\nthat is one of the changes we would make--and that investors in the \nofferings get an accurate picture of the company's finances by \nrequiring audited financial statements.\n  In the name of giving smaller companies greater access to the initial \npublic offering market, the House bill would create a new class of \ncorporation called an emerging growth company and would strip from \ninvestors in such companies more than a dozen important investor \nprotections. Some of the protections involve transparency. The House \nbill would weaken corporate governance provisions we enacted less than \n2 years ago in the Dodd-Frank Act, including disclosures on executive \npay. The House bill would exempt these companies from having to comply \nwith changes to accounting standards. It would repeal the protections \nwe put in place after the dot-com bubble burst. These protections \nrequire financial firms to separate research analysts who advise \nclients on whether to invest in initial public offerings from the sales \nteams of those same companies.\n  There is supposed to be a wall between those two parts of any company \nso the sales teams don't take advantage of what the research teams are \ntelling their customers. There are too many opportunities for conflicts \nof interest and front-running and other things if we allow that wall to \nbe breached.\n  The House bill provides that companies with up to $1 billion in \nannual revenue would not have to get an outside auditor to check their \ninternal controls. So what happens if one of these companies is cooking \nthe books? Who is going to catch it? We learned with Enron and WorldCom \nwhy we need meaningful checks on how companies prepare their financial \nstatements. The vast majority of financial restatements, which are \ncorrections to bad information given to the investing public, are made \nby medium and small companies. Investors in these companies should have \nthe confidence that the financial statements on which they base their \ndecisions are accurate.\n\n  Now, those provisions in the House bill are bad enough given the \nchronic problem in financial markets with poor and misleading financial \ndisclosure but, to make matters worse, the bill would open this \ncollection of loopholes with companies of up to $1 billion in annual \nrevenues. That is a level which would include well over 80 percent of \nall IPOs. So over 80 percent of all the IPOs that will be issued would \nthen be exempt from the protections under the House bill.\n  Financial regulators, associations of individual investors, many of \nthe largest pension funds in this country, securities experts, and the \nchamber of commerce have raised alarm bells about that $1 billion \nthreshold as well as the many problems that would follow from the House \nbill.\n  Just this week, the SEC took a series of enforcement actions against \nfraudsters seeking to victimize investors in pre-IPO offerings. One SEC \nofficial noted, ``The newly emerging secondary market for pre-IPO stock \npresents risks for even savvy investors.'' The House bill threatens to \nbring the same level of risk and instability that plagues pre-IPO \ntrading to the IPO market itself--changes that, rather than building \nsupport for IPOs, might actually make the IPO market so risky that it \nends up dampening investor interest.\n  The amendment some of us have been working on, which is the Reed-\nLandrieu-Levin, et al., amendment, accepts the premise that some small, \nnewly public companies could benefit from somewhat relaxed requirements \nas they adjust to the public marketplace. But our amendment would limit \nthese benefits to smaller companies--those with under $350 million in \nannual revenue--and our amendment would not exempt these companies from \nmany of the critical investor protections. For example, we would not \nremove protections designed to protect the integrity of the research \nthat is available to investors, nor would we exempt them from any new \naccounting\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\nrules, nor would we exempt them from requirements regarding important \nexecutive pay disclosures and shareholder input on executive pay \npackages. Our amendment would provide flexibility for smaller, newly \npublic companies to adjust to the public markets, but we would leave in \nplace the investor protections that ensure our public markets remain \nthe best in the world.\n  The House bill would also allow companies or fraudsters posing as \nlegitimate companies to solicit investors directly through the \nInternet. This is one of the really big issues we are going to address \nnext week. As written, the House bill would offer investors almost no \nprotection from fraudulent schemes and fake investment opportunities. \nAlthough these Web sites that are often called intermediaries or \nfunding portals are the only entities capable of making sure that a \ncompany seeking to sell its stock on its site is real, the House \nexempts them--exempts the intermediaries and the funding portals--from \nany real regulation or liability. The same is true with the issuing \ncompany. That is why labor groups, seniors organizations, regulators, \nand security experts all warn us that this measure is an open \ninvitation to fraud. One group calls it the ``boiler room legalization \nact.''\n  So we have many problems with these provisions in the House bill, but \nwe also believe the so-called crowdfunding, in which small startups can \naccess pools of capital from small investors, usually over the \nInternet, has the potential to provide opportunity for truly small \nbusinesses to get additional capital they need to grow. This can be \ndone legitimately. That is why we build on the work of Senators Merkley \nand Bennet to create a platform for raising money through the Internet. \nBut we make sure, as they do, that it has the necessary investor and \nconsumer protections. In fact, legitimate crowdfunding sites have made \nit clear to us that they, like us, are concerned about the House bill. \nSo we have legitimate crowdfunding interest groups that want to make \nsure the protections are there for the investors, speaking out against \nsome of the excessive provisions in the House bill. They want the \nadditional protections we provide. So our amendment makes sure that \nfunding portals are subject to meaningful regulation and that the \ncompanies that use them to raise capital are also subject to meaningful \nregulation.\n  Our amendment would, unlike the House bill, require comprehensive \ndisclosures to investors about the company and the risks of such \ninvestments. If this new way of investing in small companies is to \nsucceed, then investor protections such as the ones embodied in the \nMerkley-Bennet provisions, which we have included in our amendment, are \nvital to giving investors the confidence to participate.\n  The House bill also attempts to remove regulations on so-called \nprivate offerings. By allowing issuers of private offerings to market \ntheir stock to the general public--whether it is on billboards and the \nInternet, in visits to retirement homes or late-night television ads--\nthat provision in the House bill would dangerously lower our defenses \nagainst frauds. We have seen this movie before. In the 1990s regulators \nlowered the barriers to general solicitation for private offerings and \nwithin years reversed their error because of widespread fraud and \nabuse.\n  Some have complained that the existing restrictions on solicitation \nfor private offerings are too narrow and impede businesses' access to \ncapital. That seems unlikely given the nearly $1 trillion a year in \nprivate offering activity. But if there are yet more worthy investments \nthat are going unfunded because of unneeded investor protections, the \nSEC regulations should be updated for the Internet age.\n  The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment would direct the SEC to revise its \nrules to allow companies to offer and sell shares to a credited \ninvestor, but it then directs the SEC to make sure those who offer or \nsell these securities take reasonable steps to verify that the \npurchasers are actually accredited investors. It requires the SEC to \nrevise its rules to make sure these sales tactics are appropriate. \nThere are not going to be, under our language, billboards or cold calls \nto senior living centers. I wish I could say the same about the House \nbill.\n  There is little evidence that the reduced investor protections and \ninvitations to fraud in the House bill will make any meaningful \ncontribution to job growth. We do not have one study on any one of the \nprovisions in the House bill establishing that even one job would be \ncreated. If such a study existed, I am sure we would have seen it. The \nsimple reality is that repealing Federal securities laws--and that is \nclearly the intent of the House bill--does not create jobs. In fact, \nthe former Chief Accountant to the SEC was quoted recently as saying \nthat this JOBS bill was no jobs bill at all. He said: ``This would be \nbetter known as the bucket-shop and penny-stock fraud reauthorization \nact of 2012.''\n\n  Taken together, these and other provisions in the House bill send a \nfalse message: that in order to grow the economy, we must subject our \ncitizens to more fraud, we must put pension funds and church endowments \nat greater risk of fleecing, we must create more threats to the \nfinancial stability of American families.\n  The America that I know and that I believe in is capable of growing \nour economy without these unnecessary risks. Indeed, it is fraud and \nfinancial abuse that have repeatedly brought our economy to its knees. \nWe opened the door to fraud and abuse in the savings and loan industry \nand precipitated a crisis that destroyed 750 financial institutions \nwhen we did that. We cut the number of new homes built in this country \nby nearly half and devastated entire communities. We dropped the \nbarriers to fraud through financial statements and in swaps markets, \nopening the door to the predations of the so-called ``smartest guys in \nthe room''--those are the criminal executives of Enron. We lowered the \nbarriers to heedless risk and conflicts of interest in the financial \nsystem, thereby paving the road to the greatest financial crisis since \nthe 1930s.\n  Over the last 10 years, on a bipartisan basis, my Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations has held hearing after hearing and \nissued report after report on the Enron crisis, on accounting and \nsecurities frauds, and on the more recent subprime mortgage crisis. Our \ninvestigation has exposed how some American corporations, and their \naccountants and banks, were willing to dupe investors and, even after \ntheir wrongdoing came to light, walk away with huge paychecks while \nworkers, investors, and the American economy at large paid the price.\n  Enron was the seventh largest U.S. corporation before its crash \nbankrupted employees, pensions, and investors. It lied about its \nearnings and did so with the help of accountants and banks. Goldman \nSachs sold securities through public and private offerings that did not \nfully inform investors about what they were buying. The wrongdoing our \nsubcommittee has uncovered over the years is as powerful a reminder as \nwe can get that investors deserve protection against abuses when they \ninvest their hard-earned dollars in U.S. capital markets.\n  There is a rising wave of concern among market experts that the \neffect of the House legislation might be precisely the opposite of its \nsupporters' stated intent and that instead of boosting the ability of \ncompanies to find capital so they can grow, these changes would hurt \nthe market for investing in new companies by making that market too \nrisky. If we remove meaningful transparency and safeguards against \nfraud, SEC Chairman Schapiro wrote just a few days ago that ``investors \nwill lose confidence in our markets and capital formation will \nultimately be made more difficult and expensive.''\n  The question for the champions of lower regulatory barriers is this: \nDid those rollbacks of regulatory protections help our economy grow? \nDid those rollbacks which we saw so many of and which I have just \noutlined create jobs? Ask a family who was wiped out in the financial \ncrisis. Ask an investor who lost everything to Enron. Ask one of the \nmany 8.6 million American workers who lost their jobs in a financial \ncrisis created on Wall Street, one we have yet to fully overcome.\n  In November of 1999 this body debated another piece of financial \nlegislation, one that supporters claimed would lead to boundless new \neconomic opportunities for our country. The bill we were debating \nrepealed the Glass-Steagall Act. It lowered barriers to\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\nconcentration in the financial industry. It removed the wall that had \nseparated investment banking from commercial banking since the \naftermath of the Great Depression.\n  Senator Byron Dorgan came to this floor and he issued a warning: ``It \nmay be that I am hopelessly old-fashioned, but I just do not think we \nshould ignore the lessons learned in the 1930s . . . I also think that \nwe will, in 10 year's time, look back and say: We should not have done \nthat because we forgot the lessons of the past.''\n  Well, that was 1999. Ten years after Senator Dorgan's remarks, almost \nto the day that he predicted, America's economy hit rock bottom, with \nthe lowest mark of employment during the great recession. Well, old-\nfashioned sounds pretty good these days. I hope to be as old-fashioned \nas Senator Dorgan, who warned us that lowering the barriers that \nprotect us from financial catastrophe can only destroy jobs--not create \njobs, destroy jobs.\n  I hope the Senate will turn away from the House bill that threatens \nmore fraud, more abuse, and renewed crisis. I hope the Senate will \nembrace reforms that are present in our substitute amendment that give \nour innovative companies the chance to compete without endangering \ninvestor confidence or the stability of our economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, when I talk to owners, operators, and \nemployees of small businesses in New Hampshire, one thing I hear \nconsistently is that access to capital is a real challenge. While our \ncommunity banks have increased their lending, capital access from large \nbanks and other entities has been very hard to come by. As a result, \nsmall businesses fighting to grow and create jobs continue to be \nconstrained in their efforts.\n  I am glad the Senate is planning to move forward with this \nlegislation that will address capital formation and will take some \nadditional steps to help those small companies get the financing they \nneed to grow, but as we take that step forward, it is equally important \nthat we do not also take a step back. That is why I believe it is \ncritical for the Senate to extend two venues of small business \nfinancing as part of this debate: the Export-Import Bank and the Small \nBusiness Administration's 504 refinancing program. These programs, \nwhich bring no cost to the taxpayers--let me say that again: these \nprograms bring no cost to taxpayers--provide financing options for so \nmany small businesses in New Hampshire, in West Virginia, and across \nour country.\n  We have an important opportunity to ensure that such important \navenues to capital remain available in the coming years by extending \nthese programs as part of the small business capital package we are \ncurrently debating. So first let me begin with the Export-Import Bank, \nwhich is a vital agency that helps many small businesses secure the \nfinancing they need for export deals. This is critical because exports \nare such an important part of the markets that are available to \nbusinesses today. Mr. President, 95 percent of markets exist outside of \nthe United States, but only 1 percent of small and medium-sized \nbusinesses are doing business outside of the United States. So \nbusinesses need access to these international markets.\n  Last August, Senator Ayotte and I held a Small Business Committee \nfield hearing in New Hampshire, and it was on small business exporting. \nWe heard how difficult it can be for a small company to sell its \nproducts overseas. It is particularly challenging for a small business \nto get financing for its foreign deals. That is where the Export-Import \nBank makes such a significant impact. Mr. President, 87 percent of the \nExport-Import Bank's transactions support small businesses. So I think \nthere is a misconception about whom the Ex-Im Bank really helps. \nEighty-seven percent of their transactions support small businesses.\n  Last year alone, the bank helped finance more than $6 billion in \nexport sales from small companies in the United States. It has set a \ngoal of increasing this volume by an additional $3 billion in the \ncoming years, and it has created a new Global Access for Small Business \nInitiative which is designed to dramatically increase the number of \nsmall companies taking advantage of its programs. In fact, I think this \nnew initiative is terrific. The Ex-Im Bank came to New Hampshire and \nunveiled this initiative. Again, this bank assists small businesses at \nno cost to the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, right now this no-cost small business program is in \njeopardy. Unless we act soon to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, it \nwill hit its lending cap and it will be forced to cut off its support \nfor small businesses. We just cannot afford to let that happen. Without \nthe bank small businesses will lose a significant amount of foreign \nsales and the jobs they maintain. Last year the bank supported over \n288,000 American jobs. As more small companies become aware of the \nbank's programs, more businesses will be able to access new markets and \ncreate new jobs.\n  So I want to give an example because, as I said, last year we had the \nChair of the Export-Import Bank in Portsmouth, NH. They unveiled their \nnew small business initiative, and they met with a number of small \nbusinesses that were interested in exporting.\n  One of those small businesses was a company called Skelley Medical, \nwhich is a medical equipment company that is based in Hollis, NH. \nBefore our event, Skelley Medical was unaware of the programs the \nExport-Import Bank offered. Two weeks later, just 2 weeks after this \nevent, Skelley took out a policy with the bank. That put Skelley in a \nposition to expand its sales overseas. Right now, Skelley Medical is \nlooking to finance deals in as many as five international markets. That \nis all thanks to the help of the Export-Import Bank. Without the \nExport-Import Bank, that kind of small business success story will not \nhappen. It would be a real mistake for this Senate to pass a capital \naccess bill without this critical reauthorization.\n  The second program I would like to talk about is another no-cost \nprogram that deserves to be extended. That is the Small Business \nAdministration's section 504 refinancing program.\n  With bipartisan support, the Senate passed the Small Business Jobs \nAct 2 years ago--well, about a year and a half ago. That Small Business \nJobs Act created this 504 program to help small businesses refinance \nexisting loans under the SBA's 504 lending program.\n  Again, what we are hearing, as my colleagues know, as I am sure the \nPresiding Officer knows, is that this difficult real estate market we \nare in has made it challenging for many successful businesses to \nrefinance their real estate deals. They cannot get access to capital \nright now, particularly in the real estate industry, which has been so \nhard hit during this recession. What this SBA program allows is for \nsmall businesses to lock in long-term, stable financing so they can \nfree up capital to invest in their companies and hire new workers.\n  Although this program got off to a slow start, the Small Business \nAdministration has made important changes to ensure that it is working \nbetter now for small businesses and for banks. As a result, we are \nstarting to see a significant increase in volume.\n  In New Hampshire, lenders see this program becoming a real success in \nthe near future. Alan Abraham, who is the president of the Granite \nState Development Corporation in New Hampshire, has said that ``banks \nand borrowers are now understanding the significant benefits of the \nprogram.'' He told me:\n\n       We are starting to field many [more] phone calls requesting \n     information on the policies, and we anticipate dozens of New \n     Hampshire small businesses could benefit from extending this \n     program.\n\n  We should not cut this program off at the knees just as we are \nbeginning to see substantial returns--again, without costs to \ntaxpayers.\n  This program is scheduled to sunset in September. I believe it is \nimportant for the lending community to know as soon as possible that \nthe program will continue into 2013 so that they can devote the \nresources necessary to continue this initiative's budding success and \nalso so that we can provide the certainty so many companies tell us \nthey need.\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\n  We should extend this program. We should address the Export-Import \nBank's reauthorization. That is why, as we look at the Landrieu-Reed-\nLevin substitute amendment, it includes these provisions. It includes \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, and it includes the \nextension of the SBA 504 program. It also includes a number of other \nprovisions that address some of the concerns that have been expressed \nby the House-passed capital formation bill.\n  Senators Landrieu, Reed, and Levin were on the floor earlier and very \neloquently elaborated on those changes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthat substitute amendment to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and to \nextend SBA's 504 Loan Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to that \nLandrieu-Reed-Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as news reports focus on yet another \nhorrific shooting in an American school, we must again confront the \nsimple and sad truth: tragedies like this are often preventable. On \nFebruary 27, 17-year-old T.J. Lane opened fire in his high school \ncafeteria in Chardon, OH, killing three of his classmates and wounding \ntwo other students.\n  This is a narrative we have heard over and over again. Lane is \nbelieved to have taken the gun from his grandfather's barn. Similar to \nwhat happened 5 days earlier in Port Orchard, WA, when a 9-year-old boy \naccidentally shot his classmate with a .45-caliber handgun he took from \nhis mother's house. Or in 2009, when a 15-year-old boy was \ninstitutionalized after stealing three guns and hundreds of rounds of \nammunition from his father as part of a plan to shoot other students at \nPottstown High School in Philadelphia. Sadly, these are not rare \ncircumstances. A 2000 study by the U.S. Secret Service found that in \nmore than 65 percent of school shootings, the attacker got the gun from \nhis or her own home or from a relative.\n  The guardians of these children never intended for their firearms to \nbe used for harm. But they left their loaded guns without any measures \nto prevent their children--or anyone else--from using them \nirresponsibly. According to reports by the Legal Community Against \nViolence, in a nation where approximately one-third of households with \nminors have a firearm, studies have shown that 55 percent of these \nhouseholds store one or more of their guns unlocked. Another study \nshowed that 22 percent of the parents who claimed their children had \nnever handled their firearms were contradicted by their children. When \nit comes to gun safety, a young person's curiosity and recklessness can \nbe a dangerous thing.\n  It is imperative that gun owners across the country safely store \ntheir weapons out of the reach of young people. But despite these \ntroubling statistics, there are no Federal laws that prevent adults \nfrom leaving firearms easily accessible to children and minors. Some \nState and local governments around the Nation have adopted child \nfirearm access prevention measures, and these laws work. From 1990 to \n1994, in the 12 States where child access prevention laws had been in \neffect for at least 1 year, unintentional firearm deaths fell by 23 \npercent among children under the age of 15. Laws that encourage parents \nto keep their firearms locked and unloaded, to store their ammunition \nin a locked location separate from their firearms, and to educate their \nchildren on proper gun use and safety, would help prevent shootings \ninvolving children and teenagers.\n  We must not wait for the next Chardon High School or the next \nVirginia Tech or the next Columbine. Commonsense gun safety legislation \nprotects our schools, our universities, our religious institutions, and \nour homes from gun violence. But despite this evidence, legislation has \nbeen introduced in this Congress to dismantle the few Federal gun \nsafety provisions that protect the American people. I urge our \ncolleagues to support sensible gun safety measures that could prevent \ntragedies like the one unfolding in Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1729-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I come to floor to express concerns \nabout the transportation bill recently voted on by the Senate.\n  My State of Texas is the fastest-growing State in America, and our \neconomic success has made us a national model and a magnet for talent. \nBut rapid population and economic growth means an ever-increasing \nstrain on our infrastructure.\n  This legislation takes several positive steps such as consolidating \nprograms, improving project delivery, and expanding the Transportation \nInfrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, also known as TIFIA, which \nhas been successful in addressing various infrastructure needs in Texas \nand across our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, the bill is also deeply flawed. First, it is a 2-year \nproposal. Changing policy for such a short period of time does not give \nStates like Texas the certainty they need to undertake meaningful long-\nterm transportation projects.\n  In addition, the Senate bill uses 10 years' worth of revenue to pay \nfor 2 years of spending. This is the type of budget gimmickry that \nmakes Americans suspicious of Washington.\n  So we have legislation that is short-sighted and relies on accounting \ntricks. But the problems don't end there. The bill also moves us away \nfrom the user-pay principle. While this might work in the short term, \nclosing a large funding gap with non-user tax revenues would ultimately \ndestroy the Highway Trust Fund's protected budget status.\n  The legislation also does not address the Trust Fund's long-term \ninsolvency problem. Instead, it spends down the balance in the Trust \nFund leaving a substantial deficit starting in fiscal year 2014.\n  Finally, Texas receives significantly less from the Highway Trust \nFund than it pays in. In 2009, Texas had the lowest Trust Fund return \nratio in the country, according to a Heritage Foundation study. \nCongress simply must address the equity issue rather than rewarding a \nfew States based on their previous share of highway funding.\n  I know there are those in my State who favor this legislation, and I \nshare their commitment to finding solutions to our transportation \nchallenges. But I believe the people of Texas and the people of America \ndeserve a better approach. I hope that we can improve the bill during \nthe conference process. Our challenges are difficult, but they are not \ninsurmountable, and there is no reason we can't make 21st-century \nAmerican infrastructure the very best in the world.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleagues for \npassing the highway bill yesterday, which included language from \nMariah's Act, a bill I introduced last year. This bill reauthorizes the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, and will improve \nsafety programs on our roadways and safety standards in our vehicles.\n  Mariah's Act was named after Mariah West, a teen from Rogers, AR. A \nday before her high school graduation in 2010, Mariah was killed as a \nresult of texting while driving. Mariah's mother, Merry, has since \nbecome an advocate against texting and driving and continues to promote \nsafe driving habits across the country.\n  In part, Mariah's Act will prevent others from a similar tragedy by \nconcentrating resources to prevent distracted driving. In 2010, more \nthan 3,000\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\npeople died and thousands were hurt in crashes involving a distracted \nor inattentive driver.\n  Along with distracted driving, Mariah's Act addresses NHTSA's two \ncore missions: vehicle safety and highway safety. By improving these \nareas, we hope to continue to reduce traffic fatalities and reduce \ndamage when accidents do occur.\n  While I was pleased to hear that the number of traffic fatalities \nfell 3 percent between 2009 and 2010, there were still over 32,000 \ntraffic fatalities throughout our country in 2011. I believe we can do \nbetter to lower the number of deaths on our roadways by consistently \nimproving safety.\n  Lifesaving protections for children and young drivers are key \ncomponents of this bill. This is important because motor vehicle \ncrashes are the leading cause of death for all Americans ages 5 to 34. \nAs a parent of two teenagers, I know the fears of first transporting \nyour children, and then seeing them get behind the wheel. Because \nvehicular accidents are so deadly to our young people, I was pleased to \nintroduce a bill with strong protections for our youth.\n  Another specific issue that Mariah's Act addresses is a problem we \nhave been facing for a long time, impaired driving. Impaired driving \nstill remains a deadly problem across the country. In 2010, 31 percent \nof all fatal crashes were alcohol-related, and more than 10,000 people \nwere killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes. We, as a country, \nshould be taking a strong stance for ending this behavior and Mariah's \nAct helps develop the laws and technology to do it.\n  Other provisions in this bill include updates and consolidation of \nhighway safety programs; ensuring emerging electronics and technologies \nin vehicles are safe; and improved transparency and accountability in \nvehicle investigations.\n  Along with NHTSA, the Commerce section of this Highway bill includes \nprovisions of two bills I introduced last year, the Commercial Driver \nCompliance Improvement Act and the Safe Roads Act of 2011.\n  The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act will help \nauthorities improve compliance with hours-of-service regulations that \nkeep fatigued commercial truck and bus drivers off the road.\n  The Safe Roads Act will establish a national clearinghouse for \nverified positive alcohol and drug test results of commercial motor \nvehicle operators. This will prevent a bad actor from failing a drug \ntest in one State and simply going across a State line to try to beat \nthe test.\n  Our safety is compromised everyday by those bad acting truck and bus \ndrivers that are fatigued or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \nWe needed to strengthen our current regulations to ensure these drivers \ncannot bypass the law. These provisions are a practical way to ensure \nthat the commercial driving industry is reducing the number of unsafe \ndrivers on the road.\n  Last year, there were over 5 million accidents on our roads resulting \nin over 32,000 lives lost. That is why we need to continue to fine tune \nhighway safety programs to better target prevention, enforcement and \noversight. I am pleased that all three of these provisions were \nincluded in this Highway bill and that they will help reduce the number \nof tragedies families face due to automobile related deaths and \ninjuries.\n  I would like to thank everyone for their input and believe that we \nhave a bill that will complete the goal of increasing safety on our \nroadways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1730-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO INDIANA CHIEF JUSTICE RANDALL T. SHEPARD\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Indiana Chief Justice \nRandall T. Shepard, who is retiring this month after 25 years of \ndistinguished service as Indiana's Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Justice Shepard was appointed to the Indiana Supreme Court by \nGovernor Robert Orr in 1985 and became Chief Justice in 1987, then the \nyoungest chief justice in the nation. During his career, he has \nauthored nearly 900 civil and criminal opinions and 68 law review \narticles. His writings have been cited hundreds of times by law \njournals and other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Justice Shepard's leadership and idealism are recognized beyond his \nlegal opinions. Under his tenure, the court adopted a more balanced \nworkload of civil and criminal cases and began webcasting all of its \noral arguments. In 2001, he created the Courts in the Classroom \nprogram, which helps students learn about the judiciary, and was a \ndriving force behind the Indiana Conference for Legal Education \nOpportunity program which promotes diversity in the legal profession. \nIn 2007, Justice Shepard was appointed by Governor Mitch Daniels as co-\nchair of the Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform, and several \nof the Commission's recommendations have been implemented.\n  A seventh-generation Hoosier, Justice Shepard grew up in Evansville, \nIN, and graduated cum laude from Princeton in 1969. He received his law \ndegree from Yale Law School in 1972. Among other awards, Justice \nShepard has received the Indiana Chamber of Commerce Government Leader \nof the Year, the American Judicature Society's Opperman Award, and the \nIndiana Black Expo Lifetime Achievement Award. He has honorary degrees \nfrom the University of Southern Indiana, the University of South \nCarolina, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of \nEvansville.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to recognize Justice Shepard, and I \nwish him every continuing success as he pursues new challenges and \nopportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1730-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CIRCUS SMIRKUS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Circus Smirkus, the award-winning international touring \nyouth circus based out of Greensboro, VT. A treasured Vermont \ninstitution, renowned well beyond our borders, this year Circus Smirkus \nis celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n  Circus Smirkus was founded by Rob Mermin, who ran away to join the \ncircus at the age of 19 when summer camps for aspiring performers did \nnot exist. Upon moving to Greensboro in 1987, Rob started the program \nto promote the culture and skills of the circus and to inspire youth to \nenter the arts and experience the adventure of a traveling show.\n  Today Circus Smirkus is the only youth circus in America to put on a \nfull-season tour under its own big top, a 750-seat, one-ring, European-\nstyle circus tent. Every summer, a company of talented troupers, ages \n10 to 18, arrives and rehearses the show at Smirkus's headquarters in \nthe Circus Barn in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. Then 30 young clowns, \naerialists and acrobats take the show on the road, staging more than 70 \nperformances across New England in just 7 weeks.\n  The program is a complete immersion in circus life, including long \nhours, rigorous training, and daily chores. Most graduates--known as \nSmirkos--describe their experiences as life-changing and as having \nforged some of their most cherished memories. The young performers come \nfrom as far away as Mongolia, New Zealand, and Siberia. Since its \nfounding the circus has fostered youth exchanges with more than 25 \nnations.\n  Marcel Marceau, the famed French mime, broke his silence to call \nCircus Smirkus ``an absolutely wonderful task: to bring children hope \nfor the future, to create an entirely new form of circus and make it \nuniversal.'' He was so right. I see the skill they develop in young \nperformers and the joy they bring to every audience--including Marcelle \nand me when we take our grandchildren each summer in Vermont. I wish \nCircus Smirkus the best for this special milestone season and in all \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1730-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1730-S1731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO REVEREND HURMON E. HAMILTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nReverend Hurmon E. Hamilton, Jr. of Roxbury, MA, a remarkable pastor, \nteacher and leader. Reverend Hamilton grew up in Louisiana, the son of \na preacher. He attended Grambling State University and went on to earn \na Master of Divinity Degree from San Francisco Theological Seminary.\n  In 1994, Reverend Hamilton began his career in Massachusetts when he \nwas elected Senior Pastor of Boston's Roxbury Presbyterian Church. In \nthis\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nsenior ministry position, he led a major capital campaign that \nrenovated the historic church's building. More importantly, he \nunderstood that the church was far more than brick, mortar and stained \nglass and set about expanding the congregation's role in the community \nthrough their Social Impact Center. Under Reverend Hamilton's \nstewardship, the Center, and particularly its Dream Again Program, \nprovided a variety of hands-on programs to help area residents find \njobs, learn new skills, continue their education and even purchase and \nkeep homes.\n  Also under his leadership, the Roxbury Presbyterian Church began a \nhighly successful ``Adopt-A-School'' program that has been touted as a \nmodel of excellence.\n  Mr. President, if we are known by the fruits of our labor, then \nReverend Hamilton's time with us in Boston was bountiful. He was a \nchampion for summer jobs programs for disadvantaged teens; he also \nhelped secure funding for new textbooks for city schools. Yet nowhere \nwas he more effective than in his efforts to secure access to health \ninsurance for all our citizens. For Reverend Hamilton it was a matter \nof justice. Thanks in large part to his efforts, 98 percent of \nMassachusetts residents are now covered by health insurance. The \nprogram is not perfect and he understood that, which is why he has \nhelped lead the fight to reduce exploding health care costs in our \nstate.\n  Shortly after coming to Boston, Reverend Hamilton founded the Greater \nBoston Interfaith Organization which has been tremendously effective in \nnot just raising awareness of pressing social concerns, but bringing \ntogether religious and community organizations to actually improve the \nlives of our neighbors. Because of the GBIO and Reverend Hamilton's \nleadership, there are more opportunities for at-risk youth, poor \nfamilies are better educated and equipped to climb the economic ladder, \nand the rights of workers in nursing homes are better protected just to \nname a few of their accomplishments.\n  Mr. President, Reverend Hamilton leaves a lasting legacy in \nMassachusetts that expands well beyond his former church's Roxbury \nneighborhood. His impact can be measured in richer and more fulfilling \nlives, improved access to health insurance, better job prospects and \nengaged youth who go on to be productive and effective leaders, parents \nand workers.\n  Earlier this year, Reverend Hamilton accepted a new position in his \nwords, God reassigned him to a new ministry in California. I join \nReverend Hamilton's former congregation and all the people whose lives \nhe touched in thanking him and wish him and his wife, Dr. Rhonda \nHamilton, every blessing with their new opportunities in California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1731-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING MAJOR GENERALS FRANK VAVALA AND GUS HARGETT\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, in December, with the distinguished \nleadership of the Senators from Vermont and South Carolina, we passed \nthe National Guard Empowerment Act as an amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act with truly bipartisan support, as evidenced \nby its 71 cosponsors here in the U.S. Senate. At the time, we said that \nthe National Guard has performed extraordinary service in the last 10 \nyears alongside their Reserve and Active Duty counterparts as part of a \ntruly integrated total force, but that the changes included by the \nNational Guard Empowerment Act were most important not because of the \ngreat work in the past, but because of the essential need for enhanced \ncooperation in the future.\n  The Senate recognized that enhanced capabilities for the National \nGuard, particularly elevating the Chief of the National Guard Bureau as \na statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this Nation's highest \nmilitary planning body, were essential to meeting the threats of the \nfuture. And today I am happy to join my friend from Delaware to \nrecognize two men who played a key role in advocating that point of \nview here in the Senate, two men who approached an idea widely regarded \nas a nice, but unlikely thought and helped transform it into a reality. \nThey are Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United \nStates NGAUS, MG Frank Vavala, and his highly capable ``battle buddy,'' \nthe president of the NGAUS, retired MG Gus Hargett.\n  People around Tennessee know Gus Hargett as the former Adjutant \nGeneral of our State's National Guard, but also as the person \nresponsible for supervising the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency \nand the Tennessee State Guard. They also know Gus as the kind of guy to \nget things done when they really matter. Throughout his career he had a \nhealthy mixture of active duty service with the U.S. Army and the \nprecise sort of duty with the National Guard at the state level or \nActive Guard Reserve status that we put GEN Craig McKinley on the Joint \nChiefs of Staff to strategize for.\n  With the support of General Vavala and Adjutant Generals around the \ncountry, General Hargett provided key guidance for this legislation, \nanswered countless questions, and provided the needed impetus to take \nit over the top and onto the President's desk. He recognized that this \ntranscended simply advocating for the National Guard, it was an \nessential step for preparing our country's homeland defense strategy.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from \nTennessee to show appreciation for the efforts of General Hargett and \nGeneral Vavala. As he says, it is about much more than recognizing good \nwork done, it is about preparing for the natural and manmade threats to \nAmericans, and I would like to associate myself with his remarks.\n  My State is particularly blessed to have General Vavala as our world-\nclass adjutant general, providing invaluable leadership to the Delaware \nNational Guard on behalf of our Governor. I think that people who have \nhad just a few minutes to chat with him come away understanding that he \nis a dynamic force. They would be able to instantly understand how he \nand General Hargett helped guide a compelling, grassroots campaign of \nhundreds of thousands of National Guard men and women and their State \nleadership to make clear to their representatives that their Guard \nstrategy was a national defense concept to be taken seriously. Defense \nof our homes begins at home, something the National Guard has \nspecialized in for 375 years. At a time when it seems nothing in \nWashington works right, General Vavala insisted time and again that the \nvoice of the people matters and worked tirelessly to prove it. Congress \nrecognized the wisdom of investing in the National Guard, and responded \nappropriately, with the most important piece of legislation since the \nmodern, dual-mission National Guard was established in 1903.\n  Now, the leadership of the National Guard stands ready to support the \nPresident and Secretary of Defense in the new strategic guidance \nreleased in January. It is clear that tough decisions have to be made \nin this budget environment and that we will have a military with a \ndifferent look and operational approach in the future. However, we are \nconfident that the National Guard will not shrink from its \nresponsibility to defend our Nation and its interests around the world \nas well as meeting every home State emergency and challenge it faces.\n  We are grateful to GEN Frank Vavala, GEN Gus Hargett, and the members \nof NGAUS, for the important roles they played in this momentous \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1731-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1731-S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND J. WIECZOREK\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor my dear \nfriend, Raymond J. Wieczorek--a distinguished New Hampshire citizen who \nhas devoted a lifetime of service to his city, State, and Nation. After \nproviding decades of community and civic leadership in and around \nManchester, he will retire from public office at the end of this year.\n  Ray is a father and a grandfather who has also been a loving husband. \nHe has served as a soldier, a volunteer, a small businessman, a mayor, \nand as a member of New Hampshire's executive\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\ncouncil. But to me, Ray is a model public servant whose commitment to \nimproving the lives of others sets the standard for elected officials.\n  Not long after graduating from high school, Ray answered the call to \nserve his country. During the Korean war, he was a soldier with the \nArmy's 40th Infantry Division. An advocate for veterans, he remains a \nproud member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  In 1958, Ray's career brought him to his adopted hometown of \nManchester. Six years later, he founded the insurance agency that bears \nhis name--now a second generation family business carried on by his \nsons.\n  It didn't take long for Ray to realize that a city is only as strong \nas its citizenry. He once said that the heart and soul of any community \nis formed by the people who are willing to give their heart and soul to \ntheir community. And that is exactly what Ray has done.\n  To say that he has given generously of his time and expertise over \nthe past several decades would be an understatement. Ray served as a \ntrustee of the Manchester Boys and Girls Club; director and president \nof the Manchester Scholarship Foundation; chairman of the Greater \nManchester United Way Board of Directors; and as commissioner, and \nlater chairman, of the Manchester Housing and Redevelopment Authority.\n  In 1989, Ray was elected to his first of five terms as the mayor of \nManchester--New Hampshire's largest city. In the midst of an economic \ndownturn, the Queen City faced significant challenges. A once bustling \nmill town, the city was struggling to reinvent itself. Ray's enormous \nenergy, vision, and optimism made him a perfect fit for the mayor's \noffice--and at just the right time.\n  While others may have had doubts about the city's future, Ray thought \nbig. To help drive economic activity, he successfully pushed for the \napproval of a civic center. Today, visitors from across New Hampshire \ndescend on the Verizon Wireless arena--located in the well-named \n``Raymond J. Wieczorek Square''--for sporting events and concerts. This \nfacility has literally changed the face of Manchester, enlivening \ndowntown and proving that the Queen City is open for business.\n  Under Ray's leadership, Manchester made a major comeback. The city's \niconic Millyard started to flourish once again. The groundwork was laid \nfor a now-thriving Manchester Airport, which today serves as the \ngateway to northern New England and Boston's northern suburbs. \nFittingly enough, the access road to the airport is named in Ray's \nhonor. Also during his mayoralty, a new city charter was adopted. The \nFIRST program got underway, and city hall was renovated and restored; \nit is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  Ray once said, ``I wasn't born in this city. I'm here [be]cause I \nwant to be here.'' His efforts to improve Manchester were driven by an \nunwavering devotion to the city he loves. The turnaround Ray led was \nconfirmed in 1998, when Money magazine named Manchester as the Number \nOne Small City in the East.\n  And after nearly a decade of service as mayor, Ray was honored by the \nGreater Manchester Chamber of Commerce as the 1999 Citizen of the Year.\n  It would have been understandable for Ray to enjoy a quiet \nretirement. Fortunately for the people of New Hampshire, he instead \nchose to bring his wisdom to the statehouse in Concord.\n  Serving with Ray in State government, I had a firsthand opportunity \nto see his strong commitment to fighting for his constituents. And as \nNew Hampshire has faced challenges during a difficult economic period, \nthere is no question that Ray's experience as a successful mayor and \nbusinessman has contributed conspicuously to the work of the executive \ncouncil. Just as he helped Manchester navigate a challenging chapter in \nits history, Ray has provided steady and strong leadership at a \ncritical time for our State. Having served on the council for a decade, \nRay's voice will be sorely missed after his retirement.\n  Today, in the Senate, I am honored to recognize Ray Wieczorek for his \ntireless work to improve the lives of Manchester residents and citizens \nfrom across New Hampshire. I am grateful for his leadership, for his \ngood humor, and most of all for his kind friendship. By raising the bar \nfor excellence in public service, Ray Wieczorek has earned his rightful \nplace as one of New Hampshire's great statesmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1732-S1733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM\n\n Mr. CARDIN. President Theodore Roosevelt established Pelican \nIsland in Florida as the first national wildlife refuge on March 14, \n1903. He was responding not only to an urgent need to conserve our \nvulnerable natural resources but also to the passionate advocacy of \nAmericans who understood that our Nation's strength lies in the \nconservation of our wild lands and unique species.\n  Over the course of his Presidency, Roosevelt established 53 wildlife \nrefuges, from Key West's mangrove islands and sand flats to Flattery \nRock along Washington State's coast.\n  Today, on the refuge system's 109th birthday, the National Wildlife \nRefuge spans more than 150 million acres, across 556 wildlife refuges \nand 38 wetland management districts. The National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem is the Nation's premier network of public lands dedicated to the \nconservation of America's land and waters, its fish, wildlife, and \nplants.\n  From the Arctic to the Caribbean, the Atlantic to the Pacific, \nAmerica's wildlife refuges are in every State and U.S. territory. \nWildlife refuges conserve habitat that is essential to more than 700 \nspecies of birds, 220 types of mammals, 250 varieties of reptiles and \namphibians, more than 1,000 species of fish, and uncounted \ninvertebrates and plants. They sustain nearly 300 of the Nation's more \nthan 1,300 endangered or threatened species.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System does not only benefit wildlife. \nThe refuges also play a critical role for our communities. By \nprotecting wetlands, grasslands, forests, wilderness, and other natural \nhabitats, wildlife refuges improve air and water quality, relieve \nflooding, improve soil quality, and trap greenhouse gases. Wildlife \nrefuges also benefit local economies, drawing visitors to local \ncommunities and supporting jobs tied to conservation and outdoor \nrecreation.\n  I am especially proud of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in \nmy home State of Maryland. Blackwater contains roughly one-third of all \nof the tidal wetlands in the State of Maryland and provides critical \nstorm protection to lower Dorchester County, MD. Home to one of the \nlargest breeding populations of American bald eagles on the east coast, \nBlackwater Refuge is recognized as a ``Wetlands of International \nImportance'' by the Ramsar Convention and has been called one of the \n``Last Great Places'' by the Nature Conservancy. Blackwater also plays \na critical economic role in Maryland, attracting approximately 200,000 \nvisitors annually and providing an important economic engine for our \nEastern Shore communities.\n  The Blackwater Refuge is a place of great ecological and economic \nvalue, but more than that, it is a place of deep historic value. One of \nthe most important heroes in our Nation's history lived and bravely \nworked within the boundaries of Blackwater. To commemorate this \nhistory, I have introduced legislation to create two national \nhistorical parks--one within the Blackwater Refuge and one in New York \nto honor the legacy of Harriet Ross Tubman for her work on the \nUnderground Railroad. Harriet Tubman was born within the Blackwater \nboundary and conducted much of her courageous work there leading other \nslaves northward to freedom. I am deeply committed to ensuring that her \nlegacy is celebrated within the Blackwater Refuge. This is part of the \nbeauty of the National Wildlife Refuge System: by preserving the \necological integrity of our treasured lands, we also preserve an \nimportant link to our Nation's past.\n  In an increasingly urban and high-speed world, our national wildlife \nrefuges--islands of natural beauty--offer Americans priceless places to \nsoothe or stir the soul, educate the mind, and invigorate the body. I \nam pleased today to recognize the anniversary of this valuable \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1733-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2191.

 By Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Bingaman):\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\n  S. 2194. A bill to award grants in order to establish longitudinal \npersonal college readiness and savings online platforms for low-income \nstudents; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, parents in my home State of Delaware and \nall across this country worry so much and work so hard for the future \nof their children--for their health, their safety, their education, and \ntheir future. I rise today as a parent of three young children and the \nson and grandson of classroom teachers to talk about how we can pull \ntogether to provide all the tools and resources parents, teachers, \nmentors, and students need to understand, to afford, and to connect \nwith college opportunities in this country.\n  Why do we need a new solution to this longstanding problem of college \naccess? Well, let's just look at some statistics from this recent tough \nrecession we are still growing our way out of.\n  The unemployment rate amongst high school dropouts was 13 percent; \namongst those who had finished high school, 8 percent; and amongst \nthose who had a college degree, just 4 percent. That is an enormous \ndifference. That is millions of people unemployed because they didn't \nfinish their high school education and go on to some higher education.\n  In the new global economy, Americans who don't go on to college have \nless than $1 million in lifetime earning potential compared to those \nwho do go to college. That $1 million difference is something that--if \nparents and teachers and students were aware of it at the beginning of \ntheir education--it might drive them to make very different choices.\n  As a Senator, I have met with dozens of folks who lead companies or \nwho are innovators and job creators who have said they have vacant \npositions they can't fill because we are not graduating enough \nAmericans with advanced degrees and training in critical \nopportunities--engineering, science, technology, and math.\n  Filling the gap of opportunity by connecting students, teachers, \nparents, and mentors and creating a new generation of higher education \nachievers is something we can and should do to help create a \ncompetitive economy and workforce for the future. That is why today I \nam introducing the American Dream Accounts Act of 2012. This \nlegislation encourages partnerships between schools, colleges, local \nnonprofits, and businesses to develop secure, Web-based, individual, \nportable student accounts that contain information about each student's \nacademic preparedness, financial literacy, connects them to high-impact \nmentoring, and is tied to a college savings account. Instead of having \neach of these different resources be available to students separately, \nit connects them across existing silos and across existing education \nprograms at the State and Federal level and, by connecting across these \ndifferent silos, deploys a powerful new tool and resource for students, \nteachers, parents, and mentors.\n  This bill is a modest but I think powerful step toward helping more \nstudents of all income levels and backgrounds access, afford, and \ncomplete a college education. And I am grateful to Senator Rubio of \nFlorida and to Senator Bingaman of New Mexico in joining me as original \ncosponsors of this innovative solution.\n  Too many American kids today are cut off from the enormous potential \nand value of higher education. Today, just about 1 out of 10 children \nfrom low-income families will complete a college degree by the time \nthey are 24. As I have already said, the economic consequences of that \nare one of the main drivers of unemployment and poverty in our modern \neconomy. But with early action, with early engagement, we can help \nmillions of Americans beat those odds.\n  Many years ago, early in my career, I had the opportunity to work \nwith something called the national I Have a Dream Foundation, founded \nby Gene Lang, through which my family and I adopted a whole class of \nelementary kids from the East Side of Wilmington. All over this \ncountry, more than 100 similar groups, motivated individuals, and \ndonors have engaged in sponsoring college education opportunities for \nkids beginning at a very early age.\n  What I saw firsthand in the dozen years I was actively engaged with \nthe 50 kids in our I Have a Dream program was that young people who \ncome from a community, a family, a school where there is little to no \nexperience of college education get powerful and negative messages from \nan early age that college is not for them, that it is not affordable, \nthat it is not accessible, and that it is not part of the plan for \ntheir future.\n  Similarly, kids who grow up in families where their parents went to \nschool, their teachers went to school, went to college, get constant \nmessages--subtle but powerful messages--about the value and importance \nof college. Folks who come from those backgrounds--whether it is \ncollege sports or pride in their own graduation or constant \nconversations about one's alma mater or visits to college campuses--\nfrom childhood hear about college as something that is an expected part \nof life.\n  Very few of the 50 Dreamers my family and I worked with had any \nexpectation of a college education, and the most powerful thing we did \nwas to change that, to open the door to college as a possibility from \nelementary school on. It showed and this program has shown time and \nagain across the country that exciting and engaging not just young \nstudents but their parents, their teachers, and an array of mentors has \na cumulative, powerful, positive impact.\n  The American Dream Accounts Act will expand on this idea and use \nmodern social networking technology to bring together existing programs \nand deliver ideas that will work for more kids. And the good news is \nthat by utilizing existing Department of Education funds, this \nlegislation comes at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n  What makes the American Dream Accounts Act work is the unique ability \nto harness the power of currently available technology to address some \nof the biggest challenges in college access--first, connectivity. The \njourney from elementary school to finishing high school is long, and \nthe journey from there to higher education is a longer one. So many \nstudents in our public schools all over this country disengage or even \ndrop out along the way because they are not connected. They attend \nlarge and sometimes anonymous schools. Their parents are stretched too \nthin in this tough economy, trying to hang on to their jobs and \nhousing, and, frankly, a dedicated cadre of teachers can only do so \nmuch. These kids, as they become less and less connected to a clear \nvision of their future, drop out or make choices that make it unlikely \nthey will finish high school and go on to college.\n  American dream accounts take advantage of modern technology. They are \na Facebook-inspired opportunity to deliver on secure, personalized hubs \nof information that would connect these kids, sustain and support them \nthroughout the entire journey of education.\n  Second, it connects them with college savings opportunities. Senator \nRoth of Delaware long served as the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand one of the greatest pieces of his legacy was the Roth IRA, helping \nto empower working families to save for retirement. Part of the \nAmerican dream accounts is the idea of connecting young people to \ncollege savings accounts. Virtually every State has college savings \nprograms. Yet they are not accessed by most working- and middle-class \nAmericans. Connecting students to college savings accounts from their \nearliest ages has a powerful impact. Studies show that students who \nknow there is a dedicated college savings account in their name are \nseven times more likely to go to college than their peers without one. \nSo this legislation would help open an individual savings account for \neach enrolled student from the beginning of elementary school. It \nmatters less how much money is in the account than that students are \naware there is one.\n\n  The third piece of this program is early intervention. State and \nFederal governments already spend billions of dollars on higher \neducation--on Pell grants at the Federal level and in my State of \nDelaware on SEED grants. We provide these millions of dollars of \nsupport to afford college, but we don't tell kids they are there until \nthey are in high school. Most kids have already made decisions by then \nthat make them ineligible to finish high school or\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\nattend college. So why not tell them earlier, particularly given the \npowerful potential impact of that information.\n  By letting children know these opportunities exist from the earliest \nage, we can change outcomes.\n  Last is portability. One of the things I saw in my own experience \nwith my own Dreamers in Delaware was how often they moved and how often \noverstretched teachers with full classrooms didn't get any information \nor background on students who moved into their classroom halfway \nthrough the year. So instead of being welcomed and engaged in a \npositive way, they became discipline problems or were difficult to \nteach. This robust, online, secure account would empower teachers to \nconnect with parents and mentors and understand the students who are \nbefore them. That is why portability and persistence is an essential \nfeature of American dream accounts. This way, no matter what \ndisruptions or challenges a student might face as they travel through \neducation, their American dream account would travel with them. \nSupportive adults, teachers, mentors, and guidance counselors would be \nable to access this information, and kids would get a consistent \nunderstanding of the value and impact of a future college education.\n  One of my favorite parts of drafting this legislation was the \nmeetings and conversations we had with those on the front lines of \neducation in Delaware. As a community, I heard over and over again: We \nare hungry for innovative solutions. One of the many groups I met with \nwas the Delaware PTA. In endorsing the American Dream Accounts Act, \nthey said that it ``incorporates the school, the parent and the student \nto ensure each child will be closely monitored with resources and \nsupport that is needed to access a postsecondary education.''\n  The fact is our Nation's long-term economic competitiveness requires \na highly trained, highly educated workforce. We can meet that challenge \nby connecting students with a broad array of higher education options--\nvocational school, job training, community college, or a 4-year \nuniversity. This legislation will help students identify the type of \nhigher education that is best for them, the career they most want, and \ngive them the tools to get there.\n  I have visited with schools across Delaware, and one thing is clear. \nOne vision stays with me from my time at I Have a Dream to my service \nas a Senator. When you ask a roomful of elementary school kids, what do \nyou dream of being when you grow up, they all shoot their hands in the \nair and they all answer the question in the same way regardless of \ntheir background or income or community. Every child begins with dreams \nof a full, positive educational experience and career. All of our kids \nstart with big dreams, but the numbers show that not all of our kids \nget them. The American Dream Accounts Act of 2012 is a modest but \npowerful bill designed to empower students and parents of all \nbackgrounds to achieve those dreams from an early age.\n  Mr. President, I welcome support from other of my colleagues to make \nthis bill a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Begich, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2197.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe renewable energy credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined today by a \nnumber of my colleagues in introducing the American Energy and Job \nPromotion Act, a bill to extend a tax incentive for the production of \nelectricity from a number of renewable sources, including wind. The \nwind production tax credit is scheduled to expire at end of 2012. This \nbill would extend the credit for two years, through December 31, 2014. \nI am joined in this effort by Senators Mark Udall, Scott Brown, Harkin, \nHeller, Wyden and Bennet.\n  The production tax credit is a sensible policy that promotes \nhomegrown energy and American manufacturing jobs. The wind industry \ncurrently supports 75,000 American jobs and is driving as much as $20 \nbillion in private investment. During the past 5 years, 35 percent of \nall new electric generation in the United States was wind. This \nexpansion has directly led to the growth in domestic wind \nmanufacturing. There are nearly 400 manufacturing facilities today, \ncompared with just 30 in 2004.\n  The American Energy and Jobs Promotion Act would prevent a lapse in \nthe credit. Without an extension, as many as 37,000 jobs could be lost, \nincluding thousands in Iowa. With national unemployment at 8.3 percent, \nit would be irresponsible to send thousands of Americans employed in \nthe wind industry a pink slip. Unfortunately, because of the long lead \ntime in the production of wind equipment, many manufacturers are \nalready announcing layoffs.\n  I recognize that some have questioned the need to extend this \nimportant credit, particularly in light of the effort to reform the tax \ncode. I fully support tax reform and believe we need a simpler, more \nefficient tax code. However, we need to take action to support jobs and \nalternative energy producers in light of the slow pace on tax reform. \nThis 2-year extension will provide certainty for the renewable energy \nsector while recognizing that tax reform efforts could further modify \nor address this incentive in the next few years.\n  Additionally, due to our Nation's dire fiscal situation, many of my \ncolleagues have rightly focused their attention on ensuring that the \ndeficit is not exacerbated. While in the past I have generally opposed \npermanent tax increases to offset temporary tax incentives, I am \nwilling to work with my colleagues to extend the incentive in a manner \nthat minimizes its impact on the deficit.\n  Extension of the tax incentive is supported by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, Edison Electric \nInstitute and the American Farm Bureau Federation. A similar extension \nin the House of Representatives currently has the support of 80 \nbipartisan cosponsors.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation that will \ncontinue to grow domestic, renewable electricity, create jobs and \nprovide cleaner air. We must enact this extension as expeditiously as \npossible. Further delay will harm our economic recovery and our energy \nsecurity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2202. A bill to provide for the establishment of a private, \nnonprofit entity to assist the Government in providing disaster \nassistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the \nPreparedness and Resilience Foundation Act, which establishes an \nindependent non-profit public charity that acts as a philanthropic \nintermediary between the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, and \nthe private sector. The lack of appropriate mechanisms make it \ndifficult for FEMA to receive disaster related funds from private \nsector entities. The Preparedness and Resilience Foundation is intended \nto bridge this gap and improve the collaboration and coordination \nbetween FEMA and private sector entities. The unique roles that both \nthe private and public sectors play is critical not only to the \nleveraging of private and public resources, but to the development of \ncapacity and innovation models that will improve America's preparedness \nand resilience to an ever-increasing world of complexity, challenges \nand dangers both natural and man-made.\n  The measure will allow FEMA to support and carry out activities that \npromote the resilience of individuals, communities, structures, and \nsystems against natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other human \ncaused disasters. Further, the bill would build and\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nsustain the capabilities of the public, private, and civic sectors to \nwork together to prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, \nrecover from, and mitigate all such hazards.\n  Among other things, the proposed Preparedness and Resilience \nFoundation would function as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit private corporation, \nand not as an agency or instrument of the Federal Government. The \nFoundation would establish an Endowment Fund consisting of donations \nfrom non-federal entities or assets, to provide endowments and grants, \nand to carry out its mission, and preparedness and resilience \nactivities. The proposed measure requires a seven-person Board of \nDirectors, whose sole responsibility would be to run the Foundation, \nincluding management of its employees, and the administering of \ndonations to the Foundation. This legislation requires annual \nperformance evaluations of the Foundation.\n  The Preparedness and Resilience Foundation Act is modeled after the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Foundation. The CDC \nFoundation has become not only self-reliant to fund its activities, but \nalso generates millions of dollars every year to operate and award \ngrants to programs that help the agency meet its stated goals. I \nbelieve similar achievements can be made under the Preparedness and \nResilience Foundation Act. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to support \nthis measure, and to bring positive change and innovation to disaster \nmanagement in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 397\n\n       Whereas conflict between the Government of Sudan and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) has been \n     ongoing since June 2011 in Sudan's border state of South \n     Kordofan and since September 2011 in the border state of Blue \n     Nile, resulting in a humanitarian crisis;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has refused repeated \n     requests by the United States Government, the United Nations, \n     the African Union, the League of Arab States, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and others to allow humanitarian access to the \n     conflict areas;\n       Whereas the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan signed a \n     memorandum of understanding on non-aggression and cooperation \n     in Addis Ababa on February 12, 2012, agreeing to respect each \n     other's sovereignty and refrain from launching any attack \n     against the other, including bombardment;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that more than 130,000 \n     refugees have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile for South \n     Sudan, Ethiopia, and elsewhere since June 2011, and hundreds \n     of thousands more have been internally displaced or severely \n     affected by conflict;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan bombed the Yida refugee \n     camp in South Sudan on November 10, 2011;\n       Whereas both the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement-North have reportedly prevented civilians \n     from leaving Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan;\n       Whereas the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), \n     funded by the United States Agency for International \n     Development, estimated in March 2012 that conflict-affected \n     areas of South Kordofan would deteriorate further in coming \n     weeks to Phase 4 emergency levels of food insecurity (one \n     step before being classified as a famine), due mainly to \n     conflict and government policies that have limited \n     cultivation, displaced the population, restricted trade, and \n     refused access for international humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council issued a \n     statement on February 14, 2012, expressing deep and growing \n     alarm with the rising levels of malnutrition and food \n     insecurity in some areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, \n     calling on the Government of Sudan to allow immediate access \n     to United Nations personnel, and urging the Government of \n     Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North to \n     agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities and return to \n     talks to address the issues that have fueled the current \n     conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     appealed urgently to donors in February 2012 for $145,000,000 \n     to assist refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama released a statement in June \n     2011 calling on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement-North to agree immediately to a \n     ceasefire, end restrictions on humanitarian access and United \n     Nations movements, and agree on security arrangements for \n     Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States through direct, high-\n     level negotiations as opposed to the use of force;\n       Whereas President Obama released a statement on February 2, \n     2012, strongly condemning the bombing by the Armed Forces of \n     Sudan of civilian populations in Southern Kordofan and Blue \n     Nile states in Sudan, which stated that aerial attacks on \n     civilian targets are unjustified, unacceptable, and a \n     violation of international law and compound the ongoing \n     crisis in these areas;\n       Whereas neither South Kordofan nor Blue Nile were able to \n     complete the popular consultation process with the Government \n     of Sudan as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \n     (CPA) before violence broke out;\n       Whereas, despite the independence of South Sudan on July 9, \n     2011, many key issues between Sudan and South Sudan remain \n     unresolved, including transit fees for oil pipeline use, \n     citizenship, the status of Abyei, and border demarcation;\n       Whereas the goal of democratic governance reform in Sudan \n     as envisioned in the CPA has not been met;\n       Whereas, in addition to the growing conflict-induced \n     humanitarian and human rights crisis in Sudan's southern \n     border-\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\n     states, the humanitarian crisis and ongoing insecurity in \n     Darfur continues; and\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     estimates that more than 4,000,000 people in Sudan remain \n     internally displaced, and in 2011, though for the first time \n     since the Darfur conflict began, more Darfuris voluntarily \n     returned to their homes (87,000) than were newly displaced \n     (70,000), and additional tens of thousands are being \n     displaced in southern Sudan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the memorandum of understanding on non-\n     aggression and cooperation signed between the Governments of \n     Sudan and South Sudan in Addis Ababa on February 12, 2012;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement-North to reach a mutually-beneficial \n     political agreement;\n       (3) urges the Government of Sudan to allow immediate and \n     unrestricted humanitarian access to South Kordofan, Blue \n     Nile, and all other conflict-affected areas of Sudan;\n       (4) encourages the Government of Sudan and the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement-North to declare a cessation of \n     hostilities to allow food and essential supplies to reach \n     affected civilians;\n       (5) implores the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to \n     refrain from any support of proxy forces;\n       (6) urges the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement-North to allow civilians to leave the two \n     states voluntarily and seek refuge in more secure areas; and\n       (7) supports the current efforts of the Obama \n     Administration, working with partners in the international \n     community, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected \n     areas, to encourage all relevant parties to return to the \n     negotiation table to reach agreements associated with the \n     conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, to mitigate \n     violence in the interim, and to allow full humanitarian \n     access.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/15/senate-section/article/S1741-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 398--RECOGNIZING THE 191ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Carper, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Brown \nof Ohio, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lugar, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kirk, and Mr. \nChambliss) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 398\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek, \n     drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of \n     ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and. . .in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``Most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the people of Greece during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece, in one of the most consequential ``David \n     vs. Goliath'' victories for freedom and democracy in modern \n     times, refused to surrender to the Axis forces and inflicted \n     a fatal wound at a crucial moment in World War II, forcing \n     Hitler to change his timeline and delaying the attack on \n     Russia where the Axis Forces met defeat;\n       Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``If there had not been the \n     virtue and courage of the Greeks, we do not know which the \n     outcome of World War II would have been.'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     billions in the countries of the region, thereby helping to \n     create many tens of thousands of new jobs, and having \n     contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid for the \n     region;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively \n     participate in peacekeeping and peace-building operations \n     conducted by international organizations, including the \n     United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \n     European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe, and have more recently provided critical \n     support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization operation \n     in Libya;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat the Government and people of Greece \n     handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding and \n     rapprochement and cooperation in various fields with Turkey, \n     and has also upgraded its relations with other countries in \n     the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the stability of \n     the wider region;\n       Whereas the Governments and people of Greece and the United \n     States are at the forefront of efforts for freedom, \n     democracy, peace, stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond \n     between the people of Greece and the United States;

REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF COVERED BOND PROGRAMS \n                   ESTABLISHED.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, by rule and in \n     consultation with the covered bond regulators, establish a \n     covered bond regulatory oversight program that provides for--\n       (A) covered bond programs to be evaluated according to \n     reasonable and objective standards in order to be approved \n     under paragraph (2), including any additional eligibility \n     standards for eligible assets and any other criteria \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary to further the \n     purposes of this title;\n       (B) covered bond programs to be maintained in a manner that \n     is consistent with this title and safe and sound asset-\n     liability management and other financial practices; and\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\n       (C) any estate created under section 804 to be administered \n     in a manner that is consistent with maximizing the value and \n     the proceeds of the related cover pool in a resolution under \n     this title.\n       (2) Approval of each covered bond program.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered bond shall be subject to this \n     title only if the covered bond is issued by an eligible \n     issuer under a covered bond program that is approved by the \n     applicable covered bond regulator.\n       (B) Approval process.--Each covered bond regulator shall \n     apply the standards established by the Secretary under the \n     oversight program to evaluate a covered bond program that has \n     been submitted by an eligible issuer for approval. Each \n     covered bond regulator also shall take into account relevant \n     supervisory factors, including safety and soundness \n     considerations, in evaluating a covered bond program that has \n     been submitted for approval. Each covered bond regulator, \n     promptly after approving a covered bond program, shall \n     provide the Secretary with the name of the covered bond \n     program, the name of the eligible issuer, and all other \n     information reasonably requested by the Secretary in order to \n     update the registry under paragraph (3)(A). Each eligible \n     issuer, promptly after issuing a covered bond under an \n     approved covered bond program, shall provide the Secretary \n     with all information reasonably requested by the Secretary in \n     order to update the registry under paragraph (3)(B).\n       (C) Existing covered bond programs.--A covered bond \n     regulator may approve a covered bond program that is in \n     existence on the date of enactment of this Act. Upon such \n     approval, each covered bond under the covered bond program \n     shall be subject to this title, regardless of when the \n     covered bond was issued.\n       (D) Multiple covered bond programs permitted.--An eligible \n     issuer may have more than 1 covered bond program.\n       (E) Cease and desist authority.--The applicable covered \n     bond regulator may direct an eligible issuer to cease issuing \n     covered bonds under an approved covered bond program if the \n     covered bond program is not maintained in a manner that is \n     consistent with this title and the oversight program and if, \n     after notice that is reasonable under the circumstances, the \n     issuer does not remedy all deficiencies identified by the \n     applicable covered bond regulator.\n       (F) Cap on the amount of outstanding covered bonds.--\n       (i) In general.--With respect to each eligible issuer that \n     submits a covered bond program for approval, the applicable \n     covered bond regulator shall set, consistent with safety and \n     soundness considerations and the financial condition of the \n     eligible issuer, the maximum amount, as a percentage of the \n     eligible issuer's total assets, of outstanding covered bonds \n     that the eligible issuer may issue.\n       (ii) Review of cap.--The applicable covered bond regulator \n     may, not more frequently than quarterly, review the \n     percentage set under clause (i) and, if safety and soundness \n     considerations or the financial condition of the eligible \n     issuer has changed, increase or decrease such percentage. Any \n     decrease made pursuant to this clause shall have no effect on \n     existing covered bonds issued by the eligible issuer.\n       (3) Registry.--Under the oversight program, the Secretary \n     shall maintain a registry that is published on a Web site \n     available to the public and that, for each covered bond \n     program approved by a covered bond regulator, contains--\n       (A) the name of the covered bond program, the name of the \n     eligible issuer, and all other information that the Secretary \n     considers necessary to adequately identify the covered bond \n     program and the eligible issuer; and\n       (B) all information that the Secretary considers necessary \n     to adequately identify all outstanding covered bonds issued \n     under the covered bond program (including the reports \n     described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b)).\n       (4) Fees.--Each covered bond regulator may levy, on the \n     issuers of covered bonds under the primary supervision of \n     such covered bond regulator, reasonably apportioned fees that \n     such covered bond regulator considers necessary, in the \n     aggregate, to defray the costs of such covered bond regulator \n     carrying out the provisions of this title. Such funds shall \n     not be construed to be Government funds or appropriated \n     monies and shall not be subject to apportionment for purposes \n     of chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code, or any other \n     provision of law.\n       (b) Minimum Over-Collateralization Requirements.--\n       (1) Requirements established.--The Secretary, by rule and \n     in consultation with the covered bond regulators, shall \n     establish minimum over-collateralization requirements for \n     covered bonds backed by each of the eligible asset classes. \n     The minimum over-collateralization requirements shall be \n     designed to ensure that sufficient eligible assets and \n     substitute assets are maintained in the cover pool to satisfy \n     all principal and interest payments on the covered bonds when \n     due through maturity and shall be based on the credit, \n     collection, and interest rate risks (excluding the liquidity \n     risks) associated with the eligible asset class.\n       (2) Asset coverage test.--The eligible assets and the \n     substitute assets in any cover pool shall be required, in the \n     aggregate, to meet at all times the applicable minimum over-\n     collateralization requirements.\n       (3) Monthly reporting.--On a monthly basis, each issuer of \n     covered bonds shall submit a report on whether the cover pool \n     that secures the covered bonds meets the applicable minimum \n     over-collateralization requirements to--\n       (A) the Secretary;\n       (B) the applicable covered bond regulator;\n       (C) the applicable indenture trustee;\n       (D) the applicable covered bondholders;

and\n       (ii) report to the Secretary, the applicable covered bond \n     regulator, the applicable indenture trustee, and the \n     applicable covered bondholders on whether the cover pool \n     meets the applicable minimum over-collateralization \n     requirements.\n       (C) Removal and replacement.--The independent asset monitor \n     appointed under subparagraph (A) may be removed and \n     replaced--\n       (i) by a covered bond regulator in any case in which such \n     action is in the best interest of the covered bond investors; \n     and\n       (ii) by covered bond holders who own a majority of the \n     outstanding principal amount of the covered bonds secured by \n     the applicable cover pool, at any time.\n       (5) No loss of status.--Covered bonds shall remain subject \n     to this title regardless of whether the applicable cover pool \n     ceases to meet the applicable minimum over-collateralization \n     requirements.\n       (6) Failure to meet requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--If a cover pool fails to meet the \n     applicable minimum over-collateralization requirements, and \n     if the failure is not cured within the time specified in the \n     related transaction documents, the failure shall be an \n     uncured default for purposes of section 804(a).\n       (B) Notice required.--An issuer of covered bonds shall \n     promptly give the Secretary and the applicable covered bond \n     regulator written notice if the cover pool securing the \n     covered bonds fails to meet the applicable minimum over-\n     collateralization requirements, if the failure is cured \n     within the time specified in the related transaction \n     documents, or if the failure is not so cured.\n       (c) Requirements for Eligible Assets.--\n       (1) Requirements.--\n       (A) Loans.--A loan shall not qualify as an eligible asset \n     for so long as the loan is delinquent for more than 60 \n     consecutive days.\n       (B) Securities.--A security shall not qualify as an \n     eligible asset for so long as the security does not meet any \n     credit-quality requirement under this title.\n       (C) Origination.--An asset shall not qualify as an eligible \n     asset if the asset was not originated in compliance with any \n     rule or supervisory guidance of a Federal agency applicable \n     to the asset at the time of origination.\n       (D) No double pledge.--An asset shall not qualify as an \n     eligible asset for so long as the asset is subject to a prior \n     perfected security interest or other prior perfected lien \n     that has been granted in an unrelated transaction. Nothing in \n     this title shall affect such a prior perfected security \n     interest or other prior perfected lien, and the rights of \n     such lien holders.\n       (2) Failure to meet requirements.--Subject to paragraph \n     (1)(D), if an asset in a cover pool does not satisfy any \n     applicable requirement described in paragraph (1) or any \n     other applicable standard or criterion described in this \n     title, the oversight program, or the related transaction \n     documents, the asset shall not qualify as an eligible asset \n     for purposes of the asset coverage test described in \n     subsection (b)(2). A disqualified asset shall remain in the \n     cover pool unless and until removed by the issuer in \n     compliance with the provisions of this title, the oversight \n     program, and the related transaction documents. No \n     disqualified asset may be removed from the cover pool after \n     an estate has been created for the related covered bond \n     program under section 804(b)(1) or 804(c)(2), except in \n     connection with the management of the cover pool under \n     section 804(d)(1)(E).\n       (d) Other Requirements.--\n       (1) Books and records of issuer.--Each issuer of covered \n     bonds shall clearly mark its books and records to identify \n     the assets that comprise the cover pool securing the covered \n     bonds.\n       (2) Schedule of eligible assets and substitute assets.--\n     Each issuer of covered bonds shall deliver to the applicable \n     indenture trustee and the applicable independent asset \n     monitor, on at least a monthly basis, a schedule that \n     identifies all eligible assets and substitute assets in the \n     cover pool securing the covered bonds.\n       (3) Single eligible asset class.--No cover pool described \n     in section 802(3)(A) may include eligible assets from more \n     than 1 eligible asset class.

RESOLUTION UPON DEFAULT OR INSOLVENCY.\n\n       (a) Uncured Default Defined.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``uncured default'' means a default on a covered \n     bond that has not been cured within the time, if any, \n     specified in the related transaction documents.\n       (b) Default on Covered Bonds Prior to Conservatorship, \n     Receivership, Liquidation, or Bankruptcy.--\n       (1) Creation of separate estate.--If an uncured default \n     occurs on a covered bond before the issuer of the covered \n     bond enters conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or \n     bankruptcy, an estate shall be immediately and automatically \n     created by operation of law and shall exist and be \n     administered separate and apart from the issuer or any \n     subsequent conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, \n     or estate in bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of \n     the issuer. A separate estate shall be created for each \n     affected covered bond program.\n       (2) Assets and liabilities of estate.--Any estate created \n     under paragraph (1) shall be comprised of the cover pool \n     (including over-collateralization in the cover pool) that \n     secures the covered bond. The cover pool shall be immediately \n     and automatically released to and held by the estate free and \n     clear of any right, title, interest, or claim of the issuer \n     or any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee \n     in bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the \n     issuer. The estate shall be fully liable on the covered bond \n     and all other covered bonds and related obligations of the \n     issuer (including obligations under related derivative \n     transactions) that are secured by a perfected security \n     interest in or other perfected lien on the cover pool when \n     the estate is created. The estate shall not be liable on any \n     obligation of the issuer that is not secured by a perfected \n     security interest in or other perfected lien on the cover \n     pool when the estate is created. No conservator, receiver, \n     liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer \n     may charge or assess the estate for any claim of the \n     conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in \n     bankruptcy or the conservatorship, receivership, liquidating \n     agency, or estate in bankruptcy and may not obtain or perfect \n     a security interest in or other lien on the cover pool to \n     secure such a claim.\n       (3) Retention of claims.--Any holder of a covered bond or \n     related obligation for which an estate has become liable \n     under paragraph (2) shall retain a claim against the issuer \n     for any deficiency with respect to the covered bond or \n     related obligation.

The Comptroller General shall submit a report \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the \n     House of Representatives on the results of the study not \n     later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Distributions by estate.--All payments or other \n     distributions by an estate shall be made at the times, in the \n     amounts, and in the manner set forth in the covered bonds, \n     the related transaction documents, and any contracts executed \n     by or on behalf of the estate in compliance with this title \n     and the oversight program.
