Mr. President, following leader remarks, if any, the Senate \nwill be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. today. During that \nperiod of time, Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  At 3 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to S. 1039, the PATRIOT Act extension, and the time until 5 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled. At 5 p.m. there be a \nrollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. President, this will be a busy week in the Senate. We have to \nrenew the PATRIOT Act. It is not a perfect law, but it plays an \nimportant role in keeping our country safe. We also have to reauthorize \nthe FAA bill, the Federal Aviation Administration bill.\n  We all know what will be the focus of this week's biggest debate and \nbiggest headlines. The primary conversation this week will be about the \nRepublican plan to kill Medicare. People are talking a lot about that \nplan because there is a lot people have to fear.\n  The Republican plan would shatter a cornerstone of our society and \nbreak our promise to the elderly and to the sick. It would turn our \nseniors' health care over to profit-hungry insurance companies. It \nwould let bureaucrats decide what tests and treatment seniors get. It \nwould also ask seniors to pay more for their health care in exchange \nfor fewer benefits.\n  That is a bad deal all around. So it is easy to understand why the \nAmerican people do not support it. Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents do not support the plan to kill Medicare or to change it \nas we know it. I will not support it, and though the Republican House \npassed the Medicare-killing plan almost unanimously, sometimes it is \ndifficult to tell where the Republican Party stands generally.\n  We all saw how quickly one prominent Republican Presidential \ncandidate spun himself in circles last week. First, he called the plan \nfor what it was--radical. He said it was ``right-wing social \nengineering.''\n  Hours later, after Republicans jumped all over him, he reversed \ncourse and said he would support the plan to kill Medicare. Remember, \nhe said it is ``radical''; it is ``right-wing social engineering.'' And \nnow suddenly he said it is OK. That is some real interesting \ngymnastics.\n  Another prominent Republican, one who serves in this body, has been \nall over the map as well. First, he said--in his words:\n\n       Thank God for the Republican plan to kill Medicare.\n\n  Then he said he was ``undecided.'' Now he says he opposes it. Well, \ntune in tomorrow or maybe this evening to see if he changes his mind \nagain. Our Republican colleagues cannot seem to believe the same thing \ntoday they said yesterday.\n  But when Democrats talk about Medicare, we still believe today the \nsame thing we believed years ago, decades ago, generations ago. We \nbelieve in our responsibility to each other and especially those in \ntheir golden years. Forty-six years ago this summer, President Lyndon \nJohnson, a former majority leader of this body, signed Medicare into \nlaw. As he did so, he said the following:\n\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\n\n       Few can see past the speeches and the political battles to \n     the doctor over there that is tending the infirm, and to the \n     hospital that is receiving those in anguish, or feel in their \n     heart painful wrath at the injustice which denies the miracle \n     of healing to the old and to the poor.\n\n  Those injustices do not exist like they used to because of Medicare, \nbut they still exist. Potentially, they are still out there. The old \nand the poor among us still seek help and healing, and it is still our \nresponsibility to act not on political impulses but with human concern \nand compassion. It is still our responsibility not to be motivated by \nshort-term politics but to be moved by the people who need Medicare, \nthe people who count on the safety net to keep them from poverty, \nillness, and worse--death.\n  If we pay attention to those people, we will notice something else \nalso. While Republicans are tripping over themselves trying to decide \nwhether they want to kill Medicare, do you know who has not changed \ntheir minds at all? The American people. We are on their side. They \nhave not wavered one inch. They have been as constant as the \nRepublicans have been erratic. They have been consistent, and they have \nbeen clear: They do not want us to destroy their Medicare--their \nMedicare. We owe it to them to listen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3206-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, I was honored to participate \nin a very historic trip to attend the seventh ministerial meeting of \nthe Arctic Council in Nuuk, Greenland. I attended with Secretary of \nState Clinton, as well as Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Salazar.\n  The Arctic Council was founded in 1995. It is an intergovernmental \nassociation. There are eight member states within the territory that is \ncontained within the Arctic Circle. The group includes Canada, Denmark, \nFinland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, and the \nUnited States. There are also six permanent participants representing \nthe indigenous people of the region.\n  The trip was historic for a couple reasons. It was the first time a \nSecretary of State had led the U.S. delegation to the Arctic Council \nmeeting. The fact that not only Secretary Clinton led it as Secretary \nof State but she was joined by a second Secretary, the Secretary of the \nInterior, certainly made that historic. It was also the first time a \nMember of Congress had attended the Arctic Council meeting.\n  We met with Foreign Ministers of the eight Arctic Council nations and \nthe representatives of indigenous groups to discuss issues that are \nrelated to Arctic governance, climate change, and environmental \nprotection. We watched the Ministers sign a historic search-and-rescue \nagreement.\n  The Arctic Council also increased its organizational structure. They \nformed a standing Secretariat that will be established in Tromso, \nNorway. They also established criteria for the admission of new \nobservers to the Council. The People's Republic of China, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, Italy, and the European Union are all seeking \nobserver status to the Arctic Council, which might cause some to wonder \nwhy are all these non-Arctic nations interested in what is going on \nwithin the Arctic. I think that speaks to the evolving role of the \nArctic in geopolitics in the world as we know it today.\n  The search-and-rescue agreement, the first ever legally binding \nagreement among Arctic states negotiated under the auspices of the \nArctic Council, will strengthen the cooperation on search and rescue \nbetween Arctic states.\n  As the Arctic sea ice decreases, maritime activities are clearly on \nthe rise in the Arctic. Aviation traffic is also on the rise as we see \nnew polar aviation routes across the Arctic airspace in several \ndirections. But limited rescue resources, challenging weather \nconditions, and the remoteness of the area render the operations \ndifficult in the Arctic, making it very important that we have this \ncoordination among the Arctic nations.\n  Under the agreement on the U.S. side, the Coast Guard will be the \nlead Federal agency for the search and rescue in the Arctic. While we \napplaud the role the Coast Guard plays historically--a very long, \ndistinguished history of operating and conducting rescues in the \nArctic--the current status of the Coast Guard's service and aviation \nfleets makes conducting search-and-rescue operations in the Arctic very \nchallenging. With the scheduled decommissioning of the POLAR SEA, the \nCoast Guard will maintain only one--only one--heavy icebreaker in its \nfleet, and it is not expected to return to service until the year 2013. \nThey are doing some work on that vessel. While the Coast Guard does \nhave a medium-endurance icebreaker, the HEALY, the cutter is clearly \nnot equipped to handle the thick, multiyear ice that is present within \nthe Arctic.\n  On the aviation side of the Coast Guard operations, the Coast Guard \nC-130 aircraft stationed in Kodiak, AK, are the only aircraft in their \ninventory that are capable to make the direct flights to the Arctic.\n  To give some sense of the scope, here is a map of the Arctic. The \nUnited States is up here. Everything is upside down. I apologize for \nthat, but that is the way the world is. Kodiak is an island off the \nsouthern part of the State. Barrow is down here. This is where the air \nassets are stationed in Kodiak. To get to any search-and-rescue \noperations in the Chukchi Sea, in the Beaufort off Barrow or Prudhoe, \nit is over 900 miles. It is the same distance as the distance between \nWashington, DC, and Miami. If there were an incident in Miami, the \nhelicopters would have to fly from Washington to get there to provide \nfor the rescue.\n  Given the often harsh weather conditions in the Arctic, combined with \na lack of infrastructure to provide for any forward deploying basing of \nhelicopters, the Coast Guard's C-130s possibly can provide the search \npart of the rescue, but it is very difficult to get to the rescue site. \nThis lack of maritime resources and shore-based infrastructure to \nprotect our aviation resources places the Coast Guard and the United \nStates in a difficult situation in the Arctic. Without concerted \nefforts and a focused policy for the Arctic, the United States and our \nCoast Guard are going to continue to be ill-equipped to conduct the \nsearch-and-rescue operations that are going to become increasingly \nnecessary as amounts of sea ice continue to diminish and the levels of \nmaritime vessel traffic increase. As former Admiral Allen, former \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, would say: I cannot discuss too much \nabout climate change, but I can tell you there is more open sea that I \nam responsible for in the Arctic. We are clearly seeing that.\n  It has been projected that a seasonal ice-free Arctic Ocean was \ndecades away and that maritime shipping through the Northwest Passage, \nthrough the Northern Sea route above Russia and direct transit across \nthe Arctic Ocean was going to be few and far between. But last year, \nRussia sent a large ice-breaking bulk tanker through the Northern Sea \nroute and across the Arctic, carrying hydrocarbons bound for Asia. The \nRussian Federation has received 15 icebreaker escort requests to \nprovide navigational support through the Northern Sea route for this \nyear. Compare that to last year when they only had three requests. We \ncan see the level of commerce stepping up.\n  Transit through the Northern Sea route or the Northeast passage, as \nit is\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nalso called, cuts 5,000 miles and 8 days off the Suez route between \nEurope and Asia. We can see why other nations would have an interest in \nwhat is going on up there. If they can cut their transit time, it is \nmoney and an opportunity for them.\n  Interest in the Arctic by both the general public, the media, and the \nArctic and the non-Arctic nations continues to grow for many reasons. \nThe Arctic is a vast area. We can see from the map it is essentially \none-sixth of the Earth's landmass. It has a population within the \nArctic area--this red line, if we can see it, is essentially all of the \nArctic nations. In the governments that are contained within, there are \nsome 4 million people who live in this region, with over 30 different \nindigenous people and dozens of languages. While the land is clearly \nmassive in size and relatively barren, it is not like Antarctica, where \nthere are no indigenous people and no governance. The eight Arctic \nnations are sovereign governments with laws that govern their land and \ntheir people.\n  The Arctic holds, clearly, vast amounts of energy. We have known this \nfor some time. But until recently, the resources of the Arctic were \ndeemed to be too difficult to access. They are covered with ice. They \nare difficult to access, and they are expensive to develop. With \nincreasing access and high energy and mineral prices, the Arctic's \nwealth, which is estimated to contain approximately 22 percent of the \nworld's remaining oil and gas reserves--22 percent of the world's \nremaining oil and gas reserves within the Arctic area--is obviously of \ngreat interest. It is now being actively explored and developed. Six of \nthe eight member nations of the Arctic Council are exploring or \ndeveloping energy resources in their own waters.\n  This makes energy exploration perhaps among the more important and \nperhaps the most serious issues for Arctic policy as we move forward. \nThis includes conventional oil and natural gas but also the methane \nhydrates and some of the less conventional forms. Offshore Alaska, we \nare estimating about 15 billion barrels of oil in a concentrated area \nof the Chukchi Sea, and over in the Beaufort Sea about 8 billion \nbarrels.\n\n  We have suffered serious delays in exploration, but I am hopeful we \nwill see exploratory wells prove up this next summer. While the U.S. \nGeological Survey tells us the region has the world's largest \nundiscovered oil and gas deposits, we also think it holds huge amounts \nof other minerals, such as coal, nickel, copper, tungsten, lead, zinc, \ngold, silver, diamonds, manganese, chromium, and titanium. The \npotential for the mineral resource is equally significant.\n  There is a natural and sometimes reflective tendency to question how \nin the world it can ever be safe or even economic to drill and produce \nin such harsh, misunderstood, and clearly distant environments. But it \nis happening. It is happening today, and the technology and the \nengineering behind some of the existing and proposed activities are \nadvancing rather rapidly.\n  While we struggle in the United States with moving ahead with \noffshore development in Alaskan waters, our neighbors are rapidly \nmoving forward on Arctic energy development. Russia, which is just 53 \nmiles from Alaska's shoreline, is turning its eye to the Arctic's vast \nenergy reserves as they are building the first offshore oil rig that \ncan withstand temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees Celsius and then \nheavy packed ice around it as well. As their oil production is in \ndecline, they are also reducing taxes and bureaucratic hurdles to \nencourage new oil development within the Arctic.\n  Norway has been exploring and producing energy in the Arctic the \nlongest of the Arctic nations. They have found the way--led the way--\nfor energy development and other activities, such as fisheries, to \ncoexist. They also lead the world in developing technology to clean up \noil in Arctic waters.\n  Energy development, as well as protection of the environment, must go \nhand in hand. It is as simple as that. I was pleased the Arctic Council \nannounced the formation of a new task force that will negotiate \nmeasures for oilspill preparedness and response throughout the region. \nThe decision to launch these negotiations is evidence of the strong \ncommitment to proactively address emerging issues within the region and \nto create international protocols to prevent and clean up offshore \noilspills in areas of the region that are becoming increasingly \naccessible to exploration because of a changing climate.\n  One question I was asked seemingly everywhere I went when I was in \nGreenland was: What is the U.S. position on the Law of the Sea Treaty? \nWhen is the Senate going to move on this treaty? The U.S. delegation \nreiterated its support for the ratification of the Convention for the \nLaw of the Sea. I happen to believe it is crucial that the United \nStates be a party to this treaty rather than an outsider who hopes our \ninterests are not going to be damaged. Accession to the Convention \nwould give current and future administrations both enhanced credibility \nand leverage in calling upon other nations to meet Convention \nresponsibilities. Given the support for the treaty by Arctic nations \nand the drive to develop national resources, the treaty will also \nprovide the stability and the certainty that is vital for investment in \nour maritime commerce.\n  It should be pointed out that the United States is the only Arctic \nnation that is not a party to the Law of the Sea Convention. The treaty \nwas first submitted to the United States for approval back in 1994. It \nhas not been approved yet. Canada and Denmark joined the treaty in 2003 \nand 2004, respectively. But until the United States accedes to the \ntreaty, it cannot submit its data regarding the extent of its extended \ncontinental shelf to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \nShelf established under the treaty. Without a Commission recommendation \nregarding such data, the legal foundation for ECS limits is much less \ncertain than if the United States were a party to the treaty.\n  Russia submitted an extended continental shelf claim in 2002 that \nwould grant them 460,000 square miles of the Arctic Ocean's bottom \nresources. We can see the green is Russia's extended Continental shelf, \nbut this lighter green is the area Russia has submitted to the \nCommission. This is an area the size of the State of Texas, California, \nand Indiana combined. Denmark and Canada are also anxious to establish \ntheir own claims in the Arctic. Norway's claim is currently under \nreview by the Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf.\n  According to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, if the United \nStates were to become a party to the treaty, we could lay claim to an \narea the size of the State of California. So if you look again, \nAlaska--again, up on the top--this area here is the area that is within \nthe United States EEZ, this 200-mile area. But this area here--an area \nagain about the size of the State of California--is what our mapping \nindicates we would be able to submit a claim to the commission for if \nwe were party to the treaty.\n  So this whole area, again, would be area the United States would be \nable to claim. If we fail to accede to the treaty, and we are sitting \non the outside, we have no right to move forward with our claim. If we \ndo not become a party to the treaty, our opportunity to make the claim \nand have the international community respect it diminishes \nconsiderably, as does our ability to challenge the claims of any other \nnation.\n  Some have described the scenario in the Arctic as a ``race for \nresources'' or even an ``arms race.'' But after seeing the \ninternational cooperation at the Arctic Council, I believe what we have \nis an opportunity. This should be a race for cooperation, a race for \nsustainable management within the Arctic. The Arctic offers a great \nopportunity to work collaboratively. It is one area where the Obama \nadministration can highlight the international cooperation in the \nimplementation of its U.S. foreign policy. Think about what the \nadministration is poised to do with the ``reset'' with Russia. I think \nthe Arctic is a perfect area to do just that.\n  What does the future hold for the Arctic? I believe the pace of \nchange in the Arctic absolutely demands greater attention be focused to \nthe Arctic. It was music to my ears to hear the Secretary of State \nacknowledge the United States is an Arctic nation. We are an Arctic \nnation because of Alaska and its people. That was incredibly \nsignificant to hear that not only as a U.S. citizen but for the other \nArctic nations to hear\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nthat statement from our Secretary of State.\n  The implications of the dynamic changing Arctic for U.S. security, \neconomic, environmental, and political interests depend on greater \nattention, greater energy, and greater focus on the Arctic itself. But \nit will take robust diplomacy and very likely recognition, as Secretary \nClinton has reminded us, that the interest in the Arctic is not just \nlimited to the five Arctic coastal States or even the eight countries \nthat make up the permanent members of the Arctic Council. It will take \na level of cooperation, a level of collaboration to include the non-\nArctic states as well. But I am pleased that ever so slowly the United \nStates seems to be waking up to the fact that we are an Arctic nation \nand willing to take up the responsibilities as such.\n  I am confident with the leadership of the Members of Congress, the \nadministration, and from the Arctic community at large, we can continue \nto highlight the strategic importance of the Arctic for the United \nStates. I believe the Arctic Council meeting may be just the turning \npoint for American leadership in the Arctic.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your attention, I yield the \nfloor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The act calls for a budget to be produced by April \n15, the Budget Committee to have meetings by April 1, and here we are \ntoward the end of May, about to recess, and we have not even had a \nhearing in the Budget Committee on the markup of a budget.\n  Budgets, of course, are able to be passed by a simple majority in the \nSenate, and they have given the majority party in the Senate the \nopportunity--really the responsibility--to set forth their vision about \nthe financial future of America, to set forth their priorities, how \nthey would conduct the people's business.\n  We know the House of Representatives met that deadline. They passed a \nhistoric budget. But the Senate has not done so. All we have seen from \nMajority Leader Reid are political games, cynical games, distractions \nand gimmicks to avoid confronting the fiscal nightmare we are now \nfacing. How else can you explain why, in the middle of the crisis, \nDemocratic leaders have not even produced a budget, have not even \nallowed the committee to meet to work on one? We have not even met to \nmark up one. We are required by law to produce a budget in committee \nand pass that budget on to the Senate floor, but this process has been \nshut down. We have not produced a budget in 754 days. Let me repeat. \nThis great Senate, in a time of financial stress and danger, has not \npassed a budget in 754 days and has, it appears, no intention of doing \none this year.\n  Today I join with the newest member of our Budget Committee, Senator \nKelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, to send a letter to Senator Reid, signed \nby every Republican Senator in the Senate, pressing him to finally \nallow the Senate to begin work on a budget. But we are told in the \nmedia that the Democrats' refusal to put forth a budget is just good \nstrategy, that it is best that they avoid putting a plan on paper.\n  Here is an excerpt from a recent article in the Wall Street Journal. \nFittingly, the article is entitled ``Democrats Unhurried in Work on \nBudget.'' I would say that is true. This is what the article said:\n\n       As a political matter, the Democratic strategists say there \n     may be little benefit in producing a budget that would \n     inevitably include unpopular items. Many Democrats believe a \n     recent House GOP proposal to overhaul Medicare is proving to \n     be unpopular and has given Democrats a political advantage. \n     They loath to give up that advantage by proposing higher \n     taxes. Senate Democrats plan to hold a vote on the Ryan plan \n     hoping to force GOP Senators to cast a vote on the Medicare \n     overhaul that could prove politically difficult.\n\n  This is astonishing. It is the position of the great Democratic Party \nthat their vision for deficit reduction is so unpopular or unfeasible \nthat they won't even articulate it in public, let alone offer it up as \na budget?\n  The heads of President Obama's fiscal commission warn that an \neconomic crisis may be just 1 year or 2 years away.\n  That was the testimony they gave us in committee. It could be a year, \na little sooner or a little later, said Erskine Bowles, Chairman of the \ncommission, along with Alan Simpson, who said it could be 1 year, in \nhis opinion, that we could have a debt crisis--not a little warning \nfrom people who spent months hearing witnesses and studying the debt \nsituation facing our country. But it appears the leaders of the Senate \nwould prefer to hide in the hills and take shots at Republicans from a \ndistance. Is that what they prefer?\n  Chairman Paul Ryan and the House GOP had put forward a plan to get \nthis country out of a looming, Greek-like debt crisis, make our economy \nmore competitive, and save Medicare for future generations. It is an \nhonest, courageous plan that will improve the quality of life for \nmillions of Americans and do the job short term and long term. It may \nnot be perfect. I am not saying it is perfect. I am saying it is a \nserious plan, seriously considered, that confronts both long-term and \nshort-term problems and reforms Medicare and puts it on a path to \nsalvation. But all we hear are attacks.\n  By contrast, the budget the President sent forward doubles our \nnational debt and puts our entire country at risk, even though the \nPresident promised it would ``not add more to the debt'' and have us \n``live within our means.'' Those were the President's words. In the 10 \nyears of his budget, analyzed by the objective Congressional Budget \nOffice, they tell us the lowest single annual deficit out of those 10 \nwould be $740 billion--a stunning amount. They would average almost $1 \ntrillion. The last years--8, 9, and 10--of his 10-year budget do not \nshow the debt going down but going back up to $1 trillion. It was the \nmost irresponsible budget that has ever been presented to this Nation. \nIt is a stunning failure to lead at a time of financial crisis. It \ndoubled the debt. It increased the debt over the projections of our \nbaseline as it is. Instead of helping, it made it worse because it \nraised taxes and raised spending, and it raised spending more than it \nraised taxes.\n  So where do our colleagues in the Senate stand? They refuse to put \nforward their own plan. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Reid said the \nDemocrats don't need a budget. ``There is no need to have a Democratic \nbudget, in my opinion.'' He said it would be ``foolish'' to present \none. The only thing that is foolish is violating the Congressional \nBudget Act in such a cynical attempt for political gain. The decision \nnot to produce a budget is not a decision based on what is best for our \ncountry but based, as you can see from the quotes of the staffers and \nactually Senator Reid's own quote--it was designed for political \nadvantage.\n  The Ryan budget is honest. If anybody confronts the budget situation \nin an honest way, they know the budget is going to have to have some \nbad news. It is going to have to tell people things cannot continue as \nthey are today but we are going to have to do better. We are going to \nhave to reduce spending. So maybe for some people that is not popular. \nIsn't that what we are paid to do here, serve the national interest, \ntell the truth about what is happening in our country?\n  We find ourselves in the remarkable position this week of having \nSenate\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nDemocratic leaders bring forward not a Senate budget but bring forward \nthe House Republican budget, only to vote it down while offering no \nalternative of their own. What a cynical ploy. Think about it.\n  Senator Reid said we are going to bring up the House budget, we are \ngoing to vote on it, and every member of his caucus--I am sure he has \nalready counted the heads--will vote no. It has no chance of passage. \nWhat good is that? The Senate has a statutory duty under the Budget Act \nto produce a budget. We have not even attempted to produce a budget. \nThey will attempt to bring forward a budget they have no intention of \nworking on, no intention of taking seriously, no intention of opening \nfor amendment or discussion, with only one goal: to use their majority \nto vote it down.\n  I look forward to the chance to support the House budget. I look \nforward to casting a vote which says we will be getting our spending \nunder control, we will deal honestly with our budget challenges short \nterm and long term. I look forward to voting for a budget that creates \njobs, makes us more competitive, and deals honestly with the debt \nthreats we have. But let's look at the bigger picture.\n\n  This week, the planned series of votes are designed by the majority \nleader to fail, of course. They are designed as a gimmick to distract \nattention from the Senate's failure to produce an honest plan. They are \ndesigned to keep this Senate from doing its job and defending this \nRepublic from grave financial danger.\n  I, therefore, will not provide unanimous consent for any prearranged \npackage of votes doomed to fail, intended to fail. Anyone can call up \nthese budget votes, consistent with the rules, anytime they wish. But a \npackage deal that wastes the Senate's time I cannot and will not \nsupport. The majority leader is wasting the American people's time. I \nam here to speak honestly and just tell the truth about that. That is \nthe plain fact. It is a political gimmick that is going on.\n  Further, I will not agree to unanimous consent on any motion to \nadjourn for the Memorial Day recess. If we are going to close down this \nChamber for another week without having produced a budget, without \nhaving even scheduled a committee hearing, then I am going to require \nwe have a vote on it. Let's vote to go home, not having done the \npeople's business.\n  Paul Ryan is leading. Speaker Boehner is leading. The House \nRepublicans are leading. They produced a document that can be defended, \nthat has integrity, that deals with our short-term spending problem and \nour long-term spending problem. It is not perfect, of course. We have \nthe opportunity to amend it. We have an opportunity to pass a budget of \nour own that might be different, but it will get us off the \nunsustainable path we are on. But our Democratic leader and the \nDemocrats who control the Chamber are refusing to allow a budget to go \nforward. They are refusing to share with the American people the \ncontents of the plan they say they have behind closed doors. They say \nthey have one. We read in the paper they have one. Why don't we see it?\n  So on Memorial Day--a week from today--we honor those who have fallen \nserving their country. We honor the brave men and women who have risked \nand given everything for our freedom and our future. We truly do. We \nhonor those who gave their last breath to preserve our way of life. But \nnow that way of life is threatened by a tidal wave of debt that we \nrefuse to confront. It is a debt we have created, that we are growing, \nand that is up to us to stop, to defeat. That the Senate would go into \nrecess this week refusing to work on a budget or even hold a public \nmeeting on it, a further hearing on it, is unthinkable. Our soldiers \nserving overseas will not get the next week off. Why should the Senate \nget a week off after failing miserably to do its job?\n  My message to the majority leader is simple. If you object to the \nHouse GOP plan or to other Republican plans, then you must come forward \nwith your own honest plan to prevent financial catastrophe and create a \nmore prosperous future. Indeed, I close with this quote from the \npreamble to the fiscal commission report. This is what the Commission \nsaid because they anticipated just this kind of political difficulty. \nThey anticipated that politicians in our country would do exactly what \nthey are doing in the Senate--not what they did in the House where they \nfaced up to their responsibility, but in the Senate.\n  This is the quote:\n\n       In the weeks and months to come, countless advocacy groups \n     and special interests will try mightily through expensive, \n     dramatic, and heart-wrenching media assaults to exempt \n     themselves from shared sacrifice and common purpose. The \n     national interest, not special interests, must prevail. We \n     urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about any \n     of our recommendations to follow what we call the Becerra \n     rule: Don't shoot down an idea without offering a better idea \n     in its place.\n\n  That is exactly what the majority leader plans to do. He said: We \ndon't need a Democratic budget. It would be foolish for us to produce \none. We will just call up this House budget, and we will attack it, and \nwith our Senate majority we will vote it down. But we won't produce our \nown. We won't produce any other alternative. We won't tell the American \npeople our vision, our prospects and plans for getting this country off \nthe unsustainable debt path we are on, and on to the path of prosperity \nand job creation and a sound financial future.\n  Why don't we hear it? Because, as one of their staff members said in \nthat comment to the press, it might cause somebody to object. We might \nhave, as the debt commission warned, advocacy groups and special \ninterests that are going to rise up and complain about anything that \nreduces a dime they receive.\n  I don't deny in an honest budget, at this point in history where 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend is borrowed, we are going to have to \nreduce some spending. Some good people are going to feel it. It is not \ngoing to be easy, just as the debt commission told us. Don't we know \nthat? I thought that was what the past election was about last fall, \nwhen the big spenders and the high tax guys got shellacked. I thought \nCongress would get the message. Apparently, we haven't.\n  The debt situation we are in is not a little biddy thing. Under the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis of President Obama's 10-year \nbudget, last year we had interest on the debt that we now owe of a \nlittle over $200 billion. According to the analysis of the President's \nbudget, in the tenth year, under his plan, the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates we will pay, in interest in 1 year, $940 billion.\n  I know that is so much money it is difficult for people to comprehend \nit. Alabama is a State of just about average size. We are about one-\nfiftieth of the United States. We have a lean government that is making \nsome serious reductions in spending because our money hasn't come in, \nand we have a constitutional amendment that requires the budget to be \nbalanced. But the amount of money that Alabama spends on its general \nfund obligations is $1.8 billion.\n  The President's proposed budget would cause the interest on our debt \nin 1 year to reach $940 billion. That is way above what we spend on \ndefense. It is way above what we spend on Medicare. It is the fastest \ngrowing item in the entire spending plan of America--interest on the \ndebt--and that is why Mr. Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve; \nMr. Alan Greenspan, our former Chairman; the International Monetary \nFund; Moody's; the debt commission have all told us this is \nunsustainable. We can't continue. We won't go 10 years without a debt \ncrisis. When asked, Mr. Bowles said we could have one in 2 years, maybe \na little sooner, maybe a little later. I am not predicting that, but if \nwe don't change that could happen, as expert after expert has said.\n  I hope in the days to come we will see the regular order be \nreestablished. Our colleagues say they have a budget. Let's bring it \nforward. Let's see it. They certainly have talked to the Democratic \nMembers on more than one occasion about it. Maybe it has some good \nthings on which we can agree. It will probably have some things that I \nwouldn't agree on, but it can be passed. We can't filibuster a budget. \nUnder the Budget Act, it can be passed by a simple majority. A budget \ncan clear the Senate, but you know what. If we produce a budget, we \nhave to tell the American people what we really believe about America, \nwhere we really want this country to go.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n  Do we want a limited government, or do we want to continue to expand \na larger and larger government? Do we want to raise taxes more and more \nto sustain spending levels higher than we have ever had them before? Is \nthat what we want? Or are we prepared to make reductions in spending? \nOne or the other has to occur. We cannot continue to borrow at the rate \nwe are borrowing, which every expert has told us.\n  I am challenging the leaders of this Senate who asked for the job, \nwho asked to be leaders of the Senate, asked to be given the \nresponsibility of helping guide our Nation, to step forward and provide \nleadership.\n  In the joint statement issued by Mr. Bowles and Alan Simpson that \nthey submitted to the Budget Committee, they said our Nation has never \nfaced a more predictable financial crisis. In other words, to the \nexperts they heard from and who testified to them, and then based on \ntheir own study, they believe we are heading to a financial crisis. \nAlan Greenspan recently said: I think the Congress will, at some point, \npass reform in spending and budget matters. The only question is, Will \nthey pass it before or after the debt crisis hits.\n  So we have that challenge. We have no higher duty than to protect our \npeople from a foreseeable danger.\n  That danger is out there. We are heading right toward it. It is time \nfor us to stand up and be honest and face that challenge. I do not \nbelieve business as usual should continue, and I will object to it so \nfar as I am able.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3210-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1038, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1038) to extend expiring \n     provisions of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization \n     Act of 2005 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 until June 1, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I wish to point out that as of Friday, there are three \nprovisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which are going \nto expire. Those three provisions are something called roving wiretaps, \nthe ``lone wolf'' provision, and the business records authority.\n  Because of prior discussions, let me point out up-front that this \ndoes not include national security letters, just these three \nprovisions: ``roving wiretaps,'' the ``lone wolf,'' and the ``business \nrecords'' authorities.\n  I very much appreciate that the majority leader and the Republican \nleader have come together in agreement to bring this legislation to the \nSenate floor. Because of its importance, particularly at this point in \ntime, I hope we will be able to conclude this business and see that \nthose provisions are extended for 4 years before Friday.\n  Many of us strongly believe when it comes to national security there \nshould be no partisan divide, only strong bipartisan support. So this \nmeasure should receive a substantial vote this afternoon, and the \nSenate will pass it quickly this week before these key authorities \nexpire.\n  But before talking about the substance of the legislation, let me \ndescribe the context in which this debate occurs.\n  Three weeks ago, on May 1, the United States carried out a risky, \ncomplicated but ultimately successful strike against Osama bin Laden, \nin Abbottabad, Pakistan. The strike was the culmination of nearly a \ndecade-long intelligence operation to locate bin Laden.\n  Similar to most complex intelligence challenges, finding bin Laden \nwas the product of multiple intelligence sources and collection \nmethods. It was a seamless effort led by the CIA, with important \ncontributions from the National Security Agency--known as the NSA--and \nthe National Geospatial Intelligence Agency as well.\n  The intelligence mechanisms that are employed in counterterrorism \noperations are carefully and regularly reviewed by the Senate's \nIntelligence Committee, which I have the honor to chair. Some are also \noverseen by the Judiciary Committee, on which I also have the pleasure \nto serve.\n  These intelligence tools include the provisions of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and in particular the three \nprovisions that will, if not reauthorized, expire on May 27. Again, \nthey are the ``roving wiretap,'' the ``lone wolf,'' and the ``business \nrecords'' authorities.\n  The point is, we as a nation rely on certain secret sources and \nmethods to protect our national security. Most other nations do as \nwell.\n  It is also important to note that the strike against bin Laden, while \na critical strategic blow to al-Qaida, is also very likely to lead to \nreprisal attempts.\n  There have been calls for attacks against the United States after the \nbin Laden strike from al-Qaida in Pakistan, from al-Qaida affiliates in \nYemen and North Africa. There is a very real concern that radicalized \nAmericans here at home may contemplate violence in response to \nextremists' calls for retribution.\n  So this is a time of heightened threat--maybe no specific threat, but \ncertainly heightened threats. We are seeing attacks in Pakistan carried \nbut by the Taliban in reprisals for this attack as well. Therefore, \nthis is a time when our vigilance must also be heightened.\n  Key officials from the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, and \nthe Department of Homeland Security recently described to the \nIntelligence Committee in closed session how their respective agencies \nhave heightened their defensive posture over these very concerns.\n  Clearly, this is a time where every legal counterterrorism and \nintelligence-gathering mechanism should be made available.\n  It is also a time to seize the opportunity to further disrupt al-\nQaida. The assault on the bin Laden compound netted a cache of valuable \ninformation: papers, videos, computer drives, and other materials about \nal Qaeda's vision and al-Qaida's plans.\n  The intelligence community established an interagency task force to \ngo through that material as quickly as possible. I am hopeful that \npreviously unknown terror plots will be identified and information \nleading to the location of terrorists will be found.\n  Authorities such as the three provisions set to expire this Friday \nmay well prove critical to thwarting new plots and finding terrorists. \nThey must be renewed.\n  Let me describe the three provisions in more detail.\n  First, the roving wiretap provision. Roving wiretap authority was \nfirst authorized for intelligence purposes in the PATRIOT Act in 2001. \nBut, as you know, it has been used for years in the criminal context. \nThis provision, codified in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nprovides the government with the flexibility necessary to conduct \nelectronic surveillance against elusive targets.\n  Let me explain.\n  In most cases under FISA, the government can go to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Court--which I will describe in detail \nlater--and present an application to tap the telephone of a suspected \nterrorist or spy. The FISA Court reviews the application and can issue \nan order--basically a warrant--to allow the government to tap a phone \nbelonging to that target.\n  We all know in this day and age there are disposable or ``throw \naway'' cell phones that allow foreign intelligence agents and \nterrorists not only to switch numbers but also to throw away their cell \nphone and replace it with another.\n  This roving wiretap authority allows the government to make a \nspecific\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nshowing to the FISA Court that the actions of a terrorist or spy may \nhave the effect of thwarting intelligence. In other words, they make \none appearance, and the government can thus seek, and the FISA Court \ncan authorize, a roving wiretap so that the FBI, for example, can \nfollow the target without having to go back to the Court for each cell \nphone change.\n  Instead, the FBI in this case would report to the FISA Court, \nnormally within 10 days of following the target to a new cell phone, \nwith information on the fact justifying the belief that the new phone \nwas or is being used by the target.\n  The Justice Department has advised Congress that the authority to \nconduct roving electronic surveillance under FISA has proven to be \noperationally useful in some 20 national security investigations \nannually. So this provision is both used and very necessary in this day \nof throw away cell phones.\n  ``Lone wolf'' authority allows the government to request, and the \nFISA Court to approve, intelligence collection against non-U.S. persons \nwho engage in international terrorism but for whom an association with \na specific international terrorist organization may not yet be known.\n  Let me explain that more clearly. All other FISA surveillance and \nsearches must be focused on a target who the government can prove is \ntied to a foreign power. Before the government can tap a phone or \nsearch a residence, it needs to demonstrate that the person it is after \nis an employee or spy or otherwise working for, or on behalf of, \nanother country or terrorist group.\n  The ``lone wolf'' provision, which was added to FISA in 2004, \nrecognizes that there may be cases where the government suspects an \nindividual inside the United States of plotting a terrorist attack, but \nit has not been able to link that individual to al-Qaida or al Shabaab \nor another group.\n  The ``lone wolf'' authority allows the government to go to the FISA \nCourt, show why it believes a non-U.S. person is engaging in terrorist \nactivity, and get a warrant to begin surveillance. This is not done \nwithout a warrant from the court.\n  It also allows for court-ordered collection against a non-U.S. target \nwho may have broken with a terrorist organization while continuing to \nprepare for an act of international terrorism.\n  The Justice Department has advised Congress that although to date it \nhas not used this authority, the ``lone wolf'' authority nevertheless \nfills an important gap in U.S. collection capabilities, and we have it \nif we need it.\n  The recent case of Khalid Aldawsari, a Saudi national arrested in \nTexas this past February, shows why the ``lone wolf'' authority is \nnecessary. Aldawsari was arrested after the FBI learned he had \npurchased chemicals and conducted research needed to make improvised \nexplosive devices. He had also researched bomb targets, including dams \nin California and the Dallas residence of former President George W. \nBush.\n  Unlike other recent terrorists such as Najibullah Zazi, David \nHeadley, and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, Aldawsari was not identified on \nthe basis of his connections to foreign terrorist organizations or \nknown at the time of his capture to be working with one.\n  He is better described as one of the most recent cases of individuals \nalready inside the United States who became radicalized and committed \nto carrying out terrorist attacks.\n  So it is for this kind of threat that the ``lone wolf'' authority is \nimportant and why we should extend this mechanism. It is also this kind \nof threat that the Intelligence Community is now especially worried \nabout, as people inside the United States may be spurred to action in \nretaliation for the strike against bin Laden.\n  If the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, or a State or local \npolice officer identifies someone building bombs, it is necessary to \nmove quickly and not take time to research a possible connection to al-\nQaida before we use FISA authorities to learn what they are up to and \nwhen and how they might strike.\n  Business records. The third authority covered by this legislation is \nknown as the business records provision and provides the government the \nsame authority in national security investigations to obtain physical \nrecords that exist in an ordinary criminal case through a grand jury \nsubpoena.\n  Business records authority has been used since 2001 in FISA to obtain \ndriver's license records, hotel records, car rental records, apartment \nleasing records, credit card records, among other business records. \nThis is the way in which you track a target.\n  Let me note that while the debate over this provision has often \nfocused on library circulation records, the Justice Department has \nadvised the Congress that this authority has never--let me stress, \nnever--been used to obtain library circulation records.\n  We had a big debate on this issue when this came up before. In fact, \nthis authority has never been used for library circulation records.\n  The Department has informed Congress that it submitted 96 \napplications to the FISA Court for business record orders last year. \nThe Justice Department has further stated that some business records \norders have been used to support critically important and highly \nsensitive intelligence collection activities. The House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees have been fully briefed on that collection.\n  Information about this sensitive collection has also been provided to \nthe House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and information has been \navailable for months to all Senators for their review.\n  The details on how the government uses all three of these authorities \nare classified and discussion of them here would harm our ability to \nidentify and stop terrorist attacks and espionage. But, if any Senators \nwould like further details, I encourage them to contact the \nIntelligence Committee, or to request a briefing from the Intelligence \nCommunity or the Department of Justice.\n  I have mentioned several times the role of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. Let me describe what it is and how it operates.\n  The FISA Court is a special court. It is a set of 11 Federal district \njudges, each of whom is appointed by the Chief Justice to specifically \nserve in this role.\n  At least one of these judges is available at all times--24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week, 365 days a year--for the purpose of reviewing \ngovernment applications to use FISA authorities and, if those \napplications are sufficient, approving them by issuing an order, or \nwhat we call in the criminal law, a warrant.\n  The FISA Court judges meet in closed session to review classified \ndeclarations, and they provide very careful judicial review of the \ngovernment's applications. They are expert in this specialized area of \nthe law, as is their expert staff. The Department of Justice officials \nwho come before them take all care in making their case and presenting \ntheir facts, as they do in public court.\n  The American people should understand that these FISA authorities we \nare discussing now--the ability to conduct electronic surveillance and \nobtain records--are subject to strict oversight. A Senate-confirmed \nofficial in the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, the Deputy \nAttorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General for National \nSecurity--one of these three must, and I stress ``must''--sign off on \nevery application before it goes to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court.\n  Federal judges, also confirmed by the Senate, must approve the \napplications. Inspectors General conduct regular audits and oversight \nas well. The Senate and House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees \nreceive regular reports from the Department of Justice on the use of \nall FISA authorities, as well as receiving briefings from the FBI and \nNSA on the implementation of the FISA statute.\n  The three authorities reauthorized by this legislation have been \ndebated extensively on this floor and in this Congress since it came up \nfor reauthorization in 2009. Every single national security official to \ncome before the Congress in the past 2 years has testified that these \nprovisions are vital to protect America and has urged their \nreauthorization.\n  It is very hard, I think, to vote no in the face of what we have been \ntold in classified intelligence briefings and in hearings by officials \nfrom the Attorney General's office and the FBI. In fact,\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nthe Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence wrote a \nletter to Leaders Reid and McConnell today, May 23, expressing their \nstrong support for immediate enactment of the legislation we are now \nconsidering.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to \nLeaders Reid and McConnell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Office of the Director of\n\n\n                                        National Intelligence,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2011.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leaders Reid, Pelosi, and \n     McConnell: We write to express our strong support for the \n     immediate enactment of S. 1038, the Patriot Sunsets Extension \n     Act of 2011. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     (``FISA'') is a critical tool that has been used in numerous \n     highly sensitive intelligence collection operations. Three \n     vital provisions of FISA are scheduled to expire after May \n     26, 2011: section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides \n     authority for roving surveillance of targets who take steps \n     that may thwart FISA surveillance; section 215 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act, which provides expanded authority to compel \n     production of business records and other tangible things with \n     the approval of the FISA court; and section 6001 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which \n     provides the authority under FISA to target non-United States \n     persons who engage in international terrorism or activities \n     in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated \n     with an identified terrorist group (the so-called ``lone \n     wolf'' definition).\n       In the current threat environment, it is essential that our \n     intelligence and law enforcement agencies have the tools they \n     need to protect our national security. At this critical \n     moment there must be no interruption in our ability to make \n     full use of these authorities to protect the American people, \n     and we urge the Congress to pass the bill and send it to the \n     President without delay.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that \n     there is no objection to this letter from the perspective of \n     the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     James R. Clapper,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me point out there are no recent \ncases of abuse of these authorities. The oversight system in place is \nworking well, I believe, to ensure they will not be misused in the \nfuture.\n  Other Senators may come to this floor and talk about abuses of these \nauthorities, but I ask: Listen carefully. Chances are they are talking \nabout a section not involved here, and that is the section on national \nsecurity letters. Again, national security letters are not touched by \nthese three sections we are renewing today. And I would say, yes, they \nwere abused or misused in years past, according to the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Justice. But corrections have been made \nsince then. More important, for today's debate, there is nothing we are \ntaking up today that affects or mentions national security letters at \nall. I have referred to this now four times. I hope I get it across \nbecause that is what happened last time. People came to the floor and \nwhat they were talking about was not in the legislation we were \nconsidering.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to support legislation authored by \nSenator Leahy that would have made several improvements in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act in order to better protect privacy rights \nand civil liberties. But the point I made during the debate in the \nJudiciary Committee, which I will repeat again today, is that many of \nthese changes were in fact codifying practices the Department of \nJustice and the FBI have already implemented.\n  For example, minimization. That was one of the issues that was \ndiscussed. It has been implemented. The departments are listening and \nthey have taken action where there have been problems.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues that the Executive Branch has heard \nand has acted to address concerns about intrusions into Americans' \ncivil liberties. The Office of the Inspector General in the Department \nof Justice has indicated that it intends to conduct audits and \ninspections to ensure that the implementation of FISA is in full \ncompliance with the law, and its reports will be carefully reviewed by \nthis Congress and by the concerned Committees. A major priority of the \nIntelligence Committee in this house is to conduct regular oversight on \nthe use of FISA authorities, and we will continue to do so after \npassage of this legislation.\n  Just about every administration official to testify on the use of \nFISA authorities has also noted the importance of having the stability \nthat comes with a long-term extension. Since December of 2009, when we \nreauthorized it, the Congress has passed three short-term extensions--\none for 2 months, one for 1 year, and one for 3 months. By lurching \nfrom one sunset to another, we run the risk that these intelligence \nauthorities are going to expire. And here we are, once again, because \nthey expire this Friday. I hope Members will think about that. I hope \nMembers who want to produce an amendment will think about the \nfollowing: if they expire, what if NSA and other agencies have to stop, \nwhat if they miss something, what if something happens? That is a \nresponsibility that rests on the heads of everyone in these two \nbodies--both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United \nStates.\n  Even short of that, by providing one short-term extension after \nanother--2 months here, 1 year there--we create significant uncertainty \nin the Intelligence Community as investigators are not sure whether \nthese tools will continue to be available to them. I can tell you as \none who tries to read the intelligence rather assiduously, we are not \nout of harm's way, and no one should believe that. People are plotting \nevery day as to how they can send someone into the United States or \nconvince someone in the United States to attack this country. The only \nthing we have to prevent this from happening is intelligence and an FBI \nthat is now able to institute surveillance and tracking on possible \ntargets in this country.\n  We have come, in my judgment, a long way since 9/11, but we cannot \nleave this country vulnerable. We must keep our guard up, and we must \nsee that the intelligence mechanisms that are available to this country \nare able to be utilized.\n  This legislation now extends the use of these sunsetting authorities \nfor 4 years, to June 1, 2015. In view of the times we are living in, I \nbelieve this is appropriate, it is keeping with past practice, and it \nis vital to the protection of the United States of America.\n  The PATRIOT Act was enacted in October 2001, and several provisions \nwere up for review and reauthorization 4 years later in December of \n2005. After some significant debate, some of the original PATRIOT Act \nprovisions were made permanent and some were reauthorized for another 4 \nyears until the end of 2009.\n  The lone-wolf authority that expires later this week was first \nenacted in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 and placed in the same \nsunset cycle as the roving wiretap and business records authorities. \nUnder the model established in the PATRIOT Act and a subsequent \nreauthorization, a 4-year extension from the end of May 2011 to June \n2015 is based on sound congressional practice.\n  These issues have been debated and re-debated and should be very \nfamiliar to Members, especially those on the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees.\n  I hope we are now going to act in the best interests of protecting \nthe people of this country from another terrorist attack by passing \nthis legislation so our intelligence professionals can continue to keep \nthis Nation secure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, a joint meeting of \nCongress will welcome the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. \nIt will be the first time Mr. Netanyahu has addressed us in a joint \nmeeting and only the second time any Israeli Prime Minister has \naddressed a joint meeting of Congress as its sole participant. It is a \ndistinct and historic honor and an opportunity for us to hear again how \ncrucial is the friendship between our two countries.\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\n  In anticipation of this event, I rise today to provide for the record \na restatement of how I and I believe many--if not most--of my \ncolleagues regard the State of Israel and America's relationship with \nthat fellow democracy. This restatement is necessary, I believe, in \nlight of the President's speech last week regarding the Arab spring. \nThe President's remarks, which were delivered just before President \nNetanyahu's arrival in the United States, seriously muddied the waters \nof American policy toward Israel and its troubled region.\n  The Arab spring has sprung from new popular forces throughout the \nregion, overthrowing regimes that have lost their relevance to the \naspirations of their people and threatening to overthrow others.\n  The administration's response has been slow in coming, awkward and \nconfused in efforts to explain its policies, inconsistent in its \napplication from one part of the region to another, less than \ntransparent in keeping Congress informed, and, worst of all, \nineffective in its guidance and understanding of events.\n  The protests in the Middle East and northern Africa have justifiably \nstirred the emotions and aspirations of the Palestinian people as well. \nThey also seek a homeland of their own--secure, stable, and living at \npeace with their neighbors. I agree this must be among our goals.\n  Some believe the groundswell of newly vibrant popular aspirations \nthroughout the region and also among the Palestinian people is both an \nopportunity and a requirement for new, creative steps in the search for \npermanent peace. There may be an opportunity here that leads to \nprogress if we and the parties to this long-lasting dispute make the \nright choices, if we seek the right ends, and if we pursue them with \nthe right strategies. Unfortunately, the administration seems to \nmisunderstand the nature of this opportunity. In a speech last week \nregarding the wave of startling events in the Middle East and north \nAfrica, President Obama attempted to bring coherence and purpose to his \nadministration's policy. Instead, the speech brought more confusion, \npotentially jeopardizing prospects for successful negotiations with \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority.\n  In my opinion, it was a serious mistake for the President to \npreemptively declare U.S. support for a Palestinian state based on the \n1967 borders. President Obama's declaration that Israel must withdraw \nto the 1967 border lines is unprecedented and unwelcome. It is true \nthat previous administrations have referred to the 1967 lines in the \npast as a reference point in the negotiations. It is also true that the \nPalestinians regard the 1967 lines as their beginning negotiating \nposition. But even with the President's vague acknowledgment of the \nneed for land swaps, no U.S. administration has previously adopted the \nPalestinian position as its official policy until now. How can this \nhelp restart negotiations or drive those negotiations toward a \nsuccessful conclusion?\n  As Mr. Netanyahu made clear to the President in the Oval Office, a \nreturn to the 1967 lines is ``indefensible'' and ignores new realities \non the ground. This position was formally recognized by President Bush \nin 2004 and must now be reconfirmed by any realistic assessment of what \nsteps are possible and necessary. The object of negotiations is to \nreach a successful and durable conclusion. But ignoring core realities \ncannot possibly contribute to progress and almost certainly would make \nit more difficult to achieve the ends we all seek.\n  Another major concern I have following the President's speech is the \nreaction to the recent announcement by the Palestinians of a \nreconciliation agreement between the Fatah party of President Abbas and \nHamas, the organization in charge in Gaza. This alleged reconciliation \nis likely a product of the Arab spring and the conviction the \nPalestinian people need to unite to pursue their common goals. This is \nunderstandable, and it would be acceptable if not for the character of \none of the main factions to this reconciliation. Make no mistake about \nit, Hamas is a terrorist organization. This group denies Israel its \nright to exist, it fires thousands of rockets into Israeli territory \nand bemoans the death of bin Laden, one of its heroes.\n  If this announced reconciliation of these Palestinian groups actually \noccurs, the Palestinian Authority of President Abbas--to which the \nUnited States, by the way, provides considerable financial and \nhumanitarian support--that administration, that group--that \nreconciliation will have President Abbas and that group dancing with \nthe devil. It cannot, therefore, expect further support from us, nor \ncan it expect support or understanding in any negotiations with Israel \nintending to create a Palestinian state. Indeed, we must not require or \neven encourage Israel to resume negotiations with an entity that \nincludes terrorists. But how did the President address this in his \nspeech? He did not mention the word ``terrorist'' or provide any solid \nindication that negotiations with Hamas would be impossible. He did not \naffirm that American assistance to Palestinians, including Hamas, would \nbe off the table. He merely said that ``Palestinian leaders will have \nto provide a credible answer'' to these remaining questions.\n  The President also suggested in his speech that the Israelis and \nPalestinians should focus negotiations in a restarted peace process on \nthe issues of borders and security, leaving the highly contentious \nissues of Jerusalem and refugees for later. This type of step-by-step \nnegotiating has been rejected many times in the past, and for good \nreason. Land is Israel's main asset in negotiations. Even if it were \npossible to reach agreement on land and borders first, Israel would be \nleft in a far weaker position to negotiate the subsequent matters. The \nrefugee issue is perhaps the most difficult of all because acceptance \nof the Palestinian position would completely change the nature of \nIsrael as a Jewish state. Indeed, it is a fundamental survival issue \nthat cannot be addressed in isolation.\n  Finally, I am deeply concerned that the President's speech may be \nused by the Palestinians to support their campaign to bring a \nunilateral declaration of statehood from the United Nations General \nAssembly. A declaration of statehood to the U.N. is a dangerous step \nthat would preempt any new negotiations and make sure sufficient \nefforts are stillborn. If this strategy succeeds at the U.N. General \nAssembly this September, it will bring serious legal, political, \ndiplomatic, and practical negative consequences for both a real peace \nprocess and Israel itself. Let me restate that. If this strategy \nsucceeds at the U.N. General Assembly in September, it will bring \nserious legal, political, diplomatic, and practical negative \nconsequences for both a real peace process and for Israel itself.\n  The Palestinian Authority has already announced its intentions to \nchallenge Israeli interests in U.N.-related bodies, including the \nInternational Court. This tactic contradicts Palestinian claims that it \nseeks to bring new energy to the peace process. Peace will come through \nrealistic negotiations, not through unilateral preemptive action.\n  The President did say he opposes this Palestinian effort to isolate \nand delegitimize Israel at the U.N., and this was a welcome statement. \nBut supporting a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, speaking out \nagainst alleged reconciliation with the terrorist faction Hamas in only \nthe most ambiguous terms, and promoting a policy that deprives Israel \nof its strongest negotiating advantage will only encourage the \nPalestinian Authority to pursue its U.N. strategy.\n  These confusing, inconsistent messages from the administration will \nnot be enough to dissuade other U.N. member states from supporting the \nPalestinian maneuver. I fear the United States will then be forced to \nveto a resolution in the Security Council that our very own errors have \nhelped bring about. Then we will find ourselves in a minority in the \nGeneral Assembly and watch as the prospect of substantive negotiations \nbecome far more distant than before. Both we and our Israeli friends \ndeserve better than this.\n  Mr. President, this is not a statement of support for Israel only. It \nis true that we are united with Israel by permanent bonds of history, \nvalues, shared strategic interests, culture, and religious heritage, \nbut those bonds are also the principal reason we have for pursuing a \npeace that is durable and just for everyone in the region. That\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\npeace will serve the Palestinian people just as much as Jewish Israel. \nA secure homeland of their own, at peace, will be the result of real \nnegotiations based on shared understanding of what is possible. \nAmericans, the people of Israel, and the Palestinian people all have a \nshared common heritage in prophetic religions. Hopefully, prayerfully, \ntogether we can aspire to a common purpose to bring enduring peace to \nthe birthplace of that heritage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to do away \nwith a law that tramples on our constitutional rights, a law that \ninvades the privacy of law-abiding Montanans and Americans, a law that \ndeprives Americans of some of our most basic constitutional \nprotections. This week, we are voting on whether to extend the USA \nPATRIOT Act 4 more years as is. There is a chance we may not have an \nopportunity to change it even though we know our freedoms have been \ncompromised. That is a shame because without that possibility, we are \nnot having the debate the American people deserve. If our only choice \nis to vote yes or no, I am going to vote no.\n  Long before I ever got to the Senate, the PATRIOT Act was sold to us \nas a toolbox of sorts to give U.S. agents the tools they need to find \nand fight and kill terrorists. But what we got from the PATRIOT Act was \na law that is killing the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. It \ngives our government full authority to dig through our private records \nor tap our phones or make a case against us without even having a \njudge's warrant even if we are doing nothing wrong.\n  When we give up our rights, we give way to exactly what the \nterrorists wanted for us--fewer freedoms and invasion of privacy. It is \nnot acceptable in Montana, and I am sure it is not acceptable anywhere \nelse. More than 200 years ago, one of our Founders in this country \nwarned us with this statement:\n\n       Those who give up essential liberty to purchase a little \n     temporary safety . . . deserve neither liberty nor safety.\n\n  Words of wisdom from Benjamin Franklin.\n  Our Nation was founded on the principles of freedom and privacy and a \ngovernment we control, and we got exactly the opposite with the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Mr. President, here is a copy of the Constitution. It is a reminder \nof our rights as Americans, guaranteed by the fourth amendment:\n\n       The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, \n     papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures, shall not be violated.\n\n  The folks who wrote the PATRIOT Act were here in Washington long \nbefore I ever thought about running for the Senate, but you don't have \nto be a lawyer to know the PATRIOT Act flies in the face of the fourth \namendment. It allows the government to conduct secret proceedings even \nwhen those proceedings don't need to be held in secret. If we allow \nthat to happen, we toss government transparency and accountability out \nthe window.\n  As we have seen over the past few weeks, our military forces and \nintelligence agents are the most effective in the world. They are the \nbest because they have the most powerful tools in the world to do their \njobs. They are better trained than anyone else, they are stronger and \nsmarter, and they do what they do without needing to snoop around into \nthe private lives of law-abiding Americans and Montanans, without \nhaving to dig up our medical records or our gun records or our library \nrecords or our Internet records.\n  The PATRIOT Act is bad policy that has put us on a very slippery \nslope. Our constitutional freedoms are too valuable to give even an \ninch of them away, especially when we don't need to.\n  Without the opportunity to make real changes to this bill, our only \noption is to say yes or no to extend this law 4 more years. If we do, \nan entire decade will have passed without the opportunity to make any \nadjustments. Not having the opportunity to amend the PATRIOT Act, I am \ngoing to vote against it in the name of freedom and privacy, and I urge \nall my colleagues to do the same because it is the responsible way to \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we find ourselves again in the situation \nof extending key provisions of the PATRIOT Act. These three provisions \nare roving wiretaps, section 215 business record orders, and the lone \nwolf provisions. These are all very important tools used to investigate \nand prevent terrorist attacks. They have been reauthorized a number of \ntimes, but it seems that in recent years we have been discussing only \nvery short term extensions of these critical tools.\n  That is why I will support the cloture motion on moving to S. 1038 \ntoday. This legislation provides a 4-year extension of the three \nexpiring provisions without any substantive changes to the existing \nauthorities, and I believe there do not need to be changes to existing \nauthorities.\n  Regardless of my support for today's cloture vote, and support for \nthe 4-year extension, I wish my colleagues to know that I support a \npermanent extension of the three expiring provisions. Having this \ndebate year after year offers little certainty to agents utilizing \nthese provisions to combat terrorism. It also leads to operational \nuncertainty, jeopardizes collection of critical intelligence, and could \nlead to compliance and reporting problems if the reauthorization occurs \ntoo close to the expiration of the law, and we are getting very close \nto that.\n  If we believe these tools are necessary--and I clearly stated I \nbelieve they are necessary--we need to provide some certainty as \nopposed to simply revisiting the law year after year. Given the \nindefinite threat we face from acts of terrorism, it is my view that we \nshould permanently reauthorize these three expiring provisions.\n  This position is supported by agents on the ground using these tools \nevery day. I have letters of support from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation Agents Association supporting a permanent reauthorization \nof the three expiring provisions. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation also supports a permanent extension of the provisions. In \nfact, a very important passage of that letter states:\n\n       Crimes and terrorism will not sunset and are still \n     targeting our nation and American citizens. Just like \n     handcuffs, the PATRIOT Act should be a permanent part of the \n     law enforcement arsenal.\n\n  Then we have another letter from the Society of Former Special Agents \nof the FBI, and that letter says:\n\n       We urge Congress to reauthorize the expiring provisions of \n     the PATRIOT Act permanently and without restrictions as the \n     three expiring provisions are essential to the security of \n     our country.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n                                           Agents Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, April 4, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the FBI Agents Association \n     (``FBIAA''), I write to submit our views on the importance of \n     permanently reauthorizing three provisions of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act (``PATRIOT Act'') that are set to expire on May 28, 2011. \n     The FBIAA is comprised of over 12,000 active duty and retired \n     Agents nationwide and is the only professional association \n     dedicated to advancing goals of FBI Agents. On their behalf, \n     we urge the Senate to act now to permanently reauthorize \n     these critical criminal investigation and counterterrorism \n     tools without new restrictions.\n       We also respectfully request that the Senate limit its \n     debate and consideration to the\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n     expiring PATRIOT Act provisions. Introducing new issues at \n     this time could unnecessarily impede progress toward \n     reauthorizing these important national security provisions, \n     potentially leading to their expiration. Given that there \n     appears to be bipartisan and bicameral consensus for \n     reauthorization of the provisions in their current form for \n     some time, expiration is easily avoidable.\n\n    The Three Expiring PATRIOT Act Provisions Should Be Permanently \n                 Reauthorized Without New Restrictions\n\n       Since 9-11, federal law enforcement officers have \n     effectively and properly used three tools provided for in the \n     PATRIOT Act and related laws: the ``business records'' \n     provision: the ``roving wiretap'' provision: and the ``lone \n     wolf'' surveillance provision. These provisions were \n     developed and adopted in response to the 9-11 terrorist \n     attacks. Placing new restrictions and requirements on them \n     now, after ten years of using and relying on these tools, is \n     antithetical to our primary post-9-11 national security \n     goal--giving federal law enforcement officers greater tools \n     and more authority to detect and thwart terrorist attacks.\n\n\n                            Business Records\n\n       The ``business records'' provision, Sec. 215 of the PATRIOT \n     Act, allows criminal investigators to apply to the U.S. \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (``FISA Court'') \n     for an order requiring the production of business records \n     related to foreign intelligence operations or an \n     investigation of international terrorism. However, no such \n     order can be issued if it concerns an investigation of a U.S. \n     person based solely on that person's exercise of his or her \n     First Amendment rights.\n       This provision is used in specific and rare circumstances. \n     As described by the Congressional Research Service, the \n     business records tool has bee used ``sparingly and never to \n     acquire library, bookstores, medical or gun sale records.'' \n     Despite infrequent use, the ability to access important bank \n     and telephone records early in investigations is critical for \n     criminal investigators, and leaders in the Department of \n     Justice and FBI have called the business records provision a \n     ``vital tool in the war on terror.''\n       Given that the provision has been used carefully and \n     effectively in investigations of terrorist threats, the FBIAA \n     recommends that Congress reauthorize the provision on a \n     permanent basis without new limitations on its use.\n\n\n                            Roving Wiretaps\n\n       The ``roving wiretap'' provision, Sec. 206 of the PATRIOT \n     Act, allows the FISA Court to issue wiretap orders that are \n     not linked to specific phones or computers if the target of \n     the surveillance has demonstrated an intent to evade \n     surveillance.\n       The ability to obtain orders for roving wiretaps is \n     absolutely essential to contemporary criminal and \n     counterterrorism investigations because criminal networks \n     have become technologically advanced and will often purchase \n     and use many different mobile phones and computers in order \n     to evade wiretap efforts. Law enforcement experts have \n     described the roving wiretap provision as a ``very critical \n     measure'' that has likely helped detect and prevent numerous \n     terrorist plots, including the plots to bomb multiple \n     synagogues in New York City.\n       The FBIAA urges Congress to permanently reauthorize the \n     roving wiretap authority and not subjected it to further \n     restrictions. The roving wiretap provision is already \n     constrained by the requirements that the FISA Court find \n     probable cause that the target intends to evade surveillance \n     to issue a wiretap and that minimization procedures are \n     followed regarding the collection, retention, and \n     dissemination of information about U.S. persons. A failure to \n     reauthorize the roving wiretap provision, or encumbering the \n     provision with unnecessary restrictions, would jeopardize the \n     utility of an important investigative tool and could, as \n     Director Mueller has warned, open up a ``gap in the law that \n     . . . sophisticated terrorists or spies could easily \n     exploit.''\n\n\n                         Lone Wolf Surveillance\n\n       The ``lone wolf'' provision, found in Section 6001 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, \n     allows the FISA Court to issue surveillance orders targeted \n     at non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or \n     activities in preparation of terrorism. Prior to enactment of \n     the lone wolf provision, the FISA Court could only issue \n     surveillance orders if specific evidence linked the targeted \n     person to a foreign power or entity. This meant that non-U.S. \n     individuals acting alone could not be effectively \n     investigated, even if evidence indicated that they were \n     preparing to engage in international terrorism.\n       The FBIAA recommends that Congress permanently reauthorize \n     the lone wolf provision because it is a necessary part of \n     combating contemporary terrorist threats. Communication \n     between individual terrorists and foreign governments and/or \n     entities is often very scarce, precisely because these groups \n     are seeking to evade detection by law enforcement. The lone \n     wolf provision gives law enforcement an important tool to \n     obtain the information necessary to ensure that threats are \n     thwarted before terrorists can act on their plans. Congress \n     should not allow this provision to expire, or place \n     additional restrictions on the provision, as such actions \n     could make it more difficult to investigate and prevent \n     dangerous terrorist threats. Recent developments in the \n     evolution of the threat of ``homegrown terrorism'' have only \n     served to underscore the necessity of maintaining this \n     provision under current law.\n\nEfforts To Add New Requirements to the Expiring Provisions and National \n               Security Letters (NSLs) Should Be Rejected\n\n       The FBIAA is concerned that the much-needed reauthorization \n     of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions may fall prey to a \n     larger debate over NSLs and new limitations on the ways that \n     these investigative tools can be used. We are aware that \n     concerns about NSLs and PATRIOT Act provisions have been used \n     by some to fuel skepticism about privacy protection. To be \n     clear, Agents undergo extensive training regarding the use of \n     these tools, and we are confident that Special Agents use \n     them to help protect the public from terrorist and criminal \n     threats.\n       Regardless of one's position on new restrictions, it is \n     clear that including them in the reauthorization debate could \n     make it almost impossible for Congress to act before May 28, \n     2011. Allowing these provisions to expire should not be an \n     option. Terrorists will not wait patiently for Congress to \n     re-adopt provisions like these before advancing their efforts \n     to harm our country. Investigators should not have their \n     hands tied when Congress could easily meet the \n     reauthorization deadline in a bipartisan and bicameral \n     fashion.\n       Moreover, Congress should not rush to codify limitations \n     and new procedural requirements without carefully considering \n     the implications of specific legislative language on national \n     security matters and ongoing investigations. Simply including \n     these changes in the reauthorization effort is inconsistent \n     with a robust consideration process.\n       The FBIAA appreciates your leadership on these issues and \n     consideration of these comments. We urge Congress to \n     reauthorize the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act \n     permanently and without new restrictions. FBI Agents work \n     diligently to detect, investigate, and apprehend individuals \n     and groups that are engaged in a constant and evolving effort \n     to craft and execute plots against the United States and its \n     citizens. The three expiring provisions are essential in our \n     fight against terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Konrad Motyka,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                                    March 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As you \n     know, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association \n     (FLEOA) is the largest non-partisan, non-profit law \n     enforcement association and represents 26,000 federal law \n     enforcement officers from 65 federal agencies. In light of \n     tomorrow's scheduled Executive Business Meeting, we are \n     writing to provide you with our views regarding \n     reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n       To date, many recently thwarted terrorist and criminal \n     plots can be directly attributed to provisions within the USA \n     PATRIOT ACT. The ACT offers federal law enforcement officers \n     the tools to stay ahead of violent criminals and better \n     protect the American citizenry from threats.\n       FLEOA sees this ACT as a crucial tool for law enforcement, \n     and not something that should periodically expire. The work \n     of federal law enforcement officers has only been enhanced by \n     the USA PATRIOT ACT.\n       Provisions dealing with:\n       1) Online Surveillance\n       2) Roving Wiretaps and Pen Resisters\n       3) Issuance of John Doe Warrants\n       4) Accessing financial records and documents\n       5) Records related to books and magazine purchases\n       6) Issuance of National Security Letters\n       In light of today's threats, the provisions listed above \n     are tools that help thwart terrorists and criminals that use \n     identity theft, the internet, cellular and satellite phones, \n     phishing schemes, social networking and wire transfers to \n     effect their crimes.\n       FLEOA has the distinct honor of representing the interests \n     of law enforcement officers from the Department of Justice, \n     Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, \n     Department of Defense, Department of Treasury, and a host of \n     other agencies. These officers are the front-line guardians \n     that protect our nation from terrorist and criminal threats.\n       They are the ones that have used the provisions in the USA \n     PATRIOT ACT to keep Americans safe under the microscope of \n     strict agency and judicial oversight that has yet to be cited \n     as ``excessive'' by any investigation or Inspector General's \n     office.\n       We would caution the Congress to be careful when trying to \n     re-work any provisions that have already been in effect and \n     have been effective.\n       Additionally, the short-term authorization is at odds with \n     a Congress that in the aftermath of the September 11th, 2001 \n     attacks asked ``Why didn't we know and connect the dots?''\n       The USA PATRIOT ACT removed some of the barriers in place \n     that prevented us from ``connecting the dots'' and any \n     retraction of\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\n     those provisions is in effect, ``re-building the wall.''\n       Crime and terrorism will not ``sunset'' and are still \n     targeting our nation and American citizens. Just like \n     handcuffs, this tool should be a permanent part of the law \n     enforcement arsenal and arguments to the contrary are flawed \n     and do not recognize the reality that the ACT has worked.\n       In this nation, law enforcement is guided by an ethos to \n     act ``beyond reproach'' and Office of Inspector General's \n     offices ensure that is the case.\n       FLEOA greatly appreciates Congress' willingness to continue \n     this important national security tool and would caution you \n     not to put it ``back behind the wall'' and is willing to work \n     with Congress as any proposed legislation moves through it.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                         J. Adler,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of \n           Investigation, Inc.,\n                                     Dumfries, VA, April 14, 2011.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 8000 members of \n     the Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, Inc. (Society), I am writing to inform you of \n     our views on the importance of permanently reauthorizing the \n     three provisions of the USA Patriot Act that are going to \n     expire on May 28, 2011.\n       The Society was established in 1937 as a fraternal, \n     educational, and community-minded organization to preserve \n     the FBI heritage in a spirit of friendship, loyalty, and \n     goodwill. As former and current Special Agents of the FBI, \n     our members are experienced in conducting sensitive criminal \n     and terrorism investigations and are concerned that any \n     changes to the Patriot Act that would make it more difficult \n     for the FBI to fulfill its vital mission of protecting our \n     great country.\n       In addition, the Society is concerned with the introduction \n     of new issues that could impede progress in reauthorizing \n     these important national security provisions. In view of the \n     bipartisan consensus for the reauthorization of these \n     provisions, we hope that their expiration can be avoided.\n       Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Federal law \n     enforcement agencies have effectively utilized three sections \n     of the Patriot Act, namely: the business records provision, \n     the roving wiretap provision and the lone wolf surveillance \n     provision. These sections of the Patriot Act were adopted in \n     direct response to the September 11th attacks and to place \n     new restrictions and requirements on these sections of the \n     Act would be detrimental to Federal law enforcement efforts \n     to detect and prevent future terrorist attacks.\n       The business records provision, Section 215 of the Patriot \n     Act, allows investigators to apply to the U.S. Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) for an order \n     requiring the production of business records related to \n     foreign intelligence operations or investigations of \n     international terrorism. This provision is utilized in \n     specific and rare circumstances. However, despite the \n     infrequent use of the provision, the ability to access \n     important records early in an investigation is critical. The \n     Society strongly encourages Congress to reauthorize this \n     provision on a permanent basis without limitations.\n       The roving wiretap provision, Section 206 of the Patriot \n     Act, allows the FISA Court to issue wiretap authorizations \n     that are not linked to specific telephones or computers if \n     the subject of the surveillance demonstrates an intent to \n     evade the surveillance. It is absolutely essential to provide \n     this ability to investigators due to the advanced technology \n     employed by criminal and terrorism networks and conspirators. \n     The failure to reauthorize this provision of the Patriot Act \n     or encumber the provision with restrictions would jeopardize \n     the importance of this valuable investigative tool.\n       The lone wolf provision, Section 6001 of the Intelligence \n     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, provides the \n     FISA Court with the authority to approve surveillance of non-\n     U.S. persons acting alone or not linked to a foreign entity \n     who are engaged in international terrorism or activities in \n     preparation of terrorist acts. The lone wolf provision \n     provides law enforcement with an important tool to obtain \n     necessary information to prevent dangerous terrorist acts \n     from occurring. The Society strongly encourages Congress not \n     to allow this provision to expire or place restrictions on \n     the provision that would weaken this vital investigative \n     tool.\n       The Society respects and appreciates your leadership on \n     these important issues. As former and current Special Agents \n     of the FBI, our members are very concerned with any changes \n     to the Patriot Act that would make it more difficult for the \n     FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate \n     terrorists and their threats to our nation. We urge Congress \n     to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act \n     permanently and without restrictions as the three expiring \n     provisions are essential to the security of our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lester A. Davis,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in addition to agents on the ground, we \nhave heard strong support for extending the expiring provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act from members of the Bush and Obama administrations. We have \nheard testimony from the Director of the FBI, the Attorney General, and \nthe Director of National Intelligence about the strong need to \nreauthorize these provisions. These same offices have recommended \nextending the provisions regardless of political ideology as both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations have backed the extensions.\n  The 4-year extension we are voting on today is a step in the right \ndirection. Extending the three expiring provisions without any \nsubstantive amendment that would restrict or curtail the use of these \ntools is very important, given the recent actions that led to the death \nof Osama bin Laden. Now is not the time to place new restrictions and \nheighten evidentiary standards on critical national security tools.\n  A lot has been said about these provisions and, unfortunately, most \nof what has been said is incorrect. Congress enacted these provisions \nand reauthorized them in 2005 following the 9/11 Commission Report, \nwhich criticized the way our agents failed to piece together clues; in \nother words, to connect the dots. Since that time, the three expiring \nprovisions have provided a great deal of information to agents who have \nhelped thwart terrorist attacks.\n  Let's be very basic. What is terrorism about? It is about killing \npeople living in Western Europe and North America. They don't like us, \nthey want to kill us, and we have to prevent that. They can make \ncontinuous mistakes and not get their job done, but once the FBI makes \na mistake and lets one of them get away it is a victory for the \nopposition. We can't afford a failure.\n  Examples along the lines that we can't have these failures: In \ntestimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security, Robert Litt, the general counsel of \nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, testified that a \nsection 215 order was used as part of the investigation by the FBI into \nKhalid Aldawasare, who was arrested in Texas recently. It was later \nrevealed in a criminal case that he was purchasing explosive chemicals \nand bombmaking components online and had scouted targets in Texas.\n  Mr. Litt also testified that section 215 orders were utilized to \nobtain hotel records in the case where a suspected spy had arranged \nlodging for intelligence officers. He also discussed the roving wiretap \nprovision and how it is used to help agents track foreign agents \noperating inside the United States who switch cellular phones \nfrequently to avoid being caught. These examples are limited not \nbecause the authorities aren't valuable, but because of how sensitive \nthe investigations are that utilize these authorities.\n  While the need for keeping personal and national security matters \nclassified may prevent the open discussion of further examples in this \nsetting--on the floor of the Senate--it is important to note that these \nprovisions are constantly under strict scrutiny by the inspector \ngeneral at the Department of Justice and by congressional oversight. In \nfact, in a March 2008 report, the Justice Department inspector general \nexamined the FBI's use of section 215 orders and found: ``We did not \nidentify any illegal use of section 215 authority.'' Further, there are \nno reported abuses of the roving surveillance authority, and the lone \nwolf provision has not yet been utilized, so it is without abuse as \nwell.\n  While I agree these three provisions should be subject to strict \nscrutiny from inspectors general and Congress, that oversight authority \nalready exists in the law and does not require amendments to these \ntools to achieve the goal of oversight. As such, it is important that \nCongress reauthorize these provisions quickly and without amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1038 because it provides a clean \nreauthorization of these very vital tools for 4 years without \nsubstantive changes. In other words, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \nWhile 4 years is a far cry from the permanence that I believe is \nnecessary on these provisions, it does provide more certainty and \npredictability than continuing to pass short-term extension after \nextension.\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion of the \nPATRIOT Act, and we are told basically that we wouldn't be able to \ncapture these terrorists if we didn't give up some of our liberties, if \nwe didn't give up some of the fourth amendment and allow it to be \neasier for the police to come into our homes. We were so frightened \nafter 9/11 that we readily gave up these freedoms.\n  We said: Well, the fourth amendment is not that important. We will \njust let the government look at all of our records, and we will make it \neasier for the government to look at our records.\n  The question we have to ask, though, is whether we would still be \nable to catch terrorists by using the fourth amendment as it was \nintended and having the protections of the fourth amendment. What we \nhave to ask ourselves is, think about the worst person in our \ncommunities. Think about someone accused of murder or rape or a \npedophile. We think of these people, and do we know what happens if \nsomeone is accused of that? Even if it is 3 o'clock in the morning and \nthey want to get their records or they want to go into their houses, \nthey call a judge. This is something very important. They get the \nwarrants almost all the time. But it is one step of protection. What we \nhave is the protection where we don't have police officers writing \nwarrants to come into our houses. They have to have it reviewed by a \njudge.\n  What we have done through the PATRIOT Act is taken away some of the \nprotections of the fourth amendment. The fourth amendment says we need \nto name the person and the place to be searched. We have taken away \nthose protections. The fourth amendment says we need to have probable \ncause. We have taken that away and made it to, if it is relevant, or we \nthink they might be related to it.\n  Originally, the FISA Court lowered the standards somewhat on the \nfourth amendment, but it recognized that it was lowering the standard \nand was careful. We had secret courts set up, and the FISA Court was \nthe court that dealt with things that had to do with national security \nor terrorism or intelligence. The information was kept secret so we \ndidn't let everybody in the world know the name, but the name had to be \ndivulged to the judges. Well, those who argue that we have to have the \nPATRIOT Act, or we have to do this or we will not be able to stop \nterrorism, they need to explain why the FISA Court did tens of \nthousands of search warrants and never turned any down. In fact, the \nhistory before the PATRIOT Act was no search warrant had ever been \nturned down.\n  So do we want to give up our liberties in exchange for more security? \nFranklin said those who give up their liberty in exchange for security \nmay end up with neither.\n  Right now, if someone has a Visa bill that is over $5,000 and chooses \nto pay for it over the phone, which is a wire transfer, the government \nis probably looking at their Visa bill. They don't have to show \nprobable cause, and they don't have to have a judge's warrant. This \ndoes apply to U.S. citizens. Often they will tell us: Oh, it is only \nforeign terrorists we are looking at. They want us to feel good about \nallowing them to spy. But this spying is going on by the tens of \nthousands and even by the millions.\n  With regard to these suspicious activity reports, we have done over 4 \nmillion of them in the last 10 years. We are now doing over 1 million a \nyear. These suspicious activity reports, all the trigger is--it doesn't \nhave to have anything to do with terrorism. The trigger is just that \nsomeone has over $5,000 that they have transferred by bank account.\n  We say, well, the courts have decided our bank records aren't \nprivate. Well, the hell they aren't. They should be private. If someone \nlooks at my Visa records, they can tell whether I go to the doctor and \nwhat kind of doctor I go to. They can conceivably tell what kind of \nmedication I am on. They can tell what kind of magazines I read. They \ncan tell what kind of books I order from Amazon. Do we want a \ngovernment that looks at our Visa bill? Do we want a government that \nlooks at all of our records and is finding out what our reading habits \nare?\n  One of the provisions applies to library records. Do we really want \nthe government to go and find out what we are reading at the library?\n  We now have a President who is wanting to know where a person has \ncontributed before they do work for the government. Do we really want \nthat kind of all-encompassing government that is looking at every \nrecord from top to bottom and invading our privacy?\n  There is another aspect of these so-called national security letters. \nThese are basically warrants that are written by FBI agents. No judge \nreviews them. This is specifically what James Otis was worried about \nwhen he talked about general warrants that weren't specifying the \nperson or the place and that were written by police officers. This is a \nproblem because this is--we depend on the checks and balances in our \nsociety. We never want to give all of the authority to either one group \nof Congress or to the President or to police or judges. We have checks \nand balances to try to prevent abuse.\n  Some have said, well, if one has nothing to hide, why do you care? \nThe thing is, it will not always be angels who are in charge of \ngovernment. We have rules because we want to prevent the day that may \noccur when we get somebody who takes over our government through \nelected office or otherwise who is intent on using the tools of \ngovernment to pry into our affairs, to snoop on what we are doing, to \npunish us for our political or religious beliefs. That is what we don't \never want: to let the law become so expansive.\n  We have to realize we can still get terrorists. We get rapists and \nmurderers every day by calling a judge.\n  That is what I am asking for. I am asking that we go through and obey \nthe fourth amendment. Many conservatives have argued that, well, they \nlove the second amendment. Some liberals say, well, they love and will \nprotect the first amendment. Do you know what. If we do not protect the \nentire bill of rights, we are not going to have any of it. If we want \nto protect our right to own a gun, we need to protect our gun records \nfrom the government looking at our gun records and finding out whether \nwe have been buying a gun at a gun show.\n  We need to protect our privacy. If we want to protect the first \namendment, we have to have the fourth amendment. In fact, we \nspecifically had to go back there. The original PATRIOT Act said we \ncould not even consult with our attorneys. We could not even tell our \nattorneys. We were gagged from telling our attorneys.\n  Even now, though, one may say: I do not know if they have \ninvestigated me. Do you know why? Because they tell our phone company, \nif they are looking at our phone records right now or our Visa records, \nit is against the law for Visa or the phone company to tell us that. It \nis hundreds of thousands of dollars of fines and jail time. It is 5 \nyears in jail if our phone company tells us they have been spying on \nus.\n  Some of this does not even require a letter from government. Some of \nit is done by the banks. The suspicious activity reports, we have \nsimply told the bank: Here, anybody who deals in cash, anybody who has \nover a $5,000 wire transfer or who deals in large amounts of money--it \nis incumbent upon the bank to spy on their customers now.\n  This is a real problem, and I think we need to have some argument and \ndebate in our country over these things. Some want to have these things \npermanently. They want to permanently give up their fourth amendment \nprotections, and I disagree strongly. Not only would I let these \nexpire, but I think we should sunset the entire PATRIOT Act and protect \nour liberties as intended by our Founding Fathers.\n  James Otis was an attorney in Boston, and he wrote about these things \nthey called, in those days, writs of assistance. These were general \nwarrants. The king would write them--or actually they were written by \nsoldiers here. They did not name the person to be searched or the \nplace, and they were used as a way to have the king have his way with \nthe people and to bully the people.\n  The idea of general warrants is what sorely offended our Founding \nFathers. That is why we got the fourth amendment. The fourth amendment \nwas a product of a decade or more of James Otis arguing cases against \nthe British Government.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\n  But the question we have to ask ourselves when thinking about these \nissues is, is it so simple that we can just say: Well, I am either \nagainst terrorism or I am going to let terrorists run wild and take \nover the country. One can be opposed to terrorists. We can go after \nterrorists. We can go after murderers and rapists and people who commit \ncrimes. But we can do it with a process that protects the innocent.\n  I think so far they say we have looked at 28 million electronic \nrecords. We have looked at 1,600,000 text messages. We have 800,000 \nhours of audio. We have so much audio they do not even listen to it \nall. Twenty-five percent of what they have recorded of our phone \nconversations is not listened to because they do not even have time to \nlisten to it.\n  My point would be that we are eavesdropping on so many people it \ncould be we are missing out and not targeting. Just like at airports--\nevery one of us is being searched in the airport. We are not \nterrorists, and we are no threat to our country. Why are we not looking \nfor people who would attack us and spending time on those people? Why \ndo we not go to a judge and say: This person we suspect of dealing with \nthis terrorist group. Will you give us a warrant?\n  Why don't we have those steps? Instead, we are mining and going \nthrough millions of records. I think we are overwhelmed with the \nrecords that we may well be doing less of a good job with terrorism \nbecause we are looking at everyone's records.\n  The bottom line is, I do not want to live in a country where we give \nup our freedoms, our privacy. I do not want to live in a country that \nloses its constitutional protections of us as individuals. We do have a \nright to privacy. We have a right not to have the government reading \nour Visa bills every month. We do have rights, and we should protect \nthem. We should not be so fearful that we say: Well, I am a good \nperson. I don't care, just look at my records. If we do, we are setting \nourselves up for a day when there will be a tyranny, when there will be \na despot who comes into power in the United States and who uses those \nrules for which we said: Oh, well, I don't have anything to hide.\n  What happens when someone takes over who believes one's religion is \nto be combatted, who believes one's political beliefs and literature \nshould be combated? What happens when that day comes?\n  We cannot give up our liberty. If we do, if we give up our liberty \nand we trade it for security, we will have neither.\n  So I rise in opposition to the cloture motion. I will be offering \namendments to the PATRIOT Act this week, and we will be having a real \ndebate about how we can stop terrorism but also preserve freedom at the \nsame time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of invoking cloture \non the motion to proceed to S. 1038, the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act \nof 2011.\n  In 4 days, on May 27, three FISA provisions--the lone wolf, roving \nwiretap, and section 215 business records authorities--will expire \nunless Congress acts to reauthorize them.\n  The House has been working on a bill, H.R. 1800, that would make the \nlone wolf provision permanent and extend the other two provisions until \nDecember 2017. Senators Feinstein and Leahy have sponsored bills that \nwould, among other things, extend all three provisions until December \n2013.\n  It seems to me that S. 1038, with its extension of the three sunsets \nuntil June 1, 2015, is a reasonable compromise. Although I believe each \none of these tools should be made permanent, this bill will ensure that \nour intelligence professionals have the tools they need to keep our \nNation safe.\n  There is little disagreement that these provisions should and must be \nreauthorized. FBI Director Robert Mueller has testified repeatedly that \neach one of these provisions is important to both national security as \nwell as criminal investigations. But their importance does not end \nthere. Because of enhanced information-sharing rules and procedures \nother parts of the intelligence community, such as the National \nCounterterrorism Center and the National Counterproliferation Center, \noften depend on the information collected under these provisions. \nLosing or changing these authorities could adversely impact the \nintelligence community's ability to analyze and share important \nnational intelligence information.\n  According to Director Mueller, with all the new technology, it is \neasy for a terrorist target to buy four or five cell phones, use them \nin quick succession, and then dump them to avoid being intercepted. He \nhas testified that the ability to track terrorists when they do this is \n``tremendously important.'' I could not agree more because it is pretty \nobvious those guys are up to something, and it is not good. Our enemies \noften know our own laws better than we do. They understand the hoops \nand hurdles the government must clear to catch up to or stay ahead of \nthem.\n  Keep in mind the FBI cannot use a roving wiretap until a court finds \nprobable cause to believe the target is an agent of a foreign power. \nSome critics claim the provision allows the FBI to avoid meeting \nprobable cause as surveillance moves from phone to phone. This claim is \nsimply not accurate, as every roving wiretap must be approved by a FISA \nCourt judge.\n  If a target changes their cell phone and the FBI moves to surveil the \nnew phone, the court is notified of that change. All of the protections \nfor U.S. person information that apply to any other FISA wiretap also \napply to roving wiretaps.\n  In short, while this authority is a tremendous asset for the FBI and \nhas been used 140 times over the past 5 years, it poses no additional \ncivil liberties concerns, and it should be renewed without delay.\n  With regard to section 215, the Business Records Act, over the past \nseveral years the rallying cry against the PATRIOT Act has centered on \nsection 215 FISA business records authority. Section 215 allows the FBI \nto seek FISA Court authority to obtain business records, such as hotel \ninformation or travel records. As with each one of the expiring \nprovisions, the FBI must meet the statutory standard of proof.\n  The inspector general from the Department of Justice conducted \nseveral audits of the FBI's use of section 215 orders and found no \nabuses of the authority. Director Mueller testified that the business \nrecords sought by the FBI in terrorism investigations are ``absolutely \nessential to identifying other persons who may be involved in terrorist \nactivities.''\n  The lone wolf provision: The sole expiring provision under the \nPATRIOT Act that has not been used by the FBI, prompting some critics \nto demand its repeal, is the lone wolf definition of an agent of a \nforeign power. Recent events have demonstrated that self-radicalizing \nindividuals with no clear affiliation to existing terrorist groups are \na growing threat to national security. The lone wolf provision provides \na counter to that threat, at least in the cases of a non-U.S. person \nwho is not readily identifiable with a particular foreign power.\n  The lone wolf provision is a necessary tool that will only need to be \nused in limited circumstances. It is kind of like those ``in case of \nemergency break glass'' boxes that cover certain fire alarms and \nequipment. While we may not use it too much, we will certainly wish we \nhad it when the right situation comes up.\n  In conclusion, I am grateful for the leadership of Senators Reid and \nMcConnell on this crucial piece of legislation. This bill will ensure \nthat our intelligence and law enforcement professionals can continue \ndoing what they do best, without any additional restrictions.\n  Our Nation has been fortunate to have not suffered a sequel to the 9/\n11 attacks, and much of the credit goes to the dedicated work of our \nintelligence and law enforcement professionals. We owe them not only \nour thanks but the recognition that their jobs are as difficult as it \nis, and we should not be taking any steps that will make their \nresponsibility to protect this country any more difficult.\n  Mr. President, I urge a vote in support of invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I unfortunately experienced a travel delay \non my way back to Washington this evening and was unable to make \ntonight's procedural vote on whether to reauthorize a portion of the \nPATRIOT Act. My plane was late, and the Senate had to close the vote at \n6 to ensure that 30 hours of postcloture time expires by midnight \ntomorrow night. Keeping to this schedule is important since three \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act are scheduled to expire later this \nweek.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.'' I would thus ask to \nlet the Record reflect that I would have voted ``yea'' on Recorded Vote \nNo. 75.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor \nfor the second time because I am highly concerned.\n  For the last 31 years, I have been running a manufacturing business \nin Oshkosh, WI. During all of that time, I have been a very careful \nobserver about what has been happening here in Washington. I have been \nwatching how broken and unworkable our government has become. I have \nbeen here now for 4\\1/2\\ months. Nothing I have seen has changed my \nmind. Our political process here in Washington is broken.\n  So here is my specific concern: There seems to be a growing \nassumption in this town that eventually--probably at the very last \nminute--some kind of grand bargain is going to be struck and we will \nactually increase the debt ceiling limit. That would be great. It will \nbe absolutely great if that would happen--if the administration would \nget serious and work with Republicans to actually address the serious \nfiscal issues that face this Nation. But I am not so sure we can count \non that.\n  The fact is the Democrat-controlled Senate has not passed a budget \nfor 754 days. I don't believe we need any further evidence that our \nbudget process in this Chamber is broken. So, in my mind, not raising \nthe debt ceiling is a very real possibility. I am afraid this \nadministration is totally ignoring that possibility. It appears it has \nabsolutely no plan B. It has no contingency plan.\n  As I mentioned, I have been running a business for the last 31 years. \nWhen you run a business, things often do not go according to plan. \nEvery day, millions of American businessmen and businesswomen try to \nanticipate the problems on the horizon. They develop contingency plans \nin case those problems arise. That is what responsible leaders do. \nGovernment should be no different.\n  But instead of being responsible, this administration seems to be \nmaking a concerted effort to scare the American public and scare the \nmarkets in a very transparent attempt to force Republicans in Congress \nto increase the debt ceiling without enacting the structural budget and \nspending reforms we need to make to prevent this Nation from going \nbankrupt. Instead of scaring the markets, the administration should be \nseeking to calm the markets by developing a contingency plan just in \ncase\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\nthe debt ceiling is not increased in time. That would be the prudent \nthing to do. That would be the responsible thing to do.\n  So, today, I am calling on President Obama to begin planning ahead so \nthat failure to raise the debt ceiling does not immediately turn into a \ntotally unnecessary crisis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             WOMEN VETERANS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nsalute the women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and honor the \nsacrifices they have made for our country.\n  Long before they were welcomed as members of the military, women \nplayed an important role in supporting our troops. Since the American \nRevolution, women have tended to the wounded and provided care to our \nsoldiers. In the early 20th century, women answered the ultimate call \nto duty and began to serve proudly in our Armed Forces.\n  These early women veterans were trailblazers, creating new \nopportunities for the women that follow in their footsteps. They gave \nall that they could to protect and defend our country, often without \nthe same recognition given to their male counterparts. Today, women \nserve at all levels of the armed services as combat pilots, medical \ncare professionals, engineers, and police officers.\n  There are over 1.8 million women veterans in the United States and \nthe role of women in the armed services continues to grow. Over 212,000 \nwomen have served actively in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 120 women \nsoldiers have sacrificed their lives and many more have been wounded. \nThese women have played an integral role in our military's success, \nworking closely with ground combat troops.\n  Women have been and continue to be a vital part of the military. \nTheir bravery and patriotism is without question. Their contributions \ndemand recognition. We must pay tribute to those women veterans who \nanswered the call to defend America.\n  On behalf of myself, and speaking for the thousands of women who have \nbenefited from their example, I would like to recognize and thank the \nwomen who have served our country, proudly and with honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3220-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FOR-PROFIT EDUCATION COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, during my floor speech last Thursday on \nfor-profit education, I neglected to insert a letter into the Record. I \nask unanimous consent that the following letter from Apollo Education \nGroup be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Apollo Group, Inc. Statement for the Record\n\n       Apollo Group, Inc. respectfully submits this response to \n     the statement delivered today by Senator Tom Harkin on the \n     issue of military educational benefits.\n       During this statement, Senator Harkin cited a complaint \n     submitted by a student at the University of Phoenix in April \n     2009. As part of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pension's investigation into for-profit \n     higher education, Apollo Group voluntarily produced this \n     complaint and the documents relating to its resolution, along \n     with tens of thousands of pages of additional documents on a \n     wide range of subjects. Apollo Group remains committed to \n     cooperating with the Committee's investigation.\n       University of Phoenix is the largest private university in \n     North America, serving a current population of over 400,000 \n     students. As with any institution of higher learning, the \n     University receives complaints from its students. It takes \n     those complaints very seriously and works hard to investigate \n     and address students' concerns in a timely, efficient, and \n     appropriate manner. The University's Office of Dispute \n     Resolution administers an industry-leading dispute resolution \n     process to investigate and resolve complaints like the one \n     referenced by Senator Harkin.\n       Notwithstanding the charges cited by Senator Harkin, it is \n     important to consider the facts of this particular complaint \n     and how it was investigated and resolved by the Office of \n     Dispute Resolution. Specifically, the documents reveal that \n     this student was dissatisfied because he or she did not \n     receive a degree one year after enrollment. After diligent \n     inquiry, the Office determined that the student's grievance \n     stemmed from the University's denial of the student's request \n     to waive certain curriculum requirements based on credits \n     received from another institution fourteen (14) years \n     earlier. That denial was based on a determination that those \n     prior credits were outdated and not equivalent to the credits \n     required as part of the applicable curriculum at the \n     University. The Office did not find any evidence that the \n     student had been promised that he or she would complete the \n     degree program within one year, as the student alleged. \n     Further investigation has determined that the student did \n     complete the degree program at the University, based on \n     educational coursework that met current academic standards, \n     and received a degree within a year after filing the \n     complaint and within two years of entering University of \n     Phoenix.\n       Senator Harkin pointed out that the student who filed this \n     complaint is a veteran who attended University of Phoenix on \n     the GI Bill. The University is committed to serving the needs \n     of its military and veteran students and believes that it \n     provides an accessible and flexible option for this segment \n     of its student population. The University has long served \n     military students, resulting in its recognition as a military \n     friendly school by GI Jobs, civilianjobs.com, and, most \n     recently, Military Advanced Education in their Third Annual \n     Guide to America's Top Military-Friendly Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       University of Phoenix's service of military students is \n     driven by its mission to provide access to higher education \n     for historically underserved populations. The University \n     takes this mission extremely seriously and strives \n     continually to improve the experience and opportunities for \n     the many thousands of students who have put their trust in \n     it. The University's industry-leading dispute resolution \n     process is a critical component of its efforts in this regard \n     and demonstrates the University's commitment to the needs and \n     concerns of its student body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3220-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO HAL DAVID\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate Hal David on his upcoming 90th birthday. Hal is a pioneer \nin the music industry and a world class lyricist, having composed some \nof the most enduring songs in American popular music. Marcelle and I \nspend many wonderful evenings with him and so enjoy hearing his stories \nof not only his song writing, but others.\n  Hal was born on May 25, 1921, in Brooklyn, NY, and was the son of two \nimmigrants. He served in the U.S. Army Entertainment Section in the \nCentral Pacific during World War II with Carl Reiner and Werner \nKlemperer. The dedication to his country and the entertainment he \nprovided for the men serving will never be forgotten.\n  Hal's musical writing career took off with his first hit record ``The \nFour Winds and the Seven Seas.'' His legendary collaboration with \ncomposer Burt Bacharach began in 1957 with the Marty Robbins hit ``The \nStory of My Life'' and included other hits such as ``Magic Moments'' \nand ``What the World Needs Now is Love.'' Through this successful \npartnership, Hal and Burt Bacharach were nominated for four Academy \nAwards and won the Oscar for best song in the 1969 film ``Butch Cassidy \nand the Sundance Kid'' with ``Raindrops.''\n  Hal David also works on legislative efforts as a board member on the \nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, ASCAP, and led \nthe battle against source licensing. During Hal's time as chairman and \nCEO of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he helped launch the Songwriters \nHall of Fame Gallery at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.\n  Hal's achievements have earned recognition on a local and \ninternational stage. He has been inducted into the Nashville \nSongwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriter Hall of Fame, which honors \nthe most popular songs from around the world. He was also the first \nnon-British award recipient to receive the Recording Academy and Ivor \nNovello Award bestowed by the British Performing Rights Society. I \ncommend him on his impressive lyricist career that has entertained \ncountless Americans and citizens around the world. Hal David is a \ndedicated and talented lyricist and friend, and I am pleased to join in \nwishing him a happy 90th birthday and all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3220-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3220-S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REUBEN SALTERS\n\n Mr. CARPER.

Reuben was commissioned as a 2d \nlieutenant at the Dover Air Force Base in 1957 and rose to the rank of \nmajor before honorably retiring in 1971.\n  Reuben's first civilian job was at the former Kent County Vocational \nand Technical School, now known as the Polytech School District, and in \n1974 he earned his master of science degree in counselor education. \nAfter serving 3 years as the director of Neighborhood Youth Corps and \nAdministrator of the Adult ABE/GED Program for Kent and Sussex \ncounties, Reuben accepted a position as an academic counselor for the \nengineering technology and business curriculum at the Delaware \nTechnical and Community College, Terry Campus. There, he also worked as \na veteran's counselor, activities coordinator and as the Terry Campus \nrepresentative at the Dover Air Force Base.\n  A man of extraordinary service, Reuben has served as president of the \ncentral Delaware branch of the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People, president of the local chapter of the Alpha Phi \nAlpha Fraternity, Inc., a faithful member of the Mt. Zion African \nMethodist Episcopal Church and a member of the Dover City Council \nserving from 1989 until his retirement earlier this year. While a \nmember of Dover City Council, Reuben held a number of leadership \npositions including the chair of the Legislative and Finance Committee, \nthe chair of the Civilian Pension Committee and a member of the \nDowntown Dover Partnership Committee.\n  Seeing the need for a greater understanding and appreciation of the \narts and culture among Dover's inner city citizens, Reuben founded the \nInner City Cultural League, Inc. in 1971. The league provides scores of \ninner city youth with the opportunity to participate in cultural and \ncommunity activities. It also provides a crime and drug-free \nenvironment where they can prepare to live productive and happy lives. \nThe program has flourished and has been enhanced by the addition of the \nannual African American Festival--now in its 21st year and attended by \nthousands of people last year--and by adding the Sankofa African Dance \nand Drum Company to the activities of the League.\n  A frequent traveler to Africa and South America to name only a few, \nReuben always returns to his favorite city of Dover, DE, where his love \nand passion for equal opportunity and quality of life for all prevail. \nI am truly honored to have worked with Reuben Salters for many years \nand am privileged to pay tribute to Dover's favorite son.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3221-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEEDS, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

DR. WALTER SOBOLEFF\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it was only a few short years \nago, in October of 2008, that I stood before this body to honor one of \nAlaska's most cherished elders, the Reverend Doctor Walter A. Soboleff, \nin commemoration of his 100th birthday.\n  Today, I come before you with a heavy heart, to share with you news \nof the passing of that distinguished and revered Tlingit elder and \nleader. On this day I ask that we honor the life of an extraordinary \nman and remember his inspirational journey.\n  At 102, on Sunday May 22, 2011, during the breaking light of that \nmorning's first dawn, the Reverend Doctor Walter A. Soboleff quietly \nstepped from a restful sleep into the Northern winds, into the budding \nspring of the Southeast forest, to begin his final flourishing journey \nfrom Earth to heaven.\n  Reverend Soboleff is often described as a man of God. His encouraging \nand often humorous words and outlook on life served as a beacon of \nlight to so many who had the honor and privilege to know him. His \nconsistently positive words were not only eloquent but also \ninspirational, and one could say they were truly words inspired by God.\n  Reverend Soboleff was active and present during most of Alaska's \nhistory. In 1957, he was in Juneau to open the Republican Convention \nInvocation. He was our State's eldest Republican and indeed more than \njust a witness, the living embodiment of the history of our great \nState. He recognized and believed that one of the qualities that made \nour Nation so great is that our Founding Fathers were God fearing and \nled with their hearts and minds open to the Creator.\n  The passing of Reverend Soboleff leaves a void that we can never hope \nto fill. The Native elders of Alaska are unique culture bearers of our \nhistory, land, and people. They are a vital link between the past and \npresent; the connection between two worlds, the old and new. They also \nhave a significant responsibility to ensure that future generations \nknow who they are and from where they came, by telling the stories and \npassing on the oral traditions of Alaska Native cultures that have \nstruggled to maintain survival.\n  Reverend Soboleff was born November 14, 1908, on Killisnoo, a small \nisland village near Admiralty Island, north of Angoon in southeast \nAlaska. His mother was Tlingit Indian and his father was the son of a \nRussian Orthodox priest serving in southeast Alaska. In his home four \nlanguages were spoken: Russian, German, English, and Tlingit. Reverend \nSoboleff's life was one of sacrifice and public service. But he \ncertainly would not have viewed his service as a sacrifice.\n  Reverend Soboleff was appointed to serve as minister of the Tlingit \nPresbyterian Memorial Church in Juneau. He ventured from his village on \nJune 14, 1940, on a steamer and landed in Juneau well before the era of \ncivil rights. To his dismay he was greeted with signs in restaurant \nwindows that said ``No dogs or Indians'' and turned away when he tried \nto rent a room. But he was not the kind of man to let a bad situation \nget the better of him. Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he felt \nsorry for the innkeeper.\n  In response, and in his way, he decided to open the doors of his \nchurch to any and all who sought to worship God. In the midst of a time \nof racial bias, Reverend Soboleff created within his church, a \nwonderful diversity of people from all races. His greatest message was \nfor people to love one another--he often said that the greatest gift of \ncivilization is for people to know who they are and to love each other \nregardless, because when there is love, there is peace.\n  Reverend Soboleff received a bachelor's degree in education in 1937 \nfrom Dubuque University in Iowa, and a divinity degree in 1940. He was \nawarded an honorary doctor of divinity by Dubuque University in 1952 \nand an honorary doctor of humanities by the University of Alaska \nFairbanks in 1968. He was also the first Alaska Native to serve on the \nAlaska State Board of Education, where he served as chairman.\n  He was truly a man of distinction and grace and a pillar of \ntraditional and modern society. He served seven terms as president of \nthe Alaska Native Brotherhood as well as grand president emeritus. In \n1952, the Reverend accepted a commission in the Alaska Army National \nGuard, serving as Chaplain for 20 years, retiring with rank of \nlieutenant colonel. He then went on to found the Alaska Native Studies \nDepartment at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Over the course of \nhis life he served God and his people well and was a leader of \nextraordinary courage, inspiring a hope for love and peace in all who \nknew him.\n  On Wednesday, May 25, Alaska's Governor Sean Parnell has ordered \nflags to be flown at half-staff in Reverend Soboleff's honor. Reverend \nSoboleff wanted to be remembered as one who tried to do his best in a \ntime of changing culture and one who took positives from both the \nNative and Western worlds. I think I can speak for all of Alaska when I \nsay he achieved that goal. I would like to offer Reverend Doctor Walter \nSoboleff's family and many friends my heartfelt condolences. Know that \nhe served the Native people and our beloved State of Alaska over the \ncourse of his entire life, 102 years; and it is my hope that his life \nwill continue to serve as an inspiration to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3222-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3222-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3222-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3222-S3223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED ON MARCH 15, 1995 IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12957 WITH RESPECT TO \n                               IRAN--PM 9\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') that takes additional steps with \nrespect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of \nMarch 15, 1995, and implements the existing statutory requirements of \nthe Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. 1701 \nnote) (ISA), as amended by, inter alia, the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-\n195) (CISADA).\n  In Executive Order 12957, the President found that the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with that \nthreat, the President in Executive Order 12957 declared a national \nemergency and imposed prohibitions on certain transactions with respect \nto the development of Iranian petroleum resources. To further respond \nto that threat, Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, imposed \ncomprehensive trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Executive Order \n13059 of August 19, 1997, consolidated and clarified the previous \norders. To take additional steps\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nwith respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n12957 and to implement section 105(a) of CISADA, I issued Executive \nOrder 13553 on September 28, 2010, to impose sanctions on officials of \nthe Government of Iran and other persons acting on behalf of the \nGovernment of Iran determined to be responsible for or complicit in \ncertain serious human rights abuses.\n  In CISADA, which I signed into law on July 1, 2010, the Congress \nfound that the illicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, \nalong with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic \nmissiles and its support for international terrorism, threaten the \nsecurity of the United States. To address the potential connection \nbetween Iran's illicit nuclear program and its energy sector, CISADA \namended ISA to expand the types of activities that are sanctionable \nunder that Act. ISA now requires that sanctions be imposed or waived \nfor persons that are determined to have made certain investments in \nIran's energy sector or to have engaged in certain activities relating \nto Iran's refined petroleum sector. In addition to expanding the types \nof sanctionable energy-related activities, CISADA added new sanctions \nthat can be imposed pursuant to ISA.\n  This order is intended to implement the statutory requirements of \nISA. Certain ISA sanctions require action by the private sector, and \nthe order will further the implementation of those ISA sanctions by \nproviding authority under IEEPA to the Secretary of the Treasury to \ntake certain actions with respect to those sanctions. The order states \nthat the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary \nof State, shall take the following actions necessary to implement the \nsanctions selected, imposed, and maintained on a person by the \nPresident or by the Secretary of State, pursuant to authority that I \nhave delegated:\n  with respect to section 6(a)(3) of ISA, prohibit any United States \nfinancial institution from making loans or providing credits to the \nperson consistent with section 6(a)(3) of ISA;\n  with respect to section 6(a)(6) of ISA, prohibit any transactions in \nforeign exchange that are subject to the jurisdiction of the United \nStates and in which the person has any interest;\n  with respect to section 6(a)(7) of ISA, prohibit any transfers of \ncredit or payments between financial institutions or by, through, or to \nany financial institution, to the extent that such transfers or \npayments are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and \ninvolve any interest of the person;\n  with respect to section 6(a)(8) of ISA, block all property and \ninterests in property that are in the United States, that come within \nthe United States, or that are or come within the possession or control \nof any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the \nperson, and provide that such property and interests in property may \nnot be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in; \nor\n  with respect to section 6(a)(9) of ISA, restrict or prohibit imports \nof goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, into the \nUnited States from the person.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA and the relevant provisions of \nISA, and to employ all powers granted to the United States Government \nby the relevant provision of ISA as may be necessary to carry out the \npurposes of the order.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Defense Commissary Agency to conduct a pilot program at military \ninstitutions to be closed or subject to an adverse realignment under a \nbase closure law under which a commissary store may sell additional \ntypes of merchandise; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleague, Senator Collins, to authorize the Department of Defense \nto carry out a pilot program to sell certain products at commissaries \nthat serve areas with military installations that have been adversely \naffected by a Base Closure and Realignment, BRAC, round. It is my \nfervent hope that this legislation will provide the Department of \nDefense with a means of reducing the operating costs of the commissary \nin Topsham, Maine sufficiently that they are able to keep a commissary \nin the area open for many years after the disestablishment of Naval Air \nStation, NAS, Brunswick.\n  As my colleagues know, the 2005 BRAC round ordered the closure of NAS \nBrunswick, Maine. That base, which once employed nearly 5,000 personnel \nin the region, will be officially disestablished on May 31, 2011. With \nthe closure of NAS Brunswick, some in the Department of Defense have \nargued that the nearby commissary in Topsham, Maine, should also be \nclosed.\n  However, even after the closure of NAS Brunswick, nearly 1,500 active \nduty, Guard, and Reserve service members remain within a 20 mile drive \nof the installation, including more than 300 active duty personnel who \nsupport the Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair \njust down the road in Bath, Maine. In addition, almost 9,000 military \nretirees and their dependents live in the immediate area, with many \nthousands more living within an hour's drive.\n  Thanks to a provision that I and my Maine colleagues succeeded in \nhaving included in the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2011, the Topsham commissary will remain open until at \nleast September 15, 2011, while the Department of Defense considers the \nfindings of a Government Accountability Office review on commissary \noperations and policies.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  That GAO review was recently completed, and it revealed that the \nDepartment's decision to close the commissary was based on instructions \nthat lack clear criteria for determining when commissaries should be \nestablished, operated, or closed. DOD concurred with GAO's assessment \nthat its instructions are unclear, and indicated that it would clarify \nits criteria in the next version of commissary operations.\n  So, just one week ago, on May 10, 2011, Senator Collins and I wrote \nto Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Clifford \nStanley to urge that he not close ANY commissary--including the Topsham \ncommissary--until those instructions are clarified. Such an approach is \nthe only reasonable route for DOD to move forward in a fair and \ntransparent manner.\n  In recognition of the financial challenges facing our nation, we have \nalso developed an idea to reduce the operating costs of the Topsham \ncommissary, which DOD estimates to be approximately $2.2 million per \nyear. The store currently returns about $400,000 to the commissary \nsystem through surcharge revenues, but I certainly appreciate how \nimportant it is to address the state of our nation's budget.\n  So, with a commissary at Topsham, and an exchange at NAS Brunswick, \nwe explored the option of using a provision in existing law to create a \n``combined'' store. Although that idea was appealing, we learned that \nevery store created under that authority has eventually failed for lack \nof financial support. Thus, we developed the legislation we introduce \nhere today.\n  This bill would create a pilot program to operate an ``enhanced \ncommissary store'' in the Topsham-Brunswick area and at other \ninstallations closed or adversely realigned by a BRAC round. This new \nauthority would allow the pilot stores to sell items that are currently \nsold by or for the military exchanges, such as alcoholic beverages and \ntobacco products. Unlike other products at the commissary, which are \nsold at cost plus a 5 percent surcharge, these products would be sold \nat higher prices as determined by the Secretary of Defense, and the \nproceeds from those sales would be applied to reducing the operating \ncosts of each enhanced commissary.\n  Although it is difficult to determine how much revenue would result \nfrom this proposal, preliminary estimates are that it could reduce \ncosts at a location such as the Topsham commissary by approximately \n$300,000 per year. That is more than enough to make a cost-effective \nbenefit like the commissary an even better deal for our service members \nand the taxpayer.\n  On a final note, I would point out that this bill is quite similar to \na provision included at the behest of Congresswoman Chellie Pingree in \nH.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act fiscal year 2012, as \nreported by the House Armed Services Committee. It has been my pleasure \nto work with her in developing this concept, and I hope that we will be \nable to include similar language in the Senate version of the bill \nlater this year.\n  I believe that this bill is a common sense solution to ensuring that \nour service members, military retirees, and their dependents are able \nto continue to access the extremely important and valued benefit that \nis the commissary system, even in locations that undergo significant \nrealignments due to a BRAC round. I urge my colleagues to consider this \nlegislation, and look forward to working with the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to include the proposal in their version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1047. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment of 1992 to require the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to take actions to improve \nenvironmental conditions in the vicinity of the Leadville Mine Drainage \nTunnel in Lake County, Colorado, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nLeadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Act of 2011 to address concerns of \nfederal jurisdiction and public safety regarding a mine drainage tunnel \nin Leadville, CO.\n  In 2008, a blockage formed in the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel that \nbacked up a large volume of contaminated water, creating a serious \nsafety hazard for the surrounding community if a catastrophic tunnel \nfailure were to occur. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, took actions to address the \nimmediate threat, including installing a dewatering relief well to \nrelieve water pressure behind the tunnel blockage. However, in the \nprocess, questions arose as to whether the Bureau of Reclamation, which \nowns the tunnel, has the authority to help implement a number of \nremedies by treating contaminated water from the tunnel. My bill \nclarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation has the authority to treat \nthis water and is responsible for maintaining the Leadville Mine \nDrainage Tunnel to protect public safety and reduce future threats to \nthe community.\n  The Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel was originally constructed by the \nfederal Bureau of Mines in the 1940s and 1950s to facilitate the \nextraction of lead and zinc ore for World War II and Korean War \nefforts. The Bureau of Reclamation acquired the tunnel in 1959, hoping \nto use it as a source of water for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, a \nwater diversion project in the Fryingpan and Arkansas River Basins. \nAlthough the tunnel was never used for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, \nwater that flows out of the tunnel is considered part of the natural \nflow of the Arkansas River. With the passage and subsequent signing \ninto law of H.R. 429 during the 102nd Congress, the Bureau of \nReclamation constructed and continues to operate a water treatment \nplant at the mouth of the tunnel.\n  Water levels in the tunnel have fluctuated in recent years. The 2008 \ncollapse in the tunnel increased the tunnel's mine pool significantly, \nleading to new seeps and springs in the area. Estimates suggest that up \nto 1 billion gallons of water may have built up behind the blockage \nwithin the mine pool.\n  In November 2007, EPA sent a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation \nexpressing concerns over a catastrophic blowout as a result of the \nbuilt-up water, and, in February 2008, the Lake County Commissioners \ndeclared a state of emergency. The Bureau of Reclamation developed a \nrisk assessment in the area, and the EPA and the Bureau of Reclamation \nperformed some emergency measures to relieve water pressure in the \ntunnel.\n  While this emergency work was important and successful, the Bureau of \nReclamation's authority to participate in a long-term solution remains \nan open question. It is unclear whether the Bureau of Reclamation has \nthe authority to treat the water from the dewatering relief well or \nsurface water diverted into the tunnel from a nearby National \nPriorities List site.\n  In short, we found there is not only a physical blockage in the \ntunnel, but also a legal blockage that has prevented the Bureau of \nReclamation, the EPA and the State of Colorado from reaching an \nagreement on a long-term solution. This legislation will clear out the \nlegal blockage by allowing the Bureau of Reclamation and the EPA to \nwork collaboratively on solutions and address the unsafe mine pool in \nthe tunnel.\n  Specifically, the bill does three things:\n  First, the bill clarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation is required \nto maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel to minimize the \nchance of a catastrophic failure of the tunnel leading to the \nuncontrolled release of contaminated water.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation has the \nauthority to participate in the long-term solution by treating water \npooling up behind the blockage and surface water diverted into the \ntunnel from operable unit 6 of the California Gulch National Priorities \nList, Superfund, site. Current law restricts the Bureau of Reclamation \nto treating only ``historically discharged'' effluent, and it is \nuncertain whether that includes treating water as part of the remedy.\n  Third, the bill requires the Bureau of Reclamation and EPA to \ncooperate on any Record of Decision for the California Gulch Superfund \nsite that impacts the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel or the associated \nwater treatment plant. As part of that cooperation, the agencies must \nenter into an\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nagreement describing how they will pay for any necessary changes to the \ntunnel or treatment plant.\n  The bill also authorizes any funding that might be necessary for the \nBureau of Reclamation to perform its clarified responsibilities under \nthis bill.\n  By clearing up the legal blockage, the bill will help create a \ncollaborative working relationship between the Bureau of Reclamation, \nthe EPA and the State of Colorado to solve this problem for the long-\nterm benefit of Lake County and all of Southeastern Colorado.\n  Concerns about the safety of the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel have \npersisted for over 30 years, as have questions about federal agencies' \nresponsibility to address those concerns. My bill will finally clarify \nfederal jurisdiction and give the residents of Leadville, Colorado, as \nwell as the entire Arkansas River Basin, an additional measure of \ncertainty that the federal government will maintain safe conditions at \nthe tunnel. I look forward to working with the rest of the Colorado \nCongressional delegation on this legislation and to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 194\n\n       Whereas peaceful demonstrations that began in Libya, \n     inspired by similar movements in Tunisia, Egypt, and \n     elsewhere in the Middle East, quickly spread to cities around \n     the country, calling for greater political reform, \n     opportunity, justice, and the rule of law;\n       Whereas, Muammar Qaddafi, his sons, and forces loyal to \n     them responded to the peaceful demonstrations by authorizing \n     and initiating violence against civilian non-combatants in \n     Libya, including the use of airpower and foreign mercenaries;\n       Whereas, on February 25, 2011, President Barack Obama \n     imposed unilateral economic sanctions on and froze the assets \n     of Muammar Qaddafi and his family, as well as the Government \n     of Libya and its agencies, to hold the Qaddafi regime \n     accountable for its continued use of violence against unarmed \n     civilians and its human rights abuses and to safeguard the \n     assets of the people of Libya;\n       Whereas, on February 26, 2011, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Resolution 1970, which mandates international \n     economic sanctions and an arms embargo;\n       Whereas, in response to Qaddafi's assault on Libyan \n     civilians, a ``no-fly zone'' in Libya was called for by the \n     Gulf Cooperation Council on March 7, 2011, by the head of the \n     Organization of the Islamic Conference on March 8, 2011, and \n     by the Arab League on March 12, 2011;\n       Whereas Qaddafi's advancing forces, after recapturing \n     cities in eastern Libya that had been liberated by the Libyan \n     opposition, were preparing to attack Benghazi, a city of \n     700,000 people and the seat of the opposition Government in \n     Libya, the Interim Transitional National Council;\n       Whereas Qaddafi stated that he would show ``no mercy'' to \n     his opponents in Benghazi, and that his forces would go \n     ``door to door'' to find and kill dissidents;\n       Whereas, on March 17, 2011, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Resolution 1973, which mandates ``all \n     necessary measures'' to protect civilians in Libya, implement \n     a ``no-fly zone'', and enforce an arms embargo against the \n     Qaddafi regime;\n       Whereas President Obama notified key congressional leaders \n     in a meeting at the White House on March 18, 2011, of his \n     intent to begin targeted military operations in Libya;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces, together with \n     coalition partners, launched Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya \n     on March 19, 2011, to protect civilians in Libya from \n     immediate danger and to enforce an arms embargo and a ``no-\n     fly zone''; and\n       Whereas, on March 31, 2011, the United States transferred \n     authority for Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya to NATO \n     command, with the mission continuing as Operation Unified \n     Protector: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the aspirations of the Libyan people for \n     political reform and self-government based on democratic and \n     human rights;\n       (2) commends the service of the men and women of the United \n     States Armed Forces and our coalition partners who are \n     engaged in military operations to protect the people of \n     Libya;\n       (3) supports the limited use of military force by the \n     United States in Libya as part of the NATO mission to enforce \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 (2011), as \n     requested by the Transitional National Council, the Arab \n     League, and the Gulf Cooperation Council;\n       (4) agrees that the goal of United States policy in Libya, \n     as stated by the President, is to achieve the departure from \n     power of Muammar Qaddafi and his family, including through \n     the use of non-military means, so that a peaceful transition \n     can begin to an inclusive government that ensures freedom, \n     opportunity, and justice for the people of Libya;\n       (5) affirms that the funds of the Qaddafi regime that have \n     been frozen by the United States should be returned to the \n     Libyan people for their benefit, including humanitarian and \n     reconstruction assistance, and calls for exploring with the \n     Transitional National Council the possibility of using some \n     of such funds to reimburse NATO member countries for expenses \n     incurred in Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified \n     Protector; and\n       (6) calls on the President--\n       (A) to submit to Congress a description of United States \n     policy objectives in Libya, both during and after Qaddafi's \n     rule, and a detailed plan to achieve them; and\n       (B) to consult regularly with Congress regarding United \n     States efforts in Libya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3229-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3229-S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 195--COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  FOUNDING OF THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN CAMBRIDGE, \n                             MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the \nfollowing resolution;

Res. 195\n\n       Whereas when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``MIT'') was founded by \n     William Barton Rogers, on April 10, 1861, the doors to a \n     powerful new institution for education, discovery, and \n     technological advancement were opened;\n       Whereas the commitment of MIT to innovation and the \n     entrepreneurial spirit has trained innovators and delivered \n     groundbreaking technologies that have significantly \n     contributed to the fields of computing, molecular biology, \n     sustainable development, biomedicine, new media, energy, and \n     the environment;\n       Whereas there are an estimated 6,900 companies founded by \n     MIT alumni in the State of Massachusetts alone, which have \n     earned worldwide sales of approximately $164,000,000,000 and \n     represent 26 percent of total sales made by Massachusetts \n     companies;\n       Whereas the distinguished living alumni of MIT have founded \n     approximately 25,800 companies that, as of 2011, provide jobs \n     for approximately 3,300,000 people around the world and earn \n     $2,200,000,000,000 in annual sales;\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n       Whereas MIT has many notable alumni and professors who have \n     contributed to leading research and development efforts, \n     including 76 Nobel Prize recipients and astronauts who have \n     flown more than \\1/3\\ of the manned spaceflights of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas MIT engineers and researchers have pioneered \n     countless innovations, including the creation of random-\n     access magnetic-core memory (commonly known as ``RAM''), \n     which led to the digital revolution, the mapping of the human \n     genome, the creation of GPS navigation technology, and the \n     engineering of the computers that landed Americans on the \n     moon;\n       Whereas MIT biomedical researchers remain at the forefront \n     of many fields and have contributed years of key \n     advancements, such as the first chemical synthesis of \n     penicillin, the invention of heart stents, and the mapping of \n     molecular defects to produce the first targeted therapies for \n     cancer treatment; and\n       Whereas MIT has excelled as a world-renowned pioneer that \n     promotes science and engineering education, economic growth, \n     scientific breakthroughs, and technological advancement in \n     the State of Massachusetts and throughout the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 150th anniversary of the founding of \n     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, \n     Massachusetts; and\n       (2) honors the outstanding contributions made by the \n     alumni, professors, and staff of the Massachusetts Institute \n     of Technology throughout the past 150 years, including the \n     efforts supported by the Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology that have spurred the industrial progress of the \n     United States through innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/23/senate-section/article/S3245-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1050, S.J.
