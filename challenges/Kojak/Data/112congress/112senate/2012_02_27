Mr. President, last week Nevada lost a great statesman and \nI lost a friend and mentor. William Raggio was the longest serving \nState senator in Nevada's history. He died last week while traveling in \nAustralia. My heart is with his wife Dale, whom I spoke with, children \nLeslie and Tracy and, of course, my thoughts go to Mark, the son Bill \nlost in 2004, six grandchildren, and they have a great-grandchild.\n  I hope it is some small comfort to know that all of Nevada mourns the \nloss of this very effective and fine Nevada citizen.\n  He was a second-generation Nevadan born and raised in Reno, NV. \nSenator Randolph Townsend said, ``Bill was part of the fabric of the \ncity.'' That is true. He lived to serve.\n  In addition to his four decades of service in the State legislature, \nhe volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces during World War II. He \nenlisted in the Navy at age 17, but the war ended before he graduated \nfrom officer training school.\n  When he finished his service, he attended the University of Nevada, \nand then went to law school in California. But he continued to serve in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps as a United States Navy Reservist.\n  He was the district attorney of Washoe County, which is the Reno \nmetropolitan area, for 18 years, including 3 terms before he became a \nState legislator. He was president of the National DAs Association.\n  He rooted out corruption wherever he served. There was nothing more \ncorrupt, in his mind, and the minds of all Nevadans, than an illegal \nbrothel. That illegal brothel went on by virtue of Joe Conforte being \nable to pass out money to people for a long time. Bill Raggio, as DA, \npicked a fight with him, and that fight is legend. Bill got the last \nword. Conforte spent 22 months in prison for trying to bribe Bill \nRaggio. And in 1965, Bill Raggio, to get the last word, had the local \nauthorities declare that facility a nuisance and burn it\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\ndown. He was there watching the fire as it destroyed that place.\n  It wasn't until 1972 that Bill brought his integrity and dedication \nto the State House as a member of the Nevada State Senate. So for 38 \nyears, there wasn't a piece of legislation that passed the Nevada \nlegislature that didn't have his imprint on it in some way. He worked \nto help pass thousands of different pieces of legislation. He was an \nexpert in the process. Nobody knew how to craft a budget better than \nBill Raggio.\n  He was a Republican who believed government should be ``lean but not \nmean.'' He was never afraid to work with Democratic members, even \nthough he was Republican leader for several terms. Here is what he said \nrecently: I think the present leadership of the Republican Party is a \nlittle too radical and has been taken over by what I think is a radical \nelement.\n  He went on to say in an interview, after he decided to retire:\n\n       The party has to reshape itself, or it won't win general \n     elections down the road.\n\n  That is Bill Raggio, speaking as we should all speak--not as a \nRepublican but as a Nevadan and an American. So it is no surprise to \nsee the outpouring of grief of Democrats and Republicans at his \npassing.\n  ``No one has ever loved this state more or has had a more passionate \ndesire to make things better for the people who live here,'' said \nDemocratic Assembly Speaker John Ocegera.\n\n       If there was a Mount Rushmore of Nevada politics, Bill \n     Raggio's image would forever be carved there. The Nevada \n     family has lost a great patriarch.\n\n  That was what Republican Governor Brian Sandoval said.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfour pages of statements made by Nevada-elected and appointed \nofficials, and citizens of Nevada about Bill Raggio.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From the Las Vegas Sun]\n\n           Reaction to Death of Former State Sen. Bill Raggio\n\n                           (Associated Press)\n\n       Reaction to the death of retired state Sen. Bill Raggio, R \n     Reno, Nevada's longest-serving state senator:\n       If there was a Mount Rushmore of Nevada politics, Bill \n     Raggio's image would forever be carved there. The Nevada \n     family has lost a great patriarch; may God rest his soul as \n     we remember all that he meant to our state.--Gov. Brian \n     Sandoval, R Nevada.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have known Bill for decades; he has been a mentor to me. \n     He always fought for Nevada and his invaluable contributions \n     and service to our state will live on. . . . His important \n     voice will be missed.--U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid, D Nevada.\n                                  ____\n\n       Clearly, he was one of the state's greatest and most \n     accomplished public servants. He was also a helluva good guy \n     who possessed a wonderful sense of humor. . . . (H)e had an \n     exceptional legal mind and was a knowledgeable, courageous \n     and fair-minded DA who helped root out organized crime in \n     Northern Nevada.--Former U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt, R Nevada.\n                                  ____\n\n       Bill was a true public servant and his sole agenda was \n     simply to make Nevada a better place. He has left an \n     unmatched political footprint upon our state, and the \n     citizens will reap the rewards of this gifted and decent \n     gentleman for many years to come.--Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki, R \n     Nevada.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sen. Raggio was an icon, a consummate statesman and one of \n     the most knowledgeable and pragmatic legislators ever to \n     serve the people of Nevada. His absence from the Legislature \n     with his retirement was keenly felt. His passing on Thursday \n     ends a chapter in Nevada history.--Nevada Supreme Court Chief \n     Justice Nancy Saitta.\n                                  ____\n\n       The passing of Bill Raggio is a tragic loss for Nevadans. \n     For those of us in the law enforcement community, we fondly \n     recall and continue to tell stories about Bill standing up to \n     perpetrators to ensure a safe community. Bill will always be \n     remembered for his impassioned service and dedication.--\n     Nevada state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto.\n                                  ____\n\n       Bill Raggio was the type of elected official I strive to \n     become. In an era of intense partisanship, he upheld a \n     statesman's voice of reason.--Nevada Secretary of State Ross \n     Miller, via Twitter.\n                                  ____\n\n       There are no words to describe his dedication to the state \n     of Nevada and I wish to express my deepest condolences and \n     prayers for his wife Dale, and his family. Bill was a true \n     statesman who dedicated his life to making Nevada a better \n     place to live. His legacy will be remembered for generations \n     to come.--U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R Nevada.\n                                  ____\n\n       He was nothing short of a giant in Nevada politics and a \n     fierce advocate for the state he loved, especially the north. \n     His dedicated public service has improved the lives of \n     thousands of Nevada families and his tireless work on higher \n     education has left a permanent mark on this state.--Rep. \n     Shelley Berkley, D Las Vegas.\n                                  ____\n\n       Bill Raggio was the consummate statesman and a dedicated \n     public servant. He was a mentor of mine and it was an honor \n     to work under him in the state senate while he was Majority \n     Leader. He will truly be missed.--U.S. Rep. Joe Heck, R \n     Henderson.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is the end of an era in Nevada. Bill was an icon of \n     legislative public service and it was a privilege to serve \n     with him in the state senate. My condolences go out to his \n     wife Dale and his two daughters.--U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, R \n     Carson City.\n                                  ____\n\n       Last year, I was honored to induct Senator Raggio into the \n     Senate Hall of Fame for his unwavering commitment to our \n     state. From his service as a District Attorney to becoming \n     one of the longest serving legislators in Nevada history, \n     Senator Raggio always put the people of Nevada first. . . . \n     Nevada has truly lost one of its finest statesmen.--Nevada \n     Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, D Las Vegas.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Raggio epitomized the term ``public servant.'' . . \n     . He was a tireless advocate for higher education, believing \n     that it was the gateway to a better life for any Nevadan. \n     With so many accomplishments and such universal respect, it's \n     impossible to do justice and honor to the life of such a \n     man.--Nevada Senate Republican Caucus.\n                                  ____\n\n       Saddened by the passing of Senator Bill Raggio. A true \n     statesman. My thoughts & prayers are with his family.--Nevada \n     Sen. Ruben Kihuen, D Las Vegas, via Twitter.\n                                  ____\n\n       Feels odd to tweet about Bill Raggio but odd not to. He was \n     my friend and a mentor. A great loss 4 Nev but, oh what a \n     life he lived!--Nevada Assemblywoman Debbie Smith, D Reno, \n     via Twitter.\n                                  ____\n\n       For those of us in higher education, indeed the whole \n     education community, we pause to thank this man who came from \n     humble immigrant roots and rose to great power, in part by \n     public education. He never forgot the contribution of \n     education to his life. We have lost a member of our family \n     today--indeed, our patriarch and champion.--Board of Regents, \n     Nevada System of Higher Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       Raggio was a champion for our Airport Authority and he had \n     the vision to create a transportation entity that plays a \n     vital role in the economy of our region. He was also a \n     wonderful mentor to me and I will miss his sage advice and \n     wise counsel. The legacy of his forward thinking will be felt \n     in our community for years to come.--Krys Bart, president and \n     CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority.\n                                  ____\n\n       He championed our state's heritage and he made our values a \n     priority. He ensured that protecting our environment was a \n     non-partisan position in Carson City as he worked across the \n     aisle to support conservation funding and wildlife. \n     Regardless of your politics, Bill Raggio was a great leader \n     and he will be missed.--Nevada Conservation League.\n                                  ____\n\n       Those who have followed NPRI's work over the years know \n     that we have both agreed and disagreed with Mr. Raggio's \n     views on various policy issues. But there was never any doubt \n     as to his love for Nevada and his commitment to making it a \n     better place to live. For that, he will always have our \n     respect and our admiration.--Andy Matthews, president of \n     Nevada Policy Research Institute.\n                                  ____\n\n       He was every bit as good and as genuine and as committed to \n     public service as what's described. That's the real person. \n     It's a huge loss.--Nevada Sen. Greg Brower, R Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n       No one has ever loved this state more or had a more \n     passionate desire to make things better for the people who \n     live here. His ability to bring people together to get things \n     done was legendary. . . . At times, he may have been an \n     adversary on a particular issue, but he was always a true \n     leader, a teacher and a friend.--Nevada Speaker of the \n     Assembly John Oceguera, D Las Vegas.\n                                  ____\n\n       He was one of the greatest friends and a true mentor to me. \n     Our great state is better because of his leadership and \n     service. He will be sorely missed.--Reno Mayor Bob Cashell.\n                                  ____\n\n       The thing that was great about Senator Raggio and the time \n     that I spent with him in the Legislature was his ability to \n     bring the two sides together and get things done. He was a \n     master at doing that.--Reno City Manager Andrew Clinger.\n                                  ____\n\n       He understood that politics is really filled with \n     compromise. The public still owns this process and they send \n     people of all stripes, different backgrounds, different \n     sections of the state. He knew in order to move things \n     forward, you had to compromise.--Former Nevada Sen. Randolph \n     Townsend, R Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n       Today Nevada Republicans across the state mourn the loss of \n     a great leader and the loss\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\n     of an even greater friend. While it is a sad day for all \n     Nevadans, it is only appropriate to remember the legacy and \n     leadership he left behind for us to follow. A loss of a true \n     icon in Nevada politics will not be forgotten. . . . We will \n     miss you.--Nevada Republican Party Chairman James Smack.\n                                  ____\n\n       Shocked to hear of Sen Raggio's passing--last time we \n     spoke, he ranted about legislators needing to put aside \n     politics & work together.--Nevada Sen. Sheila Leslie, D Reno, \n     via Twitter.\n                                  ____\n\n       Rest in peace Senator Raggio. You will be missed, but never \n     forgotten.--Nevada Sen. Michael Roberson, R Henderson, via \n     Twitter.\n                                  ____\n\n       But Raggio also saw his Republican Party transform around \n     him. In 2003, when a group of Assembly Republicans refused to \n     vote for a tax plan, Raggio didn't hesitate to excavate a \n     pejorative from earlier in his storied career: He called them \n     ``John Birchers.'' By 2008, he was battling ex-Assemblywoman \n     Sharron Angle in a primary fight for the district he'd held \n     comfortably since 1972.\n       When Raggio exercised his legendary independence--and a \n     good deal of personal pique--and endorsed Democrat Harry Reid \n     over Angle in the 2010 U.S. Senate race, his party finally \n     left him. He was ousted from his leadership position by \n     Fallon Republican Mike McGinness, and he tendered his \n     resignation from the Legislature for good.\n       ``I think the present leadership of the Republican Party is \n     a little too radical and has been taken over by what I think \n     is a radical element,'' Raggio said in an interview after he \n     quit, using a true conservative's worst pejorative. ``The \n     party has to reshape itself or it won't win general elections \n     down the road.''\n       Mark his words for November.\n       Back in January 2011, Raggio told me in an interview that \n     the state would go on without him. ``Nobody is irreplaceable. \n     You will find that out,'' he said.\n       I hope Raggio will forgive me one last time if I simply \n     don't agree.\n\n  Mr. REID. He believed in doing what was right for Nevada, even when \nit wasn't right for his political party. I admired him and respected \nhim. I respected him even when he and I disagreed, and that happened. \nBut we agreed far more than we disagreed.\n  I can remember the first time I met him. The person I worked for had \nworked as a deputy district attorney for Bill Raggio. He came to visit \nme in our law office, and he was always very funny, very articulate, \nand somebody I admired and, as I indicated, was my mentor. But I can \nremember him being in that office as if it were 10 minutes ago.\n  Upon his retirement last year, Bill told a local reporter, ``Nobody \nis irreplaceable. You will see.'' It seems, once again, though, Bill \nand I disagreed. No one can replace Bill Raggio. The mark he left on \nNevada politics could never be erased, but his powerful political voice \nand his true personal friendship will be missed.\n  Senator Raggio was an effective legislator and leader in part because \nof his willingness to cooperate with those with whom he disagreed. It \nwould serve this Chamber well to emulate his bipartisan approach.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  We have a great deal to accomplish this work period. We need to \nconsider postal reform legislation. It is mandatory that we do that. We \nhave a pressing cyber-security piece of legislation that the Pentagon \nsays is the most important thing we can do for our country. We have to \nclear a backlog of judicial nominees that threatens the effectiveness \nof our court system. But first, we must complete one of the most \nimportant tasks facing this Congress: strengthening our economy by \nrebuilding our Nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n  Today we will resume progress on the Transportation bill that will \nput 2 million Americans back to work rebuilding roads, bridges, trains, \nand their tracks.\n  The House is also considering transportation legislation. I was glad \nto see that House Republicans have moved away from that extreme \nproposal they were considering a few weeks ago. They are going to now \ntry to pass something similar to our bipartisan legislation. This is \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Too much rests on our success to let this jobs measure be bogged down \nby partisanship. President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, was the \noriginal champion of national infrastructure investment a half century \nago. He once said:\n\n       Only strength can cooperate. Weakness can only beg.\n\n  He was right that it takes strength to work together. But working \ntogether also makes us strong. I look forward to working together with \nmy colleagues on both sides as we complete transportation legislation \nthat will make our economy strong.\n  We have 5 weeks during this work period. We have a lot to do. I hope \nwe can work together to get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1031-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Pursuant to the order of the Senate \nof January 24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 14, 2012, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, will now read Washington's \nFarewell Address.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\n\n                   To the people of the United States\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1031, February 27, 2012, the Record reads: . . . as \nfollows: There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows: Washington}s Farewell Address \nTO THE PEOPLE . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . as follows: \nTO THE PEOPLE . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election \n     of a citizen to administer the executive government of the \n     United States being not far distant, and the time actually \n     arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating \n     the person who is to be clothed with that important trust, it \n     appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more \n     distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now \n     apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being \n     considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is \n     to be made.\n       I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be \n     assured that this resolution has not been taken without a \n     strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the \n     relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country--and \n     that, in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in \n     my situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of \n     zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \n     respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full \n     conviction that the step is compatible with both.\n       The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office \n     to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a \n     uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and \n     to a deference for what appeared to be your desire. I \n     constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my \n     power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty \n     to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \n     been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do \n     this, previous to the last election, had even led to the \n     preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature \n     reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our \n     affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of \n     persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the \n     idea.\n       I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well \n     as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination \n     incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and am \n     persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my \n     services, that in the present circumstances of our country \n     you will not disapprove my determination to retire.\n       The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous \n     trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge \n     of this trust, I will only say that I have, with good \n     intentions, contributed towards the organization and \n     administration of the government the best exertions of which \n     a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious in the \n     outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in \n     my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has \n     strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every \n     day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and \n     more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it \n     will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have \n     given peculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I \n     have the consolation to believe that, while choice and \n     prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism \n     does not forbid it.\n       In looking forward to the moment which is intended to \n     terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not \n     permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of \n     gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many \n     honors it has conferred upon me, still more for the steadfast \n     confidence with which it has supported me and for the \n     opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \n     inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, \n     though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have \n     resulted to our country from these services, let it always be \n     remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in \n     our annals that, under circumstances in which the passions \n     agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, amidst \n     appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \n     discouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of \n     success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the \n     constancy of your support was the essential prop of the \n     efforts and a guarantee of the plans by which they were \n     effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry \n     it with me\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n     to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that \n     Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its \n     beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be \n     perpetual; that the free constitution, which is the work of \n     your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its \n     administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom \n     and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \n     these states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made \n     complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of \n     this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of \n     recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption \n     of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n       Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your \n     welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the \n     apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me on \n     an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn \n     contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, some \n     sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \n     inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all \n     important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. \n     These will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can \n     only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting \n     friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his \n     counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \n     indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not \n     dissimilar occasion.\n       Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of \n     your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to \n     fortify or confirm the attachment.\n       The unity of government which constitutes you one people is \n     also now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main \n     pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support \n     of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad, of your \n     safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so \n     highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \n     different causes and from different quarters, much pains will \n     be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds \n     the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your \n     political fortress against which the batteries of internal \n     and external enemies will be most constantly and actively \n     (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \n     infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense \n     value of your national Union to your collective and \n     individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, \n     habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming \n     yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \n     your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \n     preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever \n     may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be \n     abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of \n     every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the \n     rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together \n     the various parts.\n       For this you have every inducement of sympathy and \n     interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, \n     that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The \n     name of American, which belongs to you in your national \n     capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more \n     than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With \n     slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, \n     manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \n     common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence \n     and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and \n     joint efforts--of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\n       But these considerations, however powerfully they address \n     themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by \n     those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here \n     every portion of our country finds the most commanding \n     motives for carefully guarding and preserving the Union of \n     the whole.\n       The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, \n     protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in \n     the productions of the latter great additional resources of \n     maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of \n     manufacturing industry. The South in the same intercourse, \n     benefitting by the agency of the North, sees its agriculture \n     grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own \n     channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \n     navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \n     different ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of \n     the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection \n     of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted. \n     The East, in a like intercourse with the West, already finds, \n     and in the progressive improvement of interior communications \n     by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for \n     the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures \n     at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to \n     its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater \n     consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \n     indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, \n     influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \n     side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of \n     interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \n     can hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its \n     own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural \n     connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \n     precarious.\n       While then every part of our country thus feels an \n     immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts \n     combined cannot fail to find in the united mass of means and \n     efforts greater strength, greater resource, proportionably \n     greater security from external danger, a less frequent \n     interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \n     of inestimable value! they must derive from union an \n     exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which \n     so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together \n     by the same government, which their own rivalships alone \n     would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign \n     alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and \n     embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of \n     those overgrown military establishments, which under any form \n     of government are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to \n     be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In \n     this sense it is, that your Union ought to be considered as a \n     main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought \n     to endear to you the preservation of the other.\n       These considerations speak a persuasive language to every \n     reflecting and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of \n     the Union as a primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a \n     doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a \n     sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere \n     speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorized \n     to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \n     auxiliary agency of governments for the respective \n     subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It \n     is well worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful \n     and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our \n     country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its \n     impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \n     patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken \n     its bands.\n       In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it \n     occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should \n     have been furnished for characterizing parties by \n     geographical discriminations--northern and southern--Atlantic \n     and western; whence designing men may endeavor to excite a \n     belief that there is a real difference of local interests and \n     views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence \n     within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions \n     and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too \n     much against the jealousies and heart burnings which spring \n     from these misrepresentations. They tend to render alien to \n     each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal \n     affection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately \n     had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in \n     the negotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous \n     ratification by the Senate--of the treaty with Spain, and \n     in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the \n     United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the \n     suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the \n     general government and in the Atlantic states unfriendly \n     to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have \n     been witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with \n     Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure to them \n     everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \n     relations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it \n     not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these \n     advantages on the Union by which they were procured? Will \n     they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such \n     there are, who would sever them from their brethren and \n     connect them with aliens?\n       To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government \n     for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, \n     between the parts can be an adequate substitute. They must \n     inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which \n     all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this \n     momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay by \n     the adoption of a Constitution of government better \n     calculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \n     efficacious management of your common concerns. This \n     government, the offspring of our own choice uninfluenced and \n     unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature \n     deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the \n     distribution of its powers uniting security with energy, and \n     containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \n     has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect \n     for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in \n     its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims \n     of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the \n     right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions \n     of government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, \n     until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole \n     people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \n     power and the right of the people to establish government \n     presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the \n     established government.\n       All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all \n     combinations and associations under whatever plausible \n     character with the real design to direct, control, \n     counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the \n     constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \n     principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \n     faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to \n     put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will \n     of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising \n     minority of the community; and, according to the alternate \n     triumphs of different parties, to make the\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\n     public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \n     incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of \n     consistent and wholesome plans digested by common councils \n     and modified by mutual interests. However combinations or \n     associations of the above description may now and then answer \n     popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and \n     things, to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, \n     and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of \n     the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of \n     government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have \n     lifted them to unjust dominion.\n       Towards the preservation of your government and the \n     permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not \n     only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions \n     to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with \n     care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however \n     specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect \n     in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \n     impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what \n     cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which \n     you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least \n     as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of \n     other human institutions, that experience is the surest \n     standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing \n     constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon the \n     credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual \n     change from the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; \n     and remember, especially, that for the efficient management \n     of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours, a \n     government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect \n     security of liberty is indispensable; liberty itself will \n     find in such a government, with powers properly distributed \n     and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \n     than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand \n     the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the \n     society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to \n     maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the \n     rights of person and property.\n       I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in \n     the state, with particular reference to the founding of them \n     on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more \n     comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner \n     against the baneful effects of the spirit of party, \n     generally.\n       This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, \n     having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. \n     It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or \n     less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the \n     popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly \n     their worst enemy.\n       The alternate domination of one faction over another, \n     sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party \n     dissension, which in different ages and countries has \n     perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful \n     despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and \n     permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \n     gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and \n     repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or \n     later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more \n     fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the \n     purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\n       Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \n     nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the \n     common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are \n     sufficient to make it the interest and the duty of a wise \n     people to discourage and restrain it.\n       It serves always to distract the public councils and \n     enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community \n     with ill founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the \n     animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally \n     riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence \n     and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the \n     government itself through the channels of party passions. \n     Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to \n     the policy and will of another.\n       There is an opinion that parties in free countries are \n     useful checks upon the administration of the government and \n     serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within \n     certain limits is probably true--and in governments of a \n     monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not \n     with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \n     popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a \n     spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it \n     is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for \n     every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of \n     excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to \n     mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it \n     demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a \n     flame, lest instead of warming it should consume.\n       It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a \n     free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with \n     its administration to confine themselves within their \n     respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise \n     of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The \n     spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all \n     the departments in one and thus to create, whatever the \n     form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of \n     that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \n     predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy \n     us of the truth of this position. The necessity of \n     reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by \n     dividing and distributing it into different depositories \n     and constituting each the guardian of the public weal \n     against invasions by the others, has been evinced by \n     experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our \n     country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be \n     as necessary as to institute them. If in the opinion of \n     the people the distribution or modification of the \n     constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it \n     be corrected by an amendment in the way which the \n     Constitution designates. But let there be no change by \n     usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the \n     instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which \n     free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always \n     greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or \n     transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n       Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \n     prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. \n     In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who \n     should labor to subvert these great pillars of human \n     happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and \n     citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, \n     ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \n     trace all their connections with private and public felicity. \n     Let it simply be asked where is the security for property, \n     for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious \n     obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of \n     investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution \n     indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \n     without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence \n     of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason \n     and experience both forbid us to expect that national \n     morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\n       It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a \n     necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed \n     extends with more or less force to every species of free \n     government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with \n     indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the \n     fabric?\n       Promote then, as an object of primary importance, \n     institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In \n     proportion as the structure of a government gives force to \n     public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be \n     enlightened.\n       As a very important source of strength and security, \n     cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use \n     it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by \n     cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely \n     disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much \n     greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the \n     accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \n     expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to \n     discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have \n     occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the \n     burden which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of \n     these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is \n     necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate \n     to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that \n     you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment \n     of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there \n     must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not \n     more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that the intrinsic \n     embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper \n     objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to \n     be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct \n     of the government in making it, and for a spirit of \n     acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the \n     public exigencies may at any time dictate.\n       Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; \n     cultivate peace and harmony with all; religion and morality \n     enjoin this conduct, and can it be that good policy does not \n     equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, \n     and, at no distant period, a great nation, to give to mankind \n     the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always \n     guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt \n     that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a \n     plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might \n     be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be, that \n     Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a \n     nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is \n     recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \n     Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n       In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential \n     than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against \n     particular nations and passionate attachments for others \n     should be excluded and that in place of them just and \n     amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. The \n     nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or \n     an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \n     slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which \n     is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its \n     interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes \n     each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of \n     slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \n     when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence \n     frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody \n     contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \n     sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \n     calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates \n     in the national propensity and adopts through passion what\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\n     reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \n     animosity of the nation subservient to projects of \n     hostility instigated by pride, ambition and other sinister \n     and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps \n     the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n       So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for \n     another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the \n     favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary \n     common interest in cases where no real common interest exists \n     and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the \n     former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the \n     latter, without adequate inducement or justification. It \n     leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of \n     privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure \n     the nation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting \n     with what ought to have been retained and by exciting \n     jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the \n     parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives \n     to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \n     themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or \n     sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium, \n     sometimes even with popularity, gilding with the appearances \n     of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference \n     for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the \n     base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or \n     infatuation.\n       As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such \n     attachments are particularly alarming to the truly \n     enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities \n     do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice \n     the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to \n     influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a \n     small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the \n     former to be the satellite of the latter.\n       Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure \n     you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free \n     people ought to be constantly awake, since history and \n     experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most \n     baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to \n     be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument \n     of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \n     against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and \n     excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate \n     to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even \n     second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, \n     who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable \n     to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \n     usurp the applause and confidence of the people to \n     surrender their interests.\n       The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign \n     nations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have \n     with them as little political connection as possible. So far \n     as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled \n     with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.\n       Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have \n     none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in \n     frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially \n     foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in \n     us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the \n     ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary \n     combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\n       Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us \n     to pursue a different course. If we remain one people under \n     an efficient government, the period is not far off when we \n     may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may \n     take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at \n     any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when \n     belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \n     acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \n     provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest \n     guided by justice shall counsel.\n       Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why \n     quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by \n     interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, \n     entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European \n     ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n       It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances \n     with any portion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we \n     are now at liberty to do it, for let me not be understood as \n     capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements (I \n     hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private \n     affairs, that honesty is always the best policy)--I repeat it \n     therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine \n     sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be \n     unwise to extend them.\n       Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable \n     establishments, on a respectably defensive posture, we may \n     safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary \n     emergencies.\n       Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are \n     recommended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our \n     commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand: \n     neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; \n     consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and \n     diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce but \n     forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \n     order to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights \n     of our merchants, and to enable the government to support \n     them--conventional rules of intercourse, the best that \n     present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \n     temporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or \n     varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \n     constantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to \n     look for disinterested favors from another--that it must pay \n     with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept \n     under that character--that by such acceptance it may place \n     itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \n     nominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude \n     for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \n     expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. \n     It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just \n     pride ought to discard.\n       In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old \n     and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the \n     strong and lasting impression I could wish--that they will \n     control the usual current of the passions or prevent our \n     nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the \n     destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that \n     they may be productive of some partial benefit, some \n     occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate \n     the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of \n     foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of \n     pretended patriotism--this hope will be a full recompense for \n     the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been \n     dictated.\n       How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been \n     guided by the principles which have been delineated, the \n     public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness \n     to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance of my own \n     conscience is that I have at least believed myself to be \n     guided by them.\n       In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my \n     proclamation of the 22d of April 1793 is the index to my \n     plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your \n     representatives in both houses of Congress, the spirit of \n     that measure has continually governed me, uninfluenced by any \n     attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n       After deliberate examination with the aid of the best \n     lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, \n     under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to \n     take--and was bound in duty and interest to take--a neutral \n     position. Having taken it, I determined, as far as should \n     depend upon me, to maintain it with moderation, perseverence, \n     and firmness.\n       The considerations which respect the right to hold this \n     conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I \n     will only observe that, according to my understanding of the \n     matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the \n     belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.\n       The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, \n     without anything more, from the obligation which justice and \n     humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which it is free \n     to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and \n     amity towards other nations.\n       The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will \n     best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With \n     me, a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to \n     our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions \n     and to progress without interruption to that degree of \n     strength and consistency which is necessary to give it, \n     humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n       Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \n     unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too \n     sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may \n     have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently \n     beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which \n     they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my \n     country will never cease to view them with indulgence and \n     that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its \n     service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent \n     abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon \n     be to the mansions of rest.\n       Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and \n     actuated by that fervent love towards it which is so natural \n     to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his \n     progenitors for several generations, I anticipate with \n     pleasing expectation that retreat, in which I promise myself \n     to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in \n     the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of good \n     laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \n     heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, \n     labors and dangers.\n\n                                              Geo. Washington,\n\n                                                    United States,\n                                              19th September 1796.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about what people \nall across the country are talking about; that is, the high price of \nenergy, what people are paying at the pump. I just returned from a week \nin Alaska. It is fair to say that in a State such as ours, that is as \nrich as we are with energy wealth, we are being killed by energy \nprices.\n  So I wanted to comment on some of the statements the President made \nover the weekend and Friday when he spoke to the country about energy. \nI have to tell you, I was pleased to hear the President say he is \njoining us in an ``all-of-the-above approach'' to energy. I think that \nis good news. It is certainly something I have been saying ever since I \narrived in the Senate.\n  It is about domestic production, it is about efficiencies and \nconservation, and it is about renewables. So that is good. We heard the \nPresident say we need to be doing more with oil and gas. You are not \ngoing to find any disagreement with me. Wind and solar, nuclear, \nbiofuels, efficiency, this is all good, but the problem we are seeing \nis the words coming from President Obama are not matching his actions \nwhen it comes to what we can be doing with our own domestic production.\n  I will speak specifically to oil and gas. The actions coming out of \nthe administration, whether through this budget or through some of the \nother proposals pushing for higher taxes, higher royalties on the \nindustry, when we think about what goes on with the oil and gas leases \nin the gulf, we have certainly seen the impact flow down there.\n  In Alaska, we have been pushing, pushing aggressively for 4 years now \nto get the OCS leases advanced through exploration with Shell, not only \n4 years in the process but billions of dollars into a process. We are \ngetting closer, but we are not there yet. With the National Petroleum \nReserve Alaska, an area that has been designated by the Congress to \nexplore for production activity, it took almost 2 years to get a bridge \nacross the CD 5, an area where we have an opportunity to continue our \nexploration--but 2 years to get a simple permit for a bridge.\n  We all know ANWR has been locked up for decades now. There is \nincredibly wealthy potential there. Look at the decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline coming out of this administration. When it comes \nto other areas that are supposedly in ``all of the above,'' nuclear--as \nmuch as we might have hoped that this was enjoying a renaissance, we \nhave seen the decision on the shutdown of Yucca Mountain from this \nadministration, the issues as they relate to access to uranium in \ncertain parts of the country.\n  The rhetoric is not necessarily matching what we are seeing coming \nout of the administration. This is what is so disturbing to a person \nlike me who comes from an area where we have so much to give, so much \nto offer.\n  The President, in his words, said, ``There are no quick fixes to this \nproblem.'' I agree. I absolutely agree. That is why instead of focusing \non what could be perceived as a quick fix, such as releasing oil from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we need to be focusing on the long-\nterm solution. I keep going back to 1995 when the House and the Senate \npassed ANWR. It was vetoed by the President shortly thereafter.\n  Prices at the pump back then were $1.07 at the pump. The average \nprice today is $3.65. Think about where we would be if that action had \nnot been vetoed; if the Alaska pipeline, which is now less than half \nfilled, were at full capacity with oil coming out of ANWR.\n  Just yesterday a colleague of ours from New York sent a letter to \nSecretary Clinton asking her to pressure Saudi Arabia to pump more oil. \nIn his letter to the Secretary, he said,\n\n       I urge the State Department to work with the Government of \n     Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production, as they are \n     currently producing well under their capacity.\n\n  Well, our pipeline is certainly well under capacity at 600,000 \nbarrels a day. When we were pushing it through at full tilt, we were \nover 2 million barrels a day. That is exactly what the Senator from New \nYork has asked Saudi Arabia to do. We could be doing it from Alaska. We \ncould be doing it from this country with our people gaining access to \nour resources, and we are not doing that.\n\n  The President said the Republican plan is just to drill, drill, \ndrill. He said: We hear this every year. Well, why do we hear this \nevery year? We hear it because it is part of the solution. It is not \nthe whole solution, but it is part of the solution, in addition to \nconservation, efficiency, renewables, and other areas of our domestic \nproduction. But drilling is part of the solution. It should not just be \npart of the rhetoric.\n  The President said, and I would agree:\n\n       The American people are not stupid on this. They know that \n     we are not just going to be able to snap our fingers and have \n     oil coming out of ANWR or having oil coming out of the OCS in \n     the Chukchi or the Beaufort.\n\n  They know it takes a while. They know in some cases it might take \ndecades to come. So why would we not start now? If we had started in \n1995, think about where we would have been.\n  He said, ``There are no short-term silver bullets.'' Once again, I \nagree. But there is a long silver bullet in Alaska, and that is our \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline that has been moving oil for 30 years now for \nthis country. That silver bullet could be filled, and it would be \nhelping this country just as we are asking for help from Saudi Arabia.\n  The statement that I think most upset me this weekend was the \nstatement that the President made when he said: Some politicians see \nthis--being higher oil prices--as a political opportunity. He repeated \na quote that ``Republicans are licking their chops,'' and stated, \n``Only in politics do people root for bad news.''\n  Well, the people of my State are not rooting for bad news when it \ncomes to higher energy prices. I will tell you, I am a little offended \nby the President's statement. I would invite him to come to Alaska, \nspend a week with me, go to where I was last Saturday in Fairbanks \nwhere people are paying $4.29 for their home heating oil. My sister \npays over $1,000 a month for home heating fuel to fill her tanks. She \nlives within 20 minutes of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. You can see it. \nYou can drive by it, this line that is half full, and it is not, again, \nbecause we are running out of resources. It is because we have been \nlocked out of ANWR, we have been delayed on NPRA, and we are still \nwaiting on OCS. There are certainly plenty of leases out there. But it \nis getting the permits out of this administration that has been holding \nus back from doing more, from doing more to help the people of Alaska \nand to help the people of this country.\n  Last month I was out in Bethel in southwest Alaska. There was a \nnative elder who came to a little gathering we had. He is from Eek, AK. \nHe was telling me that he pays $7.46 for home heating fuel in the \nvillage of Eek. That is how they stay warm. When I was there in \nJanuary, the average temperature for that month was about 20 degrees \nbelow zero. He said he has to buy his fuel 10 gallons at a time because \nthat is all he can afford. Then when he does not have any more money, \nhe goes out looking for fire wood for he and his wife. This gentleman, \nas I said, is an elder, probably 70 years old. But that is how he is \nliving. High energy prices for him are not an opportunity.\n  Go up to Nome. All eyes of the Nation were on Nome several weeks back \nwhen the Coast Guard cutter was escorting the Russian fuel tanker, the \nRenda, to get to Nome to provide fuel for the community of Nome and the \nsurrounding villages because the winter ice had come in and the winter \nbarge had not been able to make it in with the fuel.\n  When I was in Nome that afternoon, the price for gas at the pump was \n$5.43; the price for diesel was $5.99.\n  But it was projected that if they weren't able to fill their tanks, \nthey would see the prices go up to over $9 a gallon. Think of what that \ndoes to your ability to live. Thankfully, the Coast Guard and the fine \nmen and women there were able to see that the community and the \nvillages were taken care of.\n  I was in Yakutat on Wednesday, a small community that is not \naccessible by road, as most of our communities aren't. There in \nYakutat, they are paying 54 cents a kilowatt hour for energy. Most of \ntheir power is diesel-generated\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\npower--54 cents. That is for the businesses that get a subsidy from the \nState of Alaska for 30 cents a kilowatt hour. The small grocery store \nwe visited paid $10,000 for its energy prices in January alone--$10,000 \na month for a little grocery store. They are paying $5.19 a gallon \nright now, but it is going up with the next fuel barge that comes in.\n  Alaskans in villages who rely on diesel for their power can pay \nbetween 40 and 45 percent of their income for their energy costs. \nCompare that to the rest of the country, where you are looking at \nbetween 3 and 6 percent of your income going toward energy. We are \npaying almost 50 percent in some of our villages.\n  Mr. President, I don't view high oil prices as a political \nopportunity and neither do my constituents. What we view as an \nopportunity is the resource our State holds--a resource that we \ncontinue to be denied access to that opportunity. We learned late last \nweek that the USGS has come back with an estimate that the shale oil in \nAlaska would come close to 2 billion barrels of oil. ANWR's estimate is \nabout 10.6 billion barrels. In the OCS, we anticipate over 26 billion \nbarrels of oil. We have the resources. We have the ability to access \nthe resources and to do so in an environmentally safe way. This needs \nto be part of an all-of-the-above solution, in addition to everything \nwe do with renewables and our efficiencies and conservation. We must be \ndoing more domestically. Alaska holds the opportunity.\n  Again, I agree with the President that there is no short-term fix, \nbut if we don't get started today, there is not going to be a tomorrow \nfor communities such as Yakutat and Eek and Bethel and Fairbanks. We \nhave to get started today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from Alaska \nwho is seeing this battle of the high price of gasoline firsthand in a \nState that could contribute greatly to the country's solution to the \nproblem if the President and administration would but let it. I was led \non a trip by her father several years ago to the northern part of \nAlaska, where there are huge untapped reserves that literally, if they \nhad been allowed to be sent to the lower 48 at that time, could have \nsignificantly ameliorated the problem we have today. I appreciate her \ncomments. We will talk more about that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1036-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1036-S1037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARNED SUCCESS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, President Obama has ignited a national debate \nabout the meaning of fairness and American values. In his campaign \nnarrative, ``fairness'' means greater redistribution of income by the \nFederal Government, and expanding government control over the economy \nrepresents what he calls a ``renewal of American values.'' He argues \nthat income inequality is the ``defining issue of our time''--his \nwords--and that it prevents many Americans from enjoying their right to \npursue happiness.\n  While the President cloaks his rhetoric in the language of liberty--\nand often misconstrues quotations from Presidents Lincoln and Reagan in \nthe process--his interpretations of key American concepts and values \nare shallow, materialistic, and distortive of the true American dream.\n  We don't need more government interventionist and redistributionist \npolicies, which reduce freedom, in order to achieve greater measures of \nfairness and to pursue happiness. Having the government arbitrarily \ndecide how much money should be taken from person A and given to person \nB is not fair in any sense of the word, nor does it make Americans \nhappier. Indeed, even though America has become a much wealthier \ncountry during the last few decades and average income is higher, \nstudies show that happiness levels have remained unchanged. In 1972, \nfor example, 30 percent of Americans described themselves as happy. In \n2004, 31 percent of Americans described themselves that way. That is \nbecause, contrary to what President Obama suggests, the key determinant \nof lasting happiness and satisfaction is not income; rather, it is what \nAmerican Enterprise Institute president Arthur Brooks calls ``earned \nsuccess.'' People are happiest when they have earned their income, \nwhatever the level. When the government tries to take all of the \ntrouble out of life by taking care of our every need, it makes earned \nsuccess that much harder to achieve.\n  In his 2010 book ``The Battle,'' Brooks describes the connection \nbetween earned success and happiness:\n\n       Earned success gives people a sense of meaning about their \n     lives. And meaning also is key to human flourishing. It \n     reassures us that what we do in life is of significance and \n     value, for ourselves and those around us. To truly flourish, \n     we need to know that the ways in which we occupy our waking \n     hours are not based on mere pursuit of pleasure or money or \n     any other superficial goal. We need to know that our \n     endeavors have a deeper purpose.\n\n  Earned success is attained not simply through one's vocation but also \nthrough raising children, donating time to charitable or religious \ncauses, and cultivating strong relationships with friends and family. \nThat is why successful parents and more religious people tend to be \nvery happy.\n\n  The earned success that comes from doing a job also explains why \nself-made millionaires and billionaires continue to work hard after \nthey have earned their fortunes. These people are driven by the \nsatisfaction that comes from creating, innovating, and solving \nproblems. In many cases, they are making products or providing services \nthat improve our quality of life. They are not content merely to rest \non their laurels and enjoy their wealth; they want to continue \nexperiencing the pride and satisfaction that comes from earned success.\n  The importance of earned success also explains why people who win the \nlottery usually wind up depressed when they discover that the \nexcitement of being rich and buying things wears off fast. The same is \ntrue of recipients of other sources of unearned income. Studies show \nthat welfare programs don't make people happier. We need them to help \nsome people to subsist, but they don't yield true happiness or \nsatisfaction because the money is not earned.\n  If earned success is the path to happiness, public policies should be \ngeared toward promoting opportunity and freedom for everyone. No \neconomic system does more to promote earned success and freedom than \nfree market capitalism. As social scientist Charles Murray writes in \nhis new book, ``Coming Apart'':\n\n       All the good things in life . . . require freedom in the \n     only way that freedom is meaningful: freedom to act in all \n     arenas of life, coupled with responsibility for the \n     consequences for those actions.\n\n  In a true free market system, everyone is guaranteed equal rights and \nopportunities under the law, all individuals and institutions play by \nthe same rules, and the government acts primarily as a neutral umpire, \nnot a redistributor of income or a venture capitalist. Property rights \nare upheld, contracts are enforced, and hard work is rewarded. As \nBrooks points out, free enterprise is the only economic system that \naddresses the root causes of poverty by enlarging the economic pie \nrather than allowing government officials and bureaucrats to decide how \nto slice the existing one.\n  The President's concept of fairness is different from what most \nbelieve. I recently read an anecdote that helps illustrate the \nfundamental disagreement about the difference between ``fair'' and \n``earned.'' Two siblings are fighting about who gets the last cookie. \nThe brother says he should get it because his sister has already had \ntwo and that is not fair. The sister responds that she helped make the \ncookies, so she earned it. The brother believes it is fair to equalize \nrewards, regardless of effort. The sister beliefs in meritocratic \nfairness--that forced equality is unfair. Those of us who believe in \nthe ultimate fairness of the free market subscribe to the sister's view \nof meritocratic fairness. She earned it.\n  Free market capitalism is the most fair system in the world--and the \nmost moral. It is premised on voluntary transactions that make both \nsides happy by meeting their needs. Unfortunately, the past few years \nhave shown us what unfair economic policies look like.\n  When the government picks winners and losers in the marketplace, it \nis being unfair. When it rewards certain\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\ncompanies or industries for ideological reasons while effectively \npunishing and demonizing others, it is being unfair. That is crony \ncapitalism. When it shapes a corporate bailout to favor organized labor \nover secured debtholders, as the Obama administration did in the \nChrysler bailout, it is being unfair. When it plays venture capitalist \nand gives a taxpayer-funded $545 million loan guarantee to a doomed \ncompany such as Solyndra, it is being unfair. When it makes the Tax \nCode even more complex and even more tilted in favor of special \ninterests, it is being unfair. When it adopts financial regulations \nthat institutionalize ``too big to fail,'' putting taxpayers on the \nhook, it is being unfair. I could go on, but you get the point. Does \nanyone really think America's economic system is ``fairer'' today than \nin January 2009?\n  Is it fair that, after the first 3 years of the Obama administration, \nthe poor are poorer, the poverty rate is rising, the middle class is \nlosing income, and 5.5 million fewer Americans have jobs to do than in \n2007? Is it fair that the three counties with the highest median family \nincome happen to be located in the Washington, DC, area? Finally, is it \nfair that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans are constantly being \nattacked by the President even though they now pay nearly 40 percent of \nall Federal income taxes and the richest 10 percent pay two-thirds of \nall Federal taxes? These are some of the questions Stephen Moore \nrecently posed in the Wall Street Journal.\n  If the President wants to continue claiming that his policies are \nfostering economic ``fairness'' and ignoring the virtues of the free \nenterprise system, then let the debate begin.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1037-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1037-S1038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM H. GRAY, III\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to honor William H. \nGray, III.\n  As I have every year since my election to the Senate, starting back \nin January 2007, I have come to the floor at this time of the year in \ncommemoration of Black History Month.\n  This year we are privileged to honor a man whose outstanding \naccomplishments are of vital importance to African Americans as well as \nto all of America. For his entire life Bill Gray has been a minister \nand a shepherd for his congregation, his constituents, historically \nBlack colleges and universities, and to all Americans in need of a \nstronger voice. I have known Bill Gray for a quarter of a century, and \nI know his life's work is a testament to a single principle, one that \nhas infused all of his work at the Bright Hill Baptist Church in \nPhiladelphia, as a Member and leader in Congress, and with the United \nNegro College Fund.\n  Bill believes in the principle of a ``whole ministry,'' that the \nchurch must tend to all the needs of its entire congregation. Bill grew \nup learning that the ministry was not just something one did on Sunday \nmorning but, rather, the action one took in the streets on issues \nranging from housing to economic justice to excellence in education. \nBill has called his position as pastor of the Bright Hope Baptist \nChurch the most important job he has ever had, one that cultivated the \nskills and priorities that have shaped his life's work.\n  Today, I am proud to share some of the achievements that have \nresulted from Bill Gray's dedication to a ``whole ministry.''\n  Bill grew up in a family of educators and ministers who taught him \nthe value of both professions to empower others. He was born in the \nState of Louisiana to parents who were both educators. His father was \npresident of two historically Black colleges: Florida Normal and \nIndustrial College and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical School. His \nmother was both a high school teacher and served as dean of Southern \nUniversity in Baton Rouge, LA.\n  When Bill was 8 years old, his grandfather passed away and the family \nmoved from Louisiana back to Philadelphia, PA. There in Philadelphia, \nBill's father assumed his own father's position as pastor of the Bright \nHope Baptist Church in north Philadelphia, and Bill cemented his roots \nin that community. He has spoken of the powerful impact of those years, \nmoving from a region where Jim Crow laws reigned to a large northern \ncity where his family had strong ties to other clergy and community \nleaders. Because of de facto segregation in housing at the time, north \nPhiladelphia was a neighborhood with African Americans from all walks \nof life, including many role models for the young Bill Gray.\n  Hobson Reynolds across the street was the leader of the Elks. Cecil \nB. Moore, a future member of the city council and head of the NAACP of \nPhiladelphia, lived two doors down from Bill's family at the time. \nOther neighbors included the renowned architect Frederick Messiah and \nSadie Alexander, the first woman of any race to obtain a Ph.D. in \neconomics in the United States of America.\n  Of course, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a frequent visitor to Bill \nGray's home at that time, as were Dr. King's parents who were close \nfamily friends of Bill Gray's family. Both the elder and younger Kings \nas well as other ministers influenced Bill's understanding of the \n``whole ministry'' and encouraged his education and career as a \nminister.\n  Bill graduated from Simon Gratz High School and went on to Franklin \nand Marshall College. When Bill considered leaving Franklin and \nMarshall before graduation to join civil rights protests in the South, \nDr. King encouraged him to stay in school and to hone the skills \nnecessary to continue the struggle later in life. This idea of \neducation as a key to African-American advancement would guide Bill for \nthe rest of his life.\n  Bill graduated from Franklin and Marshall, and in 1966 he obtained a \nmaster's degree in divinity at Drew Theological Seminary and in 1970 a \nmaster's degree in theology from Princeton Theological Seminary. While \nat Drew, Bill's talents were recognized by the prestigious Union \nBaptist Church in Montclair, NJ, and he was later chosen to be a pastor \nthere as well. The King family presided over the installation ceremony.\n  In his first parish, Bill Gray worked to serve the ``whole \ncommunity,'' advocating aggressively for the needs of his congregation \nand the community's most vulnerable members. As the city of Montclair \nundertook urban renewal, he helped to form a development corporation to \nensure that relocation resulted in safe, decent housing for his \nparishioners and their neighbors. This issue of housing hit Bill Gray \npersonally when he tried to rent an apartment while studying at \nPrinceton and was told the unit was unavailable. He sensed immediately \nthat it was because of his race, and he found a friend who was White \nwho volunteered to go look at the apartment, at which point the \nlandlord said it was open.\n  Bill filed a lawsuit and for the first time sought damages for the \npsychological impact of discrimination. While the monetary award was \nsmall, his victory in the suit set a precedent that those who \ndiscriminated based on race could be held liable for monetary damages.\n  In 1971 Bill married Andrea Dash, with whom he has raised three sons, \nWilliam IV, Justin, and Andrew. In 1972 Bill's father died unexpectedly \nand tragically, and the congregation of Bright Hope Baptist Church \ncalled on Bill to return home as the new pastor. Bill was reluctant to \ngo back as the preacher's son, but two church elections finally \nconvinced him to return. He became the third generation of his family \nto serve as pastor of Bright Hope. Under his leadership, the \ncongregation quickly grew to over 4,000 souls.\n  Bill also taught as a professor at Jersey City State College from \n1968 to 1969, St. Peter's College in Jersey City from 1970 to 1974, \nMontclair State College from 1970 to 1972, and Rutgers University in \n1971. He also continued his important advocacy on fair access to \nhousing, and he cofounded the Philadelphia mortgage plan to help low-\nincome individuals obtain homes.\n  This dedication to helping his community and concern about their \nwelfare led him back to the political\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\nworld. In 1976 Bill ran an underdog campaign to challenge Congressman \nRobert N.C. Nix, a long-time congressional incumbent. Despite a close \ndefeat in 1976, Bill launched another campaign in 1978 and successfully \nearned nomination and election to Congress.\n\n  The U.S. House of Representatives provided another pulpit from which \nBill could pursue his ``whole ministry,'' and he did not squander the \nopportunity. He said:\n\n       If you can pastor a black Baptist Church, maneuvering in \n     Congress is easy. It's nothing compared to the choir, the \n     usher board, the deacon board. You run a volunteer \n     organization and you run it on persuasion.\n\n  Despite his lack of previous formal political experience, after \nwinning the 1978 primary election Bill started working to persuade \nother Members of Congress from his party to support him in committee \nelections. Through dogged determination, thoughtful strategy, and a \nclear explanation of his goals, Bill earned himself the freshman seat \non the policy and steering committee which sets committee assignments \nfor the party and influences policy. This established him as a rising \nstar and a friend to many other incoming Members of Congress whom he \nhelped land desirable committee spots.\n  Bill obtained seats on the following committees: the District of \nColumbia Committee, the Budget Committee, the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, and later a seat on the Appropriations Committee, the Joint \nCommittee on Deficit Reduction, and the House Administration Committee. \nLeaders of the Congressional Black Caucus elected Bill Gray as its \nsecretary, and in his second term he served as the vice chairman of the \ncaucus.\n  In Congress, he acquired a reputation as a thoughtful, honest, and \neffective leader in a diverse party, often building surprising \nalliances as he maintained his commitment to budgets that provided for \nthe neediest Americans.\n  Bill rose quickly through the ranks of leadership during his 12 years \nin Congress. In 1985 he assumed the chairmanship of the Budget \nCommittee just 6 years after the time he was elected. Just a few years \nlater, in 1988, he was elected to chair his party's House caucus, and \nthen in 1999 he became the House majority whip, the third ranking \nleadership in the House of Representatives.\n  While serving in Congress, Bill remained an active minister, tightly \nconnected with his district in Philadelphia through his actions on the \nissues for which he fought. I just happened to be a constituent of \nBill's in 1982 and 1983 when I was serving in the Jesuit Volunteer \nCorps in north Philadelphia, and I know at that time he returned to \nBright Hope Baptist Church twice a month to preach, and in Congress he \nsupported the programs upon which his constituents and his congregation \nrelied.\n  In a time of concern about fiscal discipline, Bill believed that \ncompassionate spending was also critical and said:\n\n       A balanced budget is good for the country, poor and the \n     affluent alike. I seek a budget that doesn't sacrifice \n     programs for the poor and minorities, one that is fair and \n     equitable.\n\n  He produced budgets in line with his priorities, challenging \nopponents to produce spending cuts that did not hit the most \nvulnerable. On the Foreign Affairs Committee, Bill championed aid for \nAfrica and sponsored a bill to provide aid to African villages as well \nas appropriations to ensure minority-owned business participation in \nAfrican aid programs. Bill took a strong and early stand against the \nEthiopian Government and its role in making the famine worse. He was \nalso a prominent critic of the South African apartheid regime.\n  In 1991 Bill Gray made a bold transition to minister in a new way on \na topic of paramount importance to him, his family, and others. Of \ncourse, that topic was higher education.\n  He said at the time, and I am quoting:\n\n       Woodrow Wilson used to say, ``My constituency is the next \n     generation,'' and, you know, that's why I left Congress, \n     because my constituency, really, is the next generation.\n\n  He accepted the position as president and CEO of the United Negro \nCollege Fund, the so-called UNCF, a philanthropic organization that \nhelps more than 60,000 minority students each year to obtain a higher \neducation. The United Negro College Fund not only manages 400 \nscholarship and internship programs which benefit 10,000 students but \nalso provides operating funds for 38 historically Black colleges and \nuniversities. Tuition at these colleges averages 30 percent less than \ntuition at similar universities.\n  Bill Gray has said he wanted to support historically Black colleges \nand universities during a period when Black students were choosing to \nattend a wider range of colleges. During Bill's 12 years as president \nand CEO of the United Negro College Fund, his success in supporting \nthese institutions was unprecedented--and that is an understatement. \nBill sought innovative ways to attract new investment and increase \nexisting funding. By the time he left the United Negro College Fund 12 \nyears later, Bill and his team had raised more than $1.54 billion. To \nput this in context, UNCF had raised a total of $3.3 billion in its 67-\nyear history.\n  He found new ways to solicit donations, increase the amount of in-\nkind contributions, and solicited from previously untapped foundations \nand individuals.\n  In 1999, Bill Gray secured a $1 billion grant from the Bill and \nMelinda Gates Foundation to advance minority students' access to higher \neducation in the science, math, engineering, and education fields. This \ngrant created the Gates Millennium Scholarship Program and marked the \nlargest philanthropic donation in the history of higher education in \nthe United States of America. Bill's success at the United Negro \nCollege Fund put higher education within reach and ensured brighter \nfutures for thousands of students across America.\n  We know, and those who know him know, that Bill Gray has never rested \nand he is never satisfied with one job at a time. While leading the \nUnited Negro College Fund, he was asked by President Clinton in 1994 to \nlead the efforts to restore democracy in Haiti. His work there earned \nhim the Medal of Honor from the President of Haiti.\n  After leaving the Fund in the year 2004, Bill started Gray Global \nStrategies, Inc., and has served as director on multiple corporate \nboards including Dell, JPMorgan Chase, and Pfizer. He has also served \nas vice chairman for the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care and \nhas served on the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. He is \ncurrently the chairman of Gray Global Strategies, a worldwide business \nconsulting and government affairs strategies firm.\n  Bill Gray has said that he has ``always been taught by my folk, \nparents, grandparents, that service is a sort of the rent you pay for \nthe space you occupy. And so, what I've tried to do is direct my life \ntowards service based on faith and commitment and social justice.''\n  Well said by a great leader, Bill Gray.\n  In the Senate today we express our gratitude for the excellent work \nof Rev. Bill Gray, Congressman Bill Gray, and you could add a few other \ntitles as well. We express that gratitude for the excellent work of his \n``whole ministry,'' a commitment that has touched literally millions of \nmen, women, and children across the world. His vision and achievements \nhave reached far beyond the walls of his church and the Capitol where \nwe stand today. We honor him on behalf of the people of the Bright Hope \nBaptist Church, the U.S. Congress, historically Black colleges and \nuniversities, and many more people around the world. We commend Bill \nGray today. I congratulate him. We look forward to seeing him with us \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read the nomination of Margo \nKitsy Brodie, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of New York.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the order is such that \nthe vote will be at 5:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is actually for 60 minutes of \ndebate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be at \n5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, certainly if the ranking member comes to \nthe floor and wishes to change that, I would not object.\n  Earlier this month the Senate finally ended a four-month and two-day \nfilibuster of the confirmation of Judge Adalberto Jordan and he is now \nthe first Cuban-American to serve on the Eleventh Circuit. We also \nfinally ended the five-month filibuster of the nomination of Jesse \nFurman, a former counselor to Attorney General Mukasey, and he is now a \nconfirmed Federal trial judge in the Southern District of New York.\n  The Majority Leader should not have had to file cloture petitions for \nthe Senate to vote on these outstanding judicial nominations. Senate \nRepublicans have filibustered nine of President Obama's judicial \nnominations despite the fact that he has reached out to both Republican \nand Democratic home state Senators and nominated qualified, \nideologically moderate men and women to fill vacancies on our Federal \ncourts.\n  Before I turn to the nomination of Margo Brodie, another nomination \nthat should have been confirmed last year after being reported by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously in October, I want to spend a \nmoment reflecting on Senate Republicans' treatment of Jesse Furman. \nJudge Furman was a Federal prosecutor who also served as a top legal \nadvisor to Attorney General Michael Mukasey during the George W. Bush \nadministration. He was involved with the prosecutions of the Times \nSquare bomber, the infamous Russian spies, and a Pakistani scientist \nwith ties to Al Qaeda whose actions were responsible for the 1998 \nbombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He has impeccable \ncredentials including having clerked for Justice David Souter on the \nUnited States Supreme Court. Based on his superior qualifications and \nbipartisan support, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his \nnomination last September unanimously, without a single Republican \nSenator dissenting.\n  His nomination, like so many others, was then subjected to \nobstruction and delay. From the start of his term, Republican Senators \nhave applied a double standard to President Obama's nominees. Senate \nRepublicans have chosen to depart dramatically from the long tradition \nof deference to home state Senators on district court nominees. \nInstead, an unprecedented number of President Obama's highly-qualified \ndistrict court nominees have been targeted for opposition and \nobstruction. That approach is a serious break from the Senate's \npractice of advice and consent. Since 1945, the Judiciary Committee has \nreported more than 2,100 district court nominees to the Senate. Of \nthese 2,100 nominees, only six have been reported by party-line votes--\nonly six total in the last 65 years. Five of those six party-line votes \nhave been by Republican Senators against President Obama's highly-\nqualified district court nominees. In fact, only 22 of those 2,100 \ndistrict court nominees were reported by any kind of split roll call \nvote at all, and eight of those, more than a third, have been by \nRepublican Senators choosing to oppose President Obama's nominees. \nPresident Obama's nominees are being treated differently than those of \nany President, Democratic or Republican, before him.\n  Despite his qualifications and bipartisan supporters, Jesse Furman's \nnomination was stalled for more than five months by Senate Republicans. \nWhen the Majority Leader was able to break through and schedule debate \nand a vote, I saw something else I have not seen until recently. \nRepublican Senators who had supported the nomination after studying it \nfor months when it was before the Judiciary Committee for a hearing and \nvote, flipped and changed their votes.\n  In total, 34 Republican Senators voted against this highly-qualified \nnominee. I am at a loss as to why. It appears that Senators decided to \nignore Jesse Furman's record and be swayed by mischaracterizations of a \nbrief he had written in a religious freedom case or by something he \nwrote as an 18-year old freshman in college. I urge Senators, as I have \nfor years, not to listen to the extreme special interests but to make \ntheir own judgments. I suspect that in this case it was the last-minute \ncampaign by narrow special interests groups that accounted for the \nnumber of negative votes.\n  Today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of another highly-\nqualified, consensus nominee to the Federal bench. Margo Brodie has \npracticed law for 20 years including working as a Federal prosecutor in \nBrooklyn for the last 12. She has risen from the ranks of Assistant \nU.S. Attorney to Deputy Chief of General Crimes to Deputy Chief of the \nCriminal Division. Ms. Brodie has successfully prosecuted numerous \ncases on matters ranging from violent crimes and drug offenses to white \ncollar crimes. She has also led public corruption cases, successfully \nprosecuting criminals who embezzled funds and tried to bribe government \nagencies in her home state of New York.\n  Ms. Brodie has the support of both her home state Senators and was \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 6, 2011, without \na single dissent. She has demonstrated her commitment to the rule of \nlaw, her legal abilities and knowledge of the law. It is past time for \nthe Senate to confirm this outstanding African-American woman to the \nFederal bench.\n  Margo Brodie is one of 20 judicial nominations approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee still awaiting a final vote. Fifteen of these \nnominations have been pending since last year and should have been \nconfirmed before the end of last year. Eighteen of these nominees \nreceived strong bipartisan support from the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  These nominees should be confirmed without further delay. Now in the \nfourth year of President Obama's first term, the number of judicial \nvacancies remains at 85. That is nearly double what they were at this \npoint in President Bush's administration. One hundred and thirty \nmillion Americans live in circuits or districts with a judicial vacancy \nthat could be filled if Senate Republicans would vote on judicial \nnominees that have already been voted on by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and are stalled awaiting final Senate consideration.\n  The Senate is more than 40 confirmations behind the pace we set \nconfirming President Bush's judicial nominees in 2001 through 2004. For \nthe second year in a row, the Senate Republican leadership ignored \nlong-established precedent and refused to allow votes before the \nDecember recess on the nearly 20 consensus judicial nominees who had \nbeen favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ultimately, it is the American people who pay the price for Senate \nRepublican's unnecessary and harmful delay in confirming judges to our \nFederal courts. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are \nseeking their day in court to find seats on one in 10 of those courts \nvacant. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of \nmedical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait for years \nbefore a judge hears his or her case. When two small business owners \ndisagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a \ncourt to resolve their dispute.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to stop the destructive delays that \nhave plagued our nominations process. I urge them to stop the slow-\nwalking of highly-qualified, consensus nominees. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we turn to the nomination of Margo \nBrodie to be U.S. District judge for the Eastern District of New York. \nThis will be the 69th judicial nominee of President Obama which the \nSenate has confirmed during this Congress. Overall, more than 70 \npercent of President Obama's judicial nominees have been confirmed.\n  We continue, on the Senate floor and in the Judiciary Committee, to \nwork together to reduce the number of judicial vacancies. We have held \n21 nominations hearings during this Congress, with 80 judicial nominees \nappearing at those hearings. All in all, over 85 percent of President \nObama's judicial nominees have received a hearing. We will hear from \nadditional judicial nominees later this week.\n  So even as we continue to hear concerns about the judicial vacancy \nrate and claims of obstructionism, I would note we are making progress \nas we continue to confirm judicial nominees. But let me emphasize again \nthat for more than half of the vacancies, including those designated as \n``judicial emergencies,'' the President has failed to submit a \nnomination. So critics need to look at the beginning of the process \nwhen commenting on vacancies.\n  I would like to say a little about our nominee today. Ms. Brodie \nearned a BA from St. Francis College in 1988, and her JD from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1991. She began her legal \ncareer as an assistant corporation counsel for the City of New York in \n1991. In this role, she defended city agencies and officials in the \nperformance of their duty to manage municipal affairs.\n  In 1994, Ms. Brodie became an associate with Carter, Ledyard & \nMilburn, representing clients in various types of civil litigation.\n  Since 1999, Ms. Brodie has served as an assistant U.S. attorney with \nthe Eastern District Court of New York. From May 2005 to March 2006, \nshe served as a legal advisor to the Independent Corrupt Practices and \nOther Related Offices Commission, ICPC, in Nigeria. From 2006 to 2009, \nshe supervised new AUSAs in the General Crimes Section in roles as \ndeputy chief and chief. In October 2009, she became the counselor to \nthe Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office. In her current \nposition as deputy chief of the Criminal Division, she supervises over \n100 Criminal Division AUSAs in the areas of public corruption, civil \nrights, terrorism, organized crime, gang violence, narcotics \ntrafficking, and business and securities fraud. She also advises the \noffice on legal policy and management issues.\n  Ms. Brodie has received a majority: ``Qualified;'' minority: ``Well \nQualified'' rating from the American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President. I rise today in strong support of the \nhistoric confirmation of Margo K. Brodie to the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York.\n  Frankly, at this point, all of our nominees deserve special \nattention. With one out of 10 seats on the Federal bench still vacant, \nand with 14 nominees with strong bi-partisan support pending since last \nyear, we should be focused today on confirming more than one nominee. \nHowever, Margo Brodie's nomination is of singular importance to my \nfellow New Yorkers, and to this country.\n  First--to put it simply her presence is desperately needed on one of \nthe busiest benches in the country, one that handles some of our most \nimportant cases.\n  Second, Margo Brodie will be, by all accounts, the first Caribbean-\nborn nominee in our Nation's history to be confirmed to an Article III \ncourt.\n  As I've said many times, I look for three qualities in judicial \ncandidates: excellence, moderation, and diversity. When excellence and \nmoderation are both present in a candidate--as they are with Ms. \nBrodie--diversity is a bonus: a bonus that benefits the bench, the \ncommunity, and Americans everywhere who might otherwise think that this \nkind of public service, or even a law degree, was beyond their reach. \nIn fact, I think that a candidate like Ms. Brodie is especially well-\nqualified for a lifetime appointment to the court.\n  She has chosen to make her home in this country, and in the \nneighborhoods served by this court in the Eastern District of New \nYork--and she has already graced her community with outstanding and \ndedicated service. In 1996, Ms. Brodie became a citizen of the United \nStates in the very court house where she would serve as a judge. I \ncan't think of a more fitting candidate to serve the people in \nBrooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and all the communities in between than \nsomeone who pledged her allegiance to this country just footsteps from \nwhere she will uphold the rule of law in her chosen country.\n  Ms. Brodie's story is a classic immigrant's story--one that is born \nfrom our country's finest and deepest traditions. It's a story that \nspeaks to our acceptance of people from all over the world who want to \ncome to the United States to work hard, prosper, and become a part of \nour social fabric.\n  Ms. Brodie was born in St. John, Antigua. She and her brother Euan \nwere raised by a single mother, with the help of her mother's parents \nand 14 siblings. After graduating from high school at the age of 16, \nshe attended St. Francis College in Brooklyn, where she worked full \ntime and graduated magna cum laude.\n  She went on to the University of Pennsylvania Law School. After \ngraduating from law school, Ms. Brodie worked for the New York City Law \nDepartment for three years, where she learned how to litigate cases. \nShe then spent five years at Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, founded in 1854 \nand known for alums that include Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n  Ms. Brodie returned to public service in 1999 by joining the United \nStates Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York, one of \nthe preeminent U.S. Attorney's offices in the Nation.\n  She rose to become Deputy Chief and then Chief of the General Crimes \nUnit, where she trained more than half of the current AUSA's in the \nEastern District. Since 2010, she has been the deputy chief of the \nCriminal Division, supervising all 100-plus criminal AUSAs in cases \ninvolving public corruption, civil rights, business and securities \nfraud, terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, and many other areas.\n  Ms. Brodie has also lent her considerable talents to training \nprosecutors and law enforcement officers on the rule of law in many \ndeveloping countries. She spent 10 months in Nigeria as a legal advisor \non behalf of the DOJ's overseas training program, and has conducted and \nassisted in human trafficking training for prosecutors in the Bahamas, \nJordan, Swaziland, and Tanzania.\n  In a short while, Ms. Brodie will be confirmed as a Federal judge--an \nhonor she deserves and a position that she has more than earned. I am \nproud to have supported her nomination, and to vote for her today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Margo Kitsy Brodie, of New York, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Eastern District of New York.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. \nLandrieu), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), and the Senator from Michigan (Ms. \nStabenow), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Portman), and the Senator from \nLouisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1041-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1041-S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAKING THE SENATE WORK\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, some of the Senators on the \nRepublican side have other appointments to make, so I am going to defer \nmy remarks until the end of the colloquy.\n  What I will do is first state why we are here; second, go to Senator \nIsakson, then we will go to Senator Pryor, and then back to Senator \nCollins, if we may.\n  Madam President, our leaders--the Democratic leader, the majority \nleader and the Republican leader--sometimes get criticized. They have \nhard jobs, and we recognize that. We also recognize that they can't do \ntheir jobs unless we do our jobs well. So tonight what some of us \nthought we would do, on the Democratic side and the Republican side, is \napply a management principle that is called ``catching people doing \nthings right.''\n  We believe the majority leader and the minority leader, Senator \nInouye, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator \nCochran, the ranking member, are doing things exactly right when they \nsay it is their intention to try to move all 12 of our appropriations \nbills through the Appropriations Committee and get them to the floor so \nwe can deal with them before the next fiscal year starts. We are here \nnot just to compliment them but to pledge to them our support in \nhelping them achieve that goal.\n  There are many important reasons we should do that, but basically it \nis our constitutional responsibility to appropriate money. It is a time \nwhen we need to save every penny we can. This is our best opportunity \nfor oversight, and it is also good management, and it allows the Senate \nto do what the Senate ought to do, which is consider legislation, have \na hearing, ask questions, cut out what ought to be cut out, add what \nought to be added, vote on it, bring it to the floor, amend it, debate \non it, and pass it or defeat it. That is what we should be doing. Only \ntwice since 2000 has this Senate actually considered every single one \nof the 12 appropriations bills. Only twice, in 2001 and 2005. So it has \nbeen 7 years since we considered every single one of the appropriation \nbills, which is our most basic responsibility: appropriate and \noversight.\n  That is why we are here tonight. Our leaders have said this is what \ntheir intention is. We are here to say: You are right. Congratulations. \nWe compliment you, and we are here to help you succeed. Because it is \nvery difficult for our leaders to succeed if they don't have any \nfollowers making it possible for them to achieve their goals.\n  I would defer to Senator Isakson and then to Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank Senator Alexander for giving me a moment on the \nfloor.\n  It is ironic that when I received the call last week asking if I \nwould participate in this colloquy, I was traveling my State doing \ntownhall meetings. I was near Ooltewah, TN, on Thursday night, north of \nDalton, GA, and Murray County. We had a townhall meeting, and this \nfellow in the back of the room raised his hand when it came time for \nquestions.\n  He said: Mr. Isakson, I have got a question for you. I said: What is \nthat? He said: Last night, my wife and I amended our budget that we \nestablished in December for this year because some things have not gone \nso well, and we had to recast how we are spending our money so we \nwouldn't go any further in debt than we already are. Why can't you all \ndo the same thing? ``You all,'' talking about us.\n  A few days earlier in Dublin, GA, a great, prosperous town in south \nGeorgia, a similar question was asked by a Chamber of Commerce director \nwho couldn't understand why the Federal Government and the Congress of \nthe United States could not wrap their arms around fiscal \nresponsibility, have a budget, and have appropriations acts that come \nto the floor, are debated, are amended, and the spending of the United \nStates of America's government is spent like the households of the \nUnited States of America have to spend their money.\n  So I commend Senator Alexander and Senator Pryor for bringing this to \nthe floor, and I want to commend our leaders for making affirmative \nstatements about the desire to bring the 12 appropriations bills to the \nfloor of the Senate, debate them, let us amend them, and let us bring \nthem together.\n  If you think about it, in the last 3 years we have had a situation \nwhere we either had continuing resolutions or omnibus appropriations. \nDuring a difficult period of time where we have had deficits of $1.3 \ntrillion to $1.5 trillion, we haven't taken the time to debate how we \nare spending our money, where we are spending our money, and doing it \nin the context of what we call on the floor regular order. In fact, it \nis not hard to understand why only 11 percent of the American people \nview the Congress as favorable, because they can't understand our \ninability to do what they have to do themselves. The IRS doesn't take \nexcuses on April 15 if you are not ready. You have got to be ready. If \nyou are a business and you file as an LLC or a sub S corporation, on \nthe 15th of January, the 15th of April, the 15th of June, and the 15th \nof September, you file a quarterly tax return; and if you don't, you \nare held accountable.\n  We are now going into our fourth year, and it looks as though for the \nfirst time in the last 3 years we are going to have debate on the floor \nof how we spend the American people's money. I commend Senator \nAlexander and Senator Pryor, and I thank our leadership for making the \nstatement of the desire to do so. I have already seen Senator Inouye \nand I have already seen Senator Cochran working diligently in the basic \nappropriations subcommittees to see to it that those bills come to the \nfloor. I think it is time we do our business just as the American \npeople do their business, and I commend Senator Alexander and Senator \nPryor for calling for this colloquy tonight.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, since we have other Senators on the \nfloor, what I would like to do is withhold my comments until a few of \nour other colleagues have a chance to speak, if that would be \npermissible to Senator Alexander?\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from Arkansas. The Senator from Maine is here. She has another \nappointment, and I await hearing what she has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first let me thank the Senator from \nArkansas and the Senator from Tennessee for their usual courtesies but \nalso for organizing this colloquy on the Senate floor this evening. I \nam very pleased to join my colleagues as we talk about the goal of \ntaking up the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bills in what we in the \nSenate call the regular order.\n  What does that mean? As the Presiding Officer is well aware, that \nmeans we would bring up each of the individual bills, they would be \nopen to full and fair debate, they would be amended, they would be \nvoted on, and we would avoid having some colossal bill at the end of \nthe year that combines all the appropriations bills. Those bills are \noften thousands of pages in length. A lot of times some of the \nprovisions have not had the opportunity to be thoroughly vetted. They \nreally are not very transparent. They contribute to the public's \nconcern about the way we do business here in Washington.\n  I too join in commending the majority leader, the Republican leader, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the vice chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee for their commitment to try to work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion so each and every one of the \nappropriations bills can be brought before the full Senate so that we \ncan work our will on each of these bills. I suggest that it is \nimportant to the Senate as an institution that we achieve this goal. It \nis also important for the American people to see that we can carry out \nour constitutional responsibility. Most of all, it is important for \nrestoring trust in government that we work together in an open and \nbipartisan manner to establish priorities, to make the tough spending \ndecisions that will be required, and to complete on time the work the \nConstitution requires of us.\n  I believe it is important to remember that these bills make important \ninvestments in research, economic development, infrastructure, our \nnational defense, education, and health care, and that these bills not \nonly create jobs now when they are needed most but also establish the \nfoundations for future growth.\n  Just as important to our economic future is the need to rein in \nFederal spending. Our work must continue toward the goal of getting our \nnational debt under control.\n  The best way for us to achieve these goals is for each and every one \nof the appropriations bills to come before the full Senate and for us \nto work our will on those bills. That is the way the Senate should \noperate. It is the way we must operate in order to restore the faith of \nthe American people in this institution.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by thanking Senator Alexander and Senator \nPryor for initiating this colloquy tonight. This is the way we can come \ntogether, and America will be better for it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner, has arrived. He, with Senator Pryor, has been very active in \nthe last several months in working across party lines to try to make \nthe Senate function more effectively. I would leave it to Senator Pryor \nas to what comes next.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If it is agreeable with the Senator from Tennessee, I will \nask the Senator from Virginia to say a few words. We understand he has \na pressing engagement. I don't think there is anything more pressing \nthan when it is your wife's birthday, so he would like to say a few \nwords, if that is agreeable to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas and my \ngood friend from Tennessee for initiating this effort. Again, as a \nrelatively new Senator--in fact, I jumped the line. I apologize. As the \nPresiding Officer would support, it is only in the interest of family \nvalues; if I were not getting to my wife's birthday in about 30 \nminutes, I would be able to give more extended remarks.\n  As a Senator who has only had the opportunity to serve in this body \nfor 3 years, I hear my more senior colleagues talk about the old days \nor the days when the Senate took up in an orderly fashion the business \nof the people and debated it in vigorous fashion but came to conclusion \non issues that confronted the country. We have done some of that in the \nyears when I came in with the Presiding Officer. There were issues of \nmajor importance that we have debated. But too often in recent times, \nwe have not had the favor of those kinds of debates.\n  While we can disagree about many of the grave issues of the day, as a \nformer businessperson, I know there is nothing more important than to \ngive predictability to the enterprise we call the Federal Government. \nThe way we do that is by passing spending bills--the appropriations \nbills--where hard choices are made about which programs to fund, which \nprograms not to fund.\n  Like my friend the Senator from Tennessee and both Senators from \nArkansas and the Presiding Officer, I have enormous concerns about our \ndebt and deficit. We are going to have to make hard choices. But if we \nare going to make those choices, we need a full and vigorous debate, a \ndebate where amendments are offered, where procedural tactics are not \nused to slow that debate, and where the will of the Senate is enacted.\n  I understand that the majority leader and the Republican leader have \nreached some accommodation to try to start a new way of business, and \nthe first step of that business should be having us, in a fair and \norderly process, debate appropriations bills, make those hard choices, \nand move on.\n  I again thank my colleagues for their courtesy but particularly thank \nthe Senator from Tennessee and the senior Senator from Arkansas for \nbringing us together on the floor to lend our voices. This might even \nbe like a volunteer fire department where Members of the Senate can \nrush down on an issue of importance. I heard the call that there were \nSenators down here talking on this important issue, and I am glad to \nadd my voice to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I congratulate the Senator from Virginia, who has \nworked in many different ways to try to get a result here. People say: \nI see your goal is to try to be more bipartisan. My goal is not to be \nmore bipartisan, my goal is to get a result. I learned in the public \nschools of Maryville, TN, how to count, and if you need 60 votes to \nsucceed and we have only 47 over here and only 53 over there, we have \nto find some things we agree on if we are ever going to get a result. \nWe can start with these appropriations bills, which are our basic work.\n  Not only is the senior Senator from Arkansas here today, having been \na part of these discussions to try to help the Senate be a more \neffective institution, so is the other Senator from Arkansas. I look \nforward to hearing his remarks. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I am also here tonight to compliment my \nSenate colleagues, Senators Inouye and Cochran, and the members of the \nAppropriations Committee as well as Majority Leader Reid and Republican \nLeader McConnell as they commit to do their best to pass all 13 \nappropriations bills. I also thank the senior Senator from Tennessee \nand my senior Senator from Arkansas for making this possible.\n  I do think it is very important. Each one of us in this Chamber owes \nit to the American people to work together to help our country today \nand build a path for success in the future. Our Founding Fathers laid \nthe foundation that allows the Senate to function effectively and \nefficiently, but it requires working together. The American people are \ntired of the finger-pointing that has stalled much of the work they \nsent us here to do, but today I am hopeful that we are seeing the light \nat the end of the tunnel which starts with trying to enact all 13 \nappropriations bills through a regular process this year.\n  I again applaud Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader McConnell, \nSenators Inouye and Cochran, and also the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee for agreeing to do their very best to move the appropriations \nbills forward.\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n  Determining how we spend our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is the \nbasic responsibility for Congress. We know tough choices will have to \nbe made on the appropriations bills, but moving forward is the right \ndecision. This is an important step to reducing government spending and \nhelping to balance our budget while investing in programs upon which \nAmericans have come to rely. Moving forward on these bills returns the \nSenate to its proper function and provides a framework of spending so \nthe American people can see and understand where their hard-earned \nmoney is going, as the Senator from Georgia alluded to earlier.\n  In recent days Members of Congress have worked together to find \nsolutions to the troubles Americans are facing. This level of \ncooperation was evident in headlines. One newspaper reported that \n``Washington is talking again.'' This should not be the exception. This \nneeds to be the rule.\n  I am hopeful that the agreement on moving forward with the \nappropriations bills through our regular process sets a new trend that \nwill become a standard. I can see from the people who have spoken \nbefore me tonight and those who are waiting to talk that there is \nwidespread bipartisan support for these efforts to continue.\n  Our leaders' efforts show the proper way for the Senate to function, \nand I encourage all of my colleagues to come together, not only to help \nmove forward on these bills, but also, as we work through regular order \nof the Senate, that will help us get our economy and our country back \non track.\n  I again thank our senior Senator from Tennessee and my senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, before we go to the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas, I wish to thank Senator Boozman for his comments and his \nattitude. I am not a bit surprised that, since he arrived here, he has \nbeen a very constructive force in the Senate, interested in results. He \nwas a member of the University of Arkansas football team back in the \nearly 1970s, and he knows what a team is. He knows that if the quarter \nback calls a play and everybody runs in a different direction, nobody \nscores.\n  It is good to have him here. He is an excellent Member of the Senate. \nI thank him for his participation tonight and yield to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. The only thing I would say is that Senator Pryor reminds \nme that I was a Razorback two stadiums ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I likewise wish to thank Senator Boozman. \nHe keeps calling me the senior Senator. We are partners. He does great \nwork for the State of Arkansas, and I appreciate his leadership. \nAlthough he has been here a short time, his presence has definitely \nbeen felt in the Senate already, and I look forward to working with him \nas long as we are both here. I really appreciate him being here tonight \nbecause the hour is late in Washington. It is after 6:30 now, and I \nappreciate him carving out some time.\n\n  Article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution simply states that ``no \nmoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of \nappropriations made by law.'' Like a lot of things in the Constitution, \nit is a fairly simple statement, but it is loaded with importance. We \ncan all talk about this clause as a power given to Congress in the \nConstitution, and I think that is true, but I also classify it as a \nresponsibility.\n  As a congress, it is our responsibility to write annual \nappropriations laws to fund the government's commitments to its \ncitizens. It is our responsibility to do that. The principle of an \nappropriation is a basic rule of governing, and I think a lot of people \nwould agree that we have lost sight of many of the basics around here. \nI believe the basics are important, and I would like to get back to \nthem, which includes the Senate--and hopefully the House--passing the \nannual appropriations bills through what we call the regular order.\n  This is where I wish to thank the two leaders, Senator McConnell and \nSenator Reid, because they have a commitment. They have committed to \neach other--with the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee--that we will try to get back to regular order \nand do things the way we should be doing them around here and should \nhave been doing them around here all along.\n  Regular order is something we talk about in this Chamber, but it is \nsomething many Members of the Senate, unfortunately, have never \nexperienced. Last year the Senate Appropriations Committee dutifully \npassed all 12 individual appropriations bills. Yet, when they came to \nthe floor, gridlock struck and the Senate was not able to pass these \none by one as we should have. In fact, the last time we passed them one \nby one was in the year 2006, and even in that year the Congress did not \nget them done on time.\n  What the leaders are talking about now is getting them moving through \nthe appropriations subcommittee and the full committee and bringing \nthem to the floor. As we say in regular order, let the Senate debate, \namend, and vote on these as we go. Hopefully we will get all of these \ndone on time and in the normal order, as we should. The last time \nCongress completed all of the appropriations bills one by one and on \ntime was in fiscal year 1995. So we have not done a very good job, and \nthis is one of the things that I think really frustrate the American \npeople. It is beyond time that we get serious about this \nresponsibility.\n  Here again I wish to thank Senators Reid and McConnell for their \nleadership. I think we see our leaders acting like leaders and trying \nto get things moving for the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bills, but \nI must say we all recognize this is easier said than done. We all know \nthat. I want them to know they have many, many of their colleagues who \nsupport them in this goal of getting all of the appropriations bills \ndone as we should.\n  We have two very respected and accomplished Senate leaders here on \nthe floor, but we also have two very accomplished and respected \nSenators who run the Appropriations Committee. We could all talk a long \ntime tonight about the chairman and ranking member, and I am confident \nthat if as a Chamber we stand behind them and stand behind the two \nleaders, we can break this cycle of inaction here in the Senate.\n  The good news for this year is that we have already enacted into law \nour top-line spending number--in technical terms, people call that a \n302 A allocation--so we know how much money we can spend on \ndiscretionary programs under the law. We passed that law last year. \nEven though we didn't pass a budget resolution, we did pass the Budget \nControl Act, and that total for spending is $1.047 trillion, and that \nis $686 billion for security building and $361 billion for nonsecurity. \nThis was supported by 74 Members in this Chamber, 269 Members down the \nhall in the House, and it was signed into law by the President. It is \nnow the law of the land, so we now have our top-line spending numbers \nin law, and hopefully that will help us jump-start the fiscal 2013 \nspending appropriations process regardless of what happens to the \nbudget resolution, which, by the way, totally supports getting a budget \nresolution passed. Nonetheless, we have this already in law for this \nyear.\n  I would like to end by saying that I believe we can pass all 12 \nappropriations bills this year, and I think we can do it in a way that \ngives us ample opportunity for input, debate, and a chance to amend. \nWhether or not we will pass all 12 spending bills on time this year \nwill depend on whether Members of Congress will have the will to get it \ndone. I think the American people want us to get it done. They want to \nsee us work together.\n  Madam President, if I could ask a question of the Senator from \nTennessee through the Chair, I would like to get his reflections, \nbecause Senator Alexander has been around this place for a long time, \ngoing back to Senator Howard Baker, who was one of the legends in the \nSenate, and Senator Alexander was able to work with him and for him and \nsee the Senate as it ran differently back in those days.\n  Madam President, I would like to ask through the Chair why Senator \nAlexander thinks it is so important that we get our appropriation bills \nback on track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis leadership. I will answer his question to the best of my ability.\n  I suppose some people may be watching and say what we are talking \nabout is a lot of ``inside baseball.'' Well, it would be like telling a \nbunch of people that talking about singing at the Grand Ole Opry is \n``inside baseball.'' This is what we do.\n  I went out to see Johnny Cash at the House of Cash when I was \nGovernor of Tennessee many years ago, and I didn't know quite what to \nsay to him, and so I said: Johnny, how many nights do you appear on the \nroad?\n  With that big-old deep voice of his, he said: Oh, about 200.\n  I said: My goodness. Why do you do that?\n  He looked at me and said: That is what I do.\n  Well, this is what we do or at least what we are supposed to do. I \nmean, we are elected by the people from Arkansas, Tennessee, North \nCarolina, and all over this country expecting us to get results. They \nsent us up here to put the country first, put our States next, and try \nto lead us in the right direction. We have our partisan differences, \nbut in the end one of the things we are supposed to do is to \nappropriate dollars. It says in the Constitution, section 9, article I, \nthat ``no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of \nappropriations made by law.'' That is us. So this is what we do.\n  In addition to that, we are supposed to oversee the spending of that \nmoney. This is not the whole budget, this is only about 38 percent of \nit, but it is over $1 trillion. And at a time when we are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend, maybe the people of this country have a \nright to expect that we take up each one of these 12 appropriations \nbills, that we have our hearings on them, and that we oversee the \nspending. If we want to add to nuclear modernization, we vote on that, \nand if we want to cut Solyndra, we vote on that, but we do our job of \nappropriations, and we do our job of oversight.\n\n  Now, Senator Pryor, the senior Senator from Arkansas, asked me what \nmy reflection was upon this Senate. I have seen it for a long time. I \ncame here in January of 1967 as a very young man with a newly elected \nRepublican Senator from Tennessee, Howard Baker, and I watched him for \na long time. There are many lessons in having watched the Senate for a \nlong time, but one of the lessons is that the leaders cannot lead \nwithout any followers. This is a body that operates by unanimous \nconsent. If one of us wants to grease the tracks, the train runs off \nthe tracks. That is the way it works. So the leaders are not going to \nbe able to complete what their stated intention is, which is to take \nthese 12 appropriations bills, bring them through the committees by \nlate April, early May--the House is doing the same thing, we \nunderstand--and then bring them to the floor so that we have a chance \nto consider them, to expose them to the light of day, amend them, vote \non them, and pass them or reject them. That is what we do, as Johnny \nCash said about his 200 nights on the road, and we should be doing it.\n  The idea that we have not taken these 12 appropriations bills and \nbrought them to the floor but 2 times since the year 2000 is a bad \ncommentary on this body. It means it doesn't function the way it should \nfunction. I do think it functioned better in the 1970s and 1980s. When \nSenator Byrd and Senator Baker were the Democratic and Republican \nleaders, they would get unanimous consent agreements to bring bills to \nthe floor. The minority would allow that, and the majority would allow \na lot of amendments until people got tired of voting. But they could \nnot have done that just by themselves. Senator Byrd and Senator Baker \nwere very good leaders, but they could not have gotten that done if the \nSenators themselves didn't make it possible for the leaders to succeed.\n  So I am delighted to see this discussion. I see the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is here, and I would be interested in her comments. My \nfeeling is that there are a large number of Republicans--and I believe \na large number of Democrats--who prefer to see the Senate work together \nto get results. I mean, we worked pretty hard to get here, and the \npeople of Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina expect us to get \nresults, so here is a chance for us to do that. I believe our leaders \nare saying: OK, let's get this done. And we are saying: Senator Reid, \nSenator McConnell, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, we are going to \nhelp. We know it will not always be peaches and cream. There will be \nproblems, but, as Senator Warner talked about a volunteer fire \ndepartment, maybe when the bell rings and we all show up, we will make \nthe Senate more effective and we will be more effective.\n  Let me stop my remarks for a moment and yield to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, who has been a regular participant in the discussions \nwe have had about how we can make the Senate be a more effective \ninstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join this colloquy and to \nhear the Senator from Tennessee and the senior Senator from Arkansas \nwork together on this issue. I think it is something of prime \nimportance. Just as Senator Isakson went across Georgia this past week, \nI was in many cities and communities in North Carolina, and people are \nconcerned, as he said, with such a low approval rating of the Congress. \nThey are asking us: Why can't you work together? And, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee said, when we have 47 Members in one party and 53 \nMembers in the other party and today we need 60 votes in order to get \nsomething done, we are going to have to work together in this Chamber. \nThat also means the Senate and the House are going to have to come \ntogether and have conferences that actually work so we can get \nlegislation passed--in the case we are talking about right now, getting \nthe 12 appropriations bills passed.\n  When I was in the North Carolina Senate, I was one of the cochairs of \nthe Budget Committee. We know how to do this. We know how to get things \ndone. Obviously this is a much bigger piece of the pie up here, but it \nis important to the people throughout our country that we work together \nto get these bills passed. So I am very pleased to hear this debate and \ncolloquy and the commitment we have standing here and talking about and \npledging to work together.\n  I am pleased that Senator Inouye, the chairman of this committee, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Cochran, are putting this together and \nbringing this forward. I applaud both the Senator from Tennessee and \nthe Senator from Arkansas for holding this colloquy and bringing this \nout so the American people can hear what we are talking about and the \ncommitment to move forward.\n  I thank the Chair. We are here to make this place work, to make our \ncountry work better every day. We are going to have our differences of \nopinion. The way the Senate is structured, we should bring the bill to \nthe floor and offer amendments. Let's have a vote. Let's have our \ndifferences of opinion. When we don't do that, we are not doing our \njob.\n\n  I see the Senator from South Carolina has arrived. I wish to say this \nto him: For the last 45 minutes, we have had a stream of Democratic and \nRepublican Senators who have come to the floor and who have \ncongratulated the majority leader, the Republican leader, and the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for \nsaying we should take all 12 appropriations bills this year, bring them \nthrough committee properly, have all of our hearings, do our oversight, \nbring them to the floor, and then let's pass them.\n  More than that, we have said we know our leaders can't be leaders if \nthey don't have any followers, and it is part of our job to create an \nenvironment in which they can succeed. So we have come to the floor to \nsay that, to pledge we are going to do that. It is not just those who \ncome tonight. We represent a preponderance of Senators on our side of \nthe aisle and, I am told, a preponderance of the Democrats as well.\n  I would say to the Senator from South Carolina that the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, was here a little earlier and he said the \nexercise tonight reminded him of a volunteer fire department. I believe \nI first heard those words from the Senator from South Carolina. The \nSenator from South\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\nCarolina has seen the House of Representatives and he has seen the \nSenate and he has seen the condition of our country. I wish to yield to \nhim in this colloquy for his thoughts on what we are doing here \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, my first thought is that the American \npeople are not very impressed with what we are doing up here. We have a \ncongressional approval rating of about 10 to 15 percent. I think it \nwould help all of us if we could go back home and say: This coming week \nwe are going to be talking about the Department of Education budget; we \nare going to be talking about Veterans Affairs; we are going to be \ntalking about Energy and Water.\n  We want to be able to tell our mayors and people--county council, \ncity council, our constituents--we are going to be debating how much \nmoney we will allocate for different parts of the government, even \nknowing we are broke. I think that would resonate, I say to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  This whole idea of a volunteer fire department, when we think about \nit--particularly in the South, and I am sure it is true everywhere--\nvolunteer fire departments have citizens who have a lot of things to do \nbut feel as though if they work together to protect each others' homes \nfrom devastation by fire, that would be a good thing. They are all \nvolunteers. They don't get any money. They lower everybody's insurance \npremiums by having a volunteer fire department. I think a lot of \nMembers of the Senate feel very frustrated, as does the average person \non the street. We want to do better. So we are volunteering our \nservices here to the body so that if we will do things that make sense \nto the American people, count us in to kind of push the ball up the \nhill.\n  The good news, I say to my colleague, is our leaderships have \ncommitted to this. Without ``followship,'' it doesn't matter what they \nsay. This is going to take discipline in this body. I expect those on \nthe other side of the aisle to take votes they won't like, and I expect \nthose on this side of the aisle to take votes we won't like. But we \nhave to have some discipline about it. We want the bills to get done in \nan orderly fashion, and we want the Senate to be a Senate.\n  This comes about because Senator Warner spent a lot of time getting \nus all together. This volunteer fire department idea we have, the \nSenator from Tennessee and Senator Warner have made this happen. We had \nseveral dinners among the people here tonight to try to find a way to \nget the Senate back to doing business. I am convinced that if we could \nbring one appropriations bill to the floor, have an honest debate about \nhow much we should spend on that part of the government, have \namendments relevant and not relevant but in an orderly fashion, that \nwould be momentum to get the Senate back to being the Senate. That \nwould help us all and it would help the country.\n  I want to tell Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: Don't let this \nmoment pass. We have your back and we want to conduct the Senate in a \nway that is more traditional than is going on today.\n  I came here to do things. I think everybody who has spoken here \ntonight is telling the public and telling each other: Enough is enough. \nThis is a lousy way--to appropriate a couple three trillion dollars at \nthe end of the year in a big bill nobody reads. If you think that is a \nbroken system, we agree. We don't like the idea of passing a bill in \nthe last week of the fiscal year--3,000, 4,000 pages, whatever it is--\nand nobody knows what is in it, but that is the only way we can run the \ngovernment if we didn't go back to the normal course of business. So \nfor those who want better government, this will give us better \ngovernment. If you want to do something constructive, this gives us an \nopportunity. For those who want to set priorities, this allows you to \ndo it.\n  To the leaders of the Senate: If you will follow through with this, \nit will pay enormous dividends for the body. And to Senators Alexander, \nPryor, and others who have been in the volunteer fire department, I \nthink this is a good moment for the Senate and I am proud to be \nassociated with it, and if it happens, it will be because of what they \nhave done.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, before we go back to the Senator from \nArkansas, I have a question I wish to ask the Senator from South \nCarolina. First, I am not sure he was here when I referred to the Grand \nOle Opry. I haven't been doing that because it is in Nashville. But it \nhas occurred to me over the last several months that there is a lot \nabout what we do that is like the Grand Ole Opry. I know a lot of \nperformers of the Opry, members of the Opry. They sing and pick in \nevery little bar in the South for 20 years until finally, by skill and \nby accident, they get an invitation to join the Grand Ole Opry. What \nwould they think if they joined the Grand Ole Opry and then they \nweren't allowed to sing?\n  That is kind of the way we are in the Senate. We are lucky to be \nhere. We are political accidents in a sense. But we worked hard to be \nhere--almost all of us on both sides. So the idea of coming here, \nworking hard to be here, being elected by the people who sent us, and \nthen not being allowed to amend or vote or debate is unacceptable. That \nis what we want to do with these 12 bills.\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina reminded me of a specific example of \nthat--the deep ports in the United States. If we are going to export \nAmerican-made goods and create more jobs in our country, we are going \nto have to have deep ports. We have a real problem in the way we \nfinance that in the Federal Government, and we would be a stronger \ncountry if we could discuss that in the Appropriations Committee. If we \ndon't fix it there, we should bring it to the floor and have amendments \nand have a debate and let people see what is going on.\n  Would the Senator agree that would be a perfect example of what we \nshould be doing?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator from Tennessee picked the best \nexample I can think of simply because the Charleston harbor deepening \nis probably the No. 1 issue for the State of South Carolina.\n  The Panama Canal is going to be widened and the cargo ships that are \ngoing to be on the oceans of the world in the next few years are three \ntimes the size of the cargo ships that exist today. Shipping as we know \nit is going to change. What does that mean? It means harbors such as \nSavannah and Charleston--just name a harbor on the east coast--are \ngoing to have to be deeper to accept these ships.\n  What does it mean for shipping? Ships that would normally deposit \ntheir goods in California can now access the east coast. So east coast \nports, based on common sense and merit, have to be deepened. If we \nbrought the Energy and Water appropriations bill through the committee \nand to the floor, it would make us all think about that. Because when I \nhear the President say we want to double exports in the next 5 years, \ncount me in. It would be thousands of jobs--millions of jobs--created \nin America. How do we get those products to the customers overseas if \nour ports are not modernized to adjust to the change in shipping? Then \nit is a statement that will not bear fruit. Go to Shanghai, go to Hong \nKong and other ports, go to Mideast ports, and we are 20 years behind.\n  This is a good example of how, if we took the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, among ourselves we could create a national vision \nto deepen ports to adjust to shipping changes. If we keep continuing to \nappropriate in the last week of the session in a bill that nobody \nreads, not only will our fellow citizens think poorly of us, we won't \nhave a vision. So this is a good example of why if we took every \nappropriations bill, put it through committee and brought it to the \nfloor, we could come up with ways to make smart decisions.\n  I guess what we are talking about is that spending $2 trillion or $3 \ntrillion in a week where only four of five people know what is in the \nbill is not smart. We all did come here to have our say, and I have a \nthousand ideas about ports.\n  So, my friend in Arkansas, if the port of Charleston is deepened and \nother east coast ports are deepened and the cargo containers are three \ntimes the volume we have today, what does that mean for the Mississippi \nRiver? It means it has to be widened and deepened. Because the cargo we \nunload on\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nthe east coast has to get to the interior of the country. I want to \nhave a vision for interior ports, because one thing could affect the \nother. And the only way the Senate can make smart decisions is to break \nthe government into 12 parts, as we have been doing for a long time, \nand get back to doing business in a more traditional fashion.\n  This is a classic example: If we brought the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill to the floor, people other than me would have a say \nabout what to do, given the change in shipping. And if we don't do it \nin the normal course of business--if we keep doing this in the last \nweek of the session--we are going to be left behind as a Nation.\n  This is a great example of why we should do appropriations bills in \nthe normal course of business. If we can pull this off in 2012, it will \nnot be a lost year; it will be where we can do some good for the \npublic.\n  So I thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I have one thing to say in closing while \nmy two colleagues are still on the floor: Today, Senator Shaheen read \nWashington's Farewell Address which we have been doing in the Senate \nsince 1888. One of the reasons we do that is because President \nWashington calls to us through history to do our best.\n  We talk about this issue in South Carolina--deepening the port of \nCharleston. Certainly President Washington knew about the port of \nCharleston. It was a huge asset for this fledgling Nation of ours. He \nhad no idea about a Panama Canal. He had no idea about goods coming \nover from China. He certainly had no idea about goods coming in from \nthe west coast because at that point he was hoping we would get to \nAppalachia. He had no idea what was going to happen here. But he calls \nto us from history to do our job and accept the challenges that come \nour way.\n  The appropriations bills shouldn't be a challenge. That is nuts-and-\nbolts good government.\n  This week in Arkansas we had five townhall meetings and they were \ngreat. I got lots of good questions; a few pointed questions. My \ncolleagues know how it goes because they have participated in those as \nwell. It was great. It is democracy in action. When people can show up \nin a community and ask their Senator questions, that means the system \nis working. It is working back home, but we need to get it to work up \nhere. That is what I heard over and over this week in Arkansas, is the \nexpectations for this Congress are very low for this year. We talk \nabout a 10-percent approval rating. I am sometimes surprised it is that \nhigh.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, here is the \ngood news: It wouldn't take much to exceed expectations. But I want to \nsay to the west coast Senators that their ports need to be modernized \ntoo. They need transportation hubs around their ports. The whole \ninfrastructure regarding export opportunities in this country has \ndeteriorated because of a lack of vision.\n  Wal-Mart is a pretty good model of how business works. They get \nthousands of millions of products a day out to stores all over the \ncountry. They do it in a business fashion: FedEx--Federal Express--UPS. \nThe Federal Government is stuck in the 1950s and we need to change \nthat. I think the appropriations process is the right vehicle to do it.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That does go back to the appropriations process, because \nobviously those things require money, they take investment in our \nfuture. But the truth is if we are stymied in our appropriations \nprocess, there are a lot of good things that we can't get done. But \nwhen they go through, we can take care of the challenges that present \nthemselves around the country. We have a lot of need in this country. I \nam certainly a promoter of investing in infrastructure, and the ports \nare very important to our Nation.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his leadership in helping to make the Senate work \nand for his good example and for his giving us a specific example--the \ndeep ports--as to why it is important that we set out to do what we are \nelected to do, which is to say, the Port of Charleston and the Port of \nSavannah have to be deepwater ports if we want to keep our jobs. That \nneeds to be said in the Senate. It needs to be said in the subcommittee \nand in the full committee, and it needs to be said on the floor.\n  It is encouraging to me when Senators such as the Senator from North \nCarolina and Arkansas and Virginia from that side of the aisle, and the \nSenator from South Carolina and the Senator from Maine and the junior \nSenator from Arkansas and the Senator from Georgia on this side of the \naisle--I think we would all say firmly that while we are only several \nSenators, the words we speak are the same feelings that a large number \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle feel.\n  We want to get results. We want to do our jobs. We want to create an \nenvironment in which our leaders can succeed. We know that if we want \nto, we can do that. And we should do it because it is our \nconstitutional responsibility, because oversight is our responsibility, \nbecause it is lazy management if we allow it to go to the end of the \nyear and end up with a great big pile of bills in an omnibus or a \ncontinuing resolution, which is worse.\n\n  We need to go over spending item by item. I am on six subcommittees. \nAll three of us are on the Appropriations Committee. We will probably \nhave 30 hearings in the next 2 or 3 months. We will have a good \nopportunity to go through $1 trillion of discretionary spending and try \nto spend it wisely and to save money wherever we can.\n  One last thing: When these spending bills come to the floor and we \ndebate them and approve them, we can show the American people that \ndiscretionary spending is not the biggest problem we have with spending \nin this country. Discretionary spending is 38 percent of the budget, \nand according to the Congressional Budget Office it is scheduled to go \nup over the next 10 years at the rate of inflation. The rest of the \nbudget, which is largely our entitlement programs, is scheduled to grow \nup to four times the rate of inflation. If it does that, we will be a \nbankrupt country after about 10 or 12 years. So there is every reason \nin the world for us to bring these bills to the floor.\n  My concluding sentence is this: We congratulate the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders and the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee. We believe our job is to bring all 12 bills \nthrough committee and to the floor and pass them before the fiscal year \nstarts. We, on both sides of the aisle--those of us who have spoken and \nmany others who feel the same way--pledge our support to help our \nleaders achieve that result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander from Tennessee \nfor his leadership on this issue. He is the one who wanted to come here \nand praise the two leaders for their leadership. Again, they are \ndemonstrating leadership by reaching this agreement and trying to \nchange recent practice around here. They want to set a new standard for \ngetting it done as we are supposed to get it done.\n  So I thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee for all of his hard \nwork, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. He is working on many \nways to try to make this institution run better and to make the \nAmerican people proud of the Senate. So I thank the Senator for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1046-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1046-S1047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS CULBERTSON\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Thomas Culbertson of \nFremont, OH, for many years of outstanding leadership and service to \nThe Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center. A former college librarian \nand stockbroker, Mr. Culbertson began his service to the center in 1988 \nas a manuscripts curator and rose to the position of executive director \nin 2004.\n  Mr. Culbertson was instrumental in developing two workshop series for \neducators. The first series, ``History Links: A Partnership to Teach \nAmerican History,'' helped 300 area schoolteachers implement State \nstandards for social studies that focused on American history. The \nsecond series included three workshops for more than 200 community \ncollege faculty that focused on America's Gilded Age. Mr. Culbertson \nalso led the effort to gain\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\naccreditation for the Hayes Museum from the American Association of \nMuseums in 2002.\n  Of utmost importance to Mr. Culbertson's legacy is the $1.2 million \nrestoration of the first floor of the Hayes home to how it looked when \nour 19th President and his wife, Lucy, lived there. With the help of \nthe late U.S. Representative Paul Gillmor, the Hayes Center was awarded \na $400,000 Save America's Treasures grant through the U.S. Department \nof Interior. In addition, the center received $500,000 in State capital \nfunding, and Mr. Culbertson helped raise $300,000 in donations to pay \nfor the restoration. The project included replicating wallpaper, \ncarpets, and other features that had been altered over the years. The \nhome renovation will be completed in July 2012.\n  For his commitment to public service and the many contributions he \nhas made to the Hayes Presidential Center, I would like to recognize \nand thank Mr. Culbertson for his years of service and wish him well in \nhis retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1047-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIE O'REE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Willie O'Ree made history on the \nnight of January 18, 1958, but for too long the significance of what he \naccomplished that night went largely unacknowledged. Every American \nshould know Willie O'Ree for his rightful place in history: he is the \nJackie Robinson of hockey--the first player of African heritage to play \nin the National Hockey League.\n  Unlike Jackie Robinson's widely heralded debut with the Brooklyn \nDodgers 11 years earlier, Willie O'Ree's appearance on the ice for the \nBoston Bruins 54 years ago got little notice in the press. The New York \nTimes simply reported: ``The Boston Bruins, with a Negro, Billy O'Ree, \nin the line-up for the first time in National Hockey League history, \nscored once in every period tonight to beat the first-place Montreal \nCanadiens for the first time in eight games, 3 0.'' Sports Illustrated \nhad even less to say in its Scoreboard column: ``Boston made history by \nbringing up Quebec's Billy O'Ree, first Negro to play in NHL.''\n  But it was a milestone for hockey--and a dream come true for the 22-\nyear-old Willie O'Ree, who had spent his boyhood in New Brunswick, \nCanada--the youngest of 13 children--idolizing such NHL legends as \nGordie Howe and Maurice Richard. He liked baseball, too, landing a \ntryout with the Milwaukee Braves minor league team in Waycross, GA, in \n1956. He even got to meet Jackie Robinson on a trip his baseball team \nmade to New York in 1949.\n  Willie was as good at shortstop as he was at second base. He was good \nat the plate, too. And with his speed, he stole a lot of bases. But to \nhim, baseball was just a way to stay in shape for hockey. To him, \n``there was just something about hockey,'' he always said. He started \nskating when he was 2 years old and began playing organized hockey when \nhe was 5.\n  He explains his love of hockey in words all of us who share his \npassion for the game can appreciate. ``When I put a pair of skates on \nand a hockey stick in my hand and started maneuvering the puck,' he \nsays, ``I just became obsessed with it. I had that burning desire \nwithin me.''\n  That burning desire--that deep ambition--drove Willie O'Ree through \nalmost two minor league seasons with the Quebec Aces before being \ncalled up by the Boston Bruins for that historic game in Montreal \nagainst the Canadiens in 1958. But after that memorable night, he would \nplay only one more game with Boston before being sent back to the \nminors for the rest of the season.\n  But in 1960, Willie O'Ree was back with the Bruins for 43 games, \nincluding one memorable game at the Boston Garden in which he scored \nthe winning goal in a 3 2 victory over Montreal. It came in the third \nperiod. Willie broke away from his check, got a perfect pass from Leo \nBoivin, stick handled past two Canadiens players, then from 10 feet out \nfired a shot past goaltender Charlie Hodge. More than 13,000 Bruins \nfans jumped to their feet and gave Willie a 2-minute standing ovation.\n  That year, Willie had a total of four goals and 10 assists with the \nBruins, but that was the end of his NHL career. He spent the next six \nseasons in the Western Hockey League, then nine more seasons in the \nPacific Hockey League until he retired in 1979 at the age of 44. Most \nseasons were productive despite the fact that at 19 he had suffered an \ninjury that left him blind in his right eye. Doctors said he would \nnever play hockey again. They were wrong. With aggressiveness, \nfearlessness and speed, he scored nearly 500 goals in his 21 years \nplaying professional hockey.\n  His own impairment was no obstacle to Willie O'Ree. Neither was the \nblind bigotry of those who filled his mailbox with anonymous death \nthreats, those who screamed racial epithets at him from the stands, \nthose who even tossed black cats out on the ice, even those players who \ntook countless cheap shots at him, in a time when players did not wear \nhelmets or face shields. Willie responded the same way as Jackie \nRobinson had in 1947 when he broke the color barrier in baseball--with \nquiet strength and calm dignity. ``I just want to be a hockey player,'' \nhe said, ``and if they couldn't accept that fact, that was their \nproblem, not mine.''\n  It wasn't until 1974 that another black player, Washington's Mike \nMarson, made it to the NHL. It is undeniable that Willie O'Ree--his \ntalent and his character--opened the NHL to other minorities. But \nWillie's ground-breaking days are far from over. For the last 14 years, \nhe has served as the NHL's Director of Youth Development and ambassador \nfor NHL Diversity, part of the NHL Foundation supporting hockey \nprograms for boys and girls throughout North America. He is constantly \non the go, running clinics and speaking at schools all across the \ncontinent, teaching not only hockey but also how to live life off the \nice. He continues to spread the word that ``hockey is for everyone.''\n  We have recognized and celebrated ambassadors from all over the \nworld. We should also honor Willie O'Ree who is the ultimate ambassador \nnot just for hockey, but for dignity and respect and even courage in \nthe world of sports. The world weathers so many storms and so much \nuncertainty, but at the center of each we find people of character who \nrevive our hope and give us strength. Willie O'Ree is such a man, and \nwe are all blessed to have his strength as an example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1047-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1047-S1048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize National History Day, a yearlong academic \nprogram focused on improving the teaching and learning of history for \n6th to 12th grade students, for receiving a 2011 National Humanities \nMedal. The National Humanities medals honor achievements in history, \nliterature, education, and cultural policy. For the first time ever, a \nK 12 education program has received this prestigious award. National \nHistory Day was recognized as ``a program that inspires in American \nstudents a passion for history.''\n  Each year more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands \nof teachers nationwide, participate in the yearlong National History \nDay program. Students choose historical topics related to a theme and \nconduct extensive primary and secondary research through libraries, \narchives, museums, oral history interviews, and historic sites. After \nanalyzing and interpreting their sources and drawing conclusions about \nthe significance of their topics in history, students present their \nwork in original papers, Web sites, exhibits, performances, and \ndocumentaries. These products are entered into competitions in the \nspring, at local, State, and national levels where they are evaluated \nby professional historians and educators. The program culminates in a \nnational competition each June. National History Day programs operate \nin all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories, \nengaging students with its unique approach to the hands-on learning of \nhistory.\n  In addition to discovering the exciting world of the past, National \nHistory Day also helps students develop the attributes that are \ncritical to make them college and career ready. This includes:\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\ncritical thinking and problem-solving skills, research and reading \nskills, oral and written communication and presentation skills, self-\nesteem and confidence, and a sense of responsibility for and \ninvolvement in the democratic process. With schools spending more \nresources and time focusing on English language arts and mathematics \neducation, it is important that programs like National History Day are \nrecognized and supported to ensure students receive a quality history \nand civics education.\n  The impact of National History Day is also supported by data. A \nrecent comprehensive study by Rockman et al found that students who \nparticipate in National History Day develop a range of college and \ncareer-ready skills, and outperform their peers on State standardized \ntests across all subjects--including science and mathematics.\n  National History Day is much more than a day, it is an evidence-based \nhistory education program that gives our young people skills to succeed \nin school and post secondary careers as well as a valuable \nunderstanding of how the world they live in has been shaped by people \nand events of the past. National History Day is a unique program that \nhas benefited over 15 million students since 1982. I congratulate them \non winning the 2011 National Humanities Medal and wish them many more \nyears of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/27/senate-section/article/S1048-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 5, 2011, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on February 21, 2012, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3630.
