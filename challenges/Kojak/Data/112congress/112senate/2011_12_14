Madam President, this has become a familiar scene on \nCapitol Hill. As time ticks down to the wire, the House has sent the \nSenate yet another bill that will not pass. Meanwhile, American \nfamilies stare down a $1,000 tax increase, and on January 1 they will \nbe scrambling to afford the necessities because of Republican \nobstructionism that Americans don't understand.\n  It has become the Republican fallback play: Waste precious time \ncatering to tea party extremists when they could be working with \nDemocrats to compromise.\n  Republican leaders have already spent weeks drumming up tea party \nsupport for legislation they knew was dead on arrival in the Senate. \nNow it is time to get this vote over with so real negotiations can \nbegin to prevent a tax increase on 160 million middle-class Americans.\n  This morning I will ask unanimous consent to vote on the House-passed \nbill. Democrats were ready to vote on this legislation last night, but \nI can't set a vote at this time under Senate procedures without Senator \nMcConnell's approval. Even though we already knew the bill was dead, \nSenator McConnell wasn't ready to hold a vote on it last night.\n  That is an about-face from just a few hours before--even as recently \nas yesterday morning, Tuesday morning--and on Monday, for example, when \nSenator McConnell urged us to take up the House bill as soon as \npossible.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       My suggestion is that once this legislation comes over from \n     the House, we pass it without delay.\n\n  That is what I tried to do last night--not pass it but at least have \na vote on it.\n  Senator McConnell repeated that call yesterday morning--Tuesday \nmorning. Here is what he said yesterday morning:\n\n       I would suggest that our friends put the political games \n     aside and give the American people the certainty and the jobs \n     that they deserve. Take up the House bill, pass it right here \n     in the Senate, and send it to the President . . . without \n     theatrics and without delay.\n\n  Then yesterday afternoon Senator McConnell said:\n\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n\n       The first thing we need to find out is whether there are \n     the votes in the Senate to pass what the House has passed.\n\n  So I say to my friend the Republican leader let's find out whether he \nhas the votes in the Senate to pass what the House has passed. Let's \nvote on this now. We knew Monday the bill wouldn't pass the Senate, we \nalso knew yesterday this bill wouldn't pass the Senate, and we still \nknow it will not pass the Senate.\n  Here is why this legislation is a nonstarter. I will give 3 of about \n33 reasons: The bill cuts unemployment benefits for 1 million Americans \nat a time when there are not jobs for one out of every four people \nseeking work. It weakens safeguards that keep our air clean and our \nchildren healthy, and the President has already threatened to veto it. \nIn fact, he said he will veto it.\n  Legislation written to appeal only to the extreme rightwing of the \nRepublican Party can't pass the Senate. Republicans will see that \nagain, whenever they allow us to vote on this legislation that my \nfriend, the Republican leader, said let's vote on right away. Right \naway was last night.\n  So let's get this vote over with. Then we can begin serious \nnegotiations on how to prevent a $1,000 tax hike on American families. \nThe sooner we put this useless, partisan charade behind us, the sooner \nwe can negotiate a true bipartisan solution that protects middle-class \nworkers.\n  Madam President, there has been a lot of talk about let's get to the \nomnibus, and let's pass it. However, it is not complete. There are \nmajor issues. We have made significant progress. There are still \ncritical issues to be ironed out. There are issues that deal with \nforeign policy. There are issues that deal with the environment. There \nare issues that deal with--we have about seven or eight--what some \nwould refer to as game stoppers. We could complete that work, but it is \nsomething that is not done now.\n  There is no reason, while that work is continuing, to hold up the \nmiddle-class tax cut. Congress is not going to go home for vacation--\nremember, the bill that some want to pass, the omnibus bill, takes care \nof us, it takes care of legislators. It has Legislative Branch \nappropriations in it. So we shouldn't go home until we finish the \nbusiness of the American people.\n  Preventing a $1,000 tax increase on American families is the most \npressing business we have, and we are not going to allow Republicans in \nCongress to take care of themselves without taking care of middle-class \nfamilies as well.\n  We hope to complete this important work soon--this week. If we can't, \nwe should pass a short continuing resolution to keep the government \nopen while we work through each compromise. We have passed short-term \nCRs many times before, and we should do it again if that is what it \ntakes to prevent a tax on the middle class.\n  The bottom line is this: It is time for the two sides to come \ntogether and compromise. As I told the Speaker Monday and as I spoke on \nthe floor yesterday and I have said this to my friend the Republican \nleader the House can't pass legislation that will succeed over here \nunless they get Democrats to support their legislation. We cannot pass \nlegislation here because of how the Republicans have set not a majority \nrule but we have to get 60 votes. We can't get 60 votes unless we get \nRepublican assistance. So we need to compromise. Legislation is there \nto compromise, but it might take a little more time. Republicans should \ngive Congress a few more days to finish its job rather than rushing \nhome for vacation.\n  I have already talked about the importance of doing this legislation \nas quickly as we can. I think it is extremely important, and we \nunderstand that it could be done--the vote could take place, and it \nwould take 20 minutes to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8556-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8556-S8558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ntwo scheduled votes in the Senate, we proceed to the consideration of \nH.R. 3630, which is the House-passed legislation--the House-passed \nlegislation that, out of 435 Members of Congress, got 10 Democratic \nvotes--that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees prior to a vote on passage of the bill; that \nno amendments be in order prior to a vote on passage, and that the vote \non passage be subject to a 60-vote threshold--which my friend, the \nRepublican leader, seems to believe is the standard around here \nanymore--further, that if the bill is not passed, it remain the pending \nbusiness, and that following I be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, our \nmost immediate concern at this point is that despite Federal funding \nexpiring 2 days from now--Friday night--my friend the majority leader \nis blocking action on the funding bill to keep the government open. \nThat is our most immediate concern, and we should address it first \nbecause the deadline is literally just 2 days away. That comes first.\n  My good friend the majority leader has said shutting the government \ndown would be extreme and that it is too risky to even entertain, and \nthat issue is just 2 days away. Everyone knows the truth is that the \nbill would fund our troops, our border security, and the remaining \nfunding for the rest of the fiscal year, and it is ready to go. They \nwere prepared to sign the conference report earlier this week until \nleadership on this side said don't sign the report.\n  There is agreement on the funding bill but no agreement and no plan \nat all about how we are going to pass the payroll tax cut extension in \nthe Senate. So we ought to finish our most immediate concern first.\n  Let me repeat that our friends across the aisle have no plan, and \nsome might suggest no desire, to pass a payroll tax cut extension--the \nPresident's top priority--extend unemployment insurance or ensure \nseniors' access to medical care. They have made no attempt at all to \nproduce a bill that can pass the Senate. It is their responsibility in \nthe majority to do that. Instead, we have wasted week after week after \nweek on one senseless show vote after another--votes that one member in \nthe Democratic Senate leadership recently admitted were designed solely \nto score points on millionaires.\n  So let's deal first with the deadline that happens this Friday, 2 \ndays from now--fund the government through the rest of the fiscal \nyear--and then turn immediately to the payroll tax extension that \nexpires later in January, and let's pass the job-creating and job-\nsaving measures the House has passed.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nmajority leader's request to say as follows: that the Senate would turn \nto the consideration of the House bill relating to the payroll tax \nrepeal extension immediately after the Senate passes a conference \nreport or a bill received from the House that funds the government \nthrough the end of the fiscal year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the majority leader so modify \nthe request?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, my friend is living in a \nworld of nonreality. Let's look for a way out.\n  The House of Representatives, which has a significant majority of \nRepublicans, last week couldn't even pass a bill. That was in all the \npress. They couldn't get the votes. So what they did, in an effort to \nplacate the far right so they could pass a bill with Republican votes, \nthey stuck in a bunch of issues that are hard to comprehend--issues \ndealing with the environment that have nothing to do with this bill. \nEven a Republican Senator said that bill, standing alone, looks OK, but \njammed in with everything else it doesn't look so good. They should be \nseparate issues.\n  We have issues on the so-called omnibus or spending bill that have \nnot yet been resolved, one dealing with Cuba, a very important piece of \nlegislation in the minds of many Senators. One of the Senators who \nbelieves so strongly that this provision should be taken out is a \nRepublican Senator from Florida. We have issues dealing with the \nenvironment which are extremely important: light bulbs, coal, and many \nother issues that haven't been resolved in this so-called omnibus.\n  So, Madam President, I think everyone can see very clearly that my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle obviously want to have the \ngovernment shut down.\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\n  As I have said before, and I will say again, they have had experience \ndoing this. The presumptive Republican nominee Newt Gingrich tried that \nonce and it didn't work so well. So I don't think it is going to work \nvery well again. Everyone knows why the government is going to shut \ndown, if, in fact, it does.\n\n  We have 160 million Americans who are out there cheering for us--\ncheering for us--that we can get them the tax relief they deserve. We \nhave well more than 1 million Americans who have been out of work for a \nlong period of time who are cheering for us. We have businesspeople out \nthere who are cheering for us, that there are certain tax benefits that \nare important to creating jobs that we need to do before we leave here.\n  So, Madam President, I object and ask unanimous consent that if the \nSenate receives from the House a bill that continues funding for the \nFederal Government through December 21, 2011, it be in order for the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, to proceed \nto the bill; further, that the bill be read three times and passed, all \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard for the first \nrequest.\n  Is there objection to the second request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am not sure what the majority \nleader just said.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what I said is, I ask that if we get a \nbill from the House to have a CR, a continuing resolution, for another \nfew days, that we be allowed to take it up. Under the rules of the \nSenate and the Congress, I cannot initiate a CR here. It is a tax \nmeasure and constitutionally has to start over there. So I have said \nthat if the Senate receives from the House a bill that continues \nfunding for the Federal Government--I said through December 21--any \nreasonable time is fine with me--it be in order for me, after I talk to \nthe Republican leader, to proceed to the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we do \nnot need to do that.\n  Representative Jim Moran, Democrat of Virginia, one of the top \nmembers on the House Appropriations Committee, said this yesterday:\n\n       Our bill is done, and it should go to the president \n     immediately. . . . We're not holding it up. . . . I can't \n     speak for Harry Reid. I can't speak for him. As far as I'm \n     concerned, it should be done.\n\n  A government shutdown is 2 days away. We have an agreement based on \nwhat all the appropriators on the conference report are saying. We can \npass that and do first things first--prevent a government shutdown. I \nagree with the majority leader, a government shutdown is a terrible \nidea. He has said that repeatedly. We have all said it repeatedly. The \nway to avoid that is to get our work done. The work is done on the \nappropriations conference report. We ought to get signatures on it, and \nwe ought to pass it, and we ought to do it in the next 2 days.\n  Now, Madam President, there were a series of other competing UCs \nhere, and I am a little confused as to where we are.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object to that one, by the way, the last one we were \ndiscussing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know Congressman Moran. He is a fine man \nwho has been in Congress many, many years. But he should step over here \nand talk to Senator Menendez or Marco Rubio and see how they feel about \nCuba and the language in that bill that changes things in relation to \nhow they feel, which dramatically changes our relationship with Cuba, \nor how about the chairman of the Environment Committee, Barbara Boxer. \nSee how she feels about going back, in effect, to some saying the Dark \nAges, changing lightbulbs, or how about dealing with other \nenvironmental issues, dealing with coal. How about talking to some of \nthe other Senators on that committee.\n  The bill is not complete. I think we could complete it very quickly \nif people sat down and focused on what we need to do to get out of \nhere. But now it has not been completed. I do not care what Jim Moran \nsays or what Mitch McConnell says, the bill is not completed.\n  But, Madam President, what is obviously extremely clear, which is \nextremely clear here, my friend the Republican leader has talked for \ndays--I went through what he said on Monday, what he said on two \nseparate occasions on Tuesday: Let's vote on this bill now. That is \nwhat he said. It is obvious that something has happened in the last few \nhours that suddenly they do not want to vote on their own bill.\n  Keep this in mind: The House has passed a bill that I have said and \nnon-Democrats have said is a dead duck, DOA, dead on arrival. It is \nhere. It is dead. And they do not want to vote on it. Do you think \nmaybe they do not want to vote on it because Republican Senators are \nkind of embarrassed or ashamed of what is in that bill? I would think \nso.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say, speaking of \nembarrassment, it is that we are doing an omnibus again. The reason we \nare doing an omnibus again here on the eve of Christmas is because we \nhave not passed our appropriations bills. We have had almost as many \nshow votes in the Senate this year, roughly an equal number of show \nvotes--in other words, designed to fail, to go nowhere, to present a \ntalking point for the President in his campaign--as we have had votes \non real bills that we are supposed to pass.\n  So here we are once again. Three years this Democratic Senate has not \npassed a budget. Three years we have ended up either in omnibus or CR \nsituations. And here we are again.\n  Now the appropriators in the House and Senate have labored long and \nhard. A couple days ago, they said they were ready to sign the report. \nMy good friend the majority leader and the President said: Don't let \nthem sign the report. We might actually have to pass the bill--a \nmysterious strategy to me.\n  All I am saying here is, first things first. If the majority leader \nis convinced the House-passed bill is DOA, why doesn't he start talking \nto the Speaker about how we might actually craft a bill that can pass \nboth the Republican House and the Democratic Senate and quit wasting \nour time here in the Senate scoring points? A government shutdown is 2 \ndays away.\n  So first things first. Let's keep the government from shutting down. \nThese other measures do not expire until the end of the month. If the \nmajority leader is correct that the House bill will not pass the \nSenate, why doesn't he talk to the Speaker and work out something that \ncan pass on a bipartisan basis because, regretfully, I would say to \nmy friend the majority leader, the Republicans control the House. The \nDemocrats control the Senate, unfortunately, from my point of view. \nThis has to be worked out.\n\n  The last time I looked, Christmas is a week from Sunday. Time is a-\nwasting. We have fiddled all year long--all year long, one point-\nscoring bill after another, designed to fail, designed to divide us, \ndesigned to get no result, to give the President a talking point out on \nthe campaign trail--and here we are, a few days before Christmas, and \nthe silliness continues.\n  Now, if my friend the majority leader is so convinced the House-\npassed bill cannot pass the Senate, I would say again, talk to the \nSpeaker and work out something that can pass both the House and the \nSenate. Time is a-wasting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, talk about a diversion--that is what we \njust heard. My friend the Republican leader has talked from the very \nbeginning of this Congress that his No. 1 goal is to defeat Obama for \nreelection. That is not looking so good. Romney is stumbling, Gingrich \nis plodding along, heading now everyplace.\n  But, Madam President, because the Republican leader has caused us--\nbecause we have the rules in the Senate, which I accept--has caused us \nto focus all of our attention on my friend trying to make sure the \nPresident is not reelected, we have spent months and months on things \nthat were ordinarily done just like that.\n  Funding the government--we had numerous CRs for very short periods of\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\ntime. Finally, we were able to get that done. Then came the debt \nceiling, and we spent 3 months on that--3 months of wasting time here \nin the Senate. Never have we done that. As I indicated and has been \nspread on the record of this body many, many times, under Ronald \nReagan, the debt ceiling was raised 18 times just like that.\n  Also, Madam President, anyone who understands Washington--and there \nare a lot more people who understand Washington than the people who are \nin this Chamber--my friend says: have him--me--go deal with the \nSpeaker. Well, the issue there is kind of stunning how my friend has \nsaid this: Go talk to the Speaker. Everyone knows the Speaker cannot \nmove forward with any negotiations until this bill is defeated here, \nperiod. Obviously, that is the case. The Speaker cannot negotiate with \nme until this bill is killed.\n  So I repeat, the spending bill my friend the Republican leader \ncomplains about is not completed. The issue facing the American people \nis whether they are going to have tax relief the Democrats want to give \nthem or whether they are going to face a shutdown that was first made \nvery unpopular by Newt Gingrich. And there is going to be another one \nthat will be just as unpopular.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I just listened with great eagerness to \nthe discussion between the majority leader and the Republican leader, \nand I would like to make two points here and then several subsidiary \npoints.\n  We need to do two things before we leave: We need to fund the \ngovernment in a reasonable and rational way, and we need to help the \nmiddle class get tax relief because the middle class is suffering. We \nneed to do both. As Leader Reid said, to do both, you need both \nDemocrats and Republicans to agree. If you try to do one without the \nother, you will not get anything done.\n  So last night Speaker Boehner sent a bill on middle-class tax relief \nthat was such a Christmas tree that we knew it could not pass. And he \nknew it could not pass. We know why he did it. He did it because he \ncould not get enough Republican votes in his caucus without all of \nthese killer amendments to get it through. He could not get it through \nwithout those amendments.\n  So the Republican leader says: Well, if we know it cannot pass, why \ndon't we start negotiating? There is one point here. We do not have to \nconvince Speaker Boehner to start negotiating. He knows that. But we \nhave to convince the hundred votes in his caucus who do not believe we \nshould give middle-class tax relief, who are wedded to these amendments \nthat will kill the bill here in the Senate because they are so \nunpalatable. It is not 1 or 2 amendments; it is 10 or 12 or 15 \namendments. We need to show those hundred that this bill cannot pass.\n  We have to give middle-class tax relief, and we have to fund the \ngovernment. So why wouldn't we vote on it now, dispose of it, and move \non with the ultimate negotiations which will talk in tandem about \nfunding the government long term and middle-class tax relief?\n\n  Now, why don't our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nvote on that proposal? Is it because they fear embarrassing defections \nfrom their own side--defections that would show once again how too many \nRepublicans in the Senate do not want to extend middle-class tax relief \nno matter what is attached to it? That is not a good reason.\n  What are we waiting for? The House bill is on a road to nowhere, so \nlet's let the air out of the tires, and then we can move on. We all \nknow how it is going to end--not with either Chamber imposing its will \non the other but with a negotiation. So let's remove this bill from the \nfloor, give Speaker Boehner some of the freedom he may need to \nnegotiate, and get this all done.\n  As, again, Leader Reid said--and he said it so well--we cannot pass \nthe bills without both Democratic and Republican votes in the House and \nthe Senate. Negotiating to come to an agreement makes ultimate sense.\n  I heard the Republican leader say: Well, the government runs out by \nFriday. There is an easy way to deal with that, which Leader Reid asked \nfor in a unanimous consent request and was rejected: fund the \ngovernment for a short period of time.\n  So the logic here is to do three things: Vote on this bill. Put it \naside. Fund the government for another short period of time. And then \nnegotiate in earnest and produce both things America needs: an omnibus \nfunding resolution that funds the government that has been worked on \nvery hard by the Appropriations Committee--deal with the outstanding \nissues in that proposal. There are still serious outstanding issues. \nAnyone who has been around here knows that issues such as Cuba and the \nenvironment and abortion in DC are not easy to settle and have not been \nsettled yet.\n  So we kill the bill the House sent to us--we vote on it. It will die. \nWe know it does not have the votes. It probably does not have even the \nunanimous support on the Republican side. I would bet that is pretty \nlikely. We do a short-term CR. We fund the government for a period of \ntime. And we have earnest negotiations that will produce both middle-\nclass tax relief and a funding resolution for the government. We should \nnegotiate the two measures together because, as the leader said, you \ncannot pass them without both Democratic and Republican votes in either \nChamber. Obviously, in this Chamber, there are not 60 votes without \nRepublican support. And in the other Chamber--because too many people \nare against even the agreement, too many on the Republican side are \nagainst the agreement we had for $1.04 trillion in spending--they will \nneed Democratic votes.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, could I ask a question of the \nSenator from New York through the Chair?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I am confused. The House passed a bill last night and \nhas sent it to the Senate. Correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. This is a Republican bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. And we are ready to vote on it?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We are.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. And the Republicans will not let us vote on it?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I am confused.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So are we all.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Why would the Republicans not let us vote on their \nbill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One of the theories is that there is dissention even on \nthat bill among the Republican side, as there was on the previous bill \nthat had middle-class tax relief in it.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. That is why we vote, to determine whether there is \ndissention.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Agreed. The Senator from Missouri is exactly correct. If \nwe voted, it would move the process of both funding the government--\nvery important--and getting middle-class tax relief--also very \nimportant--forward.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Well, I would certainly urge every single Senator, be \nthey Democrat or Republican, to come to the floor and ask the question: \nWhy are we not voting today on the bill that was passed by the House? \nWe are ready to vote. You know, the American people do not get this \ngame. The bill was passed in the House. Why are we not voting? Why is \nthe Republican Party blocking its own bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from Missouri is, as usual, thoughtful, \npolitically astute, and right down the middle moderate. It makes no \nsense to block it. It is holding up progress, particularly because the \nRepublican House\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\nhas to be shown that this bill is not going to be the answer. The only \nway to both fund the government and provide middle-class relief is for \nDemocrats and Republicans to get together, as the Democratic leader has \nsaid, almost until he is blue in the face.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. With all due respect to my friend and colleague from \nNew York, I thank him for the answers, because I was confused that the \nRepublicans are keeping us from voting on a Republican bill. But it is \nnot the House we need show anything. We have a tendency around here to \nget focused on the back and forth among ourselves. It is the American \npeople we need to show that we are capable of standing up, casting a \nvote, seeing whether it passes or fails, and then negotiating and \nfinding a way forward.\n  I would say to my colleague from New York, if the Republicans in the \nSenate are not willing to vote on their own legislation, then you have \ngot to scratch your head.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, I would accept the modification of \nmy argument made by the Senator from Missouri. The point, of course, we \nboth agree on is we ought to vote. We ought to do it to show the world, \nwhether it is the House, Senate, American people, or anybody else. That \nmakes a great deal of sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New York and \ncolleague from Missouri for putting in context where we are today. But \nlet's take one step back and look at what is the issue. The issue is \nbasic: Will the payroll tax cut that currently helps 160 million \nAmericans continue after January 1? That is the underlying question.\n  After all of the back and forth and politics, we believe it should. \nThe President believes it should. Economists tell us that is the way to \nhelp us out of a recession and create more jobs. We have come up with a \nway to pay for it so it will not add to the deficit. Our proposal: a \nsurtax on the wealthiest Americans, not on the first million dollars in \nincome each year but on their second million dollars in income, a \nsurtax.\n  We ask across America: Do you think that is fair to ask that \nsacrifice? Overwhelmingly, not just Democrats, Independents, \nRepublicans, tea party Republicans believe that is fair. But, \nunfortunately, many on the Republican side are indentured political \nservants to a Washington lobbyist named Grover Norquist. They have \nsigned an oath that they believe supersedes any other oath, to the \nConstitution or to the people they represent, that they will never, \never vote for a tax increase for the wealthy--not one penny. Not one \npenny.\n  So they wanted to stop the extension of this payroll tax cut for \nworking families. They came up with a bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. The bill in the House of Representatives passed last \nnight. It is so bad that the Senate Republicans will not let us bring \nit to the floor for a vote. They know what is going to happen. We saw \nit in the last 2 weeks. The Presiding Officer can remember. Senator \nHeller of Nevada put up a Republican alternative on the payroll tax \ncut, and on the first vote, out of 43 Republicans, 20 supported his \nmeasure, and out of the Republican leadership team, only Senator \nMcConnell voted for it. Clearly this is not a popular approach, even \nwhen it is written by Senate Republicans.\n  Now the House Republican approach is so unpopular they will not even \ncall it on the floor--so unpopular. If anyone is wondering whether we \nare going to get home for Christmas, they should have listened to this \nexchange this morning, when the Republicans refused to even call their \nown vote.\n  I agree with the Senator from Missouri. We owe to it the American \npeople to get to the bottom of this, and quickly, to assure them \nJanuary 1 the payroll cut will continue for working families across \nAmerica, to assure them that we will maintain unemployment benefits for \nthe 14 million unemployed Americans struggling to find jobs--4 \nunemployed for every available job. It is basic that we need to do \nthis, and if we are going to get down to it, then I am afraid our \nSenate Republican colleagues have to accept the reality.\n  There comes a moment for a vote. This is the moment, the vote on \nwhether we are going forward to make sure that we extend the payroll \ntax cut for working families in a fair way. That is what is at hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8559-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in about 30 minutes, we will have a rare \nchance on the floor of the Senate--it does not happen often. We will \nhave consideration of two efforts to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We all take this seriously. Each one of us, before we \ncould exercise our responsibility as Senators, swore to uphold and \ndefend that Constitution. Now we are being asked to amend it.\n  How often have we amended the Constitution? In the past 220 years \nsince we passed the Bill of Rights, we have amended it 17 times: to \nabolish slavery, to give women the right to vote, significant historic \ndecisions. What comes before us today are two amendments which, \nfrankly, do not stand the test of whether they meet constitutional \nstandards.\n  I am going to vote against both. I thank my colleague, Senator Udall \nof Colorado, for offering a version. Senator McConnell, Senator Hatch \nhave offered their own. I do not believe either one of them is right \nfor America. Here is what it comes down to. If we pass either of these \nconstitutional amendments, we will be forced to cut government spending \nat exactly the wrong moment in time when it comes to our economy. When \nour economy is in trouble, revenues are down, we step in with \nstabilizers to try to make sure that we keep families afloat during \ndifficult times and restore our economy to growth. Those stabilizers \nare threatened and endangered by these balanced budget amendments.\n  Secondly, the enforcement of these balanced budget amendments will be \nby our Federal courts. Can you imagine? Can you imagine that the day \nafter we pass a budget, lawsuits spring up across America in the \nFederal courts challenging whether we have exceeded the constitutional \nrequirement that no more than, say, 18 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct be spent, arguments that there has been a miscalculation? How \nlong will that take to resolve in court and what happens to America in \nthe meantime?\n  Then what remedies do the courts have? The Republicans have made it \nclear, because of their view, one of the remedies cannot be extending \ntaxes on the wealthiest in America. They never want that to happen. Now \nthey want to enshrine that theory in the Constitution. Turning to our \ncourts for enforcement of spending is, in my mind, a direct violation \nof the spirit and letter of the law in the Constitution which gives to \nCongress exclusively the power of the purse. It is a bad idea. It is \ncertainly not one we should support.\n  I also want to say that this approach is unnecessary. There comes a \ntime--and we have reached it--when we need to have the political will, \nin a bipartisan fashion, to deal with our country's problems, whether \nit is the tax cut, extending the government's life into the next fiscal \nyear, or dealing with our long-term deficit. It takes political will, \nmaybe even political courage. It does not take a constitutional \namendment.\n  Let's defeat both of these amendments. Let's show our respect for \nthis Constitution that we have sworn to uphold and defend and not pass \nsomething that has not been thought through that may, in fact, harm \nAmerica rather than help it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8559-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8559-S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the need for a balanced budget \namendment is very great. You know how the national debt now is reaching \na point where, if we don't intervene with a constitutional requirement \nfor a balanced\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\nbudget, it is going to become unsustainable. Statutes have not \ncontrolled deficit spending.\n  I was an author of one of those statutes--former Senator Harry F. \nByrd of Virginia and I as a Member of the House--back in 1979. For 15 \nyears that law was on the books, and never in those 15 years was there \na balanced budget amendment. It makes it very clear that laws will not \ncontrol deficit spending.\n  I concluded a long time ago, as I voted on previous constitutional \namendments requiring a balanced budget that didn't pass, that a \nconstitutional amendment is a must to provide Congress with the \nnecessary discipline. The example right now in Europe of their fiscal \nand deficit situation is sobering. Nations that allow debt to grow out \nof control risk default. One of those countries is practically in \ndefault. If we don't take effective corrective action, the European \nfuture could be ours and sooner than we think.\n  Each generation of Americans has enjoyed a brighter future than the \nprevious generation. The failure of Congress to tame the deficit and \nthe debt threatens the American dream for our children and \ngrandchildren. The Constitution was designed to secure the blessings of \nliberty not only for ourselves but also for our children. This makes \nbalancing the budget not just an economic issue but a moral issue as \nwell, and creates a moral obligation to take action. A constitutional \namendment is not only a first step in that direction but it will make \nsure the discipline is binding in future years.\n\n  The balanced budget amendment will enforce a lower debt. Members \ntaking an oath to adhere to its provisions guarantees greater fiscal \ndiscipline than what we have without that constitutional provision. \nThey will take that oath seriously, just as is the case for the 46 \nState constitutions that contain requirements their State legislatures \nbalance their budgets. We always say the State legislatures and States \nare the political laboratories for our system of government. We ought \nto take the results of those laboratories and put them to use at the \nFederal level. I am urging my colleagues to vote for the resolution \nbefore us, which is S.J. Res. 10.\n  There have been complaints this resolution would transfer to the \ncourts the power of the purse, but that is a misreading of S.J. Res. \n10. The amendment prohibits the courts from raising taxes. The doctrine \nof standing, the doctrine of ripeness, and the doctrine of political \nquestion will prevent courts from deciding cases under the amendment.\n  This is a lesson we should have learned. I think it was 1997--nearly \n15 years ago--when this body failed by one vote--and I am ashamed to \ntell you it was one Republican not voting for it--to enact such a \nconstitutional requirement. But it didn't pass. If it had passed, we \nwouldn't be in the fiscal situation we are in right now. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for S.J. Res. 10.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I oppose the two balanced budget \namendments before us. Senator Hatch's proposal would cap spending at 18 \npercent of gross domestic product, forcing deep cuts to Social Security \nand other critical programs. Senator Udall's alternative, while less \nextreme, is still not a proposal I can support.\n  I have consistently opposed balanced budget amendment proposals \nbecause Congress doesn't need a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. We have done it before.\n  In the 1990s, during President Clinton's term, we not only balanced \nthe budget, but we created surpluses and 23 million new jobs. We cut \nwasteful spending, made smart investments, and ensured that everyone, \nincluding the wealthiest, paid their fair share.\n  In 1993, we passed a budget plan without a single Republican vote. By \n1998, the budget had come into balance, and as President Clinton was \nleaving office in 2001, budget analysts were predicting surpluses as \nfar as the eye could see.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush tax cuts and two wars put on a credit card \ncreated huge deficits.\n  To get our country back on a path to fiscal responsibility, we don't \nneed a balanced budget amendment. That is why the Senate has voted down \nbalanced budget amendments many times--most recently in 1995, 1996, and \n1997. Instead, we need the political will to come together and make \nresponsible choices for our country's future.\n  Many economists believe that balanced budget amendments are bad \npolicy because they limit the ability of the Federal Government to \nrespond during times of economic crisis and recession.\n  Limiting our ability to make smart, job-creating investments is no \nway to set a foundation for our country's long-term economic growth.\n  Finally, while these proposals include exceptions for times of war, \nthere is no exception for natural disasters. A minority of Senators or \nRepresentatives could block Federal assistance for any disaster, no \nmatter how severe.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this balanced budget \namendment and recommitting ourselves to our duty as a Congress to \npromote fiscal responsibility and economic growth.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in full support of a \nbalanced budget amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S.J. Res. \n10, along with all of my fellow Republicans.\n  Shortly, the Senate will vote on two proposals for balancing the \nFederal budget. One of those proposals, offered by my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, will provide a strong and meaningful change to the \nway this Congress performs it spending function.\n  I thank the Senator for his continued hard work on trying to balance \nthe budget, something he has been working on since 1995. Unfortunately, \nhe, like all of the Members of this body, has seen the recent and \ndisconcerting rise in debt.\n  It is appalling that we continue to head down a path to destruction \nand fiscal lunacy. The American people are fed up with this. How do we \nknow that? Recent polls say that only 9 percent of the population \nbelieves in the spending path Congress has chosen.\n  For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, we had in excess of \n$1.3 trillion in deficit spending. In November of this year we \nsurpassed $15 trillion in total debt. This rampant overspending will \nnot end without a drastic change--without taking away the power to \noverspend.\n  Not only have the American people told us this, our financial markets \nhave told us this as well. Unbearable debt in the European markets is \ndepressing our domestic financial markets. If left unchecked our own \ndebt will continue to lower economic outlook.\n  It is reprehensible that an issue of this magnitude and significance \nis subject to the partisan bickering and gamesmanship that often rears \nits head in politics.\n  I encourage my colleagues to give solemn consideration to the \nproposal before us, as it will turn us immediately away from our \noverspending.\n  We have to truly examine issues that are very difficult for a lot of \nus to deal with, and we have to make some very tough decisions.\n  Too frequently, we have engaged in political theater instead of \nearnest efforts to resolve these long-term budget issues. The American \npeople expect and deserve an honest budget debate and an honest budget \nprocess. When we pass this legislation and it is ratified by the \nStates, the American people will finally get an honest budget, and they \nwill get it every year.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, the idea of preventing a \nburdensome and crushing debt for future generations is a thing of the \npast. The time is now. The crisis is now. Congress has been shirking \nits budget responsibilities for so long that we are now the ones \nfeeling the effects of the debt.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about some of the things the \nRepublican proposal accomplishes. The President will continue to submit \nhis yearly budget proposal--a budget proposal that is not only balanced \nbut limits the size of the Federal Government to 18 percent of GDP. By \ncomparison, last year spending was at almost 24 percent of GDP.\n  Further, this legislation requires a supermajority to surpass the \nspending caps for things like emergency spending. We will end a \nlongstanding budget gimmick of government spending in the name of \nemergencies for things that are not truly emergencies.\n  The rules would be even stricter governing spending of money in times \nof\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\nwar instead of the general exemption we have now. This proposal will \nalso force Congress to fix and save Social Security.\n  Finally, one of the most important parts of this proposal is that a \ntwo-thirds vote of each House is required to increase taxes, helping \nprevent higher tax rates to pay for balancing the budget.\n  We can no longer allow the American people to suffer by not providing \nthe economic basis for recovery and growth. The equation is simple: A \nbalanced Federal budget that is free of excessive debt leads to a \nhealthy economy and sustainable job-creation activities.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the two \nbalanced budget amendment proposals currently pending before the Senate \nand to explain why I will vote against both even though I support a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I fervently believe that the most pressing issue our country faces \ntoday is the need to gain control over the staggering Federal deficits \nand long-term debt that threaten our security. In thinking about the \nbudget challenges we faced over the past year, I have often been \nreminded of something our second President said two centuries ago that \nremains hauntingly true today: ``There are two ways to conquer and \nenslave a nation,'' as President Adams put it, ``One is by sword and \nthe other is by debt.'' President Adams' words have been echoed in our \ntime by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \nwho argued earlier this year that the national debt is the greatest \nlong-term threat to our national security.\n  We can all agree that we must take on the challenge of addressing our \ndeficit and debt. At the same time, as we have seen again and again \nover the past year, making tough choices is not an easy thing to do. \nAny responsible deficit reduction proposal will, by definition, be \npainful and unpopular because raising revenues and cutting benefits and \nfavored Federal programs is painful and unpopular.\n  I am prepared to vote for a plan similar to that proposed by the \nBowles-Simpson Commission, the Gang of 6, or the Rivlin-Domenici group \nbecause I believe this approach is responsible and addresses the \ntoughest challenges we face head-on. Also, I would support a clean \nbalanced budget amendment, which would compel Congress to make tough \nchoices to raise revenues as necessary, rein in spending, and balance \nour budget.\n  However, the two proposals we are considering today, in my opinion, \nare problematic and marred by extraneous and ill-advised provisions \nthat should never be part of our Constitution. These votes say so \nloudly how dysfunctional Congress has become. I want to vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment that says clearly that Federal Government \nspending cannot exceed revenues. Yet I can't vote for either of these \namendments because each contains a partisan part that does not belong \nin our Constitution.\n  I do not take the idea of amending our Constitution lightly. As we \nconsider these amendments, let's not forget that our Constitution is \nthe supreme law of our land; it reflects America's first principles and \nhighest ideals, guaranteeing the fundamental rights that have been the \ncornerstone of the freedom and opportunity at the heart of the American \nexperience since our founding.\n  However, given the dire fiscal situation we face--coupled with the \nreality that time and again Congress has been unable to break away from \nits partisan gridlock to make the painful but necessary decisions that \nmust be made to save our Republic--amending the Constitution may be the \nonly way to compel a balanced budget.\n  I have come to this conclusion first because it is clear that our \nbudget process is clearly broken. The truth is that we in Congress have \nfailed to uphold our foremost constitutional duties: managing our \nbudgeting process. With annual deficits over $1 trillion and our \nnational debt increasing over $4 billion each day, this is no time for \nCongress to flout the very laws we established to keep our country's \nfiscal health afloat and manage the budget process responsibly.\n  I am speaking in particular about the framework for our budget \nprocess which was first enacted into law in 1921 when Congress \nestablished the annual budgeting requirement and later in 1974 when the \nformal process for establishing a coherent budget was enshrined in law.\n  The failure to pass a budget resolution for the past 3 years is \nsymptomatic of the deep problems we face with regard to our budget, \ndeficits, and debt. Likewise, statutory attempts such as pay-go have \nnot produced the kinds of results we need. At the same time, as we have \nseem over the past several months, Republicans and Democrats cannot \nseem to agree on how to reform entitlements--the biggest driver of our \ndebt and deficits--or reform the Tax Code to ensure that our tax system \nis fair for most Americans, less deferential to special interests, and \nable to sustain the financing of our country's priorities over the long \nterm.\n  It is regrettable that it has come to this, but it seems that perhaps \nthe only way to get Congress to balance the budget is to make it a \nconstitutional requirement.\n  Unfortunately, both proposals before us today are marred by \nextraneous and, in my view, ill-advised and unnecessary provisions. The \nRepublican version, for example, would require that total outlays for \nany fiscal year not exceed 18 percent of GDP and a two-thirds majority \nvote in both Chambers would be required to override this requirement. I \nbelieve it is unwise to impose, as part of our Constitution, an \narbitrary spending cap that would handicap future Congresses without \nregard to the unknown economic realities that future generations of \nAmericans may face. Unless we can see into the future, we should not be \nin the business of predicting what level of spending will be \nappropriate 25 or 50 years from now.\n  Furthermore, the Republican proposal prohibits any bill that \nincreases Federal taxes from becoming law unless it is approved by a \ntwo-thirds majority of both Chambers. This provision essentially gives \nextraordinary constitutional protection to potentially egregious tax \nloopholes and revenue-draining tax expenditures--the same parts of the \nTax Code we have been trying to reform.\n  Likewise, the Democratic balanced budget amendment is not without its \nown faults. A provision prohibiting Congress from passing any bill that \nprovides a tax cut to millionaires during a year that we run a deficit \nis not a statement that needs to be part of our Constitution. Moreover, \nthe Democratic alternative exempts Social Security, which would \nessentially prevent Congress from reforming the program, which I \nbelieve it essential to ensure its solvency for generations to come.\n  On the whole, both the Republican and Democratic balanced budget \namendments are short-sided for different reasons. Instead of focusing \non the single task of providing a balanced budget requirement, \nideological arguments abound in both proposals, making it virtually \nimpossible to support either one.\n  As a result, I will not support either proposal. Instead, I encourage \nmy colleagues from both parties to support a clean version of a \nbalanced budget amendment that is worthy of inclusion in our \nConstitution.\n  If we work together to see beyond the fog of partisanship, it will \nbecome clear that there is not much disagreement about the basic and \ndeeply troubling facts of our current fiscal crisis. For this reason, \nfirst and foremost, I hope Congress will step up and act on a specific \nand comprehensive proposal to reduce the deficit. In the end, process \nreforms will not allow us to escape the hard decisions we must face.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, Washington politicians do not live by the \nsame rules that virtually all families and small businesses play by. It \nis your responsibility to balance your budget, spend no more than what \nis in your bank account, and have a plan to manage common expenses such \nas student, home, and car loans.\n  But in Washington, money is routinely borrowed from Peter to pay \nPaul, or in America's case, money is borrowed from China and others to \npay for more government than we could ever afford. As a result, \npoliticians have dug us into a hole of $15 trillion in debt, with no \nend in sight. Now more than ever, we need a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\n  In Florida's State government, we worked under a balanced budget \namendment, and every year we worked tirelessly, had contentious \ndebates, and made very tough choices to pass a balanced budget year \nafter year. That responsibility and accountability is not unique to \nFlorida, as practically every other State also works under a balanced \nbudget amendment. We need to bring this same kind of fiscal restraint \nto Washington. And unless we enshrine strong balanced budget principles \nin our Constitution, Washington politicians will never stop. That is \nwhy it is critically important that the Senate approve a strong \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The national debt is now over $15 trillion. When I was sworn into \noffice about a year ago, the debt was just over $14 trillion. That \nmeans that in just 1 year, Congress has allowed our debt to increase by \nmore than $1 trillion. Virtually nothing could stop it from happening, \ndespite the fact that 2011 has given us a startling glimpse into our \nfuture as European nations face their day of reckoning for decades of \nreckless spending.\n  This year's debt ceiling debate gave us an opportunity to get serious \nabout controlling our debt and reform the way Washington spends money. \nBut not enough people have been willing to come to grips with the \nreality that decades of reckless spending by both parties is leading us \nto a diminished future.\n  As the Senate debates a balanced budget amendment this week, it is \nimportant to note that not all balanced budget amendment proposals are \ncreated equal. The version that I have joined all 47 of my Senate \nRepublican colleagues in supporting, S.J. Res. 10, includes three \nelements I believe are key to truly handcuffing out-of-control \npoliticians: a two-thirds supermajority to raise taxes, a three-fifths \nsupermajority to increase the debt limit, and a cap on all Federal \nspending at 18 percent of gross domestic product. The proposal put \nforth by Senator Mark Udall, S.J. Res. 24, contains no cap on spending, \nno taxpayer protections, and no strict mechanisms to ensure that the \namendment is actually followed. Unfortunately, if ratified, this \nproposal would simply be another ineffective, disingenuous Washington \nmove that would make it easier to raise taxes and still allow for more \nspending.\n  The idea of not spending more money than we have is common sense for \nworking families and small businesses. We need to bring that common \nsense to Washington, and we need a strong balanced budget amendment \nthat is truly worthy of being added to our Constitution. The Senate \nmust seize the moment by passing a real balanced budget amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the balanced budget \namendment proposals before us today. I support a balanced budget. But I \ncannot support these proposals.\n  All year, we have been discussing and debating how to have a more \nfrugal government. But while we are trying to be frugal, how can we \nalso meet our responsibilities to national defense and maintain our \nsocial contract? To achieve that we have to put politics and \npartisanship aside, and work together to find the sensible center. And \nthe balanced budget amendment does not allow for that.\n  I am for cuts. But our approach must be balanced like a three legged \nstool with responsible discretionary and military spending cuts; \nrevenue; and reform that strengthens Medicare and Medicaid. The \nbalanced budget amendment does not allow for that.\n  Before we adopt a balanced budget amendment, we should know exactly \nwhat it is that we are doing. We need to know just how these programs \nare going to be affected. What cuts are going to be taken. How deep. \nWhat programs. And most importantly what the consequences will be to \nthe health, safety, and security of the American people.\n  How would a balanced budget amendment affect seniors? It attacks \neconomic security for senior citizens through cuts to Social Security \nand Medicare. It breaks the social contract.\n  Under the Republican plan, it cuts spending to 1965 levels before \nMedicare existed and when the average Social Security benefit was about \n$1,200 a year. That was 46 years ago, when making $8,000 a year was \nconsidered a fantastic salary. Would you want to go back and make \n$8,000 a year? I do not think so. I do not think we want to go back to \nthat. Do we really want to go back to not having Medicare? Sure we need \nto reform and refresh Medicare, but do we want to end Medicare? I don't \nthink so.\n  How would a balanced budget amendment affect our ability to respond \nto natural disasters, when the 24-hour news coverage is over and people \nreturn to their regularly scheduled programs? States that are hit by \ndisasters are just beginning the recovery process and depend on their \nFederal partners. Times of disaster are not for making choices between \none State or another. Government must be there. We are all in this \ntogether. Just one snowstorm, wildfire, or devastating flood away from \nour own crisis. But the balanced budget amendment would force these \nterrible choices.\n  What about funding for America's veterans in order to be able to meet \ntheir acute care, provide primary care connected to service-connected \ndisabilities, and long-term care for those who bear the permanent \nwounds of war? What about funding for disability pensions for veterans? \nThe balanced budget amendment makes funding for American's veterans \nwith service-connected disabilities vulnerable to mandatory budget \ncuts.\n  How will a balanced budget amendment affect the next generation? It \ndenies educational opportunity to young people and an opportunity \nstructure to working families. The balanced budget amendment puts \nfunding for Head Start, Pell Grants, and funding that helps schools \ncomply with Title IX funding for job training on the chopping block. I \nbelieve we must keep the doors of opportunity open, not slam them shut.\n  How will a balanced budget amendment affect our Federal workers and \neveryone who depends on their work? The State of Maryland is home to \nsome of the flagship agencies of the Federal Government and 130,000 \nhardworking Federal employees live in Maryland. Agents at the Federal \nBureau of Investigation work to protect our safety. Employees at the \nSocial Security Administration provide actuarial information on how to \nkeep it solvent and make sure the checks are out there on time. At \nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, they are scanning the universe for \nthe secrets to life here on Earth. The mandatory budget cuts of the \nbalanced budget amendment will require arbitrary cuts to the Federal \nworkforce without certainty that the agencies will be capable of doing \ntheir job. These kinds of cuts are dangerous and harmful to the public.\n  The Founders did not include a provision requiring a balanced budget \nat all times. They did not include a provision limiting the size of \ngovernment to an arbitrary percent of the size of our economy. Instead, \nin our Constitution, the Founders said that Congress would have the \npower to borrow on the credit of the United States and the \nresponsibility to provide for the general welfare of the country.\n  Providing for the general welfare of the country means keeping the \npromise of our social contract to our seniors and our veterans. It \nmeans keeping the ladder of opportunity available to the next \ngeneration. And it means responding to natural disasters and \nmaintaining a safe and secure homeland.\n  Make no mistake. We must balance the budget. But we must do it based \non principles that preserve economic security for senior citizens, that \nprovide opportunity for young people, and that ensure opportunity for \nworking families.\n  I cannot and will not support any legislation that abandons these \nprinciples. Therefore, I will vote against this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in a short while, we will vote on two \nbalanced budget amendments to the Constitution, at least one of which \nwill be a true balanced budget amendment. One of those amendments, S.J. \nRes. 10, the amendment supported by every Senate Republican, addresses \nthe fundamental crisis of our time; that is, the crisis of exploding \ndebt caused by excessive spending. The other amendment does not address \nthat crisis and, therefore, cannot put this country back on a sound \nfiscal footing.\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\n  The votes we cast today will tell the American people whether we \nhonestly acknowledge the fiscal crisis posed by our $15 trillion \nnational debt and whether we are serious about prescribing an effective \ncure.\n  Exploding budget deficits and skyrocketing national debt are symptoms \nof an addiction to overspending. A real solution must address the real \ncause of this crisis, not just its symptoms. Congress will not kick its \noverspending addiction alone but only if required to do so by the \nConstitution itself.\n  One of the amendments before us today, S.J. Res. 24, simply cannot be \na solution because it does not address the overspending that causes \nthis crisis. This amendment, offered by my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Udall, on behalf of the Democrats, purports to require balanced \nbudgets but, for purely political reasons, explicitly exempts \nsignificant portions of the very government spending that will most \naggressively drive our future debt.\n  The Democratic alternative sets no overall limit on government \nspending, allowing Congress to continue spending with impunity. The \nDemocratic alternative does nothing to restrict the propensity of \nCongress and the President to raise taxes on families and businesses as \na way of compensating for their failure to reduce spending and in order \nto fuel more spending in the future.\n  In fact, as my friend Senator Kyl pointed out yesterday, the \nDemocratic alternative actually makes it harder to cut taxes. To top it \noff, the Democrats' amendment not only sets no limits on Congress \nraising taxes, but it appears to allow judges to raise taxes to balance \nthe budget.\n  In other words, the Democratic alternative allows Congress to \ncontinue doing exactly what has caused this crisis in the first place. \nIt allows Members of Congress committed to a tax-and-spend philosophy \nto continue sending taxpayer dollars to special interests at the \nexpense of the general fiscal health of this country. The so-called \nsolution that continues to enable out-of-control spending is no \nsolution at all.\n  Maintenance of this tax-and-spend status quo is the priority of those \nwho support the Democratic alternative. Just listen to their criticism \nof my amendment, S.J. Res. 10, the one supported by all Republican \nSenators--every one of us. The Democrats criticize my amendment's \nrequirement that Congress balance its books as too stringent. They \ncriticize it for not allowing more stimulus spending, my gosh, and they \ncriticize it for not allowing easy tax increases.\n  The people of Utah, and most Americans for that matter, would respond \nthat these are the very restrictions Congress needs. They would say \nthese restrictions are long overdue and would be positive additions to \nour Constitution. It is no wonder the advocates of the wornout \nphilosophy of tax and spend view the provisions of S.J. Res. 10, our \nconstitutional amendment, as a threat.\n  They are a threat. Our amendment's provisions are a threat to those \nwhose only plan is to sit on their hands while our debt continues to \nskyrocket. The strong balanced budget amendment offered by the \nRepublicans directly addresses the real cause of our budget crisis and \noffers equally direct solutions. It requires supermajorities. That \ndoesn't mean we can't do things. It just says we have to have \nsupermajorities to raise taxes. It means it requires wide bipartisan \nagreement for deficit or excess spending, as well as for raising either \ntaxes or the debt limit.\n  I would note a supermajority to raise the debt limit was in the \nbalanced budget amendment that passed the Senate back in 1982. I know \nbecause I was the one pushing it. It passed the Senate.\n  Our amendment limits both spending and the tax increases that fuel \nmore spending. This is more than a balanced budget amendment. It is a \nfiscal discipline amendment or a constitutional amendment for limited \ngovernment.\n  Much of the Western world now faces a debt crisis. The eurozone is \nnearly reaching the point of no return. The United States is closing in \non that same point of no return with our total debt already equal to \n100 percent of our entire economy--of our GDP. The national debt now \namounts to about $48,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nInterest payments alone on this debt are now greater than spending on \nmost other Federal programs and would be even higher if interest rates \nwere not at historic lows. Annual budget deficits are larger than the \nentire national debt when I introduced my first balanced budget \namendment.\n  Let me say that again. Annual budget deficits--just the deficit this \nyear and last year, just standing alone; this year's budget deficit and \nthe annual budget deficits of this President--are larger than the \nentire national debt when I introduced the first balanced budget \namendment in 1979 and 10 times higher than when the Senate last voted \non a balanced budget amendment in 1997.\n  More than two centuries ago, America's Founders warned of the dangers \nof debt. Thomas Jefferson, the forbearer of the Democratic Party, said \npublic debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared. He would be aghast \nat what Democrats are trying to sell. Alexander Hamilton said there \nought to be perpetual, anxious, and unceasing efforts to reduce debt as \nfast as possible. John Adams said the experience of other countries \nthat accumulate debt should prevent us from doing so ourselves. He \nmight as well have been speaking about Europe today. He would be \nappalled at what we are doing around here.\n  Watching the failure of Congress and the President to get spending \nand debt under control, these Founding Fathers must be turning over in \ntheir graves, and I believe we continue to reject their wisdom at our \nperil.\n  Despite all the evidence, opponents continue to claim Congress will \nmake the tough fiscal choices by itself; that Congress does not need \nany help. After so many years of failure, that amounts to fiddling \nwhile our fiscal house is burning to the ground. That is the argument \nthey make. Closing their eyes, shutting their ears, and repeating \nthe mantra that Congress does not need a constitutional amendment is \nexactly what got us to the edge of the cliff we are standing on today \nand which we are about to go over, if we don't put some restraints on \naround here.\n\n  If spending were a drug, Congress would be a very pathetic addict. An \naddict ignores evidence and denies he has a problem. An addict claims \nover and over that he can stop his addictive behavior any time. But \nsimilar to a real addict, Congress cannot kick the habit on its own. \nCongress needs some help. The Constitution is the way to get that help, \nand the Founding Fathers would have loved this amendment.\n  Think of S.J. Res. 10 as a constitutional intervention. It will \nrequire not only that the Federal budget be balanced but that it be \nbalanced in the right way. When we vote on these amendments, Senators \nwill demonstrate where they stand on the great crisis of our time. \nVoting against any balanced budget amendment simply endorses the status \nquo. It ignores the evidence and pretends everything is fine, even as \nwe head for the cliff. This is the only amendment that deserves the \ntitle of a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Voting for the Democrats' alternative--S.J. Res. 24--also endorses \nthe status quo because it barely touches the symptom--budget deficits \nand debt--while ignoring the cause--government spending. Without \ncovering all government spending and without setting real limits on \nspending and taxes, the Democrats' alternative does little more than \nput a bandaid on the problem. It isn't even a good bandaid that holds.\n  The only proposal before us that effectively responds to our budget \ncrisis is S.J. Res. 10. It is the only proposal that addresses the real \ncause of the unbalanced budgets that are dragging us into fiscal \nquicksand.\n  This crisis threatens national security, economic prosperity, and \nmaybe, most important of all, individual liberty. Congress will not \nsolve this crisis by itself. S.J. Res. 10 is the only solution that \naddresses not only the symptoms of our fiscal crisis but the cause as \nwell. These are the facts. These are simply the facts, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to support S.J. Res. 10.\n  I heard the distinguished majority whip talking earlier, and just for \na minute I think he was asking: Why do this. You know you can't win. We \ndon't know we can't win. But even if we\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\ncan't, some fights are worth fighting, especially when our national \nsecurity, economic prosperity, and individual liberty are at stake. \nThat is what we are living with right now.\n  The American people need to know where we stand, whether we will ever \ndo anything real or do something real about our addiction to \noverspending. That is the bankruptcy of our country right now--the \naddiction to overspending. Our amendment ends that addiction. It \nprovides 5 years to get there, so it is a reasonable provision. But it \ndoes force us to get there.\n  The Democratic amendment doesn't even attack the real problem. It is \nthere for political purposes. It is there so Democrats can say: We \nvoted for a balanced budget amendment, even though it, basically, has \nlittle to do with balancing the budget.\n  I was enamored with the talk of the Democrat budget chairman \nyesterday, Senator Conrad from North Dakota. He went through all the \nproblems we have and how deep they are and how problematic they are and \nwhat an addiction it is and all of that. Then he said we can do it by \njust doing what is right under the Constitution and forcing ourselves \nto do what is right and just balance the budget without a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  He couldn't have made a better case for the balanced budget amendment \nbecause I have been here for 35 years, and I can say there hasn't been \na real effort except during the mid-1990s to do that. That was when the \nfirst Republican House of Representatives and Senate in over 40 years \ntook place. It was when they did have a President, Bill Clinton, who \nrecognized that the time had come to do something about spending.\n  I have to give him credit for that in contrast to our current \nPresident who just demands more taxes and more spending all the time. \nThere isn't anything or any person he wouldn't tax if he could get away \nwith it except those unable to pay any taxes at all, and nobody wants \nto tax them.\n  The fact is, I think the distinguished Budget Committee chairman made \na tremendous case for our amendment. I can say we have been going on \nway too long.\n  Back in 1997, we came within one vote of passing this amendment. That \nwas twice now. Remember, in 1992 we actually passed an amendment, but \nTip O'Neill and the Democrats killed it in the House at that time. But \nin 1997 we came within one vote. I actually had the votes as I walked \nto the floor, and then one of our weak-kneed Republicans who was \nthreatened by the unions, who had been high up on the endorsement list, \nwho wanted to be seen every time we had a press conference on this \nissue, buckled and voted the other way and we lost. Had we won that \namendment in 1997, we wouldn't be in this colossal mess we are in \ntoday. Frankly, I, for one, hope we can get out of that mess, and the \nonly way we are going to is through a constitutional amendment that \ndoes what this amendment we are presenting actually calls for.\n  I just do not believe our friends on the other side are ever going to \nquit taxing and spending, and I have 35 years to prove it--except when \nthe first Republican Congress in over 40 years came into being, and \nthey had a President who worked with them, a Democratic President, by \nthe way. I wish we had a Democratic President here who would work with \nus. He would go down in history as one of the most popular Presidents \nin history if he would do so. But, no, he wants to tax and he wants to \nspend. Frankly, I am fed up with it, and I think a lot of people are \nfed up with it. The people out in the hinterlands are all fed up with \nit, and they realize we need to put some restraints on Congress it has \nto live up to.\n  That doesn't mean we can't get a supermajority to raise taxes or we \ncan't get a supermajority to raise the debt limit or we can't get a \nsupermajority to an undeclared war--to give a good reason why our \nfriends on the other side might want to support this. But it does mean \nthere will be restraints that will work and will keep this country \nsecure and free.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time. I ask that any time be divided \nequally, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve the \nremainder of our time but to permit the distinguished Senator from \nColorado to utilize his 5 minutes at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise this morning to speak \nin favor of the legislation that I have authored to amend the \nConstitution to require that Congress, on behalf of the American \npeople, balance the Federal budget.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the merits of a balanced budget amendment, \nand I appreciate the debate that has occurred on the Senate floor which \nwas in the best traditions of the Senate. I particularly have enjoyed \nhearing Senator Hatch's point of view. I think we have some \ndisagreements about how we implement a balanced budget amendment, but \nwe both agree that we need to put the Federal Government's finances in \nbalance. Perhaps if we both fall short today on these important votes, \nwe can go back and work together in the best tradition of Senator Hatch \nand Senator Simon. Senator Simon, on our side, was a strong proponent \nin the 1990s of a balanced budget amendment. Senator Hatch referenced \nthose efforts then.\n  Let me quickly summarize my arguments for why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment. I start out thinking about Coloradans and the common \nsense they apply to their everyday finances, and there is a big dose of \nColorado common sense in my proposal. It is aimed at finding common \nground that both parties and a big majority of Americans can support, \nand it starts with a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. \nThat is the heart of the issue. It is something on which many of us \nagree. But my proposal also asks us to avoid the mistakes of the last \ndecade that have resulted in debt that is not only significant but it \nis exploding.\n  For example, it would prevent deficit-busting tax breaks for \nAmericans who earn $1 million or more a year. Why should we continue to \ngive additional tax breaks to the wealthiest among us during times when \nwe are in these tough deficit situations?\n  I would also create a Social Security lock box to keep Congress from \nraiding the trust fund to hide the true size of our annual deficits. We \nhave been using the Social Security fund as a slush fund to remedy our \nbudgeting problems. That would end.\n  In sum, the proposal I brought forward is straightforward, it is \nsimple, and upholds the principle: We should pay for our government in \na responsible manner.\n  I think, looking at the Presiding Officer, in your home State most \nAmericans agree to that, most New Yorkers do. Most Coloradans certainly \ndo.\n  I also want to be clear, there are some important differences between \nmy approach and my dear friend Senator Hatch's approach. We will vote \non his proposal today as well.\n  Senator Hatch's proposal--this is in my estimation--goes far beyond \nbalancing our books, and it is a balanced budget amendment only in \npart. That is because it includes some unrealistic limitations on our \ngovernment that could prevent us from securing the retirement of hard-\nworking Americans, undermine our national defense, and send the United \nStates back to a time before Social Security, Medicare, and a host of \nother important programs were put in place to protect our middle class, \nthe true heart of our country.\n  Even worse, it locks in some special interest tax breaks that do \nnothing to grow our economy or create jobs. It, in effect, would turn \nthe Constitution into a document that protects every special tax break \nthat has been successfully lobbied over the years. That is not what our \nconstituents, hard-working Americans, expect from a balanced budget \namendment.\n\n  On the other hand, my approach is straightforward. It requires us to \npay for what we spend. It creates flexibility depending on the economic \nconditions that we face and the year in which we\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nfind ourselves. But it wouldn't lead to the erosion of seniors' \nretirement security or it wouldn't lock in special interest tax breaks.\n  So I say to all of my colleagues, it is time to put aside our \npolitical differences, check our ultimatums at the door, and let's work \nacross the aisle and challenge ourselves to put our country first \nthrough balancing the budget.\n  Our debt is $15 trillion and it is growing. The bipartisan cochairmen \nof President Obama's commission on the debt have called our debt a \ncancer, and the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \nMullen, has said it is the single biggest threat to our national \nsecurity. It is clear it is time to act. We have run out of time to \nact.\n  So, as I close, I just want to say the American people have demanded \nwe get our fiscal house in order. As usual, they are a few steps ahead \nof us, and it is now time for us in the Congress to catch up. So I am \nasking my colleagues of both parties and both Chambers to support my \nproposal. This is the right approach. It will enhance our economic \nsecurity. It will ensure that we keep faith with our children. We \nshouldn't pass off this unsustainable debt to our children.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nproposal. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to complete these \nremarks. It might take a few seconds beyond.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, critics suggest a vote for our balanced \nbudget amendment is a waste of the Chamber's time. That is pure bunk.\n  The same folks who say we should not be voting on the Republicans' \nbalanced budget amendment have also offered up their own amendment to \nshow their constituents that they too want to balance the budget.\n  I can tell you now that it is the Democratic alternative that misses \nthe point, for a number of reasons. One, it doesn't address the true \ncrisis. We have a crisis of spending. We are $15 trillion in debt, and \nthe Democratic alternative does nothing to address it.\n  No. 2, it carves out massive portions of government spending from \ntheir definition of Federal outlays. No. 3, even its balance \nrequirements, the most basic feature of any balanced budget amendment, \nare easily overridden. No. 4, there is no cap on Federal spending. And, \nNo. 5, there is no supermajority requirement for tax increases.\n  Put it all together and this is what you get with the Democratic \nbalanced budget amendment. You get a constitutional amendment that is \ngoing to force Congress to raise taxes on families and businesses to \npay for out-of-control government spending. The Democratic alternative \nshould be rejected. It might look good from a distance but up close it \ndoes not even begin to address our Nation's fiscal crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8565-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 10 and S.J. \nRes. 24, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 24) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution relative to requiring a balanced budget.\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 10) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relative to balancing \n     the budget.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \n5 minutes of debate equally divided prior to votes on passage of the \nmeasures.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday and today my Republican \ncolleagues here in the Senate have been coming to the floor one after \nanother to deliver a simple, urgent message, one that I hear every time \nI am home in Kentucky: Washington simply must change course. The \nspending spree must end. We must put our Nation's fiscal house in order \nbefore it is too late.\n  This is not a partisan message. Everyone recognizes that both parties \nplayed a role in getting us to this point. But let's be clear, \nRepublicans are the only ones in Congress right now who are attempting \nto do something meaningful about fiscal restraint. The only way we will \nactually achieve it is by acting together on serious legislation such \nas the balanced budget amendment Republicans are voting on today--not \nthrough thinly veiled cover votes such as the one Democrats plan to \nhold alongside this morning.\n  For nearly 3 years now, Republicans have stood up to the fiscal \nrecklessness of this administration and pleaded with the President and \nDemocrats in Congress to stop the spending spree--stop it--and work \nwith us on a serious plan to put our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  For nearly 3 years we have met nothing but resistance. I even read \nthis week that some Democrats in Congress actually view our insistence \non fiscal responsibility as a good political issue for them. They say \nAmericans have moved on, that they do not want to hear about fiscal \nrestraint anymore. Apparently these Democrats are content to let this \ncrisis continue to build and build until it pops up in the polls again.\n  What Republicans have been saying this week is that we do not have \nthat luxury. We cannot wait for a European-style calamity to happen \nright here to finally do something about our fiscal problems, nor \nshould we want to. After all, we were not elected to get reelected. We \nwere elected to recognize the Nation's problems and to face up to them \nwith foresight and with courage.\n  That is why Republicans have kept up our call for a serious and \neffective balanced budget amendment. We have seen all the statistics--\nthat Congress now borrows more than 40 cents for every dollar it \nspends; that interest payments on the debt alone will soon crowd out \nspending on things such as education and defense; that annual deficits \nunder this President routinely double and triple the previous record.\n  We know where it has gotten us. Under this President, the national \ndebt has rocketed from $10.1 trillion all the way up to 15.1 trillion, \nmore than a 40-percent increase in the national debt under this \nPresident in a record time of less than 3 years, a run of fiscal \nmismanagement only matched in its recklessness by total unwillingness \nto correct it.\n  The President's most recent budget was so irresponsible that not a \nsingle Member of the Senate voted for it, not one. The President's \nbudget was voted down unanimously here in the Senate.\n  What about the first ever downgrade of U.S. debt, did that prompt \naction? Not in this White House. It prompted a round of ``shoot the \nmessenger'' instead. This President's entire approach to our Nation's \nfiscal problems has been to sit back and blame somebody else, even as \nhe continues to make all of these problems worse.\n  There was a time when President Obama claimed to believe in the \nimportance of paying our debts. As a Senator he stood on this very \nfloor and chastised his predecessor for even asking the Congress to \nraise the Nation's debt limit. He called it a failure of leadership. \nYet earlier this year, as President\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nhe demanded that Congress approve the single largest debt limit \nincrease ever requested by a U.S. President--without any plan at all to \ncover the cost. It was this kind of fiscal recklessness that roused \nRepublicans to recommit ourselves to the idea that, if we are going to \npreserve the American dream for our children, Congress has to stop \nspending more than it takes in, and it was the Democrats' resistance to \nthat idea that convinced us the only way to make sure it happens is \nthrough a constitutional amendment that actually requires it.\n  For too long, the politics of the moment or of the next election have \nbeen put ahead of Congress's responsibility to balance the books. Too \nmany promises have been made that cannot possibly ever be kept, and now \nthe time for serious action has come; we must prevent what is happening \nin Europe from happening here.\n  That is what our balanced budget amendment would do. By permanently \nlimiting Congressional spending to the historical norm of 18 percent of \ngross national product, and through a new three-fifths supermajority of \nboth Houses of Congress to raise the debt limit, the balanced budget \namendment Republicans are proposing today would go a long way in \npreventing that day of reckoning from happening right here in America. \nEvery single Senator should support it.\n  Democrats here in Washington know the American people want Congress \nto get its fiscal house in order. That is why they proposed a balanced \nbudget amendment of their own. Unfortunately, they have no real \nintention of passing it. If they did, they would join us in supporting \na bill that we know would lead to the kind of fiscal restraint the \nAmerican people are asking for.\n\n  I ask my friends on the other side to join us. It is not too late. We \nare only going to solve this problem together. Republicans are doing \nour part. We need them to do theirs. The American people are asking us \nto act. Let's do it. If this President will not take America's fiscal \nproblems seriously, Congress should do it for him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as I rise to ask for the yeas \nand nays on the amendment, I point out my amendment is not a cover \namendment. It includes many of the principles and provisions the House \nconsidered in a balanced budget amendment they voted on recently, and \nit also contains many of the provisions and principles that this body \nin the 1990s considered when Paul Simon and Senator Hatch and many \nothers led on a balanced budget amendment proposal.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays on S.J.

Res. 10\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote on S.J. Res. 10.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this is the last chance to vote for a \nconstitutional amendment that will truly do something, that will tie \nthe hands of Congress so they have to live within fiscal constraints. \nWe are taxing and spending this country into bankruptcy. We have a $15 \ntrillion-plus national debt, growing to $20 trillion to $30 trillion. \nWe don't have any restraint around here.\n  People say: If we just live up to the Constitution and restrain \nourselves, we can do that. They have been saying that for 35 years. The \nonly time we have come to a balanced budget around here is when we had \nthe first Republican Congress in over 40 years and we had a President \nwho was willing to support it.\n  This is our chance to try to do something for our country that will \nstop the outrageous, out-of-control spending. We need to do it. This \namendment is the only one that can do it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have actually voted for a balanced \nbudget. Democrats in this Chamber and in the other Chamber voted for \none and it passed. Not a single Republican voted for it. During the \nClinton administration, we were able to balance the budget and start \npaying down the debt. A huge surplus was left to his successor and it \nwas squandered by that administration.\n  We should not enshrine the extreme provisions in the current proposal \nin our Constitution. We should not make it more difficult for Congress \nto respond to economic and natural disasters. Proponents of this \namendment say: Let's let the courts make these decisions. Let us not \ntransform our courts into budget-cutting bodies. They are not equipped \nto perform that role. Even Justice Scalia, testifying before our \ncommittee, laughed at the idea that they could do that.\n  The Hatch-McConnell proposal will do nothing to spur economic growth \nor ease the partisan gridlock in the Congress. It will do the opposite. \nIt will enshrine bad fiscal policy in the Constitution. A vote for this \nproposal is a vote for dramatic cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and \nveterans' benefits.\n  Partisan efforts like this may be good bumper-sticker politics, but \nthey are bad solutions. I wish those who say they revere the \nConstitution would show it the respect it deserves rather than treating \nit like a blog entry.\n  I urge Senators to oppose this radical and ill-considered proposal to \namend our Constitution.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 229 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last night the House of Representatives \npassed a tax cut bill, one that is doomed in the Senate and that the \nPresident has made it clear he will not sign.\n  It is important for us to move beyond this stalemate on an important \nissue that will literally affect 160 million working Americans.\n  Currently those working families enjoy a 2-percent payroll tax cut. \nFor the average family in Illinois with a $50,000 annual income, it \nmeans $1,000 a year or more in terms of a tax cut. So if we fail to \ncontinue this payroll tax cut, families across Illinois and across \nAmerica are going to see an increase in their payroll taxes of about \n$100 to $125 dollars a month. We cannot let that happen. These families \nare struggling paycheck to paycheck. We want to help them. We want to \nmake sure we help this economy by putting more life into it, which \ncreates more opportunity for profitability for business and new jobs.\n  We also need to maintain our unemployment insurance which we have \nprovided during these difficult times for those families struggling to \nfind work.\n  At this point it is clear we should move immediately--immediately--to \nconsideration of the House tax cut bill, a bill which passed the House \nand should be taken up immediately in the Senate. There is no reason \nfor delay. It has to be done before we go home. Let's not waste any \nmore time. Let's bring it to a vote.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3630, which was just received in the Senate from \nthe House; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees prior to a vote on passage of the bill; \nthat no amendments be in order prior to the vote, and that the vote on \npassage be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; further, that if \nthe bill is not passed, it remain the pending business and the majority \nleader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object on behalf of our leader. This \nis a matter that needs to be decided between our two leaders. That has \nnot been done. The bill has just come over. There needs to be some \ntime. Certainly we hope in the future to vote on it at a time when the \ntwo leaders can agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I know her \nobjection was on behalf of the Republican Senate leader. I would appeal \nto him and all Republicans on that side of the aisle, let's get down to \nthe business of extending this payroll tax cut for working families and \nmaintaining the unemployment insurance to help millions of Americans. \nLet's get it done before we even consider leaving for this holiday \nseason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8567-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8567-S8568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, at a time when our economy is \nstaggering and global unrest is making long-term energy supplies \nuncertain, we are going to eventually be able to take up a bill that \nhas been passed by the House that would bypass the President's decision \nto postpone until 2013, after the elections next year, a domestic \ninfrastructure project that promises 20,000 immediate jobs, and 118,000 \nspinoff jobs, and provides a stable energy source from our trusted \nneighbor Canada.\n  After 3 years of unprecedented reviews by State and Federal agencies, \nthe administration decided to delay the Keystone XL pipeline until \nafter the 2012 election. Why? It would seem obvious that this is a \ndecision that could now be made. The studies have been done. The jobs \nare needed. This is a privately financed traditional energy project. It \nis truly shovel ready. It is not a temporary government stimulus \nprogram based on wishful thinking, looking for things that can be done \naround the country. It is ready to go and it is privately financed, so \nthere are no taxpayer dollars involved.\n  The pipeline is our Nation's access to the estimated 170 billion \nbarrels of recoverable oil in western Canadian tar sands. It will \nprovide energy from a reliable trading partner and friend, lessening \nour dependence on oil from turbulent Middle East and North African \ncountries and from dictators and terrorism-supporting regimes in South \nAmerica.\n  This turmoil leads to price spikes and supply interruptions that \nthreaten our economy and our national security. If we can go forward \nwith the pipeline project, it would have a tremendous impact on our \nNation, where the project could stimulate $2.3 billion in new spending \nand generate more than $48 million in new tax revenues just in my home \nState of Texas.\n  The pipeline construction would result in 700,000 additional barrels \nof oils per day being sent to refineries in Texas. Our State's 26 \nrefineries account for more than 25 percent of the total U.S. oil \nproduction, which is approximately 5 percent of worldwide capacity. \nTexas refineries working at capacity are of great benefit to the \nconsumers of America. Oil is provided faster and more efficiently to \ndomestic consumers and industry, bringing down the cost of energy to \neveryone in our country.\n  Last night the House approved this legislation. President Obama \ncontinues to threaten to veto any bill that comes to his desk that \ninvolves the Keystone pipeline. So I think it is fair to ask: What is \nhis plan? The administration recently announced the President's 5-year \nblueprint for the future of America's energy resources. For example, \nthe plan limits the offshore energy development to less than 3 percent \nof offshore areas.\n  The administration is decreasing our energy resources while other \ncountries continue to increase their energy wealth, just off our coast \nin some instances, some as close as 25 miles from the U.S. waters. With \nthe right policies, the oil and gas industry could create 1.4 million \nnew jobs and raise $800 billion of additional government revenue by \n2030. That would come from people working. That would come from people \nin the economy buying things, creating new jobs, and paying taxes \nbecause they are earning money. That is the way we should increase \nrevenue in this country, not by stimulus programs that add to our \ndeficit and to the debt that is going to be inherited by our children.\n  The administration is determined to pursue policies that limit our \nutilization of our own natural resources. Most other countries in the \nworld are trying to develop their natural resources, and some do not \nhave natural resources and wish they did. America has them but we are \nnot using them.\n  We could--with a single pipeline--do something that would lower the \ncost of energy and create new jobs and raise additional government \nrevenue. The fact that we are debating this project today in the face \nof a frozen economy and rising energy insecurity is unthinkable. We do \nnot need more Solyndra fiascos. We do not need to waste additional \nbillions of taxpayer dollars to support failed businesses that would \nnot exist without federal subsidies.\n  This pipeline has not one taxpayer dollar in it. It is privately \nfunded and will create private industry jobs that would be jobs that \ncreate more revenue for our country through the spending and the \ncreation of still further jobs.\n  We would be doing it with a trusted neighbor and ally, Canada. This \nis something we should do. I would love to see us do it in a bipartisan \nway in this Senate as the House has already done.\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the urgent need to \nprevent a tax increase in the year 2012 if the Congress does not act to \nextend the payroll tax cut from last year. This is fundamental when it \ncomes to working families across the country. Some 160 million working \nAmericans are depending upon the Congress to do its work, to do its \nduty, and conclude this year on a couple of matters.\n  The principal focus of most people's attention right now, in addition \nto making sure we have a budget in place for the next couple of weeks \nand months but also, most urgently, is to make sure we are doing \neverything possible to bring about a cut in the payroll tax again as we \ndid last year. So we should be voting today. We should not be waiting. \nWe know the House has acted. I would guess that what they passed in the \nHouse will not pass in the Senate, but we should vote. Vote today. Get \nthat done. Then both sides can sit down and work out a compromise on \nthe payroll tax cut so we can give those 160 million American workers \nsome measure of certainty as they begin to celebrate the holidays and \nprepare for our new year.\n  When I talk to people in Pennsylvania, they say to me basically two \nthings: Do something to create jobs or to create the environment or the \ncondition that job creation will flow from and, they say, do it in a \nbipartisan way. Work together as we, meaning Americans back home, have \nto work together. They have to work together at home to meet a budget. \nThey have to work together at their worksite to be able to move a \ncompany or their agenda forward for an employer.\n  What we need is a very simple agreement on a very basic bill, and it \nshould be a bill that would extend and, I would argue, expand. I wish \nto go beyond the payroll tax cut of last year. What we should be doing \nis cutting it in half. I know there might be others who do not want to \ngo that far. But what we have now from the House is a 350-page bill \nloaded with all kinds of provisions that have nothing to do with the \npayroll tax cut and nothing to do with moving the economy forward. It \nis kind of a political game they are playing.\n  For example, the Keystone pipeline will be the subject of a lot of \ndebate and discussion. But that has nothing to do with providing 160 \nmillion working Americans with a payroll tax cut, so we should set that \naside and focus on cutting the payroll tax. Some of the provisions in \nthe Republican bill will do substantial harm to families individually \nbut also to the larger economy. Cutting 40 weeks--let me say that \nagain--cutting 40 weeks from unemployment insurance is one provision. \nThat is the wrong thing to do when have you between 13 and 14 million \nAmericans out of work, in Pennsylvania over half a million people out \nof work, at last count 513,000 people out of work. They are telling us \nthat we should cut unemployment insurance by 40 weeks.\n  Does that make any sense at all? Oh, by the way, what they leave out \nin that debate is what unemployment insurance does to the wider \neconomy. You spend a buck on that, you get a lot more than a buck in \nreturn in terms of the economic impact. So unemployment insurance, when \nit is provided to people who lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown, helps the larger economy in addition to helping an individual \nworker or his or her family.\n  When it comes to the issue of the payroll tax cut itself, what we are \ntalking about here is not something complicated and theoretical. We are \ntalking about take-home pay, what goes in your pocket from your \npaycheck. We have got a choice here. If we go the right way and we \nextend the payroll tax cuts from last year, there is as much as $1,000 \nin take-home pay as a result of that.\n  I had a bill which we worked to try to compromise and change--we \nchanged our bill in order to compromise, I should say. I thought it \nwould be better if we cut the payroll tax for workers in half. That \nwould be as much as $1,500 in your pocket for 2012. The other side \nobjected to that. They wanted no payroll tax cut, apparently, for \nbusinesses, which I thought was a good idea. Then they also wanted to \nscale back what we could do for employees. But we are where we are. We \nwill see what they are willing to do now. But let's not lose sight of \nwhat this is all about. If we do the right thing, we will have $1,000 \nextra in take-home pay for 160 million American workers, but if we go \nthe way of some people here in Washington and play political games, it \nwill be zero extra dollars of take-home pay. Very simple. It is a very \nsimple choice.\n  I would hope our friends on the Republican side would allow us to \nvote today on the Republican House bill.\n  It is not going to pass, but it does provide clarity so that both \nsides can then sit down. They have rejected my compromise. Now the \nHouse version will come over here. But we will have some clarity about \nwhere both sides stand.\n  We can sit down and negotiate and get a payroll tax cut done, but we \ncannot do that until they let us vote on what the House did. We need to \nhave that vote today. I don't know why the Republican side would want \nto hold it up in the Senate. We should vote on that. It is about take-\nhome pay and also about peace of mind. I think a lot of Americans would \nlike to know now that they can celebrate the holidays and move into \n2012 with some peace of mind, knowing they are going to have some money \nin their pockets they might not have otherwise. It will have a \ntremendous impact on the economy. We know that from the data and from \nwhat happened in the first few months of 2011.\n  If the Congress fails to act, here is what it means for a State such \nas Pennsylvania. You can replicate this, I am sure, in other States as \nwell. Mark Zandi, a respected economist on both sides of the aisle in \nWashington, looked at Pennsylvania and the impact of not extending the \npayroll tax cut for 2012. He said it would cost our State a little shy \nof 20,000 jobs in calendar year 2012--in a State, by the way, where in \n2011 we created--or I should say the increase in jobs in Pennsylvania \nwas more than 50,000 in 2011. That is not enough, and we need to do \nmore, but certainly when you are creating jobs at that rate--and \npossibly in 2012 it could go above 50,000 jobs created in Pennsylvania. \nBut not to act on the payroll tax and reduce that 50,000 or more by \n20,000 jobs--and that is just one State--if you don't pass the payroll \ntax cut, that is the adverse impact on 1 State--20,000 jobs, according \nto Mark Zandi. That is a big mistake. We cannot afford to make those \nkinds of mistakes at this moment, which is very precarious in our \neconomy, just when we are getting some--although not enough--good news \nabout the economy.\n  We need to kick-start, jump-start job creation across the country. We \ncan do that in large measure--although not completely--by a payroll tax \ncut.\n  It is time to move forward and time to move on. We should get this \nvote done on the House version, and then we can go to the negotiating \ntable. While we are doing that, we can get some other things done. To \nhold up a vote on the House bill doesn't make any sense at all. We only \nhave 17 days until the end of the year. We have other work to do as \nwell. But the main thing we have to do right now is come together to \nprotect 160 million American workers so that they can conclude the year \nand go into the holiday season and begin a new year with peace of mind \nto know they are going to have that payroll tax cut in their take-home \npay and also to give those who are out of work and their families, \ntheir communities, and the country some assurance on unemployment \ninsurance.\n  It is not time to play politics in Washington. This is the holiday \nseason. If there is anytime in the year when people expect us to work \ntogether, it is at this time when we celebrate the holidays. We need to \ncome together and compromise. I have compromised a couple of times in \nmy legislation. I will not review that now, but I did that on my \nversion of the payroll tax cut. We can all compromise more. We need to \ncome together and stop putting up roadblocks to voting on measures that \nwill lead us to a compromise.\n  The simple message for today is this: Let's vote on the House bill. \nIf that doesn't pass, then we can go to the negotiating table and come \nup with a compromise to cut the payroll tax and put more take-home pay \nin the pockets of 160 million American workers.\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \nimportance of sustained funding and support for the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, better known as LIHEAP. I know it is \nsomething my colleague, the Presiding Officer, cares very much about as \nwell.\n  LIHEAP helps households pay home heating costs and targets funds for \nthose families with the lowest incomes and the highest energy costs. In \n2010, nearly 165,000 families in Minnesota used this critical lifeline.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, our home State may be known as the \nland of ice hockey and ice fishing and other winter sports, but our \ntough winters can be downright dangerous to families struggling to pay \ntheir utility bills and trying to keep the heat on.\n  Even as Minnesota's economy has weathered the recession better than \nmost, we have seen a great increase in need for assistance with heating \nbills. From 2008 to 2010, there was a 30-percent increase in families \nwho needed energy assistance. Without sustained funding for LIHEAP at \ncurrent levels, we risk pushing these 38,000 families out into the \ncold.\n  This October, I joined with Members from many cold weather States, as \nmy colleague did, in a letter that urged the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to release LIHEAP funds as quickly and at as high a \nlevel as possible. We must follow up on this action by fully funding \nLIHEAP.\n  On October 28, the Department of Health and Human Services released \n$1.7 billion for LIHEAP. This is a start, but we need another $3 \nbillion to ensure we sustain level funding from last year. Depending on \nhow and what the final appropriations are for fiscal year 2012, it is \nimportant to recognize we will need over $1 billion to fully fund \nLIHEAP.\n  I believe seniors should not have to choose between paying for \nmedication and their heating bills; that families should not have to \nchoose between putting food on the table or keeping their furnaces on \nat night, and children should always have a warm home to sleep in at \nnight. LIHEAP is targeting those families who are most in need. In \nfact, the average household served by LIHEAP in Minnesota had an income \nof $16,000, and 85 percent of the homes served by LIHEAP included at \nleast one senior, a person with a disability, or a child under the age \nof 18. These families are struggling. Now is not the time to pull the \nrug out from under their feet.\n  LIHEAP is supported by nonprofit organizations such as Community \nAction of Minneapolis, the Salvation Army, State and local governments, \nand utility companies. These organizations know the value this program \nhas to ensure that families have the tools they need to stay safe \nduring the coldest winter nights. They also see how it creates economic \nactivity by maintaining demand for utilities when household budgets are \nunder the greatest strain and may be forced to go without.\n  According to economists, LIHEAP is a smart investment. For every \ndollar in benefits paid, $1.13 is generated in economic activity. As a \ncosponsor of the LIHEAP Protection Act, introduced by Senator Jack Reed \nof Rhode Island, I want to commend my colleagues on their leadership on \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with them to ensure this \nlegislation is passed and that funding for the critical program is \nmaintained.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8569-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8569-S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3630\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to eventually make a unanimous \nconsent request. We have alerted our Republican friends to it. But \nbefore I do, I want to set the stage for why I am going to eventually \nask we be allowed to go to H.R. 3630, which is at the desk, and that \nthere be a debate and a vote on the Republican-passed payroll tax cut.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand why, as we approach the end of \nthis year, Republicans do not want, right now, to have a vote on their \nown bill. Maybe it is because they do not have a lot of votes for it \nbecause it is a disaster. The President has spoken out very strongly \nfor a payroll tax cut. We need that. It has been in effect, and if we \ndon't extend it in this time of recovering from a deep dark recession, \neconomists of all stripes have said we are going to see a reduction in \neconomic growth. That is something we don't need right now.\n  Initially, Republicans said they didn't want anything to do with this \ntax cut. They loved the tax cuts for the millionaires and billionaires. \nOh, that one they have a heart for but this one, they don't really \nlike.\n  I think they took the heat back home, and good for the American \npeople. They then decided they had to pass it because if they didn't \npass it, working people were going to notice that $1,000 increase in \ntheir taxes.\n  So we are facing a very odd situation. Having served in the House for \n10 years--I had left before Newt Gingrich became Speaker; I ran for the \nSenate. I know how things work over there. I can almost see--though I \nhave no accuracy on this; it is simply my own feeling--the mindset: The \nPresident wants this tax cut so badly, let's do it, but let's load this \nup with things he is not going to be able to abide. Frankly, that is \nwhat they did.\n  Let's look at some of the things that are in this payroll tax cut. \nFirst of all, they added environmental riders. One of them I am very \nfamiliar with, and I want to spend a minute explaining.\n  The EPA passed a rule to control the filthiest and dirtiest boiler \noperations. These boilers are located in our communities. They spew \nforth things you really don't want to know about, but we better know. \nThey are things such as mercury, arsenic, and lead. All these things \ncause cancer, and all of these things are dangerous to all of us, \nparticularly to children and to pregnant women. So the EPA has crafted \na rule--listen to this--that only goes after 5,500 of the 1.6 million \nboilers. Again, these are the filthiest and the dirtiest.\n  In crafting this rule, they had peer review science that showed this \nrule would prevent 8,100 premature deaths every single year. That is \nbecause we are talking about mercury, lead, and arsenic. These are not \nour friends.\n  Now, not being able to abide by this, those in the House are standing \nwith the dirtiest polluters, and they put a stop to that rule. To me, \nthis is shocking, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. If I saw you were driving a car in a certain direction, Mr. \nPresident, and I said to you, if you continue to drive your car in that \ndirection, you are going to hurt people; you are actually going to be \nresponsible for the deaths of 8,100 people in the course of a year, you \nwould turn that car around. But, no, they are barreling forward. I am \nnot even citing the stats--because I don't have them in my memory--on \nthe number of missed workdays, the number of asthma cases, and the lost \nschooldays, but it is in the tens of thousands in a year.\n\n  So they attached what I call a real poison pill to the payroll tax \ncut. But that wasn't enough. Despite the objections from the Republican \nGovernor of Nebraska, they pushed forward on the tar sands pipeline \nbefore the studies were done. By the way, the environmental impact \nreport was done by a company that had ties to the developer. So before \nwe rush to judgment on this, colleagues, we need to have more \ninformation. But, no, they are going to jam that through.\n  So those are two environmental riders that are in the bill that are \nvery dangerous for the American people. So it is sort of like, here is \n$1,000 for you with the payroll tax cut, but we have just increased \nyour risk of getting asthma or perhaps dying of cancer or a heart \nattack. Maybe that is why they object to having a vote on this bill.\n  Now, in this bill, the way they pay for things is unbelievable. They \nare so fearful of hurting the upper income people--those earning over \n$1 million a\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nyear and paying for this payroll tax cut the way we do, with a small \nsurtax on the millionaires and billionaires, which doesn't kick in \nuntil they get past the $1 million mark--they go after the middle \nclass. They raise premiums on Medicare for 25 percent of Medicare \nrecipients who earn $80,000 a year, and they raise it 15 percent for \nsome of them in this time of recession. They cut the number of weeks an \nindividual can get unemployment insurance, which also, at this time, is \njust plain cruel. They go after the salaries of middle-class workers, \nsuch as Federal firefighters, veterans, nurses, air traffic \ncontrollers, FBI agents, and all Federal employees while they allow \ngovernment contractor employees to earn up to $700,000 a year.\n  Senator Grassley is here, and I know he probably disagrees with some \nof what I said, but I know he agrees on the Federal contractor issue. \nIn this particular bill, which the House crafted, I say to my friends, \nthey go after middle-class workers, but the government contractor \nworkers can earn up to $700,000 a year. To me, that is the only reason \nI can see why Republicans are objecting to having a vote on this so-\ncalled payroll tax bill--because it is so loaded with things that are \ngoing to hurt the American people.\n  So I think we ought to have that vote and kill this Christmas turkey, \nbecause it is a turkey. It is harmful to the middle class. It is \nliterally going to cause an increase in premature deaths, in asthma \ncases, and it is literally going to hurt middle-class workers while it \nleaves the millionaires and billionaires alone. What kind of value \nsystem is that? Merry Christmas to the middle class. No, it isn't.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of H.R. 3630, which was just received from the House; \nthat there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees prior to a vote on passage of the bill; that no \namendments be in order prior to the vote; and that the vote on passage \nbe subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; further, if the bill is \nnot passed, it remain the pending business and the majority leader be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I must object, but I \nwish to make clear that the Senator from California understands I \ndidn't come to the floor to object to her request, but on behalf of the \nRepublican leader I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. We are buddies. We \nwork together on a lot of good government issues. But the minority \nleader, the Republican leader, is objecting.\n  So in summing this up, as I leave the floor, I would ask \nrhetorically, why on Earth the Republican leader is afraid to vote on a \nRepublican bill, other than the fact that that bill, in my view, \nexposes a set of values that are not consistent with the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nwhat time I might consume, but I wouldn't expect it would be more than \n30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nthe Fast and Furious investigation. But I would also like to follow up \nand have this portion of my remarks follow the Senator from California \nbecause I think my side has a legitimate position to take on some job \ncreation things that are in the House bill that has come over here; \nthat if people just hear one side of the story, they might \nmisunderstand we are not interested in creating jobs and we are only \ninterested in putting stumbling blocks in the way of regulations or \nPresidential decisions that are made. But it is directly related to, in \nthe case of rules by EPA that the Senator spoke about, it is a fact \nthat under this administration there is an explosion of regulations. A \nlot of those regulations, because of their cost, have led to the \nelimination of a lot of jobs or a lot of jobs not being created as a \nresult thereof.\n  So if we hear the President of the United States saying we ought to \npass legislation that he is for to create jobs or we hear the President \nof the United States, one or two times a week, flying all over the \ncountry at taxpayers' expense to give political speeches and asking to \nput the pressure on Congress to pass his jobs bill at the very same \ntime his departments are issuing regulations costing jobs or not \ncreating jobs or the President making a decision that we shouldn't \nbuild a pipeline from Canada down to Texas so we can import more oil in \na cost-effective way from our friend Canada--a reliable friend--instead \nof spending $830 million every day--every day--to import oil and paying \nthat to countries that either hate us or want to kill us, we think \nthere is an inconsistency between the President who is going around the \ncountry giving speeches on why Congress isn't passing his legislation \nto create jobs, when his administration is making decisions--in the \ncase of the pipeline, 20,000 jobs could be created right now, union-\npaying jobs, good jobs, and 110,000 jobs on the side related thereto, \nplus what it does good for the energy policy of the United States to \nhave that built. The President is standing in the way.\n  He says it needs another year of study. The State Department has \nalready given two studies over a period of years saying it is OK to go \nahead. It is not an environmental problem. The Nebraska legislature \nheld it up for a little while because of the aquifer, but they have \nreached an agreement that it can go through their State in a little \ndifferent direction.\n  We think we ought to create those 20,000 jobs and we ought to do it \nright now and this legislation that has come over from the House does \nthat. This legislation coming over from the House puts some block of \nsome regulations going into effect that is going to eliminate jobs or \nstop the creation of jobs.\n  So we are a little bit irritated about the inconsistency between an \nadministration that wants us to pass legislation to create jobs when, \nat the very same time, one person is making a decision that we are not \ngoing to move ahead with job creation projects. This legislation allows \nto move ahead for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8570-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8570-S8573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAST AND FURIOUS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the reason I came to the Senate floor is \nto give my colleagues an update on the Fast and Furious investigation \nthat I have been conducting since last January 31.\n  For almost 11 months now, I have been investigating Fast and Furious, \nan operation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF. On \nDecember 2, the Justice Department finally came clean about who helped \ndraft its February 4 letter to Congress. That was a letter I wrote that \nthey responded to since I opened the investigation on January 31. It \nonly took them a few days to get a letter to me that had a tremendous \nnumber of falsehoods in it.\n  That letter falsely denied ATF whistleblower allegations that ATF \nwalked guns. The revelation in the December 2 documents of this year \nwere the last straw for me. They admitted the February 4 letter had \nfalsehoods in it. I called for Assistant Attorney General Breuer to \nstep down, and I don't do that lightly.\n  Earlier documents had already shown Mr. Breuer displayed a stunning \nlack of judgment in failing to respond adequately when told guns had \nwalked in Operation Wide Receiver in the years 2006-07. The December 2 \ndocument showed that Mr. Breuer was far more informed during the \ndrafting of the February 4 letter than he admitted before the Judiciary \nCommittee just 1 month earlier. These two issues led me to call for the \nresignation of Mr. Breuer, the highest ranking official in the Justice \nDepartment who knew about gunwalking in Operation Wide Receiver.\n  The December 2 documents also established a number of other key \npoints. The first is that the Justice Department has a flawed process \nfor responding to letters from Congress that involve whistleblowers. So \nany of my colleagues, any of the 99 other Senators who are writing \nletters to the Justice Department, understand they have a flawed \nprocess if it involved whistleblowers responding to us. I will show\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nthat to you. In the cover letter that accompanied the documents, the \nJustice Department wrote that, in drafting their February 4 response, \nwhich had these falsehoods in it:\n\n       Department personnel . . . relied on information provided \n     by supervisors from the components in the best position to \n     know the relevant facts.\n\n  They were listening to supervisors because they only listen to \nsupervisors. That is the problem with not answering the letters in a \ntruthful way, to me, 5 days later after I handed them to the Attorney \nGeneral. I will show that in just a minute.\n  Clearly, the Justice Department did not rely on those in the best \nposition to know the facts, since the letter was withdrawn on December \n2 due to its inaccuracies.\n  I don't know how they can withdraw a letter that is in the public \ndomain, but they just somehow withdraw the letter.\n  The whistleblowers were in the best position to know the facts. \nFrontline personnel--not supervisors--were in the best position to know \nthe facts, not these senior bureaucrats or political appointees. Yet \nthe Department failed to provide a credible process for whistleblowers, \npeople who know what is happening on a day-to-day basis, and other \nfrontline personnel to provide information without fear of retaliation.\n  Employees simply do not believe they are free to report misconduct \nbecause they see what happens to those who speak out. They know it is a \ncareer killer because the ATF and the Justice Department culture \nprotects those who retaliate against whistleblowers. Yet whistleblowers \nin this case spoke out anyway.\n  In other words, these whistleblowers were speaking out, taking a \nchance on their professional future in Federal Government because they \nknew something wasn't right about the walking of guns. So they risked \ntheir career to make sure the truth was known.\n\n  The only crime committed by whistleblowers, generally, is the crime \nof committing truth. But when the Office of Legislative Affairs sought \ninformation to respond to my inquiries, it didn't ask these brave \nwhistleblowers what happened. Instead, it simply relied on self-serving \ndenials of senior officials at ATF headquarters or the criminal \ndivision here in DC or the U.S. attorneys in Arizona.\n  In other words, the Department took the word of the very officials \nthe whistleblowers alleged had mismanaged the situation in the very \nfirst place, without getting both sides of the story.\n  The U.S. attorney has since admitted in testimony to congressional \ninvestigators he was too strident when he first heard these \naccusations. He claimed he didn't know all the facts.\n  We can't rely on the chain of command when we have a whistleblower. \nBy definition, whistleblowers emerge because the chain of command is \nbroken. Whistleblowers come to Congress because they are unsuccessful \nin getting their supervisors to address fraud, waste, and abuse. \nSometimes those supervisors attempt to cover tracks and paper over the \nproblem. That is why we have to get the story straight from the horse's \nmouth. We can't let the facts be filtered through multiple layers of \nbureaucracy. After all, the bureaucracy is filled with the same \nsupervisors who should have done something about the problem in the \nvery first place before whistleblowers even come forward.\n  These problems are particularly prevalent in the Federal Government \nthat is so very large it is virtually impossible for anyone to ever be \nheld accountable for anything. So it is crucial those investigating \nwhistleblower allegations go straight to those on the ground level with \nfirsthand knowledge of the facts. Their goal should be to understand \nthe underlying facts of the whistleblower allegations, not to \nintimidate whistleblowers into silence. Instead, inquiries all too \noften focus on the whistleblowers themselves and what skeletons they \nhave in their closet. That approach is exactly what is wrong with the \nFederal Government and why it doesn't function as efficiently as it \ncan. Because if more whistleblowers were listened to and wrongs were \nbrought to the surface and transparency ruled, there would be more \naccountability.\n  The focus should be on whether the accusations are true so the \nproblems can be corrected. Too often, however, the focus is on finding \nout what information the whistleblower disclosed so the agency can \ncircle the wagons and build a defense. That needs to change. If the \ndepartment is going to regain its credibility, it needs to provide \nstraight answers, not talking points and spin.\n  The only way to provide straight answers is to make sure we get \nstraight answers in the first place. That is one reason we have pushed \nin our investigation to be able to interview frontline personnel.\n  The Justice Department objected in a letter Tuesday night. In that \nletter, the Justice Department also objected to us talking to first- or \nsecond-level supervisors. This is exactly the sort of approach that \nprevents key information from getting to senior officials and to \nCongress and impedes Congress's constitutional responsibilities to see \nthat the laws are faithfully executed. In other words, we don't just \npass laws and say that is the end of it. We have to pass laws to make \nsure we are a check on the executive branch of government and that \nmeans to do the constitutional job of oversight. That means ask \nquestions. That means we are entitled to answers--unless somebody is \ntrying to cover up something. When they are trying to cover up \nsomething in the bureaucracy, I always tell them: If you get \nstonewalled, eventually the truth is going to come out. The more truth \nthat comes out, the more egg you are going to have on your face. Mr. \nBreuer is one of those who has tremendous egg on his face.\n  Justice cites the so-called line personnel policy for refusing to \nprovide officials for voluntary interviews. The policy is based purely \non nothing but the Department's own preferences. This isn't any law or \nstatute or even case law. The Department has frequently set aside the \npolicy and made exceptions.\n  For example, line attorneys gave transcribed interviews under oath to \nCongress in the 1992 Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Facility \ninvestigation. As recently as October, assistant U.S. attorney Rachel \nLieber, the line attorney responsible for the anthrax investigations, \nparticipated in an interview with PBS's ``Frontline.''\n  How can the Justice Department tell me or argue to Congress that \nCongress should not be allowed access to line attorneys when they give \nthat same kind of access to the press? Those are the kinds of line \npersonnel and individuals who have the actual answers. I kind of \nsurmise that the reason the Justice Department will let a U.S. attorney \nor some FBI agents be interviewed on television is that some public \naffairs officer has looked at it and said: This is a good story. This \nis going to make us look good. But when Congress wants to interview \nline people, no, and we have a constitutional responsibility to do \nthat.\n  I would like to suggest that the Justice Department let the public \naffairs people make a decision of who can talk to Congress because it \nmight make them look a little better if they will let them talk to \nCongress or are they afraid we might find out something? It is \nirritating as heck.\n  In this case, had the Justice Department gone to the horse's mouth \nbefore sending an inaccurate letter to me on February 4, they would \nhave been able to get the story straight. The memo I have here I am not \ngoing to read, but I want to hold it up.\n  The memo is from an ATF line agent who substantiated the claims of \nthe first ATF whistleblowers.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy be printed in the Record immediately \nafter my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is dated February 3, 2011, the day before the \nJustice Department sent their letter to me. The memo was passed up his \nchain in response to investigators on my staff talking to him about \nOperation Fast and Furious. He accurately described the problems with \nFast and Furious. What he said was consistent with the claims I had \nalready heard from other whistleblowers. Information such as this is \nwhy I was skeptical days later when the Department sent its February 4 \nletter to me, denying the allegations. In other words, I had proof they \nwere lying to us.\n  The agent wrote in the memo about being ordered by a Fast and Furious\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\ncase agent to hold back in their surveillance, so that they did not \n``burn the operation.''\n  While watching straw purchasers hand off weapons to traffickers--\nviolating the laws of this country but encouraged to do it by their own \nJustice Department--the case agent ``told all the agents to leave the \nimmediate area.''\n  While a crime was being committed the agent said to the agents to \nleave the area immediately. The memo explicitly says:\n\n       The transaction between the suspects took place and the \n     vehicle that took possession of the firearms eventually left \n     the area without agents following it.\n\n  A crime is committed, U.S. agents there let them move on.\n  After the phone call to my staff, the ATF agent's supervisor \nrequested that he write this memo documenting what he had told my \ninvestigators. This passed up the chain all the way to the ATF \nleadership. We know that because there are e-mails attaching the memo \nsent to senior headquarter officials. However, the Justice Department \nhas refused to provide copies of those e-mails and will only allow them \nto be reviewed at Justice Department headquarters.\n  The Department has also refused to provide a copy of this memo. My \nstaff had to obtain it from confidential sources.\n  One of the questions yet to be answered is who in the Justice \nDepartment saw the memo and when. Either way, once the Justice \nDepartment got hold of it they tried to keep it under wraps by refusing \nto give me a copy. They made my staff go to the Justice Department to \nview it, even though the entire memo simply recounts information that \nwas already provided to my staff. It is embarrassing to the Department \nbecause it shows that the truth was easily knowable before the false \ndenial was sent to Congress on February 4. If they had asked for \nfirsthand documentation such as this memo when they first got my letter \nin January, we would not be where we are today.\n  The second point these documents establish is that main Justice had \nproblems of its own. It was not all the fault of the ATF or the U.S. \nattorney. Mr. Breuer's deputy, Deputy Attorney General Jason Weinstein, \nparticipated in drafting a false statement. The Justice Department's \nFebruary 4 letter read:\n\n       ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been \n     purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to \n     Mexico.\n\n  Documents show that line originated in a phone conversation, February \n1, 2011, between Justice Department legislative affairs assistant \ndirector Billy Hoover from ATF and Jason Weinstein from main Justice's \ncriminal division.\n  Like Assistant Attorney General Breuer, Mr. Weinstein knew that ATF \nhad let hundreds of weapons walk in Operation Wide Receiver, which was \nan earlier, smaller scale case than Fast and Furious. In fact, in April \n2010, he brought that fact to the attention of Mr. Breuer, his boss. \nApril 2010 is 8 months before I got involved in this investigation. His \ne-mail to Mr. Breuer about Wide Receiver said:\n\n       As you'll recall from Jim's briefing, ATF let a bunch of \n     guns walk in efforts to get upstream conspirators but only \n     got straws, and didn't recover many guns. Some were recovered \n     in [Mexico] after being used in crimes.\n\n  It is ironic that is how Mr. Weinstein described Wide Receiver. He \nwas one of the officials who authorized wiretaps in Fast and Furious. \nTherefore, he was in a position to know that exact same description \napplied to Fast and Furious. Yet he allowed the myth to be perpetrated \nthat ATF would never do such a thing. Mr. Weinstein saw the Justice \nDepartment's very first draft of the letter to Congress. In fact, as \none of his Justice Department colleagues in the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral's office said, ``CRM,'' which happens to be the criminal \ndivision, and OLA, which is the Office of Legislative Affairs--``CRM \nand OLA basically drafted it.''\n  Mr. Weinstein knew the letter contained a blatantly false line. Yet \nhe did nothing to correct it and that line thus remained in every \nsuccessive draft of the letter.\n  On December 2 this year, the Justice Department's latest spin was \nthat its statement that ``ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons'' \nwas ``aspirational.'' Nevertheless, that did not stop them from \nwithdrawing the letter for inaccuracies. Perhaps the ``aspirational'' \nlanguage should be saved for mission statements. Responses to specific \nand serious allegations ought to, in a commonsense way, stick to the \nfacts, right? This was an oversight letter. I was not asking for some \n``feel good'' fuzzy message about what ATF aspired to. I was asking for \nsimple facts.\n  A U.S. Border Patrol agent had died, and at the scene of his death \nwere two guns from Fast and Furious. So his death was connected to the \nATF operation. Whistleblowers were reaching outside of the chain of \ncommand because supervisors would not listen. Instead of treating these \nallegations with the kind of seriousness they deserved, the Justice \nDepartment resorted to damage control.\n  I do not know what else my investigation is going to uncover, but we \nare going to pursue it until we get to the end of it because my goal is \nto find out who at the highest level of government, in Justice or the \nWhite House, approved this, and get them fired; make sure that the \nTerry family gets all of the information about the death of their son--\nto this point they have had hardly anything--and, No. 3, to make sure a \nstupid program like walking guns, Fast and Furious, et cetera, never \nhappens again.\n  This week the investigation revealed that shortly after the February \n4 letter, Lanny Breuer asked Mr. Weinstein to write up an analytical \nmemo of Fast and Furious. This suggests that Mr. Breuer and his deputy \nMr. Weinstein were down in the weeds on Operation Fast and Furious a \nlot earlier than previously admitted. Mr. Weinstein was in an excellent \nposition to write such a memo, since Mr. Breuer has acknowledged that \nMr. Weinstein was one of the individuals who approved wiretaps in the \nsummer of 2010 as part of Operation Fast and Furious. However, we had \nto learn of this memo from sources not from the Justice Department but \nfrom outside of the Justice Department. The Justice Department has not \nprovided it to us, even though it is clearly responsive to a House \nOversight Government Reform Committee October 25 subpoena.\n  This type of maneuvering is what got the Justice Department in \ntrouble to begin with. The Justice Department should produce this \ndocument immediately, along with all the other responsive documents.\n  This investigation will continue. People must be held accountable. \nThe Justice Department must stop stonewalling today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n           Firearms and Explosives,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2011.\n     Memorandum To: Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Field Division\n     Thru: Resident Agent in Charge, Lubbock Field Office\n     From: Gary M. Styers, Special Agent, Lubbock Field Office\n     Subject: Contact with Congressional Investigators\n       On February 2, 2011, at approximately 1500 hours, ATF \n     Special Agent Gary Styers was contacted telephonically by \n     Robert Donovan and Brian Downey, representing United States \n     Senator Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     Downey and Donovan after identifying themselves asked Special \n     Agent Styers if he would be willing to answer some questions \n     regarding the time Special Agent Styers spent on a detail to \n     the Phoenix Field Division, Phoenix Group VII Office. Special \n     Agent Styers said he would be willing to answer questions to \n     the best of his knowledge.\n       Special Agent Styers was asked if he was familiar with the \n     large firearms trafficking case in Phoenix Group VII and \n     Special Agent Styers said he was. Downey and Donovan asked if \n     Special Agent Styers knew the name of the case and he \n     responded that it was ``Fast and Furious.'' Downey and \n     Donovan then asked if Special Agent Styers knew who the case \n     agent was and Special Agent Styers said it was Special Agent \n     Hope McAllister. Special Agent Styers was also asked who the \n     supervisor of the group was and Special Agent Styers said it \n     was Group Supervisor David Voth. Downey and Donovan also \n     asked who helped Special Agent McAllister, Special Agent \n     Styers said that Special Agent McAllister had a Co-Case Agent \n     from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as an \n     agent from Group VII. Downey and Donovan asked who was the \n     Agent from ICE and Special Agent Styers told them it was Lane \n     France.\n       Downey and Donovan asked Special Agent Styers if he knew \n     what the agents were assigned to do on the investigation. \n     Special Agent Styers explained that a group of agents were \n     assigned to the case and that since the case was in the stage \n     of an active\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\n     wiretap, some agents were working within the group and \n     Special Agent Styers was then asked about his general \n     impression of the Fast and Furious case. Special Agent Styers \n     stated that the case had systematically divided and isolated \n     agents from the group. The case agent had solicited the \n     advice of numerous experienced agents, including Special \n     Agent Styers, regarding how to conduct and end the wiretap \n     operations and case overall. Special Agent Styers gave the \n     case agent his honest opinion and advice since Special Agent \n     Styers had worked two wiretap investigations in his career. \n     Special Agent Styers felt that his advice and opinions, as \n     well as other agents' advice and opinions were widely \n     disregarded. Along with other agents within the group, \n     Special Agent Styers explained that he was no longer asked to \n     assist with Fast and Furious and concentrated on his assigned \n     cases and provided necessary assistance to fellow agents \n     within the detail and group.\n       Downey and Donovan asked Special Agent Styers what he felt \n     was incorrect about the way the Fast and Furious case was \n     conducted. Special Agent Styers explained that first and \n     foremost, it is unheard of to have an active wiretap \n     investigation without full time dedicated surveillance units \n     on the ground. Special Agent Styers relayed that no agents in \n     the group were assigned to surveillance on the Fast and \n     Furious case. Special Agent Styers said that other agencies \n     or task force officers may have been used to conduct \n     surveillance and respond to calls of FFLs, but it seemed that \n     either the case agent or Group Supervisor would poll the \n     office for agents who were available to respond at short \n     notice.\n       Secondly, Special Agent Styers said that it appeared odd to \n     have a majority of ATF Agents working on a wiretap \n     investigation, who had never worked such a case. Especially, \n     when numerous, permanent Group VII agents and detailers had \n     previous wiretap experience.\n       Special Agent Styers was provided with contact information \n     for Downey and Donovan and the conversation was ended. \n     Special Agent Styers contacted the Lubbock Resident Agent in \n     Charge, Jim Luera at 1545 hours after the conversation with \n     Downey and Donovan ended, to inform him of the contact. \n     Special Agent Styers was later asked to document the \n     conversation herein and attempted to do so to the fullest \n     extent possible.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Gary M. Styers.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do not see another Member on the \nfloor.

Mr. President, the cornerstone of Congress's ability to \neffectively oversee the Federal Government is the free and open access \nto information--in other words, congressional oversight, what I was \ntalking about in regard to Fast and Furious.\n  On another investigation 231 days ago, on April 27, I made a very \nsimple request. I requested that the Federal Communications Commission \nturn over communications regarding its controversial approval of the \nLightSquared project. LightSquared is a company owned by a hedge fund \ncalled Harbinger Capital Partners that is seeking FCC approval to use \nits satellite spectrum to build a terrestrial wireless network. To \naccomplish its goals, LightSquared has already spent millions of \ndollars on lobbyists and made large political donations.\n  The problem is that LightSquared's signals would, according to \nFederal Government tests, cause massive interference with the global \npositioning system, more commonly referred to as GPS. GPS, as you know, \nis a critical tool for anything from military drones and missiles to \ncar and ship navigation. LightSquared's initial plan, which the FCC \nconditionally approved, would have interfered with just about every \nsingle GPS user.\n  The surprising fact is that there is no evidence the FCC even tested \nLightSquared's plan before approving it. In fact, the FCC granted this \nwaiver--which is estimated to be worth at least $10 billion to \nLightSquared--in a shortened comment period starting right around \nThanksgiving, 2010. Giving a company a possible $10 billion windfall in \na holiday-shortened comment period without doing any testing is very \nsuspicious. Risking our Nation's GPS assets, including the role they \nplay in defending our Nation to accomplish this goal, is downright \ndangerous.\n  The question I am asking is, Why would the FCC do this? Of course, to \nget to the bottom of this question I asked the Federal Communications \nCommission for some documents--again, a simple question, a request for \nsome information. The FCC, an agency with employees who are supposed to \nwork for the American people, said no to my request. My staff was told \nthe FCC intentionally ignored my document request. The FCC officials \nsaid they have determined that they will only be responsive to two \nMembers of Congress: the Chairs of the House and Senate Commerce \nCommittees, not even to ranking members of those same committees, and, \nof course, not to members of those committees whether you are majority \nor minority. Presumably, they would not even answer to the majority \nleader of the Senate or to the Speaker of the House, but for sure they \nsurely are not answering to this senior Senator from Iowa. If you \nhappen to be one of the 99.6 of the Congress who doesn't chair one of \nthose two committees, from the FCC's point of view, sorry, you are out \nof luck. No documents for you. This attitude is unacceptable. I \nconveyed my concerns to the FCC on July 5 and asked again for \ndocuments. Again, I was stonewalled. This time the FCC claimed that \nsince I cannot subpoena the FCC, it would not respond.\n\n  President Obama committed to run the most transparent administration \nin history. Yet the FCC is saying if you cannot force us to be open, we \nwon't do it. I wrote another letter asking the FCC for documents on \nSeptember 8, and again I was stonewalled.\n  This brings us to where we are today, 230-some days later. The FCC's \ndecision to impede Congress's constitutional duty of oversight has \nforced me to make a difficult decision. I do not take that decision to \nhold up nominees lightly, but I never do it in secret. I always put a \nstatement in the Record, and this is in addition to that statement. But \nwhen an agency flagrantly disregards congressional oversight, something \nmust be done.\n  Before I publicly announced my intention to hold the nominees, I, \nthrough staff, contacted the FCC officials. I informed them that if the \ndocuments were not forthcoming, I would hold up the Federal \nCommunication Commission's nominees whom the President sent up here. I \nwas surprised and disappointed by their response. Despite knowing my \nintentions, they chose not to provide any documents. As a result, I am \nhonoring my promise to hold those nominees.\n  It is unfortunate the FCC has chosen this path. Due to the FCC's \ndecision to hide its actions from the public and Congress, these \nnominations are now stalled in the Senate. The question I would ask \ntoday of my colleagues and the President of the Senate is: Why? The FCC \nhas already told me it would likely provide these documents if certain \nmembers--chairmen of committees--asked for them, but somehow 99.6 \npercent of the Congress has no right to this information. In other \nwords, 99.6 percent of the Members of Congress cannot do their \nconstitutional job of oversight of the Federal Communications \nCommission. To paraphrase a very popular slogan these days, I guess \nthat makes me part of the 99.6 percent.\n  My concern is not just specific to this document request. It is \nbroader than that. In the future, any Member of Congress may request \ndocuments from the FCC. As the courts have put it, every Member has a \nvoice and a vote in the process under the Constitution. Each one of us \nhas the authority to request and receive information from the executive \nbranch in order to inform those votes. That is what our court has said. \nThat authority is inherent in each Member's responsibility to \nparticipate in the legislative process.\n  The creation of the committee system and the delegation of certain \nresponsibilities to committee chairmen doesn't change that at all. \nIndividual Members still have a right, as well as a responsibility, to \ninform themselves by requesting information directly from agencies. For \nCongress to have a complete view of how an agency works, we need to \nhave access to documents. Turning off that flow of information \nshortcircuits transparency and hurts accountability.\n  In this case, the Federal Communication Commission's actions have \nreal-\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nworld effects. The FCC's decision to grant a waiver to LightSquared \ncreated uncertainty for GPS users, and that includes our own National \nDefense Agency, the Department of Defense, and other Federal agencies. \nAnother one is the Federal Aviation Administration which claims that \n800 people would die as a result of LightSquared's initially proposed \nnetwork. To the FAA, the FCC's decision could have killed people.\n  The Department of Defense wrote a letter to the FCC saying that it \nwas not consulted by the FCC. Press reports say that General Shelton--\nwho heads up GPS for the Armed Forces--said that LightSquared's \ninterference would harm the military's use of GPS. To the Department of \nDefense, the Federal Communication Commission's actions would have \nharmed national security.\n  These are only two agencies, but the Department of Transportation, \nNASA, and NOAA, among others, have already raised concerns about \nLightSquared's plan. The effects of the FCC's decision are not just \nlimited to the Federal Government; they also affect ordinary Americans. \nHere are two examples: For Americans who hope that NextGen air traffic \ncontrol will reduce air traffic delays, the FCC's action would have \ncontinued to increase air traffic wasting time, fuel, and ultimately \nmoney for the flying public. For Americans who use precision \nagriculture to save time and money, the FCC's actions would harm the \naccuracy and reliability of their equipment. This again leads to wasted \nenergy, lower crop yields, and higher prices for products such as wheat \nand corn. At the end of the day, the FCC's actions would cost the \nAmerican consumers money.\n  Does the FCC even care? I don't know. But the agency certainly has \nnot provided any evidence that it took any of this information into \nconsideration. What we see today is an agency that is completely \nunaccountable and unanswerable to 99.6 percent of the Congress and, by \nextension, the American public. This is simply wrong, and I will \ncontinue to hold the FCC's nominees until this attitude changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8574-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BENEFITS EXPIRATION\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nimmediately extend the payroll tax cut and to fully continue jobless \nbenefits for millions of Americans. In less than 3 weeks 160 million \nAmericans face an automatic tax increase and millions of out-of-work \nAmericans will begin to lose their jobless benefits. In order to keep \nour economy on track, we must continue the payroll tax cut and jobless \nbenefits for millions of out-of-work Americans.\n  My State of Rhode Island, in particular, has felt the economic \ndownturn acutely. With four unemployed job seekers for every one job \nand middle-class families struggling to get by--the possibility that \nCongress would let the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits expire is \nunthinkable.\n  I have joined my colleagues on this side of the aisle and voted time \nand again to cut taxes for middle-class families, and each time our \nRepublican colleagues have opposed the measure because they value tax \nbreaks for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of income earners more than \nthey do tax cuts for middle-class Americans. Republicans have even \nrejected our effort to provide tax cuts to businesses and provide them \nincentives to hire. So in response, Democrats narrowed the focus of the \ntax cuts to employees. But, Republicans again refused to provide a tax \ncut for the middle class because it was paid for by asking the top one-\ntenth of 1 percent of Americans to contribute.\n  We have seen Republicans refuse to invest in our Nation's roads, \nbridges, schools, and in policies that will create jobs because \nRepublicans cling to their belief that the wealthiest in our Nation \nshould not have to share in the sacrifice every other American has made \nduring these very difficult economic times. Republicans have voted in \nfavor of millionaires and billionaires five times, costing middle-class \nAmericans tax cuts and the continuation of jobless benefits and other \npolicies that would help create and sustain jobs.\n  Republicans are not putting forth serious proposals. The House \nRepublican extenders plan that passed that body yesterday is the latest \nexample of not only brinksmanship but their ideological rigidity. \nInstead of reaching a sensible compromise that works for all Americans, \nthe House Republicans voted to slash the current unemployment insurance \nprogram nearly in half and eliminate targeted relief for the hardest \nhit States like Rhode Island even as our job market is still weak and \n14 million Americans are out of work. Republicans are in effect \nrefusing to pass critical legislation, particularly with respect to \ncontinuing unemployment insurance. And instead of continuing \nunemployment insurance they are working to put an end to it by \nimplementing aggressive waivers leading to block granting and creating \nartificial barriers to benefits--all with the long-term goal of \ndismantling the system. The Republicans would blunt one of the most \neffective countercyclical tools we have and ultimately throw it away.\n\n  At the core of the Republican Party's effort to reduce jobless \nbenefits is the terribly misguided belief that Americans don't want to \nwork. I say to my Republican colleagues--Americans do want to work. But \nwe have to create jobs or incentivize the private sector to create jobs \nso they can work.\n  Instead of compromising and focusing on economic policies that will \nhelp create jobs and help the middle class, House Republicans focus on \ndead-on-arrival special interest pet projects such as the Keystone \npipeline and further efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act.\n  The Republican plan ignores the reality and the challenges that face \nAmerican families--to maintain their home, to maintain their job, to \nprovide for the future of their families and their children and their \nretirement.\n  For those who have lost their jobs in one of the worst economic \ndownturns we have ever faced, unemployment insurance is a lifeline. It \nis also important for Main Street businesses that rely on these \ndollars. Grocery stores and drugstores--they all depend on people \nhaving some cash to come in and take care of the necessities of life. \nWithout the extension of jobless benefits, consumers will pull back \nspending, hurt local businesses, and decelerate the progress our \neconomy has made.\n  We have had 21 months of private sector job growth. This is not \nsufficient to satisfy the needs across the country, but the growth \nstands in stark contrast to the absolute collapse of employment in the \nlast months of the Bush administration. This job growth has not been an \naccident. It has been the result of decisions that the President and \nCongress made, which include the Recovery Act and other programs that \nkeep the economy moving--not fast enough--but keep it moving forward.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that failing to extend UI \nbenefits could result in a loss of $72 billion of economic activity in \n2012--$72 billion of lost demand, which would slow down the economy and \nslow down job creation.\n  These are challenging times for millions of Americans. We cannot \nafford to let Congress be sidetracked by marginal issues. The core \nissues are very clear: extend tax cuts for middle-class Americans, \ncontinue unemployment benefits to those desperately searching for work. \nWe are facing a tough job market; we have to pass these measures. We \nhave to pass a clean tax cut for millions of working middle class \nfamilies, and we have to continue jobless benefits in order to help \nmillions of out-of-work Americans looking for a job.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when President Obama was sworn into \noffice, the Nation's average price for a gallon of gasoline was under \n$2. We all know that is not the case today. In most parts of the \ncountry, gas remains well over $3 a gallon. In my home State of\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\nArkansas, the price of gas ranges anywhere from just under $3 to $3.50 \na gallon. The reason it stayed at a steady price is because there is a \ndecreased demand because of the poor economy.\n  Business owners will tell you that when the price of gas hits $3.50 a \ngallon, it truly does affect how decisions are made. When it hits the \n$4 mark, things start to shut down in terms of the economy because the \naverage person's disposable income is going to the gas pump instead of \nlocal businesses.\n  Our country at this time lacks an energy policy. We are also facing a \njobs crisis of enormous magnitude. And our President is standing in the \nway of one project that can help address both of these problems: the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  The proposed 1,700-mile pipeline would transport 700,000 barrels of \noil per day from Canada to U.S. refineries in the gulf coast. Canada's \noil sands are among the largest oil reserves in the world. As global \ndemand for oil surges and Canada increases production, the addition of \nthe Keystone Pipeline will ensure that Americans benefit from reliable \nand secure oil from our largest trading partner and trusted ally.\n  The $7 billion pipeline cost will be paid by the Keystone consortium \nand will fund nearly $\\1/2\\ billion in salaries. It will result in the \npurchase of $6.5 billion worth of materials, services, and other local \neconomic activity. None of this will be funded with any Federal money. \nIt is a no-brainer.\n  Some of these jobs are in my home State of Arkansas. Welspun Tubular \nCompany, which makes pipes for the oil industry, has been producing \npipe for the Keystone project. Unfortunately, due to the \nadministration's delay on Keystone, the company has already begun to \nlay off workers in Little Rock. They have 500 miles of pipe that was \nproduced for the project, ready to go, that is just sitting in the \nfacility.\n  By delaying the start of the project, it is putting Americans out of \nwork instead of putting Americans to work. Delaying this project costs \nthousands of well-paying jobs when Americans need reliable employment, \nand it hurts Arkansas businesses that have invested millions of dollars \nto help produce the pipeline. It is also a major step backward for \nenergy policy goals of reducing our dependence on oil from unstable \nregimes.\n  When it comes to energy policy, I am kind of a T. Boone Pickens guy. \nI firmly believe that if it is American, we need to be using it. This \ngoes for not only renewable forms of energy but the vast amount of \nfossil fuels we have been blessed with throughout the United States and \ndirectly off our shores. If we use what we have here in a responsible \nmanner, we can be better positioned to pick and choose from whom we \nimport our remaining oil.\n  Importing oil from Canada would accelerate America's independence \nfrom overseas oil by increasing the petroleum trade with one of our \nmost reliable allies, one of our most reliable friends, instead of \ndepending on the likes of Saudi Arabia and hostile regimes such as \nVenezuela for much of our oil. The amount of oil provided through this \nproject is equal to half the amount we import from the Middle East. I \ndoubt that anyone in this body would argue that any of the countries we \nimport oil from in that region are more stable than Canada.\n  President Obama needs to quit pandering to the radical \nenvironmentalists. He needs to do what is best for the country, not \nwhat he perceives is best for his reelection. The Keystone Pipeline is \nwhat is best for America. Let's move forward.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today the President of the United States traveled to Ft. \nBragg, NC, to mark the end of the war in Iraq and to pay tribute to the \nmore than 12.5 million men and women of our Armed Forces who have \nserved and fought there since 2003. Those Americans deserve all of the \npraise and recognition they receive, for they have given up their \ncomfort and safety. They have given up less demanding and more \nlucrative jobs. They have given parts of their bodies and cherished \nparts of their lives. They have given the quiet little sacrifices that \noften go unmentioned but often hurt the most: the anniversaries spent \nalone, the birth of a child missed, the first steps not seen, and the \nfirst words not heard.\n  They have given all of that, and always they are prepared to give \nmore. They deserve to be honored by us all. I know the President's \nwords of praise and appreciation for our troops today were sincere and \nheartfelt. I have every reason to believe he will do all in his power \nto keep his promises to take care of our troops and their families at \nhome and to never forget how those noble Americans have done far more \nthan their fair share for the betterment of our Nation.\n  The President is a patriot and a good American, and I know his heart \nswells with the same pride and sense of awe all of us feel when we are \nin the presence of our men and women in uniform. These are humbling \nfeelings, feelings of wonderment and gratitude, and they unite all \nAmericans whether they supported the war in Iraq or not.\n  But let me point out a fact the President did not acknowledge today, \nwhich is this: Our men and women in uniform have been able to come home \nfrom Iraq by the tens of thousands over the past 3 years, and not just \ncome home but come home with honor having succeeded in their mission \nfor the simple reason that the surge worked.\n  All of this is possible because in 2007, with the war nearly lost, we \nchanged our strategy, changed our leaders in the field, and sent more \ntroops. This policy was vehemently opposed at the time by then-Senator \nObama and now President of the United States and his senior leaders \nright here on the floor of this Senate.\n  On January 10, 2007, the day the surge strategy was announced, then-\nSenator Obama said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is \n     going to solve the sectarian violence there. In fact, I think \n     it will do the reverse.\n\n  On November 15, 2007, when it was clear to GEN David Petraeus and \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker and many of us that the surge was working, \nthen-Senator Obama said:\n\n       The overall strategy is failed because we have not seen any \n     change in behavior among Iraq's political leaders.\n\n  Finally, on January 28, 2008, when it was undeniable the surge was \nsucceeding, he had this to say:\n\n       President Bush said that the surge in Iraq is working, when \n     we know that's just not true.\n\n  At the time the President's preferred alternative was to begin an \nimmediate withdrawal and have all U.S. troops out of Iraq by the end of \n2009. I will let future historians be the judge of that proposed \npolicy. All I will say is that for 3 years, the President has been \nharvesting the successes of the very strategy he consistently dismissed \nas a failure. I imagine this irony was not lost on a few of our troops \nat Fort Bragg today, most of whom deployed and fought as part of the \nsurge.\n  The fact is, the President has consistently called for a complete \nwithdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the earliest possible date, \nand he has never deviated from this position as President. Indeed, he \nalways reaffirmed his campaign promise to end the war in Iraq and \nwithdrawal of our troops. So perhaps it should not have come as a \nsurprise when the President announced in October that he was ending \nnegotiations with the Iraqi Government over whether to maintain a small \nnumber of U.S. troops in Iraq beyond this year to continue assisting \nIraq security forces.\n  I continue to believe this decision represents a failure of \nleadership, both Iraqi and American; that it was a sad case of \npolitical expediency triumphing over military necessity, both in \nBaghdad and in Washington; and that it will have serious negative \nconsequences for Iraq's stability and our national security interests.\n  I sincerely hope I am wrong, but I fear that GEN Jack Keane, who is \none of the main architects of the surge, could be correct again when he \nsaid recently:\n\n       We won the war in Iraq, and we are now losing the peace.\n\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\n\n  Let me be clear. Like all Americans, I too am eager to bring our \ntroops home. I do not want them to remain in Iraq or anywhere else for \na day longer than necessary. But I also agree with our military \ncommanders in Iraq who were nearly unanimous in their belief that some \nU.S. forces, approximately 20,000, should remain for a period of time \nto help the Iraqis secure the hard-earned gains that we had made \ntogether.\n  All of our top commanders in Iraq, by the way, chosen by the \nPresident of the United States--all of our top commanders in Iraq--\nGeneral Petraeus, General Odierno, General Austin, all of them believed \nwe needed to maintain a presence of U.S. troops there, and they \nconsistently made that clear to many of us during our repeated visits \nto Iraq.\n  On February 3, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, GEN Lloyd \nAustin, and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Jim Jeffrey testified to the \nCommittee on Armed Services that for all of the progress the Iraqi \nsecurity forces had made in recent years--and it has been substantial--\nthey still have critical gaps in their capabilities that will endure \nbeyond this year. Those shortcomings included enabling functions for \ncounterterrorism operations, the control of Iraq's airspace, and other \nexternal security missions, intelligence collection and fusion, \ntraining and sustainment of the force.\n  Our commanders wanted U.S. troops to remain in Iraq beyond this year \nto continue assisting Iraqi forces in filling these gaps in their \ncapabilities. Indeed, Iraqi commanders believed the exact same thing. \nIn August, the chief of staff of Iraq's armed forces could not have \nbeen any clearer. He said:\n\n       The problem will start after 2011. The politicians must \n     find other ways to fill the void after 2011. If I were asked \n     about the withdrawal, I would say to politicians, the U.S. \n     Army must stay until the Iraqi Army is fully ready in 2020.\n\n  During repeated travels to Iraq with my colleagues, I have met with \nall of the leaders of Iraq's major political blocs, and they too said \nthey would support keeping a presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. So let's \nbe clear. This is what our commanders recommended, it is what Iraqi \ncommanders recommended, and it is what all of Iraq's key political \nleaders said privately that they were prepared to support. So what \nhappened? What happened?\n  Advocates of withdrawal are quick to point out that the current \nsecurity arrangement which requires all U.S. troops to be out of Iraq \nby the end of this year was concluded by the Bush administration. That \nis true. But it is also beside the point. The authors of that agreement \nalways intended for it to be renegotiated at a later date to allow some \nU.S. forces to remain in Iraq.\n  As former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, whose State Department \nteam negotiated the security agreements, has said:\n\n       There was an expectation that we would negotiate something \n     that looked like a residual force for our training with the \n     Iraqis. Everybody believed it would be better if there was \n     some kind of residual force.\n\n  So if that is not the reason, I ask again: What happened? The \nprevailing narrative is that the U.S. and Iraqi leaders could not reach \nagreement over the legal protections needed to keep our troops in Iraq. \nTo be sure, this was a matter of vital importance. But while this may \nhave been a reason for our failure, the privileges and immunities \nissues are less causes than symptoms of the larger reason we could not \nreach agreement with the Iraqis. Because of his political promise to \nfully withdraw from Iraq, the President never brought the full weight \nof his office to bear in shaping the politics and the events on the \nground in Iraq so as to secure a residual presence of U.S. troops. This \nleft our commanders and our negotiators in Baghdad mostly trying to \nrespond to events in Iraq, trying to shape events without the full \ninfluence of the American President behind them.\n  Last May, I traveled to Iraq with the Senator from South Carolina, \nMr. Graham. We met with all of the major Iraqi leaders. All of them \nwere ready to come to an agreement on a future presence of U.S. troops \nin Iraq. But as Prime Minister Malaki explained to us, the \nadministration at that time and for the foreseeable future had not \ngiven the Iraqi Government a number of troops and missions that it \nwould propose to keep in Iraq.\n  For weeks after, the administration failed to make a proposal to the \nIraqis, and when the Iraqis finally united in August and publicly asked \nthe administration to begin negotiations, the response from Washington \nwas again characterized by delay. This ensured that a serious \nnegotiation could not begin much less succeed.\n  I know Iraq is a sovereign country. I know it has an elected \ngovernment that must answer to public opinion. I know there could be no \nagreement over a future U.S. military presence in Iraq if Iraqis did \nnot agree to it and build support for it. So this is as much a failure \nof Iraqi leadership as it is of American leadership. But to blame this \non the Iraqis does not excuse the fact that we had an enormous amount \nof influence with Iraq's leaders and we did not exercise it to the \nfullest extent possible to achieve an outcome that was in our national \nsecurity interest.\n  In fact, in the view of many, they deliberately refused to come up \nwith a number. They deliberately refused to engage in serious \nnegotiation with the Iraqis, with the ultimate purpose of fulfilling \nthe Presidents's campaign pledge that he would get all U.S. troops out \nof Iraq.\n  That is not a violation of sovereignty. That is diplomacy, that is \nleadership. Leaders must shape events and public opinion not just \nrespond to them, and starting in early 2009, from their desire to \naccelerate our withdrawal from Iraq faster than our commanders \nrecommended, to their hands-off approach to the Iraqi process of \ngovernment formation last year, to their record of delay and passivity \non the question of maintaining a presence of U.S. troops beyond this \nyear, this administration has consistently failed at the highest level \nto lead on Iraq.\n  I say again, perhaps this outcome should not have been a surprise. It \nis what the President has consistently promised to do, and that \ndecision makes good political sense for this President. But such \ndecisions should not be determined by domestic politics. The brave \nAmericans who have fought so valiantly and have given so much did so \nnot for political reasons but for the safety and security of their \nfellow citizens, for their friends, for their families, for their \nchildren's future, and for us.\n  This is a decisive moment in the history of America's relationship \nwith Iraq and with all of the countries of the broader Middle East. \nThis is a moment when the substantial influence we have long enjoyed in \nthat part of the world could be receding--in fact, it is receding. We \ncannot allow that to be our Nation's future. We must continue to lead. \nWe must not let short-term political gains dictate our longer term \ngoals. We need to continue working to shape a freer, more just, and \nmore secure future for both Iraq and for people across the Middle East, \nfor it is in our own national security interest to do so.\n  Over 4,000 brave, young Americans gave their lives in this conflict. \nI hope and I pray--regardless of these decisions made in large part for \npolitical reasons--that their sacrifice was not in vain. I hope their \nfamilies will not mourn the day their sons and daughters went out to \nfight for freedom for the Iraqi people.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear that this decision of a complete pullout \nof U.S. troops from Iraq was dictated by politics and not our national \nsecurity interests. I believe history will judge this President's \nleadership with the scorn and disdain it deserves.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the House yesterday passed a bill that \nincluded an effort to move forward on the Keystone XL Pipeline project, \nand I wish to talk about that project for a while today and American \nenergy generally.\n  We all agree private sector job creation needs to be the No. 1 \npriority in Washington. One of the best ways to jump-start job creation \nis simply\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nthrough good energy projects. The shortest path to more American jobs \nis more American energy.\n  Unfortunately, the President and the administration have delayed one \nof the largest domestic, shovel-ready projects until after the election \nnext year. This is a project that is ready to go. The States this \nproject would go through have cleared the way for the project. There is \nno government money involved. This just takes a government OK, saying: \nYes, it is all right to create these jobs. These jobs not only have the \nshort-term impact of creating the jobs that are created to build the \npipeline but the long-term impact of all the economic activity that \noccurs because of this new North American energy to which we would have \naccess. In delaying this program, the President is simply stalling the \ncreation of thousands of jobs and postponing not only the growth in our \neconomy but also a move toward more energy security.\n  Not too many years ago, I don't think one could say with a straight \nface that we need to do everything we can to create something that \nclosely resembles energy independence. We are in a situation now with \nNorth American energy where we can do that. The numbers on the Keystone \nXL project speak for themselves.\n  This project would create 20,000 direct jobs during the construction \nphase--20,000 jobs. That is why the labor union movement in the country \nsupports this project. Twenty thousand jobs to build the pipeline. It \nwould generate $20.9 billion in new private sector spending. It would \ngenerate around $5 billion in new State, local, and Federal revenue \nwhen this project is being built and when this project is completed. \nNationwide, the project would benefit 1,400 American job creators.\n  The Keystone XL project would also help reinforce America's energy \nsecurity by reducing our dependence on other parts of the world. With \nCanada, our largest trading partner, it is a miracle relationship, this \nlarge border that we don't worry very much about, all the back-and-\nforth economic activity that occurs. In fact, for every $1 we would \nsend to Canada for that energy, they would send 91 cents back. So this \nis $1 we are spending to get 91 cents back, to be more of an energy \npartner with our closest neighbor--we have clearly a bigger border with \nCanada than we do with Mexico--to be an energy partner with our closest \nneighbor rather than to worry about energy in places where, frankly, \nthey don't like us very well. If they do like us, they don't get the \nmoney back to us in the same way.\n  In fact, by comparison, of the 91 cents we would get back for every \n$1 we send to Canada for North American energy coming out of Canada, we \nget 49 cents back from Saudi Arabia. That doesn't mean Saudi Arabia is \na bad trading partner. It just means they are not as good a trading \npartner as the Canadians are. We get 33 cents back from Venezuela. So \nwhy would we want to send $1 to Venezuela or $1 to Saudi Arabia for \nenergy if we could send $1 to Canada and almost all of that $1 comes \nright back to us?\n  Domestically, this project would help encourage more oil production \nin the Bakken formation in the Upper Great Plains. The Bakken \nformation--which I sure didn't know about 15 years ago and I don't know \nthat anybody did--is thought to be the greatest new energy development \nsince Prudhoe Bay in the 1960s. I read somewhere the other day that \nNorth Dakota has become the fourth or fifth energy-producing State in \nthe country, passing Oklahoma. This is a great resource right at the \nincoming border of where this new pipeline and all this energy activity \nwould be.\n  Regardless of the White House's decision to delay this project, the \nCanadian oil sands will be developed. It is not a question of whether \nthere is going to be a market; it is who gets the market. The Canadians \nhave said, as they should: If we don't build a pipeline through the \nUnited States to the refineries in the Southern part of the United \nStates, we are going to build that same pipeline in another direction. \nMost likely, the pipeline will go to the Pacific coast and then the \nenergy goes to Asia.\n  Why would we want energy going to Asia from a trading partner where \nwe get 91 cents back rather than energy coming here? Why would we want \nto buy more energy from the Middle East and less energy than we could \nbuy from our neighbor? Why would we think for a minute that the energy \nsecurity of the country would be better served in any other way than \nthis one?\n  So this is going to most likely go to Asia. If it doesn't go to Asia, \nI guess it can go to the Atlantic coast and go to Europe. But what \neverybody believes is, if it doesn't come here, they just turn the \npipeline to the west instead of the south, and those oil sands, that \ngreat energy resource goes somewhere else rather than where it makes \nmore sense for us to get it or more sense for them to send it.\n  This is as close to an energy no-brainer as I can think of. But the \nmajority leader says this project is dead on arrival in the Senate. I \ndon't believe he meant just dead on arrival if it was part of a package \nthat extended the payroll tax. I think the quote was: ``It is dead on \narrival.'' It is not going to go anywhere in the coming year, at a time \nwhen we need those jobs. Eventually, we all know as quickly as we can \nget it, we need to be more dependent on North American energy and less \ndependent on energy everywhere else.\n  There have been many reports that say the administration's timing is \nin consideration for the reelection effort. This appears to be about \none American job instead of more American jobs, and we need to be \nconcerned about more American jobs.\n  Some reports have noted that the President's advisers ``fear that a \ndecision in favor of the project could dampen enthusiasm among \nvolunteers needed for door-to-door campaigning in battleground \nStates.''\n  I thought that bus went to battleground States. That should be enough \nto get to battleground States. We shouldn't have to worry about not \nhaving these volunteers because we choose to do what makes sense for us \nin the energy situation.\n  Others have noted that ``the President decided to punt on this \nproject in order to placate parts of the coalition that elected him in \n2008.''\n  Americans are looking for jobs, not more of the same from Washington. \nThis isn't time for politics. We need to jump-start the private sector \neconomy. Again, I will say, the quickest road to more American jobs is \nmore American energies.\n  For the better part of 60 years, we have used more energy than we \ncould produce. The marketplace is there. The consumer is there. The \nuser is there. This is what capitalism is all about. It is what free \nenterprise is all about, figuring out how to connect the product with \nthe consumer. So we know the consumer is there. Let's do what we can to \nconnect that consumer with the energy needs they have.\n  According to a Gallup poll, the sharp decline in the workforce last \nmonth may have more of a reflection on the large number of Americans \ndeciding to give up looking for work. Let's do things that energize the \neconomy and energize the American workforce.\n  I am glad to be a sponsor of the North American Energy Security Act. \nThe House again pursued this week a similar policy as part of their \neffort to vote on a payroll tax extension, with this as an effort to \ncreate new jobs. Whether it is the Keystone Pipeline or the Utility \nMACT rule that slows down people's decisions to make a job-creating \ndecision or other EPA rules and potential rules that make people think \ntwice and three times and eventually enough times you don't do it about \njob creation or what we need to do to get to the oil and gas shale \nreserves of the country or oil in the Gulf of Mexico, let's do what is \nnecessary for North America. Let's make North American energy work for \nAmerica. I don't know a better way to do that at less government cost \nor less government involvement than the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to share a feeling that many in my \nhome\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nState have expressed to me. I rise to share my frustration.\n  It is not just the frustration you may feel, as I have felt presiding \nover this body, when for hours at a time it is empty, when there is \nsuch precious and important work that we can and should be doing to get \nthe people of this great country back to work, to strengthen our \nnational security, to lay the groundwork for a strong recovery, to deal \nwith the hundreds of issues this body should be dealing with. I am \nexpressing my frustration at our inability to work together and to make \nreal progress.\n  Today, I have had the blessing of being visited by a number of \nDelawareans for lunch, for business visits, for just some constituent \ncatchup. As I do almost every day, I commuted down from Delaware this \nmorning. As I have heard from folks on the train, as I have heard from \nfolks in my office, as I have heard from folks who have written and \ncalled my offices in Delaware and in Washington, they are puzzled and \nthey are frustrated. They don't understand why we can't move forward.\n  To paraphrase the good Senator from Missouri who just spoke, there is \na no-brainer right in front of us, and it is the extension of the \npayroll tax cut. It is something that at least apparently has the \nsupport of both parties in both Houses. It is something a number of \neconomists have said is an important contributor to the modest but \nsteady economic growth that is helping pull America out of this \nterrible great recession.\n  So I ask: Why is it we sit here stalled, unclear on when we can \nproceed to a vote, to a consideration of a clean payroll tax cut? There \nhave been a whole series of efforts to get us to the floor for a vote \nto an extension of the payroll tax cut. This is a simple enough matter.\n  Working Americans all over this country--I believe 160 million of \nthem--will be hit with an increase in their payroll tax rate at the end \nof this month, just a few days now away, unless we act. My good friend \nSenator Casey of Pennsylvania has suggested several versions of a \npayroll tax cut that would build upon and strengthen the payroll tax \ncut that the President proposed and this body passed last year. The \nCasey compromise that has most recently been considered and debated in \nthis body would put up to $1,500 in the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans all over this country and would contribute as much as 1.5 \npercent to GDP growth in the coming year. But in the last 2 weeks, we \nhave seen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle four times \nblock our efforts through filibusters and dilatory tactics to attempt \nto get to a payroll tax cut extension. The first Republican version was \nopposed by 26 Senate Republicans; the second version opposed by 25.\n  So on some level I have to ask, what are we doing? Since when do \nRepublicans openly oppose tax cuts? I have been in this Senate just \nover 1 year. As you know, I was sworn in last November. In my freshman \nyear, I have seen many moments when we have been unable to reach \nreasonable compromise, when we have been unable to move forward, and \nwhen we have flirted with having to shut down the whole Federal \nGovernment because we couldn't reach an appropriate compromise with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Now we, once again, stand \nhere this Wednesday, knowing that unless we can act in partnership, we \nwill shut down this government on Friday without a continuing \nresolution.\n  Last night, the House acted. They passed this payroll tax cut \nextension and sent it over to us, and I am puzzled as to why we are not \nmoving to it on the floor today. I will tell you that when we get to \nmove to it, I will vote against it, and I know many others here will as \nwell. Why? Because H.R. 3630, which passed the House last night, is not \njust a clean extension of the payroll tax cut bill--in fact, far from \nit. It is loaded with a whole series of other policy riders, things \nthat have nothing to do with the payroll tax cut extension which House \nleadership had to do in order to garner enough votes to move it.\n  Today we should be considering this bill sent to us last night, the \nSpeaker asking us to take it up, and it has a whole series of \nprovisions which I suspect many here and at home don't know about. I \nwill briefly consider a few of them.\n  It undermines health care reform by punishing low- and middle-income \nfamilies whose economic circumstances changed during the year. It cuts \n40 weeks of unemployment benefits from the 99 weeks we would like to \nextend to 54 weeks. It overrides the President's decisionmaking process \non the Keystone XL Pipeline--in my view, simply to embarrass the \nPresident--and it amends the Clean Air Act to block EPA's proposed \nrules on toxic air pollution from industrial boilers.\n\n  It would also freeze Federal pay through 2013 and impose a triple \ncontribution, mandatory contribution to Federal retirement programs, \neffectively cutting Federal employee pay and taking more than $53 \nbillion out of the pockets of Federal workers.\n  To me, in some ways most alarmingly, it allows States to impose drug-\ntesting requirements on employees who have lost their jobs and are \nseeking unemployment.\n  In short, what came over to us from the House last night is the \nfurthest thing possible from a clean extension of the payroll tax cut. \nIt is a payroll tax cut with rider after rider sitting on the back of \nthis horse that has weighed it down so greatly, it can clearly hardly \nmove. It is a terrible bill, and in my view we should move to it, \ndispose of it, and get back to the business of the country.\n  Last, I am puzzled as to why we are not proceeding to it. My \nrecollection--and I don't have the joy of sitting here on the floor all \nthe time, but my recollection from what I read and heard is that the \nRepublican leader has twice called on us to move to this bill. I \nbelieve he did so twice earlier this week, saying we should put \npartisanship aside and promptly take up whatever is sent over to us \nfrom the House by way of a payroll tax cut extension. I think I quote \nwhen I say his comment was:\n\n       I think the first thing we need to find out is whether \n     there are the votes in the Senate to pass what the House has \n     passed. And so I'd rather not speculate about what happens \n     later. I'm hoping we are spending our time and energy trying \n     to get this bill passed in the Senate, as well as in the \n     House.\n\n  That is a perfectly reasonable attitude. We should proceed to this \nbill. We are here. We have the bill. We have been waiting almost \nliterally the entire day without making any progress. We need to extend \ntax cuts for payrolls. We need to extend tax cuts that incentivize \nclean energy investments. We need to extend tax cuts that can help \ninspire innovation, research, and development.\n  There is a whole list of tax cuts that will expire at the end of this \nyear without action. We need to pass the National Defense Authorization \nAct. We need to pass a continuing resolution to fund this government \nand the rest of this year's appropriations bills. There are so many \nimportant bills to which we must turn.\n  My sole question is, why, when we tried to proceed to this bill this \nmorning, did the Republican leader object?\n  I am just a freshman, but I represent a State that is deeply \nfrustrated and puzzled. Since when do Republicans load up a tax cut \nextension with so many riders that they are afraid to even bring it to \na vote on the floor of this Chamber? I am puzzled. I am frustrated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8578-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8578-S8579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to speak today in support \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of the largest shovel-ready \ninfrastructure projects in the United States. It would bring oil from \nNorth Dakota and from Canada to refineries along the gulf coast and in \nthe Midwest. The pipeline would strengthen America's energy security \nand create tens of thousands of new jobs. These are good-paying jobs. \nBut don't take my word for it, just consider what representatives of \norganized labor have had to say.\n  The president of the Building and Construction Trades Department of \nthe AFL-CIO said:\n\n       [A]ny discussion of the Keystone XL project begins and ends \n     with one word: JOBS.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Throughout America's Heartland, the Keystone Pipeline \n     represents the prospect for\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n     20,000 immediate jobs . . . without one single dollar of \n     government assistance.\n\n  The general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \nsaid:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline project will offer working men and \n     women a real chance to earn a good wage and support their \n     families in this difficult economic climate.\n\n  Consider the remarks of the general president of the Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America. He said:\n\n       This project . . . is not just a pipeline, but . . . a \n     lifeline for thousands of desperate working men and women.\n\n  House Democrats also recognize the importance of this Keystone XL \nPipeline. This summer, 47 House Democrats voted in favor of the bill to \nrequire a decision on the pipeline by November 1. On October 19, 22 \nHouse Democrats wrote a letter to the President. This is what they told \nPresident Obama:\n\n       America . . . cannot afford to say no to this privately \n     funded . . . jobs-creating infrastructure project.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       It is in our national interest to have a Presidential \n     Permit issued for the Keystone XL Pipeline as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  Senate Democrats also support the Keystone XL Pipeline. Senator \nBaucus of Montana said:\n\n       We need to put Montanans back to work and cannot afford \n     further delays to the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  Senator Tester, also from Montana, said:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline will create Montana jobs and it \n     should not have to wait 14 months for an up-or-down decision.\n\n  Senator Manchin of West Virginia said:\n\n       I'm for the Keystone Pipeline . . . all the trade unions, \n     everyone's for it. It creates thousands of jobs.\n\n  Senator Begich and Senator Landrieu have also written in support of \nthe pipeline.\n  Until recently, President Obama suggested that he too believed the \npipeline to be in the interests of the United States. On April 6, the \nPresident held a townhall event in Pennsylvania. There, he received a \nquestion about Canadian oil sands production. In response, the \nPresident of the United States discussed the Keystone XL Pipeline. This \nis what he said:\n\n       . . . importing oil from countries that are stable and \n     friendly is a good thing. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat. The President of the United States said:\n\n       . . . importing oil from countries that are stable and \n     friendly is a good thing. . . .\n\n  However, on November 10, the President reversed course, and he showed \na different side. After protests from environmentalists, the President \ndecided to punt his decision on the pipeline until after the 2012 \nPresidential election.\n  Many in the press say the President delayed his decision so that \nenvironmental activists would turn out on election day to support him. \nIf true, the President's decision to delay the approval of the pipeline \nwas not only political, it was also cynical--cynical because these \nenvironmental activists believe they can shut down Canadian oil sands \nproduction. They believe they can shut down the production by stopping \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. It simply is not true, and \nthe President knows it. But maybe the President does not want to be \nhonest with these environmental activists. Maybe he just doesn't want \nto disappoint them. He doesn't want his political base to stay home on \nelection day.\n  But don't take it from me; consider what Austan Goolsbee had to say. \nMany Members of this Chamber know he is the former Chairman of the \nWhite House Council of Economic Advisers, this White House Council--\nPresident Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. This is what he said:\n\n       It is a bit naive to think that the tar sands would not be \n     developed if they don't build that pipeline.\n       Eventually, it's going to be built. It may go to the \n     Pacific, it may go through Nebraska, but it is going to be \n     built somewhere.\n\n  Again, Mr. Goolsbee was President Obama's top economic adviser.\n  Why are the Canadian oil sands going to be developed? Because the oil \nsands are a huge national asset for Canada, and Canada will not allow \nthat asset to be stranded.\n  Let's consider the findings of the Canadian Research Institute. This \nis an independent, not-for-profit research entity that was established \nin 1975. Its mission is to provide relevant, independent, and objective \neconomic research on energy and environmental issues.\n  This June, they released a report. It was entitled ``Economic Impacts \nof Staged Development of Oil Sands Projects in Alberta from 2010 to \n2035''--a 25-year future look. This report looked at a variety of \nscenarios, including one in which no new pipeline capacity is built. \nUnder that scenario, the institute estimated that the total impact on \nCanada's GDP would be about $2.3 trillion over those 25 years. It also \nestimated that the compensation for Canadian employees will reach \nalmost $650 billion over this same period. It estimated that the \ndirect, indirect, and induced employment in Canada will grow from \n390,000 jobs to a peak of 490,000 jobs in 2020, just 9 years from now. \nIt also estimated that the royalties to Alberta will go from \napproximately $3.6 billion in 2010 to a peak of $22.6 billion in 2020--\nin 10 years, from $3.6 billion to $22.6 billion in royalties to \nAlberta.\n  Again, the Canadian Energy Research Institute made all of these \nestimates assuming that no additional pipeline capacity will be built. \nWhat do these estimates mean? They mean Canada will continue to develop \nits oil resources whether or not Keystone XL Pipeline or any other \npipeline is built. It means the environmental activists trying to shut \ndown oil sands production are naive at best.\n  It also means that the President, President Obama, is once again \nfailing to lead, that he once again is failing to be forthright with \nthe American people, and that he is unwilling and failing to make \ndifficult decisions. The President is showing that he thinks his job is \nreally the only job that matters.\n  Of course we all know Canada will not sit idly by. Canada will add \nadditional pipeline capacity whether or not Keystone XL Pipeline is \nbuilt.\n  Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, has said that the decision \nto delay approval of Keystone XL Pipeline demonstrates ``the necessity \nof making sure that we're able to access Asian markets for our energy \nproducts.'' That is what the Canadian Prime Minister had to say. He was \njust in Washington last week. Alberta's Premier, Alison Redford, said \nthat the decision to delay approval of the pipeline ``is a clear \nreminder about the strategic importance of diversifying our export \nmarkets.'' ``A clear reminder about the strategic importance of \ndiversifying our export markets.'' In other words, Canada has a \ntremendous amount of oil, and Canada will ensure that its oil is \nbrought to market. It may go to the United States, it may go to China, \nit may go to another country, but Canada's oil will be brought to \nmarket.\n  Thus, the question for President Obama is very simple, very \nstraightforward: Is it in America's interests to reduce our dependence \non oil from the Persian Gulf and from Venezuela? Is it in America's \ninterest to create tens of thousands of new jobs at a time of 8.6 \npercent unemployment? The answer is abundantly obvious. The answer, of \ncourse, is, yes, it is in America's best interests to reduce our \ndependence on oil from the Persian Gulf and Venezuela. It is in \nAmerica's interest to create tens of thousands of new jobs at a time of \n8.6 percent unemployment.\n  It is time that the President starts to say yes and stops saying no \nto jobs and to energy--yes to energy security, yes to tens of thousands \nof new good-paying jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are at a time in the calendar that \nusually is a time of excellent anticipation. Christmas is coming. The \nholidays are coming. People are trying to\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nget their families in order, do the shopping, and all the things we \nhave to do. It would seem this is a moment of fairly happy days and the \nholiday season is here. But these are not happy times for many \nAmericans.\n  Across our country, families are fighting to keep their heads above \nwater. Some parents do not know how they are going to put food on the \ntable tonight, much less presents under the Christmas tree or during \nthe Hanukkah holidays. That is why our side of the aisle is fighting to \ncontinue and expand a tax cut that has benefited millions of working \nfamilies this year. This is a tax cut for people who need it--families \nwho depend on a paycheck. With the payroll tax cut, the typical family \nin my State, the State of New Jersey, would receive an extra $40 a \nweek, starting next year. That is what a typical household in the \nNortheast pays for gasoline or health care each week.\n  Mr. President, $40 a week adds up to $2,100 a year. For parents who \nare struggling--as many are--to make ends meet, an extra $2,100 goes a \nlong way to help buy groceries or pay the electric bill or purchase \nmedicines. It can help pay for childcare, preschool or college \ntuition--the necessities that help ensure children succeed in life.\n  To make sure all working families continue receiving this much needed \nrelief next year, we are asking America's millionaires--people who earn \nover $1 million a year--to pay their fair share of what the country \nneeds to get ourselves back into reasonable balance. But the \nRepublicans will not even allow us to vote on a bill that their \ncolleagues in the House approved last night.\n  I wish to just spend a minute here. The House passed a bill last \nnight. It included tax relief for some and we should take it here and \nconsider it. But the Republicans will not even let us bring up the bill \nthat passed in the House last night, and there is a question as to why. \nWhy will they not let us do it? There is, obviously, a hidden meaning.\n  But what we see is, the Republicans are acting like Scrooges. This \npicture I have in the Chamber shows a mean-looking guy, as we see. That \nis what they want to do for Christmas.\n  For GOP Scrooges, this is not the season of giving; it is time to \ntake things away. He said: No payroll tax cut for you this year.\n  They want to take away the tax cut for ordinary working families. The \nRepublican Scrooges want to take away unemployment insurance benefits \nfor 1 million people--imagine, people who are dependent on unemployment \ninsurance at times when they are out of work, to help sustain their \nfamilies, put food on the table, to try and just keep their heads above \nwater. But that does not matter to our friends on the Republican side.\n  Today in America there is only one job available for every four \nunemployed people. This is not the time to cut unemployment benefits.\n  Republicans also want to weaken safeguards that keep our air clean--\nfilling our atmosphere with poisons and endangering the health of our \nchildren. They want to weaken those safeguards.\n  To add insult to injury, the Republicans are also trying to ram \nthrough a massive pipeline that will carry toxic materials into our \ncountry--toxic materials. We are so conscious of what damage the toxic \nenvironment can do to our families, to our children. But they want to \nhave a pipeline that will carry toxic materials into our country. They \nwant to make it easier for coal-fired industrial facilities to foul the \nair, spew toxins into our neighborhoods.\n  It is hard to believe. Instead of gifts, the Republican Scrooges want \nlumps of coal in the stockings and coal pollution in our lungs.\n  In many families, it is a tradition to teach children to welcome \nSanta Claus during the holidays. This year, we are going to tell our \nkids to hide away from the Republican Scrooges. We are not going to \nalarm our children and tell them things that are difficult may be even \nmore difficult if some tax relief that is proposed for working-class \nfamilies is not available to them.\n  The Republican priorities are different. They want to raise taxes on \nmiddle-class families--families who work for a living--to protect \nluxuries for millionaires: nice boats, airplanes. I do not mind--they \nhave made the money; it is what they buy with it--but at least carry \ntheir fair share of our financial needs in this country.\n  The Republican priorities say they are for lower taxes, but that only \ngoes for the jet set. When it comes to cutting taxes for working \nfamilies, the Republican mantra is: Hey, we have to take care of the \nwealthy. We have to watch out for the wealthy, make sure they are OK. \nDon't ask them to carry more of the load. It is not a good time to deal \nwith them. After all, maybe they will be big contributors to our \npolitical campaigns.\n  Let's not kid ourselves. American millionaires do not need help. They \ndo not need the Republicans' help. Since the 1980s, our country's \nwealthiest 1 percent of the working people have seen their average \nhousehold income increase by 55 percent. Let me restate that. Since the \n1980s, our country's wealthiest 1 percent have seen their average \nhousehold income increase by 55 percent--enormous--but for the bottom \n90 percent average household income has not increased at all. As a \nmatter of fact, it has gone down because the cost of living has gone up \nmuch faster than even any raises that come through.\n  Even though incomes are growing for the very wealthy, their tax rates \nare actually going down. Their taxes are going down. We can also look \nat the chief executive officers to see how well the wealthy are faring.\n  CEOs at the largest companies are now paid an average salary of $11 \nmillion a year. Note that. The largest companies' CEOs are now paid an \naverage salary of $11 million a year. That is 343 times as much as the \naverage worker's salary of $33,000 a year. This comparison is so hard \nto reconcile. The CEOs of the largest companies have an average salary \nof $11 million a year, and the average worker's salary is $33,000 a \nyear. Where is the equity in this? When we send the people out to \nfight, put on the country's uniforms, do the jobs, build the \nfoundations, make sure the country is strong--$33,000 a year. That is \ntough.\n\n  Just a few decades ago, the pay gap between CEOs and workers was much \nmore modest. The CEOs--again, the CEO, people at the top of these \ncompanies--were paid an average of 42 times as much as the average \nworker, as we see on this chart. The chart demonstrates that in the \n1980s, the CEOs made 42 times the average worker's pay. So the \ndifference was not that obvious or that big. In 2010, CEOs made 343 \ntimes the average worker's pay. There is no equity there.\n  I come from the corporate world, and I know what big salaries are. I \nhave seen it in my own company. But the one thing you have to do is at \nleast encourage the people who are working for you to understand that \nthey have a chance in life to provide the things we all talk about for \nour children--a college education, the prospect of a decent job, the \nprospect of being able to take care of our own family.\n  The numbers make it clear: Our goal should not be protecting \nmillionaires. They do not need our help. We should be focused on \nprotecting Medicare, food safety, home heating for the poor, and Head \nStart for little kids who have a first chance to learn--to learn--to \nunderstand education, to see how important it is to learn, to start \nreading books at an early age, to start having conversations with their \nparents about what is going on in this world.\n  They want to take those children out of the Head Start facility--so \nmany of them, 200,000; it has been proposed in some of the House \nbudgets--take them out of the Head Start school.\n  But our Republican colleagues do not want to hear about that. They \ncontinue asking the poor, the middle class, the elderly, and our \nchildren to bear the entire burden of these tough times.\n  The Republicans now remind me of what accountants are like. They are \npeople who are obsessed, obligated to deal with the bottom line. There \nis no soul, no humanity, no compassion--not around here--unless it is \nfor the wealthy. They have compassion for themselves.\n  Let's be clear: It does not hurt those of us who have been successful \nto pay our fair share. I remind those within my voice, who hear me, we \nhave two wars going on. We have people paying a terrible price to serve \nour country's needs--a terrible price. This is a time\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nfor those who are fortunate enough to make above $1 million to say: \nHey, I want to help carry this burden. I do not want to ask people who \nare scratching for a living--just trying to make ends meet--I do not \nwant to ask them to do more without saying I want to do my share.\n  I was lucky. I ran a very big company. I want to do my share. That is \nwhy I am here. That is what I am talking about. To those who make more \nthan $1 million a year, I say: Look in the mirror. Ask yourself if you \ncould succeed without help from anyone else or did your country help \nyou achieve your prosperity. Was it people who built the buildings and \nbuilt the infrastructure and manned the jobs all across the country--\nservice jobs? They built the foundation upon which those who make $1 \nmillion a year build their futures, build their fortunes. That is what \nhappens. But there is not the respect for the hard-working families \nthat we like to see.\n  I ask our Republican colleagues, think about the true meaning of the \nholidays.\n  It is not Halloween, it is not trick or treat, because otherwise that \nis what the game looks like. This time of the year is about coming \ntogether, caring about your fellow man. This should be a season of \ngiving, not taking away the necessities from our country's most \nvulnerable.\n  We all remember at the end of a ``Christmas Carol'' when Ebenezer \nScrooge opened his heart and became a hero. We need the same kind of \nmiracle here in Congress. We need the Republican scrooges to have a \nchange of heart and work with us to help our fellow Americans this \nholiday season. We need them to help us continue and expand the tax \ncuts for working families. We need them to help us continue \nunemployment insurance benefits for the jobless and clean air \nsafeguards for our children. We need them to help us protect the \nprograms that benefit the people who need them most, whom we need to \nkeep our foundation strong.\n  To our Republican colleagues, we say, come on, let's work together. \nLet's do this. Let's put the acrimony aside. Let's put the selfishness \naside and say, those who work every day for a living and try to keep \nthings together--and we have millions of people who are looking for \njobs who cannot find them right now--let's work together to make sure \nour children and grandchildren inherit an America that is even stronger \nthan the one we inherited. Show the heart of America. That will be the \nbest gift we can ever give them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are no more important issues for \nmiddle-class families across America than jobs and the economy. This is \nwhat they want their elected officials to be focused on. It is exactly \nwhat I think we ought to be working on every single day. That is why I \nhave come to the Senate floor again and again to urge my Republican \ncolleagues to stop blocking our attempts to extend and expand the \nmiddle-class tax cut so many of our families are counting on. That is \nwhy I come to the floor once again today to discuss the urgent need to \nmaintain Federal unemployment benefits for middle-class families across \nour country. This should be an easy issue.\n  Unemployment benefits provide a lifeline for millions of families, \nand it would be simply wrong to cut off this support while the economy \ncontinues to struggle and so many of our workers are having so much \ntrouble finding work. Right now, there are more than four unemployed \nworkers for every single job opening. If every opening were filled \ntomorrow, we would still have more than 10 million workers across the \ncountry without a job to even apply for.\n  Additionally, nearly half of all unemployed workers have been out of \na job for 6 months or longer, which is higher than we have seen for \nmore than 60 years.\n  So millions of Americans are unemployed today, not because they do \nnot want to work and not because they do not have valuable skills but \nsimply because they find themselves in an economy that is not creating \njobs as quickly as we need it to. Those unemployed workers are \ndesperate to get back on the job. Unemployment benefits make all the \ndifference for them and their families while they scour the want ads \nand pound the pavement and send out resume after resume after resume.\n  I recently sent a letter to my constituents asking for their stories \nabout what these benefits actually mean to them and their families. The \nresponse to that was unbelievable. Within a few days, I received \nhundreds of e-mails. People sent me videos. They sent me pictures of \ntheir families. I received story after story from workers and families \nfrom across my home State of Washington who are fighting to make ends \nmeet in this very tough economy and who cannot afford to have the rug \npulled out from underneath them.\n  One of those stories came from a woman named Vicki, who lives in \nMaple Valley, WA. She was an unemployed single mom, lost her apartment, \nand told me she now has to share a room with her son in a relative's \nhome. Vicki told me she has made every effort--going to interviews, \nsending out her resumes to hundreds of employers, still not able to \nfind a job.\n  She understands that in this economy finding a job will not be easy, \nbut she is going to keep trying, and the support she receives from \nunemployment benefits has kept her and her family afloat and made all \nof the difference. She said those benefits allowed her to put food on \nthe table for her family and gas in her car so she could go to job \ninterviews. She told me, ``If I lose my unemployment benefits, I do not \nknow what I will be able to do to provide for my son.''\n  She is not alone. I heard from older Americans such as Judy. She is a \ngrandmother of five from Bothell, WA. Judy told me she had been working \nfor 47 years before being laid off from her teaching job in 2009. She \nsaid over the last 12 years she has worked to teach adults the skills \nthey need to move into jobs as bookkeepers and receptionists and \nschedulers. But in this economy, although she was an expert in her \narea, even she cannot find a job in those fields.\n  She wrote to me, saying:\n\n       I want to work, but nobody will hire older citizens no \n     matter how much experience they have. I started looking for a \n     job at the pay level I was at when I was laid off. But after \n     being unemployed now for 2 years, I am even looking at jobs \n     for less than half of that. Still I am told my experience \n     does not match their requirements.\n\n  For Judy, unemployment benefits are not the solution. She wants a \njob. But they provide her with some critical support while she looks \nfor that last job before she can retire.\n  I also heard from Sheila from Bellevue, WA. Like Judy, she is close \nto retirement, but she was laid off last year from an engineering \ntechnician job that she told me she loved and now she is desperate to \nget back to work. After sending out over 500 resumes since then, she \nhas had 4 interviews. In her e-mail to me, Sheila wrote:\n\n       I was devastated when I was laid off. I now look for work 7 \n     days a week. I have worked hard my entire life. I do not want \n     everything I have worked for to disappear.\n\n  She told me that is what would happen if her unemployment benefits \nrun out now.\n  Finally, I received a video message from Scott in Olalla, WA. Scott \ntold me that after working at the same company for 20 years, he was \nlaid off in March and filed his first unemployment claim in the 30-plus \nyears he has been in the workforce. He said he always thought \nunemployment insurance was for the other people, never thought he would \nbe the one collecting it. Now he calls it a godsend for him and his \nfamily. In his video, Scott told me about the uncertainty his family \nwould face if his benefits expired before he could get back on the job. \nIf this happens, Scott said:\n\n       I cannot imagine what it would do to my family to lose our \n     home. We spend our money wisely. We live well within our \n     means. But if we lost our home, we would be just another \n     statistic. The last thing I want to do is to explain to my \n     wife and my daughter that we have to leave our home.\n\n  That is exactly what he said would happen if he loses his \nunemployment benefits in this tough economy.\n  Those are just a few of the many stories I have received. There are \nso many of them out there. Millions of the people across America, \nincluding about 100,000 in my home State of Washington, will stand to \nlose their benefits\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\nthat they count on if Congress does not act by the end of this year, in \na few short weeks. These workers are not looking for a handout. They do \nnot want to be a burden, but they need support while they get back on \ntheir feet and back on the job.\n  In this struggling economy, maintaining these unemployment benefits \nis critical. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said \nmaintaining unemployment benefits is one of the most effective policy \ntools we have now to boost the economy and get money into the pocket of \nour consumers. If they are cut off, it would not just be devastating \nfor the families who count on this support, it is going to hurt our \nsmall businesses and communities to have billions of dollars pulled \naway from consumers who spend it every month on food and rent and \nclothing. We cannot afford to have this lifeline cut off. Our great \ncountry has always been a place that stands with our middle-class \nfamilies when times are tough and gives them the support they need to \nget back on their feet and back on the job and contributing to their \ncommunities once again.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to stand with us as the holidays \napproach, to maintain these unemployment insurance benefits that so \nmany of our families are counting on, and to keep working to cut taxes \nfor the middle class and get our economy moving again and put our \ncountry back to work.\n  On that last point, before I finish, I want to join our majority \nleader and so many others who today called on Republicans to stop \nblocking their own bill and allow it to be brought up for an up-or-down \nvote. We know the Republican bill that passed the House yesterday is \ngoing to fail. It is bad policy, and many in their own caucus \napparently do not support it. Their bill takes some of the policies we \nare fighting for to support the middle class, including unemployment \nbenefits, waters them down, and then adds a whole bunch of tea party \nred meat to attract the Republican support it needed to pass the House.\n  I am focused on delivering the tax cuts that middle-class families \nneed and deserve, so I will vote against the Republican bill if it is \nallowed to come up. But I cannot believe that our Republican colleagues \nare now preventing us from taking a vote on their own bill and then not \nallowing us to come together, which we need to do in these last few \ndays before the holidays, to get a bipartisan deal and get it to the \nAmerican people. They expect us to do this job. That is what is holding \nus up.\n  I urge our colleagues to sit down, work out an agreement, so that we \ncan all celebrate the holidays with our families, and the families out \nthere who are counting on us will know we have done the job for them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8582-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8582-S8584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I think there are a few things that many \npeople across the country, and, hopefully, in the Congress, agree upon. \nOne is that we need to focus like a laser on creating jobs. That is \nsomething I think there is universal agreement on here.\n  I also think there is universal agreement that we ought to become \nmore energy independent as a nation. We need to look for ways in which \nour country can lessen that dangerous dependence we have on foreign \nsources of energy. We import a good amount of our oil from other places \naround the world--some of them not so friendly regimes. That is why it \nis such a mystery as to why the Keystone XL Pipeline project is running \ninto such resistance from the administration.\n  It is ironic in many respects because we had the President of the \nUnited States, several months ago, saying:\n\n       We are going to have to import some oil; and when it comes \n     to the oil we import from other nations, obviously, we've got \n     to look at neighbors like Canada and Mexico that are stable, \n     steady, and reliable sources.\n\n  That is what the President said earlier this year, that if we are \ngoing to get energy, if we are going to import oil, we ought to import \nit from countries that are friendly to the United States. I argue there \nis no country more friendly to the United States than Canada, with whom \nwe have a very robust trading relationship. We do about $640 billion of \nbilateral trade annually with our Canadian neighbors. So thinking that \nwe might be able to get oil from Canada, as opposed to from Venezuela \nor somewhere in the Middle East, seems like a good option for this \ncountry--a good option that policymakers here ought to be very \nsupportive of.\n  That, again, makes it an even greater mystery as to why the \nadministration has insisted on blocking or even making a decision about \nwhether we can develop a project called the Keystone XL Pipeline, which \nwould take advantage of those oil resources available in Canada and \nbring them into the United States, transport them through a pipeline \nthat is 1,700 miles long to refineries where that product can be \nrefined, and people here could benefit from it or it could be sold \nperhaps somewhere else. Nevertheless, it would benefit the economy.\n  Both in the initial stages when the project is under construction, as \nwell as later on, it will create lots of jobs. In my State of South \nDakota--the pipeline would come through South Dakota as it makes its \nway down to the refineries, and we would benefit from hundreds of jobs \nthat would be created and $\\1/2\\ billion in economic activity will be \ncreated alone in South Dakota. That is during the construction phase, \nnot to mention all the State and local tax revenue that would benefit \nmany of the local governments across my State and other States through \nwhich the pipeline would traverse.\n  It is increasingly a mystery--I don't know how else to describe it--a \ncuriosity or something--to those of us who see the great benefit in \ngetting our oil resources from a friendly country like Canada as to why \nthis administration would be so opposed even to issuing a decision on \npermitting this pipeline project that would enable that oil to come \nfrom Canada through to refineries in this country.\n  The other issue on which there is universal agreement is that we \nought to put policies in place that create jobs. There is no greater \nshovel-ready project than the Keystone XL Pipeline. It would have an \nimmediate impact of 20,000 jobs that will be created immediately--a $7 \nbillion initial investment and billions more over the years as this \nproject continues to be utilized. Furthermore, I argue that it will \ncreate other opportunities for energy project development. Certainly, \nthe Bakken oil find in North Dakota would stand to benefit from having \na pipeline this accessible to it. It creates all kinds of spinoffs and \nother types of economic activity that would be good for jobs.\n  We will have something that lessens our dependence upon foreign \nsources of energy by about 700,000 barrels of oil a day, creates \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, and enhances the ability of State and \nlocal governments to collect revenues, which they desperately need for \ntheir own purposes and needs. Yet here we are looking at this project--\nor at least a decision on it--being blocked by this administration for \nno apparent reason other than politics, I argue.\n  We are heading into a political year, and the President is running \nfor reelection next year. I think it is clear that the delay on a \ndecision on this project for 18 months was clearly designed to get past \nthe Presidential election so the President would not have to make a \ndecision that splits his political base. We have the labor groups that \nare for it and the environmental groups that are opposed to it. I guess \nit must be a political decision for this administration to delay this \nproject. It doesn't make sense for America and American workers.\n  The President says he gets up every day and he thinks about what he \ncan do to create jobs. Well, here are 20,000 immediate jobs that we can \nbenefit from right away--not to mention the many jobs that would come \nif this project was built.\n  As we look at the legislation sent to us from the House of \nRepresentatives, it includes this Keystone XL Pipeline language that \nwould allow a decision\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nto be made 60 days from its enactment. So we could accelerate at least \nthe period in which this decision could be made.\n  Why is that important? Because this project is going to go on one way \nor the other. If it is not built in this country, it will be shipped \nsomewhere else around the world--perhaps China or another country--and \nthe American workers and the American economy will suffer, and the \nAmerican need that we have for energy will not be met. We are not going \nto benefit or be advantaged by not having this project here or if it \ngoes someplace else. That makes absolutely no sense for our economy, no \nsense for jobs and for many States that are in support of this project.\n  I hope as this debate gets underway on the proposal sent from the \nHouse of Representatives, the sticking point, the thing that hangs it \nup is not the Keystone XL Pipeline. People will probably have honest \ndisagreements about various provisions in the legislation being sent to \nus from the House, but one thing that should not delay or in any way \ndetour this from being considered in the Senate is resistance or \nobjections to a final decision being made on the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  I want to read a few things for you that have been said by some of \nthe folks across this country who think this is a good idea. Many \nrepresent working people--the labor unions. The Teamsters said:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline project will offer working men and \n     women a real chance to earn a good wage and support their \n     families in this difficult economic climate.\n\n  The AFL-CIO said:\n\n       For America's skilled craft construction professionals, any \n     discussion of the Keystone XL project begins and ends with \n     one word: Jobs.\n\n  Look at what has been said by the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers:\n\n       At a time when jobs are the top global priority, the \n     Keystone project will put thousands back to work and have \n     ripple benefits throughout the North American economy. Our \n     members look forward to being part of this historic project \n     and pledge to deliver the highest quality work to make it a \n     success.\n\n  That is what some of the labor leaders are saying. I want to read \nwhat some key Democrats in Congress have said about this. These are a \nfew excerpts from Democratic Members of Congress:\n\n       America truly cannot afford to say ``no'' to this privately \n     funded, $20 billion jobs-creating infrastructure project, \n     which could bolster our economic, energy, and national \n     security. To that end, we respectfully urge you to ensure \n     that the Presidential permit is issued for Keystone XL.\n\n  Here is another quote:\n\n       Mr. President, America needs the Keystone XL pipeline. It \n     is in our national interest to have a permit issued for \n     Keystone XL as soon as possible.\n\n  The Department of State's final environmental impact statement \nreaffirmed the findings of the two previous environmental impact \nstatements; namely, that the pipeline will have no significant impact \non the environment.\n  So we have a project that has been OK'ed by the environmental \nagencies in this country, the people who look at the environmental \nimpacts, who have said this project is ready to go. We have labor \norganizations that are waiting and are saying this is important to \ngetting people back to work. We have Democrats in Congress who have \nsaid this is a project that we should be for. In fact, there was a vote \non this language in a freestanding bill in the House recently. There \nwere 47 Democrats who came out in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline \nlegislation. So we have 47 Democrats on record.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have some sympathy for the position I \nhear the Senator enunciating--that the issue of the pipeline ought not \nto be the thing that prevents us from moving forward. I personally \nthink the pipeline is absolutely in the national interest. It will help \nus reduce our dependence on foreign energy--at least foreign sources \nthat are hostile to our interests.\n  The big question is--at least for this Senator--would the language \npermit a rerouting of the line within the State of Nebraska so that the \nquestion of the Ogallala aquifer would not be addressed? Is it the \nSenator's understanding that the language that has come to us from the \nHouse would permit Nebraska to reroute the line to avoid the aquifer?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, through the Chair, I would say to my \ncolleague from North Dakota that my understanding is the legislation \ndoes permit that to happen, and that is why I believe the State of \nNebraska, including the Governor and our colleagues here in the Senate \nfrom Nebraska, have now come out in support of this. Whereas previously \nthere had been some concern about the Ogallala aquifer, my \nunderstanding is the legislation allows for that issue to be addressed. \nAnd I have a statement here from the Governor of Nebraska expressing \nhis support for this legislation. So it does strike me that at least \nthat should not be an issue that in any way deters consideration of \nthis pipeline and that we shouldn't have to wait 18 months.\n  I am saying to my colleague from North Dakota--and I think he \nrecognizes the value of this, as he is from North Dakota, and obviously \nhis is a State that could be favorably impacted by the economic \nactivity resulting from this pipeline--that if we don't do this, \nsomebody else is going to benefit from it. This is not going to wait \naround. There are vast oil sands reserves up in Canada, and they are \nlooking for a place where they can get this to a refinery and get it \nrefined. If the United States doesn't move forward, some other country \nis going to benefit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could just say to my colleague, Canada is going to \ndevelop this resource. This oil is going to go somewhere. It is \nabsolutely in our national interest for that oil to come to our \ncountry. If the language is, as the Senator represents, that it permits \nthe rerouting of the line within Nebraska to avoid the issue with the \nOgallala aquifer, then I, for one, on this side, would hope this could \nbe part of the final package.\n  I hope this is something we can work through in the coming hours. \nThis should not be the thing that prevents us from reaching across the \naisle, reaching across the divide between the two Chambers and \nachieving a result that is critically important for the country.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask this question.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the question and comments of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I couldn't agree more with the sentiments he expressed.\n  I do believe we have in front of us something for which there is a \nlot of bipartisan support--an extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits, with some reforms, a payroll tax cut extension, a fix for the \nphysician reimbursements under Medicare, and a number of other things \nthat have been put into this with an eye toward not only addressing \nwhat are some very serious concerns--many of these things expire at the \nend of the year--but also something that would really create jobs, that \nhas a jobs component to it that would do something positive for our \neconomy.\n  I hope that we can find a way to come together and that this does not \nbecome a deterrent to the legislation that is going to be before us in \nthe not too distant future--the proposal that came to us from the House \nof Representatives. I certainly hope that doesn't unravel as a result \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline language being included because I \nrecognize--as the Senator from North Dakota has expressed, and many of \nhis colleagues on his side, along with many of my colleagues on our \nside--the value of what this could do for jobs, what this could do for \nour economy, and what this could do for America's energy needs. This \nwill enable us to do business with a friendly partner to the north--\nCanada--as opposed to continuing to import oil from other countries \naround the world with which we do not have that kind of a friendly and \nstable relationship.\n  I would hope the President would make a decision not to get in the \nway or assert pressure on Members on his side to vote against this \nsimply because it includes this particular provision. It is good for \nAmerica, it is good for the States that are impacted, and many of the \nlocal governments would benefit. It is certainly good for jobs and the \neconomy, as has been voiced by the various labor unions across this \ncountry that represent working Americans. With 700,000 barrels of oil \ncoming to America from Canada, we would be creating economic activity \nand jobs versus 700,000 barrels of oil going someplace else around the \nworld and some\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nother country benefitting and our becoming even more dependent on \nforeign sources of energy.\n  So, Madam President, again, I don't know what to say. This is a no-\nbrainer, and so I hope the Senate will find its way before we adjourn \nfor the Christmas holiday to enact this legislation that has been put \nforward that would enable this project to be decided. It doesn't \nprescribe one way or the other what the President does; it just says \nthe President either has to approve it or give a reason why it is not \nin the national interest.\n  I see the other Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, is here as \nwell. He has been a leader and involved in getting this legislation \nintroduced. I thank both my colleagues for recognizing its importance, \nand I hope we can move legislation that will get this project decided \none way or the other. In my view, an affirmative decision would be \npreferable and would allow us to move forward.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8584-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8584-S8585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC POLICY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor to discuss \nthe question of extending the payroll tax cut, dealing with \nunemployment insurance, dealing with compensation for doctors who treat \nMedicare patients, and also addressing the question of the alternative \nminimum tax and, of course, the other tax extenders as well.\n  This is a key moment for the country. As I expressed earlier--as \nSenator Thune was addressing the body--I personally do not believe the \nKeystone Pipeline should hold us back. This is something upon which I \nthink we could get broad agreement, especially if the language is as \nthe Senator has represented and as Senator Hoeven has assured me--that \nit permits the State of Nebraska to reroute that line so that the \nOgallala aquifer is not in danger. In my judgment, it is entirely in \nthe national interest to get the Keystone Pipeline advanced. So that \nshould not be the issue that hangs us up.\n  As we look at things that are holding back the economy, unemployment \nremains far too high, the housing crisis continues, and we have weak \nconsumer confidence and demand. That really is at the heart of our \nongoing economic weakness. Personal debt is still near record levels. \nWe have tightened borrowing standards for businesses and consumers. I \nhear very often that even good businesses with good track records at \npaying back loans can't secure the credit they need to expand. And we \nhave State and local budget cutbacks that are continuing.\n  As we look at the private sector jobs picture, there is some good \nnews because we have now had many months of expansion of private sector \npayrolls. In fact, if we go back to 2010, in March of the year, ever \nsince then we have seen private sector payrolls increasing to the tune \nof millions of jobs. So there is progress being made.\n  When we look at the reason there has been progress, I believe two of \nthe most distinguished economists in the country gave us a background \nto understand why we are seeing this progress after one of the greatest \nfinancial debacles in our country's history. Alan Blinder, the former \nDeputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark Zandi, who was an \neconomic adviser to the McCain campaign, did an analysis of the Federal \nGovernment's response to the financial crisis and the recession. Here \nis what they found, and they are speaking of TARP and the stimulus:\n\n       We find that its effects on real GDP, jobs, and inflation \n     are huge, and probably averted what could have been called \n     Great Depression 2.0. When all is said and done, the \n     financial and fiscal policies will have cost taxpayers a \n     substantial sum, but not nearly as much as most had feared, \n     and not nearly as much as if policymakers had not acted at \n     all. If the comprehensive policy responses saved the economy \n     from another depression, as we estimate, they were well worth \n     their cost.\n\n  Madam President, we have a debate going on in this country about \neconomic policy, and our friends on the other side believe that they \nhave the answer, that they have the prescription. I would just remind \nthose who might be listening that it was their policy and their \nprescription that led this country to the brink of economic collapse. \nThey controlled the economic policy of this country for 8 years, and \nthey put in place a series of policies that they said would \ndramatically expand job opportunities in this country and strengthen \nthe economy. But we know what happened.\n  At the end of 2008, I was in the meeting here in the Capitol with the \nBush administration's Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. They told us they were taking over AIG, the big \ninsurance company, the next morning, and they told us that if they did \nnot, they believed there would be a financial collapse within days. \nGoing back to the same tired, failed economic policies that put us in \nthat position is a mistake--a profound mistake. Hopefully we would \nlearn from history.\n  I believe what is needed now is for America to take steps to \nstrengthen the economy in the short term but to combine that with \nfiscal discipline over the mid and longer term so that we can get back \non track and face up to this debt threat.\n  Two of the more distinguished economists in the country, in addition \nto the two I have already cited, have just concluded work for the \nPeterson Institute for International Economics. These are the \nReinharts--Dr. Carmen Reinhart and Dr. Vincent Reinhart--and this is \nwhat they concluded following severe financial crises. They found that \neconomic recoveries are shallower and take much longer. Here is what \nthey said in their analysis:\n\n       Real per capita GDP growth rates are significantly lower \n     during the decade following severe financial crises. In the \n     10-year window following severe financial crises, \n     unemployment rates are significantly higher than in the \n     decade that preceded the crisis. The decade of relative \n     prosperity prior to the fall was importantly fueled by an \n     expansion in credit and rising leverage that spans about 10 \n     years; it is followed by a lengthy period of retrenchment \n     that most often only begins after the crisis and lasts almost \n     as long as the credit surge.\n\n  What they are reporting to us, after looking at a long period of \neconomic history and dozens of countries, is that after a financial \ncrisis, recovery takes much longer than is typical from a standard \nrecession.\n  We now have a bill that was sent over from the House that I believe \nhas serious defects. I believe that bill is a nonstarter.\n  First of all, the House leaders included extraneous provisions making \nit a partisan bill. President Obama has said he will veto it. Even the \nSenate GOP won't vote on it. So we have the curious circumstance where \nwe have a bill sent to us by the House of Representatives, controlled \nby the Republican Party, and the Republican Party in the Senate won't \npermit a vote on the Republican bill. One might ask, why would that be? \nPerhaps the reason is they know there aren't many votes for it in this \nChamber, just as there weren't many votes for it when it was previously \noffered on this side.\n  So more than just extending the payroll tax cut is at stake. We also \nneed to extend unemployment insurance, and we need to fix the cut that \nis about to happen to doctors who treat Medicare patients. That is the \nso-called doc fix. We need a compromise, not just partisanship, from \nboth sides. Both sides need to find a way to come together.\n  I have tried to indicate on this side a willingness to cross the \npartisan divide with respect to the Keystone Pipeline. Some on the \nother side have said that is important for their support for this \nlegislation. I have said--at least speaking for me--that I am prepared \nto support the Keystone Pipeline because I do believe it is in the \nnational interest.\n  As we look at the effect of allowing the expiring payroll tax cut to \ndie, this is what Goldman Sachs said to us:\n\n       Should [the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment \n     benefits] expire at the end of the year, fiscal drag will be \n     intense in 2012.\n\n  In other words, because there will be a reduction in demand in the \neconomy, we will see lower economic growth, we will see lower job \ncreation, we will even see a risk of returning to recession. This is \nfrom Goldman Sachs, the U.S. Economic Analyst, ``What Turns a Stall \nInto a Slump?'' They are telling us one way to turn a stall into a \nslump is to fail to extend the payroll tax cuts and to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits to those who have been out of work for \nextended periods of time.\n  That is not just the view of Goldman Sachs. I wrote a letter to the \nCongressional Budget Office--that is nonpartisan--and I asked them \nwhich of\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\nthe policy initiatives we could take would give us the biggest bang for \nthe buck. What they told us is No. 1 would be extension of unemployment \ninsurance. Why? Because the people who receive those benefits are most \nlikely to spend the money. That means there would be increased demand \nin the economy, and that would give additional lift.\n  Let me be swift to add: For those who are concerned about deficit and \ndebt, I am with you, absolutely, because our long-term threat is this \ngrowing debt. But CBO has told us in testimony before the Budget \nCommittee there is no contradiction between taking steps in the short \nterm to give lift to the economy and taking steps in the medium term \nand the longer term to rein in deficits and debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues.\n  This is what JPMorgan Chase has said on expiring payroll tax cut and \nemergency unemployment benefits:\n\n       For 2012, the more important issue is what happens to \n     expiring stimulus measures. . . . Together, [the payroll tax \n     cut and the emergency unemployment benefits] have lifted \n     household disposable income by about $150 billion this year. \n     If they expire as scheduled, consumption growth early next \n     year would be challenged. . . . In our baseline view, the \n     drag from tightening fiscal policy [including expiration of \n     the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits] \n     could subtract 1.5%-2.0% from GDP growth next year.\n\n  Since GDP growth is only forecast at 2.5 to 3 percent, a reduction of \n1.5 to 2 percent would be a dramatic reduction.\n  This is what Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, \nsaid:\n\n       If policymakers do nothing here, if Congress and the \n     administration just sit on their hands and they do nothing, \n     the odds are very high we'll go into recession early next \n     year. . . . We have a payroll tax holiday, all of us. . . . \n     We'd be in recession right now without it. . . . If they \n     don't [extend] that, at the very minimum, we'll likely go \n     into recession.\n\n  I hope very much that colleagues are listening. I hope very much that \nwe are able to proceed to address this matter of extending the payroll \ntax cut and of extending unemployment insurance.\n  I think I want to end as I began. If we had not had the government \nresponse in TARP and stimulus, Zandi and Blinder--two of the top \neconomists in this country, one who was an adviser to the McCain \ncampaign, one who was the Deputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve--have \nsaid we would be in a depression today. We would be in a depression \ntoday, with 16-percent unemployment and 8 million fewer people having \njobs. We ought to pay close attention to that advice. We ought to act \non it, and we ought to do it together. We ought to find a way for \nprincipled compromise on both sides.\n  This body is bigger and better than we are demonstrating at this \nhour. We have the chance to prove to the American people that we are \nworthy of their confidence and that we are able to respond and do the \nurgent business of the Nation. I hope we don't disappoint them.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for the courtesy of the \nadditional time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8585-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8585-S8587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to begin by thanking my esteemed colleague from \nthe great State of North Dakota. I appreciate very much his support for \nthis important project as he has again expressed. This is something we \nworked on for a great length of time. It is something we have quite a \nbit of background and experience with, energy production and the \ninfrastructure needs that go with it. Again, I express my appreciation \nto Senator Conrad for his support of the project, and also for \nexpressing, and I think doing so in very eloquent terms and in terms \nthat are very much appreciated, that he feels this is something that \nneeds to advance; that he feels as we work forward in terms of \ndetermining how to handle the payroll tax cut holiday issue, this is \nsomething that can be helpful and constructive.\n  I am here to speak in support of the Keystone project. You might say, \nWhy? Why is it important that we move forward with this project? Well, \nfirst and foremost, because it is a tremendous job creator, but also \nbecause it reduces our dependence on foreign sources of oil as well as \nimproving environmental stewardship. I want to take a minute to talk \nabout all three aspects of the legislation.\n  Together with my colleagues, I put forward the North American Energy \nSecurity Act of 2011. Essentially, that legislation clears the path to \nmove forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  For those who may not be familiar with the Keystone XL Pipeline, I \nbrought this chart that actually shows the route it travels. It is a \n1,700-mile-long pipeline which runs from Alberta, Canada, down to our \nrefineries in the gulf coast region. As you can see, it is this blue \nline laid out on the chart. Right next to it we have this red line. \nThis is the Keystone Pipeline. I will take a minute to talk about that, \nbecause I think it is important in the context of what we are trying to \ndo with Keystone XL.\n\n  Prior to being elected to the Senate, I served the State of North \nDakota for 10 years as Governor. During that time, we worked with many \ncompanies to develop pipeline infrastructure in North Dakota as we \nproduced more and more oil for this Nation, but we also worked with our \nneighbors from the North who provide oil to our country as well, in \nfact 2.2 million barrels a day, to move that product safely into our \ncountry.\n  The Keystone Pipeline, built by TransCanada, as you can see, tracks \nfrom Alberta, Canada, all the way down to Patoka, IL. So it is similar \nin that it brings Canadian crude into our refineries here in the United \nStates, which is refined and reduces our dependence on other sources of \noil. About 590,000 barrels a day flow through the Keystone Pipeline \nright now. So when we talk about the Keystone XL project, we are not \ntalking about something which hasn't been done before. In fact, we just \ngot done permitting this pipeline, which is almost identical, bringing \noil from roughly the same place in Canada down to refineries into the \nUnited States. That has already been approved by EPA and the Department \nof State. It went through the requisite NEPA and study processes, it \nwent through the proper processes with the Department of State, and it \nhas been approved, 590,000 barrels a day coming into our country to \nreduce our dependence on oil from places such as the Middle East and \nVenezuela right now. So when we talk about Keystone XL, we are not \ntalking about doing anything we haven't already done.\n  This pipeline--which would run a little bit to the west--again \nroughly starts up about the same place, Alberta, Canada, comes down \nfurther than the existing Keystone Pipeline down to our refineries. It \nis important to know that this isn't just about moving crude oil from \nCanada to the United States. This is also about moving oil within the \nUnited States.\n  In this part of our country, in North Dakota and in Montana, we are \nproducing a tremendous amount of oil. My home State of North Dakota \ntoday is closing in on oil production of 500,000 barrels of oil a day. \nWe will put 100,000 barrels a day of crude oil, such as sweet crude, \ninto this pipeline as well. So it is not just about moving Canadian oil \nin America, it is about moving oil within our country, production from \nthe Bakken region in the Williston Basin, down to our refineries.\n  Also, you will notice that the pipeline comes down to Cushing, OK. \nRight now we have a backlog of oil in Cushing, OK, and this pipeline \nwill move oil from Cushing down to the refineries in Texas and \nLouisiana. So it helps solve bottleneck issues, moving oil in our \ncountry, which will help reduce prices to consumers as you eliminate \nsome of these bottlenecks and price disparities.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n  Again I go back to the point of my being here today, talking about \nthis legislation, which is solutions-oriented legislation, problem-\nsolving legislation. What it does is it creates jobs, it reduces our \ndependence on Middle East oil, and again it provides better \nenvironmental stewardship. So when I say it is solutions oriented, what \ndo I mean by that? The issue, as I think most people who follow this \nissue will recall, the concern or the problem was in the Sandhills \nregion of western Nebraska. Concern had been expressed about going \nthrough the Sandhills of Nebraska. That is an area where we have the \nOgallala aquifer, and there was concern there that there might be an \nissue should there be any kind of breach in the pipeline. So that was \nthe issue.\n  However, the State of Nebraska recently had a special session. In \nthat special session, they said, Hey, we will work to reroute the \nproject to eastern Nebraska, similar to the pipeline that already \nexists. That eliminates the problem. Now we don't have an issue anymore \nin the Sandhills area of Nebraska.\n  The legislation we have written and that has now been incorporated \ninto the House bill takes that very solution and incorporates it into \nthe legislation. It says the Nebraska Department of Environmental \nQuality can work with EPA and the State Department to reroute the \nproject in Nebraska so there is no longer an issue. We solve the \nproblem. It is problem-solving legislation.\n  We say as to the entire project that the administration, with State, \nthe EPA, and so forth, has to make a decision on whether to approve the \nproject within 60 days. Is it in our national interest? They have to \nmake that decision within 60 days so the project can get started and we \ncan start creating those construction jobs. But as to Nebraska, they \nare not bound by the 60 days. They have the time they need to \nincorporate the solution from the State's special session.\n  All we are saying is this project has been studied for 3 years. It \nhas been studied for 3 years already. It has gone through the NEPA \nprocess. It has gone through the full EIS. State was ready to make a \ndecision. It got held up because of Nebraska, and we specifically \naddressed that problem. Now it is time to go forward. That is why this \nis problem-solving legislation.\n  Again, this is about creating jobs. This is about reducing our \ndependence on Middle East oil. We absolutely address the issue of \nNebraska. We do not set a 60-day time limit on it. As to the rest of \nthe project, we can get started.\n  Let's talk about who supports the project. The Prime Minister of \nCanada, Stephen Harper, has talked to our President and said, look, our \ngreatest ally is Canada. Canada says, this is a very important project \nfor Canada. This is about producing our energy resources in Canada. \nThis is about jobs and economic opportunity in Canada.\n  Let's join with our best ally and together create jobs and produce \nenergy we can count on.\n  The issue has been brought up about environmental stewardship. For \nthose who say we have some concerns about producing oil in the oil \nsands region of Canada, I submit Canada is doing what we are doing. \nNorth Dakota all the time is improving their technology in order to \nimprove their environmental stewardship. For example, going to in situ \nmining rather than for excavation for things such as producing the oil \nsands.\n  The point we have to understand that is very important is, if the \npipeline doesn't go this way, if the pipeline doesn't go south, it is \ngoing to go west. If this product does not come to the United States, \nthis 700,000 barrels, it is going to the west coast of Canada, where it \nwill be loaded on ships and it will go to China.\n  We have a choice to make. Do we want to reduce our dependence on oil \nfrom the Middle East and from Venezuela and other parts of the world \nwhere we have real security issues? Do we want to increase the \nrelationship and the economic ties with our best ally in the world or \ndo we want 700,000 barrels a day of Canadian oil going to China \ninstead?\n  By the way, let's talk about the environmental stewardship. That \nmeans we have to haul it over there on oil tankers. We have to continue \nto bring our product in on oil tankers, so we have higher emissions \ninstead of lower emissions. Instead of that oil being refined in the \ncleanest refineries in the world, which we have, it is going to be \nrefined in refineries in China, which have much higher emissions.\n  Again, the whole focus of the legislation--I authored the bill. The \nwhole focus in writing this bill was to say: How do we solve the \nproblem? How do we deal with the concerns? How do we make sure we are \nbeing fair to people but that we move forward with real job creation, \nwith producing more energy to increase our energy independence with our \ngood friend and neighbor, our strongest ally--Canada? How do we \ncontinue to do more in terms of private investment, deploying \ntechnologies, creating better environmental stewardship? It is about \nproblem-solving legislation.\n  We can see we have not only the U.S. Chamber of Commerce now \nsupporting this legislation, because they want to see job creation, but \nwe have all the large building and trade unions supporting it as well--\nAFL-CIO, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers, Labors International Union of North \nAmerica, United Association, International Union of Operating \nEngineers.\n  It is America's workers who are clamoring for the expedited approval \nof this important project. We can't wait.\n  Mark Ayers, president, Building & Construction Trades Department, \nAFL-CIO:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline project will offer working men and \n     women a real chance to earn a good wage and support their \n     families in this difficult economic climate.\n\n  James P. Hoffa, International Brotherhood of Teamsters:\n\n       At a time when jobs are the top global priority, the \n     Keystone Project will put thousands back to work and have \n     ripple benefits throughout the North American economy. Our \n     members look forward to being part of this historic project \n     and pledge to deliver the highest quality work to make it a \n     success.\n\n  President Edwin D. Hill, International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers. The list goes on.\n  As I said, this project has been studied for 3 years. We have already \nbuilt the sister project. We have gone through that whole process. This \nhas been studied for 3 years already.\n  How much will this project cost the American taxpayer? This is a $7 \nbillion investment, but it is private investment. It is private \ninvestment that stimulates job creation. Not only will it not cost the \nAmerican taxpayer one dime, The Perryman Group from Waco, TX, estimates \nit will create hundreds of millions of dollars in local and State \nrevenues.\n  Our country faces some real challenges. One of those challenges is we \nhave to get people back to work. We have 8.6 percent unemployment. We \nhave 13.3 million people looking for work. We need to get them back to \nwork. So government needs to create the legal, tax, and regulatory \nenvironment that stimulates private investment and gets people back to \nwork. This legislation, this project, helps do that.\n  We have a deficit and a debt--a deficit of about $1.3 trillion, a \ndebt that is now $15 trillion. When our President took office, our debt \nwas $10 trillion. The national debt was $10 trillion. Today it is $15 \ntrillion.\n  We have to get a grip on our spending. We have to start finding \nsavings, but at the same time we have to grow this economy. We have to \nget private investment going and grow this economy. That growth in \nrevenues and controlling our spending is what will reduce the deficit \nand the debt.\n  You know what, we have to do more to reduce our energy dependence on \nplaces such as the Middle East and Venezuela, where we have real \nchallenges. This is the kind of project that can do it. I submit we \nneed to move forward. This body has the opportunity to truly empower \nthe kind of investment we need to move our economy forward, to create \ngreater energy independence, and to help Americans get back to work. \nThat is exactly what they want. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8587-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8587-S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, too often we have set-piece speeches in the \nSenate without any resort to the traditional debate, where two sides \nare equally dividing time without a set script on a critical issue \nbefore our country. I would like to restart the true Senate tradition \nof debate with a debate with my colleague from Delaware.\n  I will yield to him right now.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Kirk. I am grateful for the Senator \ninviting me to join him in a real debate on the floor on an issue about \nwhich we disagree and about which we cast opposing votes earlier today. \nIt is an issue of real import to our country. It is something that has \nbeen debated in the past and will be in the future but essentially \nwhether we should have a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. KIRK. What I would like to do now, in sort of a chess clock \nstyle, is take 10 minutes, with unanimous consent, to be equally \ndivided between me and the Senator from Delaware on the subject of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered. For 10 minutes, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nDelaware may engage in a colloquy. The Parliamentarian will keep track \nof the time of each, to the best of our capability.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, the United States needs to adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It was a good idea when Thomas \nJefferson backed it and it is an even more important idea today. What \nwe are seeing in Europe is a collapse of government finance because \nthey have spent too much, taxed too much, and borrowed too much. Not \nonly do they have a crisis of their government debt, but they have \nhigher taxes and lower economic performance because of that philosophy.\n\n  We cannot repeat that mistake. That is why the Senate should have \nadopted a balanced budget amendment. I will speak in bipartisan \nfashion--any of the balanced budget amendments we considered today \nwould have been better, rather than to subject our country to a rising \ntide of debt and an economic model which is already, we are seeing, \nfailing in Europe.\n  Mr. COONS. I could not agree more that we need to be responsible; \nthat the United States and this Senate need to face our serious and \ncrippling national deficits and debt.\n  It was a good idea when Thomas Jefferson recognized that a balanced \nbudget amendment was a bad idea. Thomas Jefferson actually, several \nyears later, after supporting a balanced budget amendment, acted as \nPresident in ways that demonstrated he understood that real \nopportunities required extraordinary capabilities by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I was a county executive. Others in this Chamber who were mayors or \nGovernors lived with balanced budget requirements and it imposed great \nrestrictions on us. It forced us to make tough decisions on annual \ntimelines, so I understand why it is tempting to consider passing one \nof the balanced budget amendments that were before this Chamber today.\n  But there is a difference between the Federal Government and the \nState and local governments. Thomas Jefferson acted decisively to make \nthe Louisiana Purchase possible and to finance the War of 1812. During \nthe current economic downturn, if the Federal Government had not been \nable to borrow and invest in restoring growth to this country, we would \nnot have had a great recession, we would have had a second depression. \nI am convinced of it, and it is one of the reasons I think, had the \nbalanced budget amendment been in place, we would have been in even \ngreater trouble than we have been over the last few years.\n  Mr. KIRK. What we see now, today, though, is that we are awash in $15 \ntrillion in debt and that since the creation of the triple A credit \nrating by Standard & Poor's, the United States has now lost that \nrating.\n  When young Americans are born today, they already owe the Federal \nGovernment $40,000. So they will have a lower income and a higher tax \nburden throughout their working lives because of the debts put on them.\n  The biggest reason for a balanced budget amendment, though, is we \nhave a structural inability to represent young Americans. They cannot \nvote until they are age 18. Yet the representatives of their parents \ncan transfer tremendous burdens onto that young generation of \nAmericans. The essence of the American dream is that our children's \nlives will be better than our own. But given the weight of the debt we \nare now transferring onto the backs of the next generation, that may no \nlonger be possible.\n  We absolutely have to have a structural way to prevent one generation \nfrom transferring new spending and new debt to the new generation so \nthe American ideal is preserved and so they have a fighting chance to \nhave a better life than their parents.\n  Mr. COONS. This Senate can, should, and has shown the ability to \nreach balanced budgets--no, in fact, surpluses--within living memory. \nIn fact, when President Clinton was the President, this Senate and the \nHouse acted together. They adopted budgetary self-restraint.\n  Why amend the Constitution of the United States, our most \nfoundational document, when we have within our own power, recently \ndemonstrated in the late 1990s, the capacity to control ourselves?\n  The Senator and I agree we are leaving to our children an enormous, \ncrushing legacy of a national debt that has exceeded safe boundaries. \nBut why amend the Constitution in order to force the Senate to do our \njob? Instead, I think we should embrace some of the tough, big, bold, \nbipartisan proposals that have been put on the table--whether the \nBowles-Simpson Commission or others. The framework of a broad deal that \nrequires sacrifice from all, changes to the spiraling Federal spending, \nand changes in the direction of the country is on the table before us. \nWhy take a detour into amending America's foundational document rather \nthan simply stepping up and doing the job that is before us?\n  Mr. KIRK. The job of each generation is to make sure the Constitution \ndeals with critical problems facing the country, so we amended the \nConstitution so we could prohibit slavery. We amended the Constitution \nso we could grant women the right to vote. We should amend the \nConstitution to prevent one generation from encumbering the next \ngeneration.\n  America is the greatest experiment in self-government and, more \nimportant, the underlying value of self-rule ever designed. But we have \nseen in recent days that self-control disappear. We work in the Senate, \nnow well onto I think 900 days, without a budget. This is the most \nsuccessful corporation, the most successful enterprise on Earth, \nrepresenting the real aspiration for human dignity and freedom. Yet \nthat is in danger if we become indebted to China and other countries in \nways that no previous generation of Americans have done. This country \nhas regularly amended the Constitution to fix inequities in our \nsociety, and the growing inequity we see today is debt and deficits, \nespecially to other countries. Therefore, we should amend the \nConstitution to protect those who cannot yet vote from an economic fate \nthat would otherwise befall them.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Senator's side, 2 minutes 20 seconds; \non the side of the Senator from Illinois, 1 minute 16 seconds.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, as the good Senator from Illinois suggests, \nwe are, indeed, encumbering future generations with a debt that has \nrisen above $40,000 per American. This is a central challenge of our \ntime, one in which our national security leadership has cited as \ncritical to ensuring our security and our liberty going forward. But, \nin my view, the balanced budget amendment that was advanced through \nS.J. Res. 10 earlier today would compel exactly the sort of \nintergenerational burdens that my good friend from Illinois suggests he \nseeks to avoid.\n  Let me be clear. The requirements of that balanced budget amendment \ninclude a spending cap, a supermajority requirement to raise the \nnational debt, and a two-thirds requirement for any increase in Federal \nrevenue. Those in combination would compel drastic, immediate, and \nsubstantial reductions in a wide range of programs--such as Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits--that if imposed would\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nhave not just a short-term, very negative impact on our current economy \nbut a significant restructuring of the longstanding relationships \nbetween individual citizens and generations.\n  Yes, leaving a legacy of debt to the next generation is a terrible \nthing for us to do, but leaning on the crutch of the Constitution and \nthe fig leaf of a constitutional amendment to avoid doing our \nresponsibility--a job which the Senate is fully capable of doing--\navoids that responsibility to the next generation.\n  I close with this question: As we say in the law, if there is a \nright, what is the remedy? If we were to pass this constitutional \namendment, how would it be enforced if the Senate in the future were to \nfail to balance the budget? Would lifetime Federal judges around the \ncountry be imposing choices in terms of budget cuts, spending cuts, \nrevenue changes? I think that would be no better--in fact, far worse--\nthan the Senate simply doing its job.\n  Today I voted against this balanced budget amendment because I think \nwe have it within our power to show self-control and to secure the \nfuture for the next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. KIRK. I would close by saying the Senator and I agree. I think \nthe Simpson-Bowles plan is the right way to go, and my hope is that we \njoin together on a bipartisan basis to reduce expected Federal \nborrowing by $4 trillion along the lines of that bipartisan \nPresidential commission. But, unfortunately, the Simpson-Bowles plan is \ngathering dust. The supercommittee that was given procedural powers to \npossibly put that forward also collapsed. We have not been able to do \nour job, and we are now encumbering the next generation with even \ngreater amounts of debt--historic amounts.\n  I think the Founding Fathers did not contemplate the ability to \nborrow as much from other countries as we now have, and with the United \nStates as the center of freedom and democracy around the world there is \na lot riding on the credit of the United States.\n  My colleague from Delaware talks about a very vital future--\nespecially for people like my own mother--of Social Security and \nMedicare, but I think she understands that a bankrupt country cannot \nsupport Social Security and Medicare. We have to defend the credit of \nthe United States, and therefore I think a balanced budget amendment is \nessential to the long-term future of the United States.\n  With that, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, we have just finished. I hope we do return to a \ntradition of actual debate, and I thank my colleague for the chance to \ncarry out this debate.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8588-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8588-S8589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL BENNY LANDRENEAU\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, while we have a bit of quiet time on the \nSenate floor this evening, I thought I would make brief remarks about \nthe extraordinary career of MG Benny Landreneau. General Landreneau \nrecently retired as the most senior Adjutant General in the Nation, \nwith nearly 14 years of service as head of the Louisiana National \nGuard, serving under three Governors, and nearly four decades of \nservice to the State of Louisiana and our Nation.\n  Over many years I have had the joy and pleasure of calling General \nLandreneau a friend and a colleague and I have worked closely with him \nand the 11,000 members of our Louisiana National Guard. Through the \nSeptember 11 attacks on our country and through Hurricanes Katrina, \nRita, Gustaf, and Ike and the recent BP oilspill--one of the largest \nenvironmental disasters in our Nation's history--General Landreneau has \nproven his leadership to the people of Louisiana and our Nation time \nand time again.\n  Benny, as he is known by his friends, credits his father with \ninspiring him to serve in the National Guard. His father Joseph Audley \nLandreneau was a World War II veteran and engineering soldier and a \ncombat veteran. Benny, who grew up in Vidrine, LA, chose to follow in \nhis father's footsteps and quickly rose through the ranks in the \nLouisiana National Guard.\n  As a young man, in 1969 he enlisted as a light weapons infantryman in \nthe 773rd Maintenance Battalion. Two and a half years later he \ngraduated from Officer Candidate School and became a second lieutenant \nplatoon leader as part of the 3671st Maintenance Company. From those \nvery early beginnings in the National Guard, he progressed rapidly \nthrough the ranks.\n  During his time with the Guard, General Landreneau was part of \nseveral major campaigns, including a deployment during Desert Storm. \nDuring the first gulf war General Landreneau and his 527th Engineer \nBattalion were tasked with any number of important missions, including \nthe No. 1 mission for the gulf war commander himself, GEN Fred Franks.\n  General Franks needed an unmanned aerial vehicle landing strip built \nimmediately, so he knew who to call to get that job done. He called \nBenny Landreneau and his battalion. Need I say that it was done, I am \nsure, under budget and before time.\n  After the 527th returned to the command headquarters, General Franks \ncalled General Landreneau to thank him for what he did, which was \nextraordinary, and asked the general what he could do as a return \nfavor. Without blinking an eye, General Landreneau just said:\n\n       Sir, please, if you could get us home for Mother's Day, it \n     would be appreciated.\n\n  So all of the mostly guys were home from other States--some women in \nthe battalion as well--and they were thrilled to be home with their \nparents.\n  In 1996, shortly after the gulf war, General Landreneau retired from \nthe Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources where he served \nalso as a State conservationist for almost 30 years. Since that time, \nhe has taken the National Guard in Louisiana from a strategic reserve \nforce to an operational force that continues to lead the Nation both on \nand off the battlefield, and I will talk about off the battlefield in \njust a minute.\n  General Landreneau was quoted as saying:\n\n       The Louisiana National Guard soldiers and airmen are part \n     of the finest National Guard in America. It is their \n     dedication and professionalism, their commitment and their \n     hard work that has made the Louisiana National Guard the \n     finest guard in America. The Louisiana National Guard has \n     performed in such an outstanding matter in accepting these \n     new challenges of being an operational force and responding \n     to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and deploying throughout \n     the world when called on and, at the same time, being able to \n     take up the work of their State emergencies--\n\n  Which have been too numerous to count--\n\n     and being able to respond to the citizens of this State in an \n     outstanding fashion.\n\n  This is due in part, I say, to his leadership and vision.\n  General Landreneau has also been instrumental in implementing one of \nthe most phenomenal programs in our country: the Louisiana National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program. It is part of the National Youth \nChalleNGe Program. This is what I mean by off-the-battlefield expertise \nas well as on-the-battlefield expertise.\n  Some years ago--I think about 15--when General Conway was the general \nfor the National Guard, he helped to start this program that now has \ngraduated over 100,000 young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who \nare unfortunately drifting from the straight and narrow path. They \nhaven't ended up in prison yet, but they are headed that way. They have \ngiven up on themselves. They have gotten into a little bit of trouble \nand need a second chance. This program offers them that chance.\n  Under General Landreneau's leadership, we run three of the dozens of \nprograms operating in the United States. I might say we run the best \nthree, having been granted and acknowledged with awards in ceremonies \nfor many years in Louisiana and having graduated the largest number of \nyoung people. This has been done because of General Landreneau's \nextraordinary commitment to the citizens of our State\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nand to the young people of our State and the respect he has of his rank \nand file for these men and women to go beyond their regular duties and \nresponsibilities and step up and say: There is an epidemic in America. \nOur dropout rate is too high. What can the National Guard do, in \naddition to everything else they do both abroad and at home, to help? \nIt is extraordinary.\n  His grandchildren and his children are proud of him. I know he is \nvery proud of them.\n  He has assembled over the last 14 years arguably the most tested \nstaff in the Nation. He is being succeeded as Adjutant General by GEN \nGlenn Curtis, who has served as General Landreneau's right-hand man for \nthe last 6 years. It is the hallmark of his leadership that General \nLandreneau leaves his staff ready to step up, ready to serve, and ready \nto continue the excellent service they have given to the people of our \nState and our Nation. Although General Curtis will bring his own brand \nof leadership to the National Guard, there is no doubt, as he has said \nto me many times, he has learned at the elbow of GEN Benny Landreneau.\n  In conclusion, I would like to personally, on behalf of the people of \nour State, thank GEN Benny Landreneau for his many years of service \nand dedication to the people of Louisiana and our country. I want him \nto know he has positively impacted our State in ways that will long be \nremembered. The people of Louisiana are grateful for his service and \nfor his dedication, and we honor his admirable career in the National \nGuard.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWhitehouse and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8589-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8589-S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to address an alarming trend \nthat I see in our national discourse. As legislators, our decisions \nneed to be rooted in facts. Science driven by data and rigorous \nanalysis needs to inform our policymaking.\n  Scientists are the ones who made the United States the world's \ninnovator in the last century. Scientists are the people who gave us \nantibiotics, for example. Do you like being able to use antibiotics? \nWell, then, thank scientists.\n  Scientists put a man on the Moon--several men, actually--and got him \nback safely. These are rocket scientists.\n  Scientists made it possible for Americans to watch this speech on C-\nSPAN--that is C-SPAN, the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network--also \nrocket scientists.\n  Scientists also came up with such useful things as the Internet.\n  A scientist from the University of Minnesota, a Noble Price-winning \nagronomist named Norman Borlaug, is credited with saving over 1 billion \nlives worldwide. He did this by using science to develop a high-yield, \ndisease-resistant wheat that was planted in Pakistan, India, and \nelsewhere around the world.\n  By engineering our next-generation weapons systems, scientists ensure \nthat our military will continue to be the most powerful in the world.\n  We rely on science and scientists, and if we are to progress as a \ncountry, if we and future generations of Americans are to be healthy \nand prosperous and safe, we better put science right at the center of \nour decisionmaking. Yet, right now, foundations and think tanks funded \nby the fossil fuel industry are spreading misinformation about the \nintegrity of climate science, much as think tanks paid by the tobacco \nindustry used misinformation to cast doubt about the health hazards of \nsmoking.\n  Ignoring or flatout contradicting what climate scientists are telling \nus about the warming climate and the warming planet can lead to really \nbad decisions on natural energy and environmental policies here in \nCongress. So today Senator Whitehouse and I want to take some time to \ntalk about climate science and about the fact that a scientific \nconsensus on climate change has been reached. Climate change is \nhappening and is being driven by human activities.\n  From the National Academy of Sciences, to the American Meteorological \nSociety, to the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, all of \nthe preeminent scientific institutions agree that manmade greenhouse \ngas emissions are warming the planet and are a threat to our economy, \nto our security, and to our health, and so do the overwhelming majority \nof actively publishing climatologists.\n  This graph, taken from a study published by the National Academy of \nSciences, shows responses to the survey question: Do you think human \nactivity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global \ntemperatures?\n  What you see here is that as climate expertise goes up, so does the \naffirmation that climate change is real and is caused by human beings. \nAmong the most expert pool of respondents, climatologists who are \nactively publishing on climate change, represented by this bar right \nhere, the rightmost bar, 97 percent of that category of scientists \nanswered yes. Of course, there are a few articles published by climate \nskeptics in peer-reviewed journals, but the vast majority--97 percent--\nof the peer-reviewed literature supports the notion that people are \ncausing the Earth's climate to change.\n  What are peer-reviewed articles? Well, they are articles scientists \nwrite after conducting experiments. The experimentation is designed to \ntest a hypothesis. If the hypothesis holds up, the scientist writes a \npaper describing the experiment and sends to it a professional journal. \nThe journal then sends to it other experts in the field--peer \nreviewers--who see if they can tear any holes in the theory. They \nquestion the methodology. They check the math. Very often, they send \nthe paper back with questions. And the researchers will make changes to \nsatisfy the reviewers' inquires. If in the end the peer reviewers think \nthe work is sound, they recommend the paper for publication. Then, \nafter publication, other scientists in the field are free to read the \npaper and plug away and disprove it if they can. That is a peer-\nreviewed paper.\n  I repeat, the vast majority of peer-reviewed literature supports the \nnotion that people are causing the Earth's climate to change, and 97 \npercent of published climatologists say yes when asked: Do you think \nhuman activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean \nglobal temperatures?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as Senator Franken has pointed out, \ndespite the efforts to mislead and create doubt, the jury is not out on \nwhether climate change is happening and being caused by manmade carbon \npollution; the verdict is, in fact, in, and the verdict is clear, as \nshown by this group of scientific organizations that signed a letter \nsupporting our efforts to do something about carbon pollution in the \nSenate back in October of 2009: the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the Geophysical \nUnion, the Meteorological Society, the Natural Science Collections \nAlliance, the Botanical Society of America.\n  Virtually every significant scientific organization accepts that \nthese are the facts and that the verdict is in, and, indeed, there is \nsome recent added support. The scientific community continues to \nexamine this question.\n  A recent report by James Hansen and Makiko Sato says:\n\n       Climate change is likely to be the predominant scientific, \n     economic, political and moral issue of the 21st century. The \n     fate of humanity and nature may depend upon early recognition \n     and understanding of human-made effects on Earth's climate.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       Earth is poised to experience strong amplifying polar \n     feedbacks in response to moderate global warming. Thus, goals \n     of limiting human-made warming to 2 degrees Celsius are not \n     sufficient--they are prescriptions for disaster.\n\n  Another recent report, ``Climate Change and European Marine Ecosystem \nResearch,'' reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\n       There is no doubt that rapid global warming and ocean \n     acidification are real, and very high confidence that both \n     are forced by human activities and emissions of carbon \n     dioxide. Climate change effects are especially evident in the \n     oceans.\n\n  I will get into that later on in our colloquy a little bit further.\n\n       Levels of atmospheric CO2 are accelerating.\n\n  A third report, ``The World Energy Outlook for 2011,'' says:\n\n       Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions reached 30.4 \n     Gt in 2010, 5.3% above 2009, representing almost \n     unprecedented annual growth. In the New Policies Scenario, \n     our central scenario, CO2 emissions continue to \n     increase, reaching 36.4 Gt in 2035, and leading to an \n     emissions trajectory consistent with a long-term global \n     temperature increase of 3.5 degrees Centigrade.\n\n  What does that mean?\n\n       The expected warming of more than 3.5 degrees Centigrade in \n     the New Policies Scenario would have severe consequences: a \n     sea level rise of up to 2 metres, causing dislocation of \n     human settlements and changes to rainfall patterns, drought, \n     flood, and heat-wave incidence that would severely affect \n     food production, human disease and mortality.\n\n  There are also iconic American companies that have made the \nconsidered business judgment that climate change is real and we need to \nprepare. But we can get more on that later in the colloquy.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Yet, in spite of all of this--and these are all new \nreports on top of this 97 percent number that was established. Yet the \nconservative media and some of my colleagues in Congress seem to think \nit is just fine to ignore what these scientists are saying.\n  Let me illustrate this with an analogy. Say you went to a doctor and \nthe doctor told you: You better start eating more sensibly and start \nexercising, because you are tremendously overweight. I see that you \nhave a family history of heart disease, and your father died of a heart \nattack at an early age. You have to go on a diet and start working out \na little bit.\n  You say: You know what. I want a second opinion. So you go to a \nsecond doctor and he says: OK, you have a family history of heart \ndisease. Your father died of a heart attack at a young age, and you \nweigh over 300 pounds. You smoke three packs a day. Your cholesterol is \nout of control, your blood pressure is through the roof. It would be \nirresponsible of me as a doctor not to immediately send you to this \nplace at the Mayo Clinic that I know. I think you have to go there.\n  You say: Thanks, doctor, but I want a third opinion. So you go to the \nthird doctor and the third doctor reads the chart and looks at you and \ngoes: Wow, I am amazed that you are still alive.\n  You say: You know what. I want a fourth opinion. And then you go to \nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh doctors. They are all saying the \nsame thing. But you keep asking for more opinions.\n  Finally, you go to the 25th doctor. The 25th doctor says: It is a \ngood thing you came to me, because all this diet and exercise would \nhave been a complete waste. You are doing fine. Those other doctors are \nin the pockets of the fresh fruit and vegetable people. He says: Enjoy \nlife, eat whatever you want, keep smoking, and watch a lot of TV. That \nis my advice.\n  Then you learn the doctor was paid a salary by the makers of \nTwinkies, which, don't get me wrong, are a delicious snack food and \nshould be eaten in moderation. Am I making sense here?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is actually quite a good example, because we have \nsome of the phony science that has attacked the science of climate \nchange, which is actually a pretty good comparison to what the Senator \ndescribed.\n  Take, for instance, the bogus Marshall Institute, which was founded \nin 1984 by a physicist who had been the chief scientist behind the \ntobacco industry's campaign to convince Americans that tobacco is \nactually OK for you, and that there was doubt about whether it would \nactually do you any harm. A few years later, he organized something \ncalled the Oregon Petition, which denied that climate change was \nhappening. They phonied up the Oregon Petition to look like official \npapers of the National Academy of Sciences. So the National Academy of \nSciences had to take the unusual step of responding that the petition \n``does not reflect the conclusion of expert reports of the academy,'' \nand further, that it was ``a deliberate attempt to mislead.'' So he is \nan ``expert'' saying that tobacco is OK for you. Suddenly, he turns up \nas a climate denier, and he phonies up his report to look like----\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Was he part of a foundation?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. This is founded by the Marshall Institute. There are \nothers of these out there. The other example is the Heartland \nInstitute, another so-called think tank with backers from tobacco and \nthe fossil fuel industries, founded also in 1984. It has written \nreports to try to manufacture doubt about climate science and about the \nrisks of secondhand smoke. Heartland received nearly $700,000 from \nExxonMobil through 2006. Their bogus policy documents include false \nclaims that climate change is poorly understood, and simply wrong \nassertions, that there is no consensus about the causes, effects, or \nfuture rate of global warming.\n  Picking these two--but there are others in the constellation of bogus \nscience--they are commonly funded by the Bradley Foundation, the folks \nwho brought you the John Birch Society; by the Scaife foundations, \nwhich are constantly behind rightwing causes; the Olan Foundation, \nwhich is against public health causes; ExxonMobil; and by the Koch \nbrothers. Although it may look like different voices, it is actually \nthe same money speaking through different fronts.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. This is actually an interesting area. There is a well-\nestablished link between the scientists who have worked for think tanks \nsuch as George C. Marshall Institute, Heartland Institute, and other \nfoundations, which were funded at first by tobacco money and, since \nthen, by the fossil fuel industry. These scientists have been paid to \nspread misinformation in order to cast doubt. That is all they have to \ndo--on a whole host of scientific issues--first, tobacco and acid rain, \nthe hole in the ozone layer, and now climate change.\n  Take tobacco, for example. Scientists were paid to testify in court \nthat there was no proof that smoking caused cancer or was addictive, \neven after the industry scientists knew darn well that cigarettes were \naddictive and did cause cancer and heart disease. In fact, the tobacco \nindustry was found guilty in 2004 of plotting to conceal the health \nrisks and addictiveness of cigarettes from the public. The judge found \nthat the tobacco industry had ``devised and executed a scheme to \ndefraud consumers and potential consumers about the hazards of \ncigarettes--hazards that their own internal company documents proved \nthey had known since the 1950s.''\n  The whole purpose of this scheme was to provide misinformation, to \nconfuse the public, to manufacture doubt, and that is what is happening \nright now with climate change. Public data from the Security and \nExchange Commission and from charitable organization reports to the IRS \nreport showed that between 2005 and 2008, ExxonMobil gave about $9 \nmillion to groups linked to climate change denial, while foundations \nassociated with the private oil company Koch Industries gave nearly $25 \nmillion. The third major funder was the American Petroleum Institute. \nAll in all, the energy industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars, \neven billions of dollars, on lobbying against climate change \nlegislation between 1999 and 2010, including a large spike in spending \nfrom 2008 to 2010.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And it is not enough that they have a stable of paid-\nfor scientists to create doubt, to create phony science that raises the \nlevel of doubt; they also go out of their way to attack legitimate \nscientists. You would not think this would carry much weight in a \nproper debate, but amplified by the corporate money behind it, and \ndesigned, as the Senator said, with the purpose not to win the argument \nbut to create doubt so that the public moves on, it is actually worse.\n  One example of this attack on lifetime scientists has been the phony \nso-called Climategate scandal, which was an effort to derail \ninternational climate science and climate negotiations.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Climategate. Sometimes the Senator and I refer to it as \n``Climategate-gate.''\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, Climategate-gate. In fact, the real scandal here \nwasn't what the scientists did; the real\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nscandal was the phony attack on the scientists.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank my colleague for bringing this up. Let's talk \nabout that. This is the leak of thousands of e-mails from scientists at \nthe University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit back in 2009. It \nwas done right before the Copenhagen conference, right?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. OK. The conservative media--remember, this doubt is \namplified in the conservative echo chamber, talk radio, et cetera. You \nknow what it is, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, Fox News, et \ncetera. Conservative media pounced, taking quotes out of context to \nsensational lies like this ``scandal.'' Most of the attacks were \ndirected at an e-mail by Phil Jones, a climate scientist working with \nthe East Anglia Climate Research Unit, in which in this e-mail he \nreferred to using ``Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to \neach series for the last 20 years to hide the decline.'' That sounds \nvery bad, ``trick'' and ``hide the decline.'' That went viral in the \nconservative media--evidence that the scientific consensus on climate \nchange was a giant hoax. We had a Member of this body who said the \nscience behind this consensus ``is the same science that, through \nclimategate, has been totally rebuffed and no longer legitimate, either \nin reality or in the eyes of the American people and the people around \nthe world.''\n  But it turns out that the trick being referred to in the e-mail is \nactually a technique to use the most accurate data available. Pre-1960, \ntemperature data would include measurements from thermometers, tree \nrings, and other so-called temperature proxies. Post-1960--this is the \ntrick--they excluded tree ring data from some specific kinds of trees \nthat were widely recognized by the scientific community to be \nunreliable after 1960. So the decline refers--they refer to it as--it \nisn't a decline in global temperatures, as the deniers claim.\n  Since 1960, we have had pretty good measurement of temperatures \naround the world with things such as thermometers. They knew this tree \nring gave an apparent decline in temperature, as measured by these \nspecific kinds of trees that were known to be inaccurate compared to \nall the sensors we have for measuring--and there are thousands and \nthousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of measurements of \nthe temperature around the Earth every minute, every day.\n  So this was the ``trick''--a technique to use the most accurate data \navailable of global temperatures from things, again, called \nthermometers, and one that excluded data widely known to the scientific \ncommunity to be inaccurate. That is what the ``trick'' was. That is \nall. That is what Phil Jones referred to in his e-mail. Ironically, he \nwas trying to be precise.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And it provoked considerable review afterward because \nof the alarmist claims that were made in this phony attack on the \nclimate science. A number of pretty respectable organizations took a \nlook at this. One was the university itself, and the university itself \nreached the conclusion on the specific allegations made against the \nbehavior of CRU scientists, ``We find that their rigor and honesty as \nscientists are not in doubt. In addition, we do not find that their \nbehavior has prejudiced the balance of advice given the policymakers. \nIn particular, we did not find any evidence of behavior that might \nundermine the conclusions of the IPCC assessment.'' That was the \nuniversity review.\n  Not enough? The National Science Foundation also----\n  Mr. FRANKEN. The university could be biased.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is why we go on to the National Science \nFoundation, which found no direct evidence of research misconduct and \ntherefore said, ``We are closing this investigation with no further \naction.''\n  Parliament looked into it as well, because the university was in \nGreat Britain. And the House of Commons did an investigation. The \nCommons' investigation concluded that the challenged actions by \nProfessor Jones and others ``were in line with common practice in the \nclimate science community.'' They went on to say:\n\n       Insofar as we have been able to consider accusations of \n     dishonesty, we consider that there is no case to answer.\n\n  No case to answer. Finally, they said:\n\n       We have found no reason in this unfortunate episode to \n     challenge the scientific consensus as expressed by Professor \n     Bennington that ``global warming is happening and that it is \n     induced by human activity.''\n\n  So the studies that looked at whether the climate science was phony \nor whether the climategate scandal was phony have all come down \nsupporting the science and pointing out that climategate should \nproperly be known as climategate-gate because it was the scandal that \nwas phony.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Now, let's make a distinction between people who are \nclimate skeptics and people who are climate deniers. This is kind of an \nimportant distinction. There is nothing wrong with skepticism. In fact, \nwe love skeptics. Scientists are, by nature, skeptical. If someone has \na new idea, they need to prove conclusively they are right before 97 \npercent of scientists will believe them. This has already happened for \nan overwhelming majority of climate scientists who have concluded, \nagain, that global warming is happening and that it is caused by \nmankind. But there are a small number of them who still have questions.\n  On the other hand, a climate denier is someone who would not be \nconvinced no matter how overwhelming the evidence. And, as I pointed \nout, a lot of these deniers are being paid by polluters to say what \nthey want.\n  Now, shortly after climategate, or climategate-gate, a physicist at \nthe University of California Berkeley, Richard Muller, who was \nskeptical of the prevailing views on climate science, decided to test \nthe temperature records. Muller, a skeptic, started the Berkeley Earth \nSurface Temperature Study to reevaluate the record and weed out \nscientific biases. This was gold to climate deniers. In fact, among the \nfunders for the Muller study was the Charles Koch Foundation. But \nthings didn't work out the way the deniers had hoped.\n  In late March, Dr. Muller testified before the House Science and \nTechnology Committee with his initial findings on temperature increases \nsince the late 1950s. This is what he said:\n\n       Our result is very similar to that reported by the prior \n     groups--a rise of about .7 degrees Celsius since 1957. This \n     agreement with the prior analysis surprised us.\n\n  Because, as I say, they were skeptics. Muller basically recreated the \nblade of the so-called hockey stick graph, or the temperature graph, \nthat had come under attack in climategate.\n  This graph shows Muller's estimates against the previous estimates. \nMuller's Berkeley is black. You will see it is just identical, pretty \nmuch. This past October Dr. Muller's group released its findings, and \nto the dismay of skeptics and deniers these findings further confirmed \nthe prevailing science behind climate change and the work of the \nscientists attacked during climategate-gate.\n  We can see the results on the chart. This gray band indicates a 95-\npercent statistical spacial uncertainty. But it is exactly--and his \nline is the black line--exactly what the other scientists measured.\n  The summary of the findings begins by saying, bluntly, ``global \nwarming is real,'' and goes on to say:\n\n       Our biggest surprise was that the new results agreed so \n     closely with the warming values published previously by other \n     teams in the U.S. and U.K.\n\n  Including East Anglia.\n\n       This confirms these studies were done carefully and that \n     potential biases identified by climate change skeptics did \n     not seriously affect their conclusion.\n\n  So even though these claims that the consensus on global warming is a \nhoax have been refuted so convincingly--by a skeptic no less; funded by \nCharles Koch, no less--some of the deniers keep repeating it. The \nscience is settled and climategate, or climategate-gate, was just a big \ndistraction. So now let's move on and figure out how we are going to \nattack the challenge of climate change.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The challenge of climate change being extremely real, \none of the things that is so frustrating about this campaign of phony, \nmanufactured doubt is that in real life we are seeing the predictions \nof climate science come true around us.\n  Climate scientists predicted the atmosphere would warm, and the \natmosphere is warming. Climate scientists\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\npredicted the ocean would absorb heat, and sure enough, the ocean has \nabsorbed heat and ocean waters are warming. Climate scientists \npredicted the ocean would absorb CO2 and that would then \nlower the pH level of our ocean waters. The ocean is now more acidic \nthan it has been in 2 million years, threatening coral reefs, \nshellfish, and the tiny creatures, such as plankton, that make up the \nbase of the entire oceanic food chain.\n  Climate scientists predicted glaciers and Arctic sea ice would melt \nand, sure enough, we are seeing record melting. We just saw that \nnotorious leftwing publication, USA Today, report:\n\n       Federal Report Arctic Much Worse Since 2006. Federal \n     officials say the Arctic region has changed dramatically in \n     the past 5 years for the worse. It is melting at a near \n     record pace and it is darkening and absorbing too much of the \n     sun's heat.\n\n  Climate scientists predicted ecosystem shifts, and we are seeing \necosystem shifts, such as the million-plus-acre forests in the American \nWest--dead to the bark beetle, gone from being green and healthy \nforests to just mile after mile of brown and dead trees.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Explain why the bark beetle is doing this. What is \nhappening and how does that relates to climate change?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The bark beetle relates to climate change because \nwhat was keeping those trees free from the bark beetle was cold winters \nthat killed off the bark beetle larvae. As temperatures have warmed, \nthe larvae lived through the winters, and they attacked the trees. So \ntrees that were protected by cold winters are no longer protected, and \nthere are literally millions of acres of forest lost in the West.\n  On a smaller scale, but more important to me in my home State of \nRhode Island, the preeminent fish that was taken out of Narragansett \nBay was called the winter flounder. My wife wrote her Ph.D. thesis \nabout the winter flounder. It was a very significant cash crop for our \nfishermen and is now virtually gone because the mean water temperature \nof Narragansett Bay is up nearly 4 degrees.\n\n  Scientists also predicted we would be loading the dice for extreme \nweather with climate change, and we are seeing an unusual amount of \nextreme weather. The number of billion-dollar disasters has hit a \nrecord. A recent press clip noted:\n\n       With an almost biblical onslaught of twisters, floods, \n     snow, drought, heat, and wildfire, the U.S., in 2011, has \n     seen more weather catastrophes that caused at least $1 \n     billion in damage than it did in all of the 1980s, even after \n     the dollar figures from back then are adjusted for inflation.\n\n  Serious, grown-up corporate entities, like the biggest insurance \ncompanies in the world, are noticing this and are concerned. Munich \nReinsurance has written the following:\n\n       The high number of weather-related natural catastrophes and \n     record temperatures, both globally and in different regions \n     of the world, provide further indications of advancing \n     climate change.\n\n  Throughout the corporate world we are seeing this. Here is a list of \ncompanies that have gone public with the need for us to do something \nabout climate change: American Electric, Bank of America, Chrysler, \nCysco, DuPont, Duke Energy, eBay, Toyota, Timberland, Starbucks, \nGoogle, GM, General Electric, Ford, Siemens, PepsiCo, Nike, Nishiland, \nand John Deere. I am picking these at random, but these are not fringe \norganizations. These are the core of the American business community, \nand they recognize what is going on.\n  I want to single out one company, which is Coca-Cola. I was going to \nbring to the floor the new can of Coca-Cola as an exhibit to \ndemonstrate this major international corporation--this huge American \nsuccess story based in Atlanta--has taken probably the most iconic \nproduct in America--the Coke can--and has redesigned it to reflect what \nthe climate change is doing in the Arctic and to polar bears. \nUnfortunately, my Coke can was confiscated by the cloakroom staff \nbecause I am not allowed to bring exhibits to the floor unless they are \nthis. I should have snuck it out here, but that is why I don't have it.\n  Coca-Cola is a serious American business, and here is what they say:\n\n       The consensus on climate science is increasingly \n     unequivocal--global climate change is happening and man-made \n     greenhouse gas emissions are a crucial factor. The \n     implications of climate change for our planet are profound \n     and wide-ranging, with expected impacts on biodiversity, \n     water resources, public health, and agriculture.\n\n  So we put against that the core business community--iconic companies \nsuch as Coca-Cola, putting their very label behind the need to address \nclimate change--and the phony-baloney-paid-for scientists who are \ncreating this doubt, and it is time to close this episode.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I am glad the Senator brings up the phony-baloney doubt, \nespecially with this extreme weather we have been experiencing. Some of \nmy colleagues on the other side have pointed to the extreme \nsnowstorms--at least one of my colleagues has--in the Northeast over \nthe last several winters as evidence that global warming is a hoax. \nAgain, this is completely misleading. Intensifying blizzards aren't due \nto the Earth getting cooler, they are due to increased moisture content \nin the air. Warmer air holds more moisture.\n  Now, basically, it doesn't have to be that cold for it to snow. It \njust has to be 32 degrees or below. What is snow? It is frozen water. \nSo it is about water. The atmosphere is now holding more water because \nit is warmer. Warmer air holds more water than colder air. The main \npoint is that these increased natural disasters have real costs.\n  A few months ago we had a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee on the Forest Service's management of the intense forest \nfires we had out West this year. In that hearing, Forest Service Chief \nTom Tidwell told me he is seeing longer forest fire seasons out West--\nmore than 30 days longer than what we used to have even a decade ago. \nForest Service climate experts--and these are scientists--have said \nthat a major contributing factor to these longer fire seasons and more \nintense fires is climate change.\n  The cost of these fires, passed on to all levels of government and to \nsociety as a whole, is huge. It is something that Members on both sides \nof the aisle recognize and are concerned about. Several of my \nRepublican colleagues in that hearing expressed their concerns about \nthe cost.\n  They referred to a report from the Western Forestry Leadership \nCoalition, which estimates that the combined direct and indirect costs \nof forest fires can be as much as 30 times the cost of fire suppression \nalone. We need to factor in the cost of forest rehabilitation, the loss \nof tax revenues for local governments, loss of businesses that depend \non forest resources from property losses, not to mention the \nimmeasurable cost of lives which are lost due to the fires.\n  I wish to underscore for Members of this body that when we have \ndiscussions about important issues such as cost of wildfire response, \nwe are talking about the cost of responding to climate change. If \nforestry specialists at the U.S. Forest Service tell us these fires are \ngetting worse due to climate change, we should be listening to them.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator doesn't mind, if I change elements \nfrom fire to water since I represent an ocean State, another place \nwhere climate change is creating dangerous consequences is in our \noceans. Let me cite a few reports that have come out recently.\n  Climate Change & European Marine Ecosystem Research says:\n\n       Close to one-third of the carbon dioxide produced by humans \n     from burning fossil fuels and other sources has been absorbed \n     by the oceans since the beginning of industrialization, and \n     that has buffered the cause and effects of climate change.\n       A resulting lowered pH--\n\n  When carbon goes into the ocean, it acidifies it. It lowers the pH.\n\n       A resulting lowered pH and saturation states of the \n     carbonate minerals that form the shells and body structures \n     of many marine organisms makes these groups especially \n     vulnerable. The growth of individual coral skeletons and the \n     ability of reefs to remain structurally viable are likely to \n     be severely affected. Continuing acidification may also \n     affect the ability of the oceans to take up CO2.\n\n  So they will not be absorbing the one-third that they have absorbed \nany longer. It will stay in the atmosphere and atmospheric \nconcentrations will increase even faster.\n  The Annual Review of Marine Science reports that:\n\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\n\n       Growing human pressures, including climate change, are \n     having profound and diverse consequences for marine \n     ecosystems. These effects are globally pervasive and \n     irreversible on ecological time scales. Direct consequences \n     include increasing ocean temperature and acidity, rising sea \n     level, increased ocean stratification, decreased sea ice, and \n     altered patterns of ocean circulation, precipitation, and \n     fresh water.\n\n  The context for this is a pretty astounding one; that is, when we \nlook back through history, we don't look at changes in terms of decades \nor even generations. We look at changes in terms of millions of years.\n  There is a special issue of Oceanography with a feature on ocean \nacidification, and it is called ``Ocean Acidification in Deep Time.''\n\n       We have now an atmosphere that already contains more carbon \n     dioxide than at any time in the last 800,000 years of earth \n     history and probably more than has occurred in several tens \n     of millions of years.\n\n  We have had agriculture as humans for about 10,000 years, to give you \nan idea of what 800,000 years or several tens of millions of years \nmeans. The report goes on:\n\n       There are no precedents in recent earth history for what \n     will be the immediate and direct consequences of the release \n     of CO2 into the atmosphere and its concurrent \n     dissolution in the ocean's waters.\n\n  But we are playing with very dangerous effects when we ignore climate \nchange at the behest of a tiny minority of scientists and their \npolluter industry funders behind them.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. There are folks who get the cost of inaction, and that \nincludes the Department of Defense.\n  In its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review--or QDR--the DOD identified \nclimate and energy as among the major national security challenges that \nAmerica faces now and in the future.\n  To give you a perspective on the significance of this, ``Crafting a \nStrategic Approach to Climate and Energy'' was alongside other \npriorities laid out in the QDR with titles like, ``Succeed in \nCounterinsurgency, Stability and Counterterrorism Operations,'' and \n``Prevent Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.''\n  This is serious stuff. It matters for DOD because climate change is \npredicted to increase food and water scarcity, increase the spread of \ndisease, and spur mass migration and environmental refugees due to more \nintense storms, floods, and droughts.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We had similar testimony in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. The witness who testified before us released his testimony \nbefore the House Intelligence Committee and very much the same \nconclusion:\n\n       We judge that global climate change will have wide-ranging \n     implications for U.S. national security interests over the \n     next 20 years.\n\n  The factors that would affect U.S. national security interests as a \nresult of climate change would include food and water shortages, \nincreased health problems, including the spread of disease, increased \npotential for conflict, ground subsidence--the Earth lowering--\nflooding, coastal erosion, extreme weather events, increases in the \nseverity of storms in the Gulf of Mexico, disruptions in U.S. and \nArctic infrastructure, and increases in immigration from resource-\nscarce regions of the world.\n  There are probably climate deniers who say: That is all part of the \nconspiracy. The Defense Department is in on it. All those companies are \nin on it. The intelligence community is in on it.\n  But if there is a hoax, what is more mainstream than National \nGeographic? Is National Geographic in on it too? They would have to be \nbecause they did a special report a few years ago on climate change and \nthey showed a polar bear stranded on the melting ice. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       It's here. Melting glaciers, heat waves, rising seas, trees \n     flowering earlier, lakes freezing later, migratory birds \n     delaying their flight south. The unmistakable signs of \n     climate change are everywhere.\n\n  How do we know this? We know this because of the science. What do \nthey say about the science?\n\n       How do we know our climate is changing? Historical records, \n     decades of careful observations and precise measurements--\n  As the Senator said, with things such as thermometers--\n\n     around the globe along with basic scientific principles.\n\n  If you think National Geographic is in on it and you can't have faith \nin the Defense establishment and you can't have faith in the corporate \nestablishment and you can't have faith even in National Geographic, \nperhaps you can have faith in the Pope, who said recently:\n\n       I hope that all members of the international community can \n     agree on a responsible, credible, and supportive response to \n     this worrisome and complex phenomenon, keeping in mind the \n     needs of the poorest populations and of future generations.\n\n  The press release from Catholic News Service then quotes one of his \nbishops, Cardinal Rodriguez, who says:\n\n       Our climate is changing. Urgent action is necessary.\n\n  He called on our political leaders around the world ``to curb the \nthreat of climate change and set the world on a path to a more just and \nsustainable future.''\n  Mr. FRANKEN. OK. Well, the Pope--I mean, didn't the Catholic Church \ngo after Galileo?\n  Look, between the science supporting climate change and the reality \nof the dangers that climate change brings, we have to ramp up our \nefforts to master this challenge, and that means wise investments in \nclean energy R and deployment. They are just a good place to start. \nPlus, these investments encourage the growth of domestic clean energy--\na domestic clean energy economy which would create jobs--and has \ncreated jobs--grow our manufacturing base, and keep us competitive in \nglobal energy markets. That is so important because Germany, China, \nDenmark, and countries all over the world are winning this race.\n  One of the great parts about this job is spending half the time here \nand half the time home in Minnesota. Minnesota is a national leader in \nclean energy.\n  In 2007, Minnesota passed the highest renewable energy standard in \nthe country at the time, and all our utilities are on track to meet the \ngoal of 25 percent renewable by 2025.\n  Our largest utility, Xcel Energy, is on its way to 30 percent by \n2020. We have universities such as the University of Minnesota Morris \nwhich is pushing the frontiers of innovation in greening its campus \nthrough a biomass gasification system which provides heating and \ncooling and electricity, wind turbines that produce power, and LEED-\ncertified buildings. Our farmers have led the country in biofuels, and \nour universities are leading R efforts for the transitions to \ncellulosic and other advanced biofuels.\n  By the way, the first commercial cellulosic plant that is scaled up \nto commercial levels is being built right now. St. Paul has the largest \ndistrict energy system in North America. It is heating and cooling all \nof downtown St. Paul with woody biomass. SAGE Electrochromics is a \nmanufacturing plant in Minnesota that has cutting-edge window glass \ntechnology that uses a little photovoltaic cell to control and turn \nthese--these windows turn completely opaque and block out all UV during \nthe summer. During the winter, they are these beautiful, huge windows \nthat let in all the light. It isn't like a Polaroid. It is an \nincredible technology.\n  The University of Minnesota has just received two grants from the \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency at the Department of Energy, ARPA-E, \nthat was patterned after DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency that created the Internet. Across the State, businesses and \ncities are working together to make our buildings more energy \nefficient, using Minnesota-made technologies such as Marvin and \nAnderson windows. Minnesota, by the way, is the Silicon Valley of \nwindows. We have 3M window films or McQuay heating and air-conditioning \nsystems.\n  Just last month, I partnered with our cities and counties to launch \nthe Back to Work Minnesota Initiative, aiming to break down barriers in \nfinancing retrofits, retrofitting public and commercial buildings \nacross Minnesota. What is great about that, this pays for itself. You \nfinance this and you retrofit a building; it puts people in the \nbuilding trades to work who are in a depression, and it puts \nmanufacturers that build energy-efficient materials and equipment, \ngeothermal furnace systems and furnaces, heat exchange furnaces, pumps, \nand you save energy.\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nThe energy efficiency pays for the retrofit in 4 or 5 years and you can \ncapitalize this and we are finding innovative ways to do that. It pays \nfor itself and you lower our carbon footprint. You use less energy, \ncreate jobs, save money. It is win-win-win-win. This is something we \nhave to do. It is insane not to.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We are proud of what is going on in Rhode Island as \nwell. We plan to meet 16 percent of our energy needs through renewable \nenergy sources by 2020, and that is on top of a goal to cut energy use \nby 10 percent. So we will cut energy use by 10 percent and, of the \nremaining 90, get 16 percent of that out of renewable energy sources. \nEverybody is getting involved--utilities, towns, the State, the private \nsector. One of our cities, East Providence, is right now converting a \nbrownfield which has been vacant for 40 years, nearly, into New \nEngland's largest solar institution. As my colleague says, there will \nbe a payback and they will earn money on that for their taxpayers.\n  Our State of Rhode Island has been the national leader at how you map \nand prepare for offshore wind development. In the State and Federal \nwaters off the coast of Rhode Island we are positioned to lead the \ncountry in offshore wind siting, with all the jobs that building those \ngiant wind turbines and assembling them and erecting them offshore \ncreates.\n  We have exciting companies such as BioProcess Algae, of Portsmouth, \nRI, which opened a spectacular facility in Iowa, which takes the \nexhaust from ethanol plants and runs it through algae farms and creates \nbiofuels. They are at the cutting edge of that technology.\n  When you see these great technologies and these great opportunities--\nin this colloquy, we are ending on what I hope is a very strong, \npositive note for the economy. If we can pull away from the lies and \nthe phony science and the polluter-paid nonsense that has so far \ndistracted us from doing our duty as a nation, we can get into the race \nthat is going on in this world for the energy future. The economy of \nthis century is going to be driven by the $6 trillion clean energy \nindustry. We do not want to fall out the back of that race and leave it \nto the Chinese and the Europeans. We want to be winning that race and \nthe jobs and the economic success that can bring that not only can \npower our homes and our factories, it can power our economy back to \nsecurity for all Americans.\n  I thank Senator Franken for inviting me to join him in this colloquy. \nI think our time is coming close to expiring, so I yield the remainder \nof our time to you, and I ask unanimous consent Senator Franken be \nallowed as much time as he needs to conclude. This has been a wonderful \nopportunity for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse for his \nleadership. Algal--by the way, algal is the pronunciation of this. \nAlgal energy is amazing. We are fueling jet fighters with jet fuel made \nfrom algae.\n  Both the President and Energy Secretary Chu have said we are in \nAmerica's Sputnik moment. They are absolutely right. Fifty years ago we \nwere in a global space race. Today we are in a global clean energy \nrace. Whichever country takes the most action today to develop and make \nclean energy technologies will dominate the global economy in this \ncentury.\n  That means supporting financing for clean energy and energy \nefficiency projects. It means tax credits for clean energy \nmanufacturing, providing incentives for retrofitting residential and \npublic and commercial buildings. It means supporting basic research and \nkeeping alive initiatives that support clean energy technology \ninnovation. These need to be our priorities as we make energy policy \nand budget decisions.\n  We can pay for these investments by cutting expensive, outdated \nsubsidies for oil companies that are making record profits. There is a \nlot more to be done if we are going to win this global clean energy \nrace, but it is not going to be easy. It means unifying as a country \nand starting to do things differently than we have been doing them.\n  Albert Einstein said:\n\n       We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking \n     we used when we created them.\n\n  I am convinced we can win this race. No other country is better \npositioned. But first people need to understand the stakes. Climate \nchange is real, and failure to address it is bad for our standing in \nthe global economy, bad for the Federal budget, and bad for our \nnational security. We can do better than that for our children and our \ngrandchildren and posterity.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I take that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8594-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8594-S8595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BOILER MACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, there is not the absence of a quorum, but \nI appreciate my colleague mentioning that. I said to him earlier today, \nmaybe yesterday, Senator Franken is a joy to have around here. Some of \nus know he brings a real special touch for trying to infuse some \ncivility into this place again. He came up a year or two ago with the \nidea of a secret Santa exchange. We actually did it this year. I was \nnot going to mention it tonight. My secret Santa turned out to be the \nSenator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, the colleague of the Presiding \nOfficer. She gave me a most wonderful handmade gift that she and her \nstaff created.\n  Delaware is the only State that doesn't have a national park. What \nthey did is they created, on a sheet of paper like this--only it was a \nfirm sheet of paper, not a regular sheet of paper, but they literally--\nthis was the State of Delaware and they created a national park so we \nhave a pop-up national park with a bus going around and our pictures \nriding along in the bus. I don't care what else I get for Christmas, \nthat is going to be the best Christmas present for this year. I don't \nsee how anybody tops that.\n  But that provides not only some civility but also some levity in a \nplace that could use both, so I thank the Senator for all his \ncontributions, but especially that one.\n  On something more serious. What I want to do is talk about the \nregulation EPA has been working on for a while. It is called the boiler \nMACT. The idea is maximum achievable technology here. If you go back in \ntime, go back to about 1990--in 1970, in this country, Congress passed \nand the President signed--Richard Nixon actually signed--the Clean Air \nAct of 1970, a Republican President who had a Republican head of EPA. \nThat was able to be implemented at the time we had the Cuyahoga River \nup in Cleveland, OH, that actually was on fire. There were lots of \nterrible things happening in our environment in this country.\n  Better things started to happen, not just cleaner water, wastewater \ntreatment, and cleaner air, but it led in 1990 to the passage of the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990. One of the requirements of the Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1990 was in that legislation the Congress \ndirected EPA to finalize regulations to reduce what are called air \ntoxics from boilers by the year 2000. So the Clean Air Act was adopted \nin 1970. In 1990, 20 years later, the Clean Air Act Amendments were \nadopted, and in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Congress said: \nEPA, we want you to finalize regulations to reduce air toxics from \nboilers by the year 2000, 10 years.\n  The year 2000 came and went without any action. The Bush \nadministration, George W. Bush administration, finalized a rule. I \nthink it was in the year 2004. But they excluded many industrial \nboilers from having to comply. As it turned out, there are a lot of \nboilers in this country. I was stunned to find out there are about a \nhalf million boilers in this country. A lot of them are fairly small--\nschools or churches or smaller buildings, hospitals. But a bunch of \nthem are pretty good size.\n  In any event, the Bush administration in the year 2004 came up with a \nrule, proposed a rule, but they excluded many industrial boilers from \nhaving to comply. In fact, the rule may not have been just proposed, it \nmight actually have been finalized.\n  But, as a result, the regulation was vacated in 2007, 3 years later, \nby the Circuit Court of Appeals right here in the District of Columbia. \nSo, 2004, EPA\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nfinally gets around to finalizing the rule that they were called to do \nsome 14 years earlier by the Congress. And 3 years later the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals knocks it down and vacates that ruling on boilers.\n  It was not until June of 2010--and that is a full 10 years after the \ncongressional deadline for action--it was not until 2010 that the EPA \nissued a proposal for boiler air toxic rules that addressed all the \nmajor emitters.\n  As with most air pollution regulation these days, EPA was under court \norder to finalize the rule by a set date. The court had said to EPA: We \nwant you to finalize the rule by a set date. That date was the \nbeginning of this year, January of 2011.\n  During the public comment period, the EPA received thousands of \ncomments and new information from, among others, industry. In fact, \nthey received so much in the way of comments and new information, in \nDecember of 2010--that was a month before the date set under the court \norder to finalize the rule--a month before that date was to occur, EPA \nasked the courts, a month before the January 2011 deadline, to extend \nthe deadline for promulgating the final air toxic standards to April of \nnext year, to April of 2012.\n  The courts said: No, don't think so. They said: EPA, you have had \nenough time to finish. They allowed EPA only until January 21 of this \nyear to go ahead and actually promulgate these regulations.\n  Even though EPA didn't have a lot of time to process the comments, \nEPA was able to finalize a rule in February of this year that yielded \nthe same benefits--I think this is pretty interesting--a rule that \nrealized the same benefits in terms of reducing toxic emissions, \nmercury and arsenic, lead, that kind of thing--the same level of \nreductions in those emissions as in the June 2010 proposal that they \nmade, but they cut in half the cost of compliance. That is pretty \nimpressive, isn't it? They cut in half the cost of compliance, got the \nsame amount of reductions in emissions of these air toxic substances \nfor half the cost. However, EPA did not stop there. Wanting to address \nindustry's concerns, the EPA opened public comment yet again to \nconsider a reproposal of their regulations.\n  I know some people think EPA has been guilty of a rush to judgment in \nthis regard. I think if you go through the chronology objectively, this \nis not a rush to judgment. I hope, if nothing else, to convey tonight \nthat the EPA has moved deliberately, some say way too slowly, in order \nto address this. There are others who think way too fast, still too \nfast.\n  Anyway, last month the EPA proposed the boiler MACT regulation to try \nto address stakeholder concerns and I think they have done a workman-\nlike job, a good job. In this new proposal, of the 1\\1/2\\ million \nboilers in the United States, less than 1 percent would be affected--\nless than 1 percent would be affected by these emission limits.\n  I have a chart to show what it looks like. This is a good way to \nactually think of this.\n  The pie represents the 1.5 million boilers in the United States. Some \nare very small, and some are large industrial boilers. Less than 1 \npercent need the technology to meet the emission limits prescribed by \nEPA. That is the red tiny slice here. About another 13 percent of the \n1.5 million boilers in the United States would need to follow best \npractice standards in ensuring that the emissions from those boilers \nare in order. And the rest--1.3 million boilers or a vast majority of \nboilers, a little over 85 percent--are not affected by the rules.\n  Not everybody likes the fact that less than 1 percent of the boilers \nare affected by these rules, and some of our friends in the \nenvironmental community understand that we have been very unhappy with \nhow slowly this whole thing has proceeded.\n  The last thing I want to mention here--maybe two more things--in \nterms of moving from this point forward, how long would these less than \n1 percent have to comply with the regs that have finally been \npromulgated? I am told the sources would have up to 4 years to comply. \nThe EPA is still taking public comment and hopes to finalize this \nregulation by late spring.\n  The bottom line is that we have delayed long enough. Only 1 percent \nof our largest sources will need to clean up. The EPA has certainly \ntried to address many problems--maybe not all the problems but most \nproblems--and they are still taking public comments. I am not sure we \nneed to delay this boiler MACT any further.\n  There are a lot of people who sneeze during the course of their \nlives, as I have just done here on the floor. That was just a \ncoincidence, but a lot of people in this country suffer because of the \nquality of our air. We have made great improvements in cleaning up the \nquality of our air. We still have too many people who suffer from \nasthma and other respiratory diseases. The kinds of problems and \nemissions we are talking about here deal less with asthma and \nrespiratory diseases; we are talking about substances that can kill \npeople. In the case of the substances we are talking about here, they \nhave the ability to kill more than 8,000 people a year.\n  We don't have many large towns in Delaware. In Wilmington, we have \nabout 75,000 people. In Dover--the central part of our State--we have \nabout 30,000 people. And if you take 8,000 people, that is about as \nmany people as live in any of the--well, Newark, where we have the \nUniversity of Delaware, has about 30,000 people. But other than that, \nwe don't have a lot of large towns. For us, 8,000 people could be the \nfourth or fifth largest town in my State. That is a lot of people. At \nthe end of the day, even if these rules are fully implemented, we are \nnot going to save all of those 8,000 people, but a lot of those lives \nwill be saved in the coming years, and we need to do that.\n  We need to let this process go forward and do our dead level best--\nthe EPA has tried to be responsive to concerns that have been raised--\nto provide for a cleaner environment and not to dampen our economic \nrecovery.\n  The last word I would add is that I think the idea that we have to \nchoose one over the other is a false choice. We don't have to do that. \nWe can have a cleaner environment and we can have jobs. If you look at \nthe growth of our Nation's economy since 1970, when the Clean Air Act \nwas adopted, or 1990 when the Clean Air Act amendments were adopted, we \nhave seen dramatic growth in our budget. We have seen growth in our \neconomy, and we have seen the quality of air become a lot cleaner over \nthat period of time. So one does not preclude the other.\n  While some serious concerns have been raised about the earlier \nproposals by the EPA, a lot of those concerns have been addressed. I \nthink we need to get on with it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I think we are going to wrap it up here \naround 7:30, which is in another 10 minutes or so. I am looking around, \nand I don't see anybody else waiting to speak, so I will note the \nabsence of a quorum and bid you good night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HOROHO\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate LTG Patricia \nD. Horoho on becoming the U.S. Army's 43rd Surgeon General. This is a \nmomentous time for military medicine, with two historic firsts for the \nU.S. Army and for the Department of Defense. On December 5, 2011, \nGeneral Horoho became the first woman and the first nurse to assume \ncommand of the U.S. Army's Medical Command. Then, just 2 days later, \nshe became the Army's 43rd Army Surgeon General, making history again \nby becoming the\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nfirst woman and the first nurse in the Department of Defense to be \nsworn in as Surgeon General.\n  Lieutenant General Horoho earned her bachelor of science degree from \nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1982. She received \nher master of science degree as a clinical trauma nurse specialist from \nthe University of Pittsburgh. Her military education includes \ngraduating from the Army's Command and General Staff College and the \nIndustrial College of the Armed Forces, where she earned a second \nmaster of science degree in national resource strategy.\n  Lieutenant General Horoho has earned numerous civilian and military \nawards and recognitions throughout her distinguished career. Her \ncivilian accolades include recognition in 1993 as one of the top 100 \nnurses in the State of North Carolina. She was selected as the USO's \nWoman of the Year in 2009.

Mr. President, today I would like to \ncongratulate the National Guard on 375 years of service.\n  It was on December 13, 1636, in Massachusetts that our Nation's \nmilitary heritage was born. It was the members of the Massachusetts Bay \nColony who stood together and founded an organization to protect and \ndefend the peoples of the Bay Colony. They provided watch to ensure the \nsecurity of their fellow settlers in Massachusetts, and they drilled to \nensure they were prepared to fight if called upon.\n  From these grassroots origins comes today's National Guard: the most \nprepared, best equipped, and most mobile National Guard our Nation--or \nany nation--has ever had. Like the guardsmen of the first days of this \nNation, today's guardsmen continue to answer the call to duty. They \nserve as leaders in our homeland defense response and disaster relief, \nand over the past 10 years, our guardsmen have served with courage and \nhonor in Iraq and Afghanistan, right alongside our Active-Duty Forces. \nThey are fighting on many fronts overseas and fulfilling many different \nmissions.\n  Sometimes they are coming home with devastating injuries. When they \nreturn, these citizen soldiers and airmen face the challenges of \nrecovery, readjustment, and finding jobs. The unemployment rate of \ntoday's National Guard remains well above the national average. To \nensure that we honor the service of these guardsmen and veterans, I \nintroduced the Hire A Hero Act which gives a tax credit to small \nbusinesses that hire veterans and members of the National Guard and \nReserves, and I am pleased to say that the legislation has become law.\n  I have also pushed to ensure that all our National Guardsmen receive \nfair housing allowances. I introduced an amendment included in this \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act that makes certain every \nguardsman who gets deployed will receive the housing allowance they \nneed and deserve. When a guardsman is ordered to Active Duty for a \ncontingency operation, the housing allowance for that guardsman \ncurrently reverts back to his or her home-of-record status rather than \nthe current housing allowance of his or her present duty station, \ndespite any significant loss of income. Basically, guardsmen are being \npunished financially for being deployed to a war zone. My amendment to \nthis year's National Defense Authorization Act will rectify this \ninequity.\n  Also included in this year's National Defense Authorization Act is a \nmonumental provision recognizing the significance of today's National \nGuard. As a 32-year member of the Massachusetts National Guard and a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees, I \nam proud to have cosponsored the amendment to make the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is \na long overdue measure that gives the National Guard the recognition \nand respect that it deserves. I am proud to have supported it, and I \nlook forward to its final passage.\n  Today our National Guardsmen continue the tradition of service begun \nby the militia of 1636, and I want to pay special recognition to the \nguardsmen of the 26th Yankee Brigade serving overseas and to their \nfamilies for their service and sacrifice. Massachusetts's own 26th \nYankee Brigade is currently serving in Afghanistan. When asked, they \nanswered the call to duty. This summer while I was in Afghanistan, I \nwas fortunate enough to see firsthand the selflessness, courage, and \nprofessionalism of ``The Nation's First.'' They are a credit to the \nState of Massachusetts, the National Guard, and to this Nation.\n  Congratulations to the National Guard for its 375 years of service to \nthis Nation and to all the guardsmen who are prepared to support and \ndefend this great Nation in its times of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8596-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8596-S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the House Republicans have sent us a \npayroll tax bill that is more of a political campaign commercial than a \npiece of serious legislation. Extending this tax break for ordinary \nAmericans evidently has been a tough sell in the other body, unlike the \neagerness found there for even more tax relief for the very wealthy. \nAmong the many unrelated, controversial provisions they have attached \nas sweeteners is one that would force the President to approve the \nKeystone XL tar sands oil pipeline. Proponents of this tar sands \nproject provision argue that it belongs on this bill because building \nthe pipeline would create jobs.\n  Any construction project creates jobs. We could create thousands of \njobs by investing in clean solar and wind energy, as the Chinese have \ndone. And people can disagree about building the Keystone Pipeline, but \nthere is a lot more to it than the short-term jobs it would create, and \ntrying to jam it through Congress on this bill in the waning hours of \nthe session is little more than a political stunt.\n  It was about 15 months ago that I first learned about the plan to \nbuild a pipeline to transport crude oil from tar sand strip mines in \nAlberta across the U.S.-Canada border and down through the Midwestern \nUnited States to refineries and ports in Texas.\n  Tar sands are a particularly dirty source of petroleum, from \nextraction to refinement. As I looked into this issue I saw some of the \nphotographs of the boreal forest area where it is extracted, and I was \nshocked. Anyone who is interested in this issue, whether or not you \nthink building the pipeline is a good idea, should look at the \nphotographs. They depict an extraordinarily beautiful landscape that \nhas been ravaged by heavy machinery, vast ponds filled with polluted \nwater and sludge, and a scared wasteland where forests used to be. It \nis one of the more graphic examples of how our collective, insatiable \nthirst for oil has pillaged the fragile environment of this planet. Our \ndemand for fossil fuels will continue to grow exponentially unless we \ncome up with a comprehensive, national energy plan and have the will to \nimplement it.\n  We all know that the extraction of oil, minerals, timber, and other \nnatural resources often harms the environment. But there are degrees of \nharm. Removing the tops of mountains and dumping the refuse in rivers \nand ravines or extracting heavy oil from tar sands are among the most \nenergy intensive and destructive.\n  Under the law, the State Department has the responsibility to approve \nor disapprove the pipeline because it crosses an international \nboundary. More than a year ago, I and 10 other Senators sent a letter \nto the State Department raising concerns about the\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nproposed pipeline and the impact of tar sands oil on global warming and \nasking a number of questions about the Department's decisionmaking \nprocess. Eight months later we received a response, which answered some \nof our questions and raised others.\n  I and other Senators sent two additional letters to the Department \nabout the pipeline, most recently about reports of a possible conflict \nof interest between the contractor that performed the environmental \nreview, Cardno/Entrix, and the energy company, TransCanada.\n  There have also been e-mails indicating a less-than-arm's-length \nrelationship between a State Department official at the U.S. Embassy in \nOttawa and a lobbyist for TransCanada. And a month ago the State \nDepartment's inspector general announced the beginning of an \ninvestigation into whether conflicts of interest tainted the \nenvironmental review process.\n  What began as basic questions and fundamental concerns about the \npipeline has evolved into a significant controversy regarding the \nimpact the pipeline will have upon our Nation's energy policy and \ncontinuing dependence on fossil fuels, the irreversible harm to the \nenvironment and the acceleration of climate change, and the potential \nfor oilspills that could contaminate a key aquifer underlying an area \nof critical agricultural importance that hundreds of thousands of \nmidwesterners depend on for irrigation and drinking water.\n  From the beginning, I have expressed misgivings about the State \nDepartment's ability to conduct a thorough, credible investigation of a \nproject of this complexity that involves issues about which it has \nlimited expertise. There are reports of inexperienced staff handling \nthe lion's share of the work, and it is not surprising that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy have \nraised concerns and identified flaws in the State Department's \nanalysis.\n  It is my impression that the State Department, from the outset, \napproached this with a sense of inevitability. What they did not \nanticipate was the strong reaction of Members of Congress of both \nparties, including several from Midwestern States that have been coping \nwith multiple oilspills from the original Keystone Pipeline that \ncompany officials have treated as inconsequential. They also did not \nanticipate the strong opposition from ordinary Americans who pay close \nattention to environmental and energy policy issues, for whom tar sands \noil is particularly repugnant.\n  Concerns about the consequences of this project have united not only \nthose living along the proposed route but people across the Nation, \nincluding in Vermont, as well as in Canada, who care about the \nenvironment, both in this country and in Canada, and who understand the \nneed to wean our Nation from oil and other fossil fuels and to invest \nin renewables and energy efficiency.\n  Every President since the 1970s has spoken of the need to reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels and particularly foreign oil. But despite \nall the speeches, year after year we are more dependent on these \nfinite, polluting sources of energy than ever before.\n  Today, energy companies are spending staggering amounts of money in \nsearch of new sources of oil and gas in some of the most inhospitable \nplaces on Earth, where its extraction involves great risks to the \npeople involved, the environment, and endangered species. We even send \nour young service men and women halfway around the world to fight wars, \nin part to ensure our continued access to a ready supply of oil. It has \nbecome a national security priority.\n  We have lost valuable time, and there are no quick fixes. No matter \nwhat we do today, later this week, or later this month, this country \nwill be dependent on fossil fuels for many years to come. But simply \nreplacing Middle Eastern oil with Canadian oil without creating new, \ndependable sources of renewable energy and improving efficiency in the \nenergy we use does not alleviate the national security and economic \nrisks associated with a global oil market that is vulnerable to \nmanipulation and disruption.\n  There is also much more we could do to make use of what we have by \nwasting less, improving end-use efficiency, and increasing our use of \nrenewable sources of energy. While TransCanada and its supporters extol \nthe virtues of the Keystone XL Pipeline, as the minority leader and \nothers have done, simply by reducing waste we could eliminate entirely \nthe need for the energy produced from the oil that would flow through \nthe pipeline.\n  I come from a State that shares a border with Canada. My wife's \nfamily is Canadian. I have a great fondness for that ``giant to the \nnorth.'' But this issue is not about U.S. relations with Canada. We are \ninseparable neighbors, friends, and allies. There are strong views \nabout this pipeline, pro and con, in both countries. As Americans, we \nhave to do what is right for our country's energy future, for the \nenvironment, for our citizens.\n  Some have argued that if this pipeline is not built, TransCanada will \nsimply build a pipeline to the coast of British Columbia and export the \noil to China. But there are significant obstacles and no indication \nthat such an alternative route is a viable option. Others maintain that \nthe carbon emissions from extracting and refining this oil would not \nappreciably exceed those from oil shipped by tanker from the Middle \nEast, but they do not address the environmental harm and pollution \ncaused by the strip mining and separation process.\n  TransCanada has flooded the media with dire warnings about the \nAmerican jobs that will be lost if the pipeline is rejected, which our \nRepublican friends have echoed, trying to turn this into a campaign \nissue. But most of these are construction jobs that will disappear once \nthe pipeline is built. And the choice is not between jobs or no jobs. \nThey do not mention the tens or hundreds of thousands of American jobs \nthat could be created by investing in other cleaner, renewable sources \nof energy, which, unlike tar sands oil, will not be used up in a few \nshort decades.\n  Last month, in response to concerns about the sensitive and crucial \naquifer that the pipeline would traverse in the Midwest, the White \nHouse announced that the State Department will consider alternative \nroutes through Nebraska and that this would delay a decision on the \npipeline until 2013. This is positive, but it ignores the many other \nreasons to reject this project altogether.\n  It is my hope that on further reflection, the President will treat \nthe debate over the Keystone XL Pipeline as an opportunity to draw a \nline between our past and future energy policies.\n  Fossil fuels are finite, inefficient, and dirty. The cost we pay at \nthe gas pump bears no resemblance to the long-term environmental and \nhealth costs borne by society as a whole.\n  We cannot lessen our reliance on fossil fuels by simply talking about \nit. We cannot do it by putting our goals for a better future under the \npillow and leaving any real action to future generations. We cannot do \nit by hoping that a scientific genius will suddenly discover an \nunlimited source of energy that costs pennies and does not pollute, nor \nshould we do it by spending huge amounts of money, time, talent and \nAmerican ingenuity to search the farthest reaches of the globe for \nevery last drop of oil, regardless of how dangerous or harmful to the \nenvironment.\n  Will the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline have the cataclysmic \nconsequences that some of its opponents predict? No one can say for \nsure. If anyone had asked officials at British Petroleum on April 9, \n2010, about the probability of a disaster like the one that occurred \nthe next day when the Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, \nthey likely would have dismissed it as farfetched. It turns out they \nwere violating multiple safety regulations.\n  Are we going to change the pipeline's route to avoid the aquifer, \nonly to continue to act as if global warming is nothing to worry about, \nthat we can continue to burn more and more fossil fuels, emitting more \nand more carbon into the atmosphere, and destroying the landscape while \nwe are at it?\n  This pipeline would perpetuate a costly dependence that has gone on \nfor a century, for which we all share in the blame. Keystone XL would \nonce again do nothing to address the problems associated with fossil \nfuels. It would virtually assure more oilspills, it would do nothing to \npromote conservation and reduce waste, and it would do\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nnothing to spur investment in clean energy alternatives.\n  Most important, it would provide yet another excuse for once again \npunting the urgent, national security imperative of developing a \nsustainable energy policy for this country. That is what the decision \nabout the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline has come to represent \nregardless of what route it takes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8598-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING GOLDEN VALLEY, MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Mr. Chavez died on \nNovember 30, 2011, of injuries sustained in a car accident outside of \nWest High School in Denver, CO. He was 63 years old.\n  Mr. Chavez was a true community leader in every sense of the word. \nAfter graduating from Denver's West High School in 1967, Mr. Chavez \nspent the next 30 years of his life giving back to the school through \nteaching, coaching, and counseling. He was always there for his \nstudents, so much so that after retiring, he came back to volunteer \ncoach for the wrestling team beside his son, Gil Junior, the current \nhead coach at West. Mr. Chavez's family continues his legacy of always \nstriving for excellence in all that they endeavor.\n  Gil Chavez was a committed educator and coach who was a role model to \nthe students he worked with. He was a sincere motivator, and he backed \nup his words with promises that he kept to his students. Mr. Chavez was \nalways there for those who needed him with an ear to listen, with help \nfiguring out classes or locating a tutor, and always believing in those \nwho needed it most.\n  To Mr. Chavez's entire family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must \nbe feeling.

VOIGT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to praise an \nexceptional man, COL William M. Voigt.\n  Colonel Voigt has been one of the foremost civil and military leaders \nin Birmingham and in my State of Alabama for around a half century now. \nI was proud to join Colonel Voigt recently in Birmingham when he \naccepted his well-deserved award as the 2011 National Veteran of the \nYear.\n  I have had the pleasure to know Bill personally for many years and to \nobserve his devotion to his country. His patriotism is unsurpassed.\n  Colonel Voigt served his country with 30 years in the Alabama Air \nNational Guard and another 5 years of service with the U.S. Air Force \nReserve. He has achieved not only a bachelor of science in business \nadministration from Auburn University and a master's in business \nadministration from the University of Alabama in Birmingham but has \nalso graduated from the Air War College, the Industrial College of the \nArmed Forces, the Air Command and Staff College, and the Squadron \nOfficer School.\n  In addition to his own education, COL Bill Voigt has given his time \nand efforts to an impressive and exhaustive list of nonprofits and \nservice organizations. On top of this, he has served for over 20 years \nas the president of the National Veterans Day organization.\n  Birmingham is the birthplace of Veterans Day. The very first Veterans \nDay celebration was held in Birmingham by this very organization in \n1947. It was only in 1954, 7 years later, that Congress agreed to the \nvalue of this wonderful event and made Veterans Day the national \nholiday it is today.\n  The Birmingham National Veterans Day celebration is believed to be \nnot only the oldest but also the largest in the country. The day \nincludes a parade and a large awards dinner. The entire effort is a \nmonumental planning exercise. For 20 years Bill Voigt made it happen.\n  This year's dinner was a very special one. The organization's \npresident, James A. Holt, Congressman Spencer Bachus, Congresswoman \nTerri Sewell, and others took part in the excellent program. I was \nhonored to be a part of the program also. The superb keynote speaker \nwas RADM Tom Steffens (retired), a U.S. Navy SEAL for 34 years. It was \na special program indeed, but the remarks all revolved around Colonel \nVoigt. I know he and his wonderful family were most proud.\n  Colonel Voigt represents the model for the type of person we should \npush our youth to emulate. He is a man who has proven time and time \nagain that he is willing to serve his country, his community, and his \nfellow veterans who have fought for the ideals and goals of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to this great man and by \nextension this wonderful annual Veterans Day event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8598-4", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

The Baldrige Award is the only formal recognition of the \nperformance excellence of both public and private U.S. organizations \ngiven by the President of the United States. Southcentral Foundation is \nthe Alaska's first health care organization to receive this award.\n  Southcentral Foundation was established in 1982 to improve the health \nand social conditions of Alaska Native and American Indian people, \nenhance culture, and empower individuals and families to take charge of \ntheir lives. They employ over 1,500 people, of which 53 percent are \nAlaska Natives or American Indians. As mayor of Anchorage and now as \nSenator, I watched the growth of this excellent nonprofit from a small \noutpatient facility to a beautiful, culturally designed campus \nencompassing many buildings to serve their customer-owners.\n  Southcentral Foundation's innovative Nuka system of care combines \nmedical, dental, behavioral, and traditional practices and creates \nrelationships that focus on supporting wellness instead of just \ntreating illness. This system has received national and international \nattention for its successes in health outcomes, operational \nefficiencies, and customer and employee satisfaction. It is a truly \nexemplary health care system that is one of the best in the country.\n  The award will be presented by President Barack Obama in April, \n2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8598-5", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8598-S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN RECOGNITION OF MR. BILL VANDERWENDE AND MR. DAVE BAKER\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. \nWilliam ``Bill'' Vanderwende and Mr. David ``Dave'' Baker for their \nleadership, vision and commitment to Delaware's agriculture\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\ncommunity through their roles as Chairman and Vice-Chairman, \nrespectively, of the Delaware Nutrient Management Commission. Both have \ndedicated their lives to Delaware and its farming communities, \nbenefitting and protecting the farming industry and the thousands of \nfarmers and citizens who rely on our state's priceless natural \nresources.\n  As the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the 19-member Delaware Nutrient \nManagement Commission since its inception in 1999, Bill and Dave have \nled the Commission through years of development--made up of innovation, \nlabor and compromise--that resulted in Delaware's premier Nutrient \nManagement Program--one that serves as a model for other States. \nMoreover, Bill and Dave helped guide Delaware through U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency approval of the State's controlled \nanimal feeding operation regulations, helping to preserve our State's \nrich agricultural resources, while protecting farmers and their \nlivelihood for generations to come. When I was Governor of the State of \nDelaware, I worked closely with both Bill and Dave on the development \nof the Delaware Nutrient Management Program and know well their passion \nand loyalty to doing what is right for the First State's agricultural \ncommunity, as well as for our environment and our neighbors' \nenvironments.\n  The Delaware Nutrient Management Program was established in June 1999 \nas a result of the Delaware Nutrient Management Law. The mission of the \nDelaware Nutrient Management Program is to manage those activities \ninvolving the generation and application of nutrients in order to help \nmaintain and improve the quality of Delaware's ground and surface \nwaters and to help meet or exceed federally mandated water quality \nstandards, in the interest of the overall public welfare. The \nresponsibilities of the Delaware Nutrient Management Commission \ninclude: considering the establishment of critical areas for voluntary \nand regulatory programs; establishing Best Management Practices to \nreduce nutrients in the environment; developing educational and \nawareness programs; considering incentive programs to redistribute \nexcess nutrients; establishing the elements and general direction of \nthe State Nutrient Management Program; and, developing nutrient \nmanagement regulations.\n  In 2001, under the team's leadership, the Delaware Nutrient \nManagement Commission outlined a Memorandum of Understanding with the \nDelaware Department of Agriculture, the Delaware Department of Natural \nResources and Environmental Control, and the chief executives of all \npoultry companies operating in Delaware--an agreement that was the \nfirst of its kind. This unique partnership between the agriculture and \nenvironmental sectors in Delaware has helped contribute to the progress \nDelaware has achieved in nutrient management. Currently, the First \nState leads the nation in nutrient management planning participation. \nNinety-nine percent of all farmers who are required to have a nutrient \nmanagement plan do, indeed, have one.\n  The Delaware Nutrient Management Commission's strong working \nrelationships with the Delaware Department of Agriculture, the Delaware \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Delaware's Congressional delegation, \nand with Delaware's Governor and the State's General Assembly has \ncontributed to the implementation of on-the-ground solutions for \nnutrient management that encourage environmental stewardship and have \npositive benefits to agriculture and its farmers.\n  A native of Harrington, DE, Bill Vanderwende is a man of family, \nfaith and farming and serves as a proud, life-long member of Delaware's \nfarming tradition. For over 40 years, Bill and Ellen--his wife of \nalmost 60 years--along with their 4 children, 10 grandchildren and \nseveral employees, have run a dairy, grain and vegetable farming \noperation in Bridgeville with 700 head of dairy and 3,000 crop acres. \nBill has represented Delaware's dairy industry for decades.\n  Bill's leadership in the agricultural community stretches beyond the \nNutrient Management Commission. Bill has been a distinguished member of \nthe Sussex County Conservation District Board of Supervisors for 20 \nyears, serving as chairman since 1992. In addition, Bill served as a \nmember of the Governor's Advisory Council on Agriculture, a member of \nthe Governor's Advisory Council on Soil and Water, and as Vice-Chairman \nof Delaware Aglands Preservation Foundation Board of Trustees. Bill and \nthe Vanderwende family have also received numerous awards recognizing \ntheir positive impact and influence on Delaware's farming tradition, \nincluding Bill's honor as the recipient of the 2009 Secretary's Award \nfor Distinguished Service to Agriculture given by the Delaware \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Vanderwendes' 1993 Farm Bureau award \nfor the Farm Family of the Year.\n  Over the years, Dave Baker has made a remarkable contribution to \nDelaware's agricultural community through his work, leadership and \nthoughtful attention to detail. His commitment to Delaware's and our \nnation's farmlands, as well as his commitment to his family and \ncommunity is unmistakable. Since moving to Middletown, DE in 1952, Dave \nBaker has remained close to his roots. Today, just outside of his \nhometown, Dave lives with his wife Barbara. Together, they have a son \nErik and two grandchildren. There, Dave is the President of Baker \nFarms, a 3,000-acre grain farm. He also founded Delaware Egg Farm--now \nPuglisi Egg Farms Delaware--Delaware's largest egg producing operation.\n  In addition to his role of Vice-Chairman of the Delaware Nutrient \nManagement Commission, Dave is Chairman of the Commission's Planning \nand Personnel subcommittees. Moreover, Dave's agricultural acumen and \noutstanding leadership in the field of agriculture has been recognized \nin Delaware and well beyond our borders. Most recently, he received the \n2010 Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service to Agriculture given \nby the Delaware Department of Agriculture. During my term as Governor, \nDave was the Chairman of the Nutrient Management Advisory Committee, \nthe organization responsible for drafting Delaware's ground breaking \nnutrient management statute. He is also a past president of the \nDelaware Council of Farm Organizations. Nationally, he has served on \nthe American Egg Board and the Poultry Advisory Committee for the Farm \nBureau, and regionally, he is a past chair of the Egg Clearinghouse and \nthe Northeast United Egg Producers.\n  Delaware is fortunate to have such an outstanding team led by Bill \nVanderwende and Dave Baker to carry on a legacy of farming values that \nshape, honor and preserve our State's treasured agricultural heritage. \nBill and Dave's leadership on the Nutrient Management Commission \nreaches those not just in our agricultural community, not just in our \nState, but the millions of Americans who are impacted by Delaware's \ndecisions on nutrient management. The continued leadership of these two \nmen will keep our farming industry prosperous, while protecting our \nnatural resources for generations to come. It is with a genuine sense \nof honor and pride that I rise today to extend the heartfelt \ncongratulations and thanks of our entire Congressional delegation to \nour friends and outstanding Delaware residents, Bill Vanderwende and \nDave Baker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8599-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8599-S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING ORONO MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I commend Orono Middle \nSchool of Orono, ME, on being named a 2011 National Blue Ribbon School \nof Excellence. This prestigious recognition of high accomplishment was \nbestowed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award is considered the \nhighest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for \nthis national recognition reflect the goals of our Nation's education \nreforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue \nRibbon Schools Program is designed to honor public and private schools \nthat are either academically superior in their States or that \ndemonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement.\n  This award recognizes that Orono Middle School students achieve at \nthe highest level academically. Orono Middle School is a top-performing \nschool\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\non State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments \nthroughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing \ninstruction. The school also involves students in extracurricular \nactivities, which helps forge a strong school community where students \nare connected and encouraged to pursue their interests.\n  I applaud not only the students but also the teachers, staff, \nadministrators, and parents of Orono Middle School. Together, they are \nsucceeding in their mission to generate confidence and momentum for \nlearning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, \nhelping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible \nlearners and citizens.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Orono \nMiddle School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the \nentire community for this outstanding achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8600-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING COOL AS A MOOSE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, across the country the holiday \nshopping season is in full swing. For many, holiday shopping can be a \nstressful time, as picking out the ideal gift can often be \noverwhelming. Luckily, my home State of Maine has several small \nbusinesses which offer gift solutions in a fun and festive setting. \nToday I wish to commend and recognize one of these small businesses, \nCool As A Moose, whose retail stores offer unique and creative gifts \nfor the holiday season and throughout the year.\n  Cool As A Moose first opened its doors in 1986 in the coastal town of \nBar Harbor. Whether a customer longs for a moose hat or an adorable \nstuffed animal lobster, this small business offers customers an array \nof clever products and creative apparel. The company, now owned by \nMaine resident Kip Stone, has expanded to include stores in Freeport, \nPortland, and most recently Brunswick. The retailer also has an online \npresence and two licensed locations in Halifax and Quebec City, Canada.\n  The establishment of a store and headquarters in Brunswick this past \nMay was critical, as it brought jobs to an area of Maine that recently \nstruggled after the closure of the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Kip's \ntireless search for an ideal location lasted 2 years, as he sought to \nfind an environment that would allow him to open both a store and have \nspace for his other company, Artforms, which supplies many of the \ndesigns for the retail store. Kip selected the Old Grand City \nrestaurant and storefront for the flagship store. With this purchase \nand renovation, Kip furthered a critical mission by helping to \nrevitalize the Brunswick downtown area.\n  As can be seen from this small company's expansion, since its \nfounding, this store's friendly customer service and engaging \natmosphere have led to tremendous success. Most recently, Cool As A \nMoose was honored as the 2011 Merchant of the Year by the Maine \nMerchants Association. This honor is richly deserved as this small \nbusiness consistently strives to improve each community it serves \nthrough volunteering and supporting area non-profits.\n  Small businesses such as Cool As A Moose are the heart of the \neconomy, and this holiday season I hope Americans will gather with me \nin supporting these retailers. In these tough economic times, this \nsmall firm's willingness to expand and continually strive to put local \ncommunities first is especially refreshing. I am proud to extend my \ncongratulations to Kip Stone and everyone at Cool As A Moose for their \ntremendous efforts and offer my best wishes for continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8600-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO OFFICER JAMES BONNEAU\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nLevin, I wish to pay tribute to James ``Jim'' Bonneau, a member of the \nJackson Police Department in Jackson, MI, who has been posthumously \nawarded the Congressional Badge of Bravery.\n  Officer Bonneau was born in Canton, MI to Marc and Amy Bonneau. \nGrowing up he always wanted to help others and become a police officer. \nAfter graduating from Canton High in 2002, he earned a degree in \ncriminal justice from Eastern Michigan University. In 2007, he followed \nhis dream and joined the Jackson Police Department, which put him \nthrough Lansing Community College's Mid-Michigan Police Academy.\n  Bonneau excelled at the academy and graduated at the top of his \nclass. He was well liked by the faculty and his fellow classmates. Even \nthough he was with the department for two short years, his excellence \non the job and connection with the community he served made a \ndifference and touched many lives.\n  On March 9, 2010, Officer Bonneau and Blackman Township Public Safety \nOfficer Darin McIntosh responded to a domestic disturbance call. The \nsuspect fired multiple shots at both officers wounding Officer Bonneau \nin the chest and Officer McIntosh in the leg. Though mortally wounded, \nOfficer Bonneau showed bravery and determination while he relayed \ncritical information to central dispatch regarding the incident. His \nactions ensured that the responding officers knew what to expect upon \nentering the home. Tragically, he later died from his injuries.\n  Officer Bonneau's exceptional acts of bravery and presence of mind \nwhile in the line of duty earned him a well-deserved nomination and \naward of the State and Local Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of \nBravery.\n  On behalf of the City of Jackson and the State of Michigan, we \nexpress our gratitude to Officer Bonneau and his family for his bravery \nand commitment to law enforcement. He made the ultimate sacrifice so \nthat others may live in safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/14/senate-section/article/S8600-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8600-S8601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3630.

A bill to require the Transportation Security Administration \nto comply with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \nRights Act; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould guarantee the jobs of Transportation Service Officers, TSO, who \nare called to active military duty, putting them on the same playing \nfield as every other civilian employee called up to serve their nation \nin the uniformed services in times of need.\n  I want to thank my cosponsors for their support of this measure, \nincluding my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Richard Blumenthal, \nand the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Susan Collins. Other cosponsors include \nSenators Burr, Akaka, Tester and Landrieu.\n  This is a very simple and straightforward bill that would close a \nloophole in the law that leaves Transportation Security Officers called \nto full time military service vulnerable to dismissal from their jobs \nupon return to civilian life.\n  The jobs of all other non-military public and private sector \nemployees called up to active duty are protected under the Uniformed \nServices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, USERRA. USERRA \nentitles a reservist, a member of the National Guard, or a veteran who \nis called to duty to return to their civilian jobs once their service \nis complete. The service member must meet certain, basic requirements, \nsuch as providing advance notice to their employer of their impending \nservice and missing no more than 5 years of work under any one employer \ndue to their service.\n  According to the law itself, the purpose of USERRA is to ``encourage \nnon-career service in the uniformed services by eliminating or \nminimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which \ncan result from such service.''\n  The law also minimizes the disruption to those who are called up to \nservice by providing for their prompt reemployment when they return to \ncivilian life and protects them from discrimination based on their \nactive duty in the uniformed services.\n  This is simple fairness to those with the courage, determination, and \nlove of country to serve in the uniformed services beyond any required \nservice or normal tour of duty, and certainly at an age older than most \nsoldiers.\n  TSOs, however, are not statutorily protected against dismissal from \ntheir jobs upon return from military service. In the aftermath of 9/11, \nwhen Congress moved with lightening speed to strengthen the safety of \nair travel, we provided the Transportation Security Administration with \nthe broad authority it would need to hire and deploy\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\ntens of thousands of new workers in a matter of weeks. TSOs became a \nselect category of federal employees who were considered vital to \nthe national security, and because of the unusual circumstances and \nbroad authority given to TSA, they were exempted from many labor laws.\n\n  The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, ATSA, passed in \nNovember 2001, gives the TSA Administrator authority over all terms and \nconditions of a TSO's employment. Specifically, Section 111(d) of ATSA \nstates: ``notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nUndersecretary for Transportation Security may employ, appoint, \ndiscipline, terminate, and fix terms and conditions of employment . . . \nas the Undersecretary determines to be necessary.''\n  The Transportation Security Administration employs 3,500 reservists \nand another 15,000 veterans. The agency frequently recruits veterans, \nreservists, and members of the National Guard and benefits from their \nemployment. We should make it easier for TSA to attract the best and \nbrightest to its ranks, by ensuring these men and women have the job \nprotections they need and deserve.\n  TSA has said that it complies administratively and voluntarily with \nUSERRA. But without the force of law, reservists and National Guard \nmembers cannot count on redress if they believe TSA has violated \nUSERRA.\n  According to The Veterans of Foreign Wars, at least two TSOs so far \nhave tried to appeal TSA actions based on perceived violations of \nUSERRA. Both were thwarted in their efforts when the Office of Special \nCounsel and the Merit System Protection Board ruled that Section 111(d) \nof ATSA bars TSOs from USERRA coverage.\n  TSOs find themselves in a clearly unjust and inadvertent position. \nTherefore, the legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today \nwould simply require TSA to comply with USERRA, providing TSOs the \nstatutory protection of reemployment to which every other type of \nworker, in the private or public sectors, is eligible.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support to right this unintentional \nwrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CREATING AN OFFICIAL RECORD OF THE OSAMA BIN LADEN \n                   OPERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed \n     terrorist leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a \n     targeted strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad, \n     Pakistan.\n       (2) Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda \n     terrorist organization, the most significant terrorism threat \n     to the United States and the international community.\n       (3) Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks \n     which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, 2001, \n     the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in which \n     al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them \n     into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in \n     Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by civilian \n     passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near Shanksville, \n     Pennsylvania.\n       (4) Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other \n     deadly terrorist attacks\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\n     against the United States and its allies, including the 1998 \n     bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and \n     the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and against \n     innocent civilians in countries around the world, including \n     the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the \n     2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London, England.\n       (5) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \n     the United States, under President George W. Bush, led an \n     international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al \n     Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned \n     areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama bin Laden \n     to justice.\n       (6) President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional \n     forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan \n     as ``the central front in our enduring struggle against \n     terrorism and extremism''.\n       (7) The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its \n     affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world.\n       (8) The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence \n     community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous \n     dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism.\n       (9) The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and \n     the intelligence community prompted the Director of National \n     Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, ``Never have I \n     seen a more remarkable example of focused integration, \n     seamless collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence \n     as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the \n     ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.''.\n       (10) While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a \n     significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its \n     affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, \n     terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national \n     security.\n       (11) President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin \n     Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has \n     continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends \n     and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant \n     achievement to date in our Nation's effort to defeat al \n     Qaeda.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the \n     best of the intelligence community's capabilities and \n     teamwork;\n       (2) for years to come, Americans will look back at this \n     event as a defining point in the history of the United \n     States;\n       (3) it is vitally important that the United States \n     memorialize all the events that led to the raid so that \n     future generations will have an official record of the events \n     that transpired before, during, and as a result of the \n     operation; and\n       (4) preserving this history now will allow the United \n     States to have an accurate account of the events while those \n     that participated in the events are still serving in the \n     Government.\n       (c) Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden.--\n     Not later than 90 days after the completion of the report \n     being prepared by the Center for the Study of Intelligence \n     that documents the history of and lessons learned from the \n     raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, the \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit such \n     report to the congressional intelligence committees.\n       (d) Preservation of Records.--The Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency shall preserve any records, including \n     intelligence information and assessments, used to generate \n     the report described in subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 415.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 161.\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1892) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2012 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today in \nsupport of the Senate's passage of the Intelligence Authorization Act \nof Fiscal Year 2012. I understand that the House of Representatives \nintends to consider this legislation on the suspension calendar later \nthis week, so it should be enacted prior to the end of this session.\n  This will be the third time in less than 15 months that the Congress \nwill enact an intelligence authorization bill--including bills for \nfiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012--after a 6 year hiatus in passing \nsuch legislation. What this means is that Congress, through the Senate \nand House Intelligence Committees, is restoring oversight over the \nintelligence community and fulfilling our responsibility to thoroughly \nexamine intelligence policies and budgets.\n  Unlike the last two authorization bills, this bill was completed \ncontemporaneously with, instead of after, the appropriations process \nthat funds intelligence efforts. The classified annex to this \nlegislation authorizes appropriations for intelligence activities and \nhas helped guide the work of the appropriations committees as they \nconsidered intelligence spending. The days when the intelligence \ncommunity can bypass the intelligence committees and deal solely with \nthe appropriations committees are over.\n  Since receiving the President's budget request for the intelligence \ncommunity in February, the Intelligence Committee has recognized that \nthe massive increase in intelligence spending over the past decade has \ncome to an end. Our original bill, reported to the Senate in August of \nthis year, reduced intelligence spending below the President's request. \nSince then, we have worked closely with the House Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the executive \nbranch to reflect the spending reductions set in the Budget Control Act \nof 2011. The legislation we are approving today keeps funding for \nintelligence essentially flat from fiscal year 2011, representing the a \nmeaningful reduction from the President's request.\n  As we look to 2013, many more difficult decisions will need to be \nmade to make further reductions to intelligence spending. It is my \nbelief that real reductions in intelligence spending can be \naccomplished without sacrificing capability, but this will require a \nrigorous review and the executive branch being more forthcoming than it \nhas been to date about where it believes cuts are possible.\n  Of course, the bill also provides significant legislative provisions \nto give the intelligence community the authorities and flexibilities it \nneeds to continue protecting our national security and providing \npolicymakers the information they need to make foreign policy and \nsecurity decisions; and other provisions for the effective and \nappropriate functioning of our intelligence apparatus.\n  I note that passage of the last intelligence authorization bill \noccurred shortly after the strike leading to the death of Usama bin \nLaden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Since then, the intelligence community \nhas had continued success in tracking and removing terrorist threats to \nthe United States. Senior leaders and commanders of al-Qaida, including \nall of its affiliate groups as well as militant organizations involved \nin the Afghan war, have been removed from the fight, and terrorist \nplots and plotting have been disrupted. Among them, a plot to kill the \nSaudi Ambassador to the United States was thwarted due to the skillful \nand cooperative efforts of the FBI, DEA, CIA, and others.\n  Intelligence has factored into significant policy decisions and U.S. \nactions, including with respect to interdicting the proliferation of \nweapons, setting economic sanctions, protecting ISAF forces in \nAfghanistan, blocking cyber attacks against our government and certain \ncritical infrastructure companies, and contributing to the NATO effort \nin Libya.\n  It is my hope that the provisions in this bill will continue to aid \nthe intelligence community as it conducts its missions; ensure better \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars; and support its thousands of civilians \nand military employees.\n  Among other things, this bill includes: A section that provides for \nburial allowances for intelligence employees killed in the line of \nduty, similar to those for members of the U.S. military; New \nprocurement authorities that enable intelligence agencies to protect \nagainst supply chain risk to information technologies; a measure \nauthorizing new accounts at the Department of Treasury that will enable \ndefense intelligence agencies to become financially auditable; \nProvisions that strengthen congressional oversight of the transfer of \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay; a section that will improve the accuracy \nof intelligence community cost estimates; and Provisions that provide \nthe Director of National Intelligence with needed personnel management \nauthorities.\n  As I noted, the bill contains a 275-page classified schedule and \nannex that authorizes intelligence funding and implements the \ncommittee's oversight findings over the past year. That annex is \navailable to all Senators in the intelligence committee's offices.\n  Mr. President, let me note my sincere appreciation for the close \ncollaboration of Senator Chambliss, the vice chairman of the committee, \nthroughout the legislative process. He and his staff--in particular \nMartha Scott Poindexter and Jacqueline Russell--have continued the \nbipartisan approach that the committee followed in the last Congress, \nand we have together agreed to every provision in the bill.\n  As can be imagined, it has taken enormous effort to produce a third \nbill in such a short time frame. I sincerely thank the efforts of the \nstaff to review the President's requested funding levels and \nlegislative provisions, to draft legislation, and to negotiate a final \nproduct. In particular, I thank Lorenzo Goco, the Deputy Staff Director \nwho has overseen the legislative efforts, Michael Davidson, the general \ncounsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee until this past Labor Day, \nand Christine Healey, who has carried the load of the legislative work \nthroughout and who replaced Mr. Davidson as general counsel. I also \nextend my appreciation for the work of Eric Losick and Mike Buchwald, \nmajority counsel on the Committee, and Jack Livingston and Kathleen \nRice, the minority counsel.\n  Similarly, the Committee's budget staff has worked diligently and \nexpertly in their preparation of the classified annex to this bill and \nin working with intelligence agencies to understand and guide their \nefforts. I thank the committee's budget director, Peggy Evans, and the \nbudget staff through this period: Hayden Milberg, Randy Bookout, Andrew \nKerr, John Dickas, Paul Matulic, Matt Pollard, Amy Hopkins, Jamal Ware, \nIram Ali, Jeffrey Howard, Andy Grotto, Jim Smythers, Brian Miller, Eric \nChapman, John Maguire, Tyler Stephens, Evan Gottesman, Brian Walsh, \nRyan Tully, and Christian Cook.\n  I also appreciate the work and relationship with Chairman Rogers and \nRanking Member Ruppersberger of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence. The version of the legislation approved today builds on \nthe House legislation, and our two committees have consulted closely \nthroughout this process. We held a joint open hearing on the tenth \nanniversary of the September 11, 2011, attacks and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work together next year to enact the fiscal year 2013 \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  Let me also note my appreciation for two other Senate committees. The \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has closely followed our \nauthorizations as it drafted its appropriations bill. This underscores \nthe work done in our bill, and limits to a minimum the cases where the \nauthorization and appropriations levels do not match.\n  We have also worked over the past week with the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to include language in the classified annex to this bill \nconcerning the Military Intelligence Program and a military \nconstruction program authorized for the National Security\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nAgency. The Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee \nboth exercise jurisdiction over military construction projects with \nintelligence funding; in this instance, the two committees have both \nincluded authorizations for the High Performance Computing Center II, \nand have jointly agreed to the language included in this annex.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note that while there is no committee \nreport or conference report associated with the text that we are \napproving today, the Intelligence Committee issued a report to \naccompany the bill it reported to the Senate in August. As the \nlegislation has changed since House passage of its authorization bill \nand consideration today of this amendment, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a section-by-section analysis of the \nlegislation so as to provide for the legislative history needed to \nexplain the authors' intent and better clarify the effects of the \nprovisions included.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       For purposes of the legislative history of the Intelligence \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the Managers \n     Amendment we will pass today is an amendment in the nature of \n     a substitute to H.R. 1892. In large measure, the legislative \n     text of H.R. 1892 and this Managers Amendment follows the \n     legislative text of S. 1458, reported from the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence on August 1, 2011, Report No. 112-\n     43. The Managers Amendment also includes a classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations and annex; this is a modified \n     version of the classified Schedule and annex that were passed \n     by the House of Representatives. They have been made \n     available to the Executive Branch and appropriate \n     congressional committees. The report language in the annex \n     should be understood to represent congressional intent where \n     reference is made to the Committee.\n\n              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation\n\n\n              Title I--Budget and Personnel Authorizations\n\n     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments, \n     agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes \n     appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities for Fiscal Year 2012.\n     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations\n       Section 102(a) provides that the details of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel \n     levels for Fiscal Year 2012 are contained in the classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified Schedule \n     of Authorizations shall be made available to the Committees \n     on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives \n     and to the President. Section 102(b) provides that the \n     President shall not publicly disclose the classified Schedule \n     except as provided in Section 601(a) of the Implementing \n     Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; to the \n     extent necessary to implement the budget; or as otherwise \n     required by law. Section 102(c) authorizes the Director of \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to expend funds \n     authorized in the Act for a purpose further described in the \n     classified annex.\n     Section 103. Personnel Ceiling Adjustments\n       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility \n     to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in managing \n     the civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community. Section \n     103(a) provides that the DNI may authorize employment of \n     civilian personnel (expressed as full-time equivalent \n     positions) in Fiscal Year 2012 in excess of the number of \n     authorized full-time equivalent positions by an amount not \n     exceeding 3 percent of the total limit applicable to each IC \n     element under Section 102. The DNI may do so only if \n     necessary to the performance of important intelligence \n     functions.\n       Section 103(b) provides additional flexibility when the \n     heads of Intelligence Community elements determine that work \n     currently performed by contract personnel should be performed \n     by government employees. It does so by authorizing the DNI to \n     authorize employment of additional full-time equivalent \n     personnel in a number equal to the number of full-time \n     equivalent contract personnel currently performing that work. \n     Under this section, any exercise of this authority should be \n     implemented in accordance with a plan that includes adequate \n     support for personnel. It is intended that the exercise of \n     this authority should result in an actual reduction of the \n     number of contract personnel and not a shift of resources to \n     hire other contract personnel.\n       The DNI must report the decision to allow an Intelligence \n     Community element to exceed the personnel ceiling or to \n     convert contract personnel under Section 103(a) and (b) in \n     advance to the congressional intelligence committees.\n       During consideration of the Fiscal Year 2008 request, the \n     congressional intelligence committees learned that practices \n     within different elements of the Intelligence Community on \n     the counting of personnel with respect to legislatively-fixed \n     ceilings were inconsistent, and included not counting certain \n     personnel at all against personnel ceilings. The committees \n     requested that the Intelligence Community Chief Human Capital \n     Officer ensure that by the beginning of Fiscal Year 2010 \n     there would be a uniform and accurate method of counting all \n     Intelligence Community employees under a system of personnel \n     levels expressed as full-time equivalents. The committees \n     also expressed their view that the DNI express the personnel \n     levels for civilian employees of the Intelligence Community \n     as full-time equivalent positions in the congressional budget \n     justifications for Fiscal Year 2010. The DNI has done so. In \n     addition, the DNI has issued a policy to ensure a uniform \n     method for counting Intelligence Community employees. \n     Subsection (c) confirms in statute the obligation of the DNI \n     to establish these guidelines.\n     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account\n       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence \n     Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the \n     authorized full-time equivalent personnel levels for the \n     elements within the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2012.\n       Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations of $576,393,000 \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 for the activities of the ICMA. \n     Subsection (b) authorizes 777 full-time or full-time \n     equivalent personnel for elements within the ICMA for Fiscal \n     Year 2012 and provides that such personnel may be permanent \n     employees of the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence (ODNI) or detailed from other elements of the \n     United States Government.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes additional appropriations and \n     full-time equivalent personnel for the classified Community \n     Management Account as specified in the classified Schedule of \n     Authorizations and permits the funding for advanced research \n     and development to remain available through September 30, \n     2013.\n\n\n Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of \n     $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2012 for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability Fund. For \n     Fiscal Year 2011, Congress authorized $292,000,000. While \n     that level was consistent with prior authorizations, it did \n     not fully fund, as prior authorizations had not fully funded, \n     the obligations of the Fund. The Fiscal Year 2012 increase is \n     based on the Administration's determination, which the \n     congressional intelligence committees support, that the \n     obligations of this retirement and disability system should \n     be fully funded.\n\n\n           Title III--General Intelligence Community Matters\n\n     Section 301. Increase in employee compensation and benefits \n         authorized by law\n       Section 301 provides that funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and \n     other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such \n     additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for \n     increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.\n     Section 302. Restriction on conduct of intelligence \n         activities\n       Section 302 provides that the authorization of \n     appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute \n     authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \n     is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of \n     the United States.\n     Section 303. Annual report on hiring of National Security \n         Education Program participants\n       Section 303 requires a report not later than 90 days after \n     the end of the fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, by the head \n     of each element of the Intelligence Community on the number \n     of personnel hired by such element during such fiscal year \n     who were at any time recipients of a grant or scholarship \n     under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of \n     1991 (50 USC 1901 et seq.). The report may be in classified \n     form.\n     Section 304. Enhancement of authority for flexible personnel \n         management among the elements of the intelligence \n         community\n       Section 304 adds a subsection to Section 102A of the \n     National Security Act of 1947 to promote the ability to \n     manage all the elements of the Intelligence Community as a \n     single cohesive community. The new Subsection 102A(v) enables \n     the DNI, with the concurrence of the head of the covered \n     department concerned and in coordination with the Director of \n     the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to convert \n     competitive service positions within an Intelligence \n     Community element of the covered department to excepted \n     positions and to establish new positions in the excepted \n     service within an Intelligence Community element of a covered \n     department. Under Section 304, an incumbent occupying a \n     position on the date of enactment selected to be converted to \n     the excepted service shall have the right to refuse the \n     conversion. Once such individual no longer occupies the \n     position, the position may be converted.\n       Because of their unique intelligence, investigative and \n     national security missions, most Intelligence Community \n     elements are in the excepted civil service. However, civilian \n     employees in several smaller Intelligence Community elements \n     are still covered under competitive service rules. The \n     ability to convert those positions to the excepted service\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n     will enable the Intelligence Community to maintain a system \n     throughout the Intelligence Community that is responsive to \n     the needs of the Intelligence Community both for secrecy and \n     the ability to quickly respond to personnel requirements. The \n     DNI has requested a similar authority in the past. Under \n     Section 304, the covered departments are the Department of \n     Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department \n     of State, and the Department of the Treasury.\n       Although new positions in the excepted service may be \n     created within an element of the Intelligence Community \n     within the covered departments under this authority, the \n     personnel ceilings referred to in Section 102(a) still apply \n     to the number of personnel in an element. It is not intended \n     for this conversion authority to be used to increase the \n     number of full-time equivalent personnel in an intelligence \n     element above the applicable personnel ceilings.\n     Section 305. Preparation of nuclear proliferation assessment \n         statements\n       As set forth in the Atomic Energy Act, the United States \n     may enter into a Civilian Nuclear Agreement (or ``123 \n     Agreement'') with another nation or multinational \n     organization. After negotiating the terms of the 123 \n     Agreement, the Administration submits the terms to Congress \n     for review along with a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment \n     Statement (NPAS). Under current law, the NPAS is drafted by \n     the State Department, in consultation with the Director of \n     Central Intelligence; the Act has not been amended to reflect \n     the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence. \n     In multiple reports, the Government Accountability Office has \n     identified various problems with this process, including \n     insufficient time for consultation with the Intelligence \n     Community, a lack of adequate formal interagency guidance for \n     NPAS development, and ambiguity as to whether Intelligence \n     Community comments were fully incorporated into the final \n     NPAS. Section 305 is a modification of Section 305 of S. 1458 \n     as reported from the Senate Intelligence Committee and is \n     intended to clarify the role of the DNI and the Intelligence \n     Community in the NPAS process.\n       Section 305 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     require the DNI, in consultation with the heads of the \n     appropriate elements of the Intelligence Community and the \n     Secretary of State, to provide an addendum to each NPAS \n     accompanying a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement, \n     containing a comprehensive analysis of the country's export \n     control system with respect to nuclear-related matters. The \n     DNI is to provide the addendum to the President, the \n     congressional intelligence committees and the congressional \n     foreign relations committees.\n     Section 306. Cost estimates\n       Section 306 amends Section 506A of the National Security \n     Act of 1947 to require that independent cost estimates \n     include all costs associated with a major system acquisition \n     even when a service or capability to deliver end-to-end \n     functionality will be provided by another Intelligence \n     Community agency or element. This additional requirement in \n     the preparation of the independent cost estimate will assist \n     Congress and the Executive Branch in evaluating the full cost \n     of an acquisition, including the costs to process, exploit, \n     disseminate, and store the information such major systems \n     collect. The amendments made by Section 306 become effective \n     180 days after enactment.\n     Section 307. Updates of intelligence relating to terrorism \n         recidivism of detainees held at United States Naval \n         Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\n       Section 307 provides for a regular unclassified summary of \n     intelligence relating to recidivism of detainees formerly \n     held at Guantanamo Bay to be made public by the DNI. Section \n     334 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010, Public Law 111-259, required the DNI, along with the \n     Director of the CIA and the Director of the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, to make publicly available, on a one-\n     time basis, an unclassified summary that includes the \n     intelligence relating to former Guantanamo detainees. Under \n     Section 319 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009, \n     Public Law 111-32, the President is required to submit \n     classified quarterly reports to Congress that include \n     classified information about detainees' recidivist \n     activities.\n       Section 307 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     require the semiannual updating of the Section 334 report, \n     which is to include an unclassified summary of intelligence \n     relating to recidivism of detainees currently or formerly \n     held at Guantanamo Bay and an assessment of the likelihood \n     that such detainees will engage in terrorism or communicate \n     with persons in terrorist organizations. The initial update \n     shall be made publicly available not later than 10 days after \n     the date that the first report following enactment is \n     submitted to members and committees pursuant to Section 319 \n     of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009. The summary \n     will be prepared by the DNI, in consultation with the \n     Director of the CIA and the Director of the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, and will include the number of confirmed \n     or suspected recidivists.\n     Section 308. Notification of transfer of a detainee held at \n         United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\n       Section 308 requires the President to submit to Congress, \n     in classified form, at least 30 days prior to the transfer or \n     release of an individual detained at Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as of June 24, 2009, the following \n     information: (1) the name of the individual to be transferred \n     or released; (2) the country or freely associated state to \n     which the individual is to be transferred; (3) the terms of \n     any agreement with the country or state for the acceptance of \n     such individual, including the amount of any financial \n     assistance related to such agreement; and (4) the agencies or \n     departments of the United States responsible for ensuring the \n     agreement is carried out.\n       Section 308 is a modification of Section 306 of S. 1458, \n     which amended similar notification requirements found in \n     Public Law 111-83, 123 Stat. 2178, and Public Law 111-88, 123 \n     Stat. 2963. Section 308 requires the notification be at least \n     30 days, rather than 15 days, prior to transfer and requires \n     information be provided concerning what agencies or \n     departments of the United States, if any, are responsible for \n     ensuring any agreement with the receiving country or state is \n     carried out. Nothing in this section is to be construed to \n     supersede or otherwise affect Section 1028 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 or Section \n     8120 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2012.\n     Section 309. Enhanced procurement authority to manage supply \n         chain risk\n       Section 309 authorizes the heads of those elements of the \n     Intelligence Community outside the Department of Defense to \n     take certain procurement actions under certain circumstances \n     to reduce the risk that an adversary may sabotage, \n     maliciously introduce unwanted functions, or otherwise \n     subvert information systems so as to surveil, deny, disrupt \n     or otherwise degrade them. Section 309 is based on Section \n     806 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383).\n       Section 309(a) defines the following terms: covered agency, \n     covered item of supply, covered procurement, covered \n     procurement action, covered system, and supply chain risk. \n     The definitions of these terms are modifications of the \n     definitions of these terms as found in Section 309 of S. \n     1458, to include specific references to appropriate \n     provisions of existing law.\n       Under subsection (b), the head of a covered agency, in \n     consultation with the DNI, is authorized to carry out a \n     covered procurement action and limit the disclosure of \n     information concerning the basis for such action. Covered \n     procurement actions are subject to the conditions in \n     subsection (c), including appropriate consultation with \n     procurement officials within the covered agency and a \n     determination made in writing that the use of the authority \n     is necessary to protect national security. In addition, there \n     must be a determination that less intrusive measures are not \n     reasonably available. Where the head of the covered agency \n     plans to limit disclosure of information relating to the \n     basis for carrying out a covered procurement action, the risk \n     to national security due to disclosing such information must \n     outweigh the risk of not disclosing such information.\n       The head of the covered agency must give notice to the \n     congressional intelligence committees of a determination to \n     exercise this authority. Subsection (d) limits delegation of \n     the authority to take a covered procurement action to no \n     lower than the level of the service acquisition executive for \n     the agency concerned. Subsection (e) provides that the \n     authority under the section is in addition to any other \n     authority under any other provision of law. The authority \n     provided in Section 309 is not intended to alter or effect \n     the exercise of any other provision of law, including other \n     procurement authorities available to an intelligence agency \n     head to protect the national security.\n       The requirements of Section 309 take effect 180 days after \n     enactment and expire on the date that Section 806 of the Ike \n     Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2011 expires, which will occur in January 2014.\n     Section 310. Burial allowances\n       Section 310 authorizes the head of a department or agency \n     that contains an element of the Intelligence Community to pay \n     a burial allowance to the estate of a civilian officer or \n     employee of such department or agency who dies as the result \n     of hostile or terrorist activities or intelligence activities \n     having a substantial element of risk. The burial allowance is \n     to reimburse the estate for burial expenses, including \n     recovery, mortuary, funeral, or memorial service, cremation, \n     burial costs, and costs of transportation. The amount of the \n     burial allowance is not to be greater than the maximum \n     reimbursable amount available to the uniformed services under \n     Department of Defense Instruction 1344.08 or its successor, \n     now set at $8,800, plus actual transportation costs, and is \n     in addition to any other benefit permitted under any other \n     provision of law, including funds that may be expended as \n     specified in the General Provisions of the classified annex \n     accompanying this Act.\n       In addition, Section 310 requires the Director of the OPM, \n     in consultation with the DNI and the Secretaries of Labor and \n     Defense, to submit a report to Congress no later than 180 \n     days after enactment on the feasibility of implementing \n     legislation to provide for burial allowances at a level that \n     adequately addresses the cost of burial expenses and provides \n     for equitable treatment when any officer or employee of the \n     federal government dies as the result of an injury sustained \n     in the performance of official duties.\n     Section 311. Modification of certain reporting requirements\n       The Congress frequently requests information from the \n     Intelligence Community in the\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n     form of reports, the contents of which are specifically \n     defined by statute. The reports prepared pursuant to these \n     statutory requirements provide Congress with an invaluable \n     source of information about specific matters of concern.\n       Congressional reporting requirements, and particularly \n     recurring reporting requirements, however, can place a \n     significant burden on the resources of the Intelligence \n     Community. The congressional intelligence committees are \n     therefore reconsidering these reporting requirements on a \n     periodic basis to ensure that the reports that have been \n     requested are the best mechanism for the Congress to receive \n     the information it seeks. In some cases, annual reports can \n     be replaced with briefings or notifications that provide the \n     Congress with more timely information and offer the \n     Intelligence Community a direct line of communication to \n     respond to congressional concerns.\n       In response to a request from the DNI, the congressional \n     intelligence committees examined a set of recurring reporting \n     requirements nominated by the Intelligence Community. Because \n     the majority of recurring reports provide critical \n     information relevant to challenges facing the Intelligence \n     Community today, Section 311 eliminates or modifies only four \n     statutory reporting requirements, all from past intelligence \n     authorization acts or the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004.\n     Section 312. Review of strategic and competitive analysis \n         conducted by the intelligence community\n       Section 312 requires the DNI to direct the Director's \n     Senior Advisory Group to conduct a comprehensive review of \n     the strategic and competitive analysis of international \n     terrorism and homegrown violent extremism conducted by \n     elements of the Intelligence Community during the 12 month \n     period following enactment. Within 15 months of enactment, \n     the Director shall submit to the congressional intelligence \n     committees a report on the results of the review and any \n     actions taken by the Director to implement the \n     recommendations, if any, of the Senior Advisory Group based \n     on such results.\n\n\n  TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n      Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\n     Section 401. Intelligence community assistance to counter \n         drug trafficking organizations using public lands\n       Section 401 requires the DNI to consult with the heads of \n     the federal land management agencies on the appropriate \n     actions the Intelligence Community can take to assist such \n     agencies in responding to the threat from international drug \n     trafficking organizations or other drug traffickers that are \n     currently or have previously used public lands in the United \n     States to further their operations. The DNI is to submit a \n     report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees within 180 days of enactment on the results of \n     this consultation.\n     Section 402. Application of certain financial reporting \n         requirements to the Office of the Director of National \n         Intelligence\n       Section 402 provides a limited grace period for the ODNI in \n     meeting the requirements of 31 USC 3515 until Fiscal Year \n     2013. The DNI, in requesting this legislative provision, \n     stated that the grace period will allow time for the \n     implementation of system improvements as well as process \n     changes in the financial management system currently \n     supporting the ODNI. Together these efforts are intended to \n     yield financial statements that meet the prescribed legal and \n     audit standards.\n       Although the ODNI, under 31 USC 3515, is required to \n     prepare and submit to the Congress and the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget an audited financial \n     statement for the preceding fiscal year by March 1st, Section \n     369 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010, enacted on October 7, 2010, directs the DNI ``to \n     develop a plan and schedule to achieve a full, unqualified \n     audit of each element of the intelligence community not later \n     than September 30, 2013.'' Section 402 will align the \n     statutory requirement for auditability with the plan for \n     achieving auditability set forth in the Fiscal Year 2010 Act.\n     Section 403. Public availability of information regarding the \n         Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\n       Section 403 requires the DNI to establish and maintain on \n     the publicly accessible ODNI website information relating to \n     the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community \n     including methods to contact the Inspector General. Section \n     403 is based on a similar requirement in Section 8L of the \n     Inspector General Act, as added by the Inspector General \n     Reform Act of 2008, 5 USC App., and is similar to Section \n     413, applicable to the CIA Inspector General. The \n     information about the Inspector General is to be obvious \n     and facilitate access to the Inspector General. Given that \n     most of the Inspector General's reports will be \n     classified, Section 403 does not require that Inspector \n     General reports and audits be posted on the publicly \n     accessible website.\n     Section 404. Clarification of Status of Chief Information \n         Officer in the Executive Schedule\n       Section 404 amends 5 USC 5315 to establish the salary level \n     of the Chief Information Officer of the Intelligence \n     Community at Level IV of the Executive Schedule, the level of \n     other chief information officers in the federal government \n     with comparable duties and responsibilities. The Chief \n     Information Officer of the Intelligence Community is a \n     position established in Section 103G of the National Security \n     Act, added by Section 303 of Public Law 108-487, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, and \n     amended by Section 404 of Public Law 111-259, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n     Section 405. Temporary appointment to fill vacancies within \n         Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n       Section 405 permits the President to make temporary \n     appointments to fill vacancies in offices within the ODNI \n     that require Senate confirmation (except the DNI, for whom by \n     Section 103A(a)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947 the \n     Principal Deputy DNI is next in line) with an individual who \n     serves in another element of the Intelligence Community. A \n     similar provision was requested by the DNI.\n       The Vacancies Act (5 USC 3345(a)(1)) provides that upon a \n     vacancy in a Senate-confirmed position (1) the first \n     assistant of the office may begin serving as the acting \n     officer immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of \n     the vacancy; (2) another officer who has already received \n     Senate confirmation may be directed by the President to serve \n     as the acting officer; and (3) certain other senior agency \n     officials may be designated by the President to serve in an \n     acting capacity. Given the relatively small size of the ODNI, \n     the fact that a significant number of the personnel within \n     the ODNI are on detail to the office from other elements of \n     the Intelligence Community, and the fact that positions in \n     the ODNI to which the Vacancy Act applies serve the entire \n     Intelligence Community (such as the Director of the National \n     Counterterrorism Center or the Inspector General for the \n     Intelligence Community), an individual employed within the \n     Intelligence Community but outside the ODNI may be best \n     suited to fill a key leadership position temporarily.\n       Section 405 addresses this issue by expanding the \n     President's choice for appointment under the third category \n     of the Vacancies Act to include senior officials from any \n     element of the Intelligence Community. Nothing in Section 401 \n     modifies or precludes the utilization of sections 3345(a)(1) \n     or (2) of title 5 to fill vacancies.\n\n                Subtitle B--Central Intelligence Agency\n\n     Section 411. Acceptance of gifts\n       Section 411 is a provision that arose out of the CIA's \n     review of benefits available to the survivors of CIA \n     employees killed in the line of duty following the December \n     2009 attack at Khowst, Afghanistan. The CIA concluded that \n     the Director of the CIA did not have the authority under \n     Section 12 of the CIA Act to accept and use gifts for \n     purposes related to the welfare, education and recreation of \n     those survivors. Under current law, the Director of the CIA \n     may ``accept, hold, administer, and use gifts of money, \n     securities and other property whenever the Director \n     determines it would be in the interest of the United States . \n     . . for purposes relating to the general welfare, education, \n     or recreation of employees or dependents of employees of the \n     Agency or for similar purposes. . . .''\n       Section 411 amends Section 12 of the CIA Act to authorize \n     the Director (or the Director's designee) both to accept \n     gifts and to use them for the welfare of employees injured in \n     the line of duty without legal concern whether those actions \n     are for the general welfare of the CIA employee population as \n     a whole. It also provides that gifts may be used for the \n     assistance of the family of CIA officers who were injured or \n     who died from hostile or terrorist activities or in \n     connection with other intelligence activities having a \n     substantial element of risk. Gifts for injured employees and \n     their families or survivors are to be accepted by the CIA on \n     behalf of the CIA employees concerned, and not directly by \n     such employees or their family members. The Director is \n     authorized to assign the gifts accepted under the new \n     authority provided by this section to the CIA officers and \n     their surviving family members.\n       Section 411 provides that any exercise of authority under \n     Section 12, including the acceptance of gifts to provide for \n     the general welfare, education, or recreation of the CIA \n     employee population as a whole, shall be made according to \n     regulations developed by the Director of the CIA in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, consistent with all relevant ethical constraints and \n     principles.\n     Section 412. Foreign language proficiency requirements for \n         Central Intelligence Agency officers\n       Section 412 makes amendments in Section 104A(g) of the \n     National Security Act of 1947 which imposes foreign language \n     requirements on certain personnel within the CIA. Section 412 \n     is intended to tie the need for foreign language skills to \n     officers in occupations where foreign language ability is \n     most important, rather than to specific positions, within the \n     Directorate of Intelligence career service or the National \n     Clandestine Service career service. It is intended to \n     eliminate the need for the Director of the CIA to approve \n     waivers for the promotion, appointment, or transfer of \n     personnel such as attorneys or human resources officers for \n     whom the requirement is not intended to apply. Section 412 \n     sets the language proficiency at the objective level of level \n     3 on the Interagency Language Roundtable Language\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n     Skills Level or a commensurate proficiency level.\n       Section 412 requires the Director of the CIA to provide a \n     report within 45 days of enactment, and three subsequent \n     annual reports, to the congressional intelligence committees \n     on the number of personnel transferred to a Senior \n     Intelligence Service position in the Directorate of \n     Intelligence career service or the National Clandestine \n     career service who did not meet the foreign language \n     requirements of Section 104A(g). Section 412 also makes \n     technical corrections to delete outdated references to the \n     Directorate of Operations.\n     Section 413. Public availability of information regarding the \n         Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency\n       Section 413 requires the Director of the CIA to establish \n     and maintain on the publicly accessible CIA website \n     information relating to the CIA Inspector General including \n     methods to contact the Inspector General. Section 413 is \n     based on a similar requirement in the Inspector General \n     Reform Act, 5 USC App. 8L, and is similar to Section 403. The \n     information about the Inspector General is to be obvious and \n     facilitate access to the Inspector General. Given that most \n     of the Inspector General's reports will be classified, \n     Section 413 does not require that Inspector General reports \n     and audits be posted on the publicly accessible website. \n     Section 413 is based upon a request of the CIA Inspector \n     General.\n     Section 414. Creating an official record of the Osama bin \n         Laden operation\n       Section 414 makes findings concerning the raid of May 1, \n     2011, that killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in his \n     compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Section 414 includes a \n     statement of the sense of Congress that the events that \n     transpired before, during, and as a result of the raid be \n     memorialized to allow the United States to have an accurate \n     account of these events in the future. Section 414 requires \n     the Director of the CIA to provide to the congressional \n     intelligence committees the report being prepared by the \n     Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the \n     history of and lessons learned from the raid not later than \n     90 days after its completion and to preserve any records, \n     including intelligence information and assessments, used to \n     generate this report.\n     Section 415. Recruitment of personnel in the Office of the \n         Inspector General\n       Section 415 requires the Inspector General of the OPM, in \n     consultation with the Inspector General of the CIA, to \n     conduct a study of the personnel authorities and available \n     personnel benefits of the Office of the Inspector General of \n     the CIA. The study shall include identification of any \n     barriers and disincentives to the recruitment or retention \n     of experienced investigators within the Office of the \n     Inspector General of the CIA. The study shall compare the \n     personnel authorities of the CIA Inspector General with \n     the personnel authorities of other federal Inspectors \n     General, including a comparison of the benefits available \n     to experienced investigators within the offices of other \n     federal Inspectors General with those available to \n     investigators within the Office of the CIA Inspector \n     General. The OPM Inspector General is to submit the report \n     to the congressional intelligence and homeland security \n     committees not later than 120 days after enactment.\n\n                  Subtitle C--National Security Agency\n\n     Section 421. Additional authorities for National Security \n         Agency security personnel\n       Section 421 amends Section 11 of the National Security \n     Agency Act of 1959 to authorize NSA security personnel to \n     transport apprehended individuals from NSA premises to the \n     custody of law enforcement officials. Under current law, when \n     NSA security personnel apprehend an individual, they must \n     wait with the individual until local law enforcement \n     personnel arrive to complete the transfer of custody. This \n     can require NSA personnel to wait, frequently for hours, \n     often with the apprehended individual in a security vehicle, \n     for the transfer to local law enforcement. According to the \n     DNI, from 2004 to 2009, on 448 occasions, the apprehension of \n     an individual engaged NSA personnel and transportation \n     resources for over 2 hours.\n       Section 421 provides a limited expansion of authority for \n     NSA security personnel to transport apprehended individuals \n     to the custody of local law enforcement within 30 miles of \n     NSA premises. This authority is to be used sparingly by NSA \n     security personnel under a well-established regime of \n     administrative controls and management oversight, and only \n     with prior consent from the accepting jurisdiction.\n\n                       Subtitle D--Other Elements\n\n     Section 431. Codification of Office of Intelligence and \n         Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security as an \n         element of the intelligence community\n       Section 431 amends Section 3(4)(K) of the National Security \n     Act of 1947 in order to include the Office of Intelligence \n     and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security within \n     the term ``intelligence community'' for purposes of the Act. \n     This provides for a more specific reference to the Office of \n     Intelligence and Analysis, in addition to the intelligence \n     element of the Coast Guard, that is part of the Intelligence \n     Community, in the same manner as Congress has done in Section \n     3(4)(I) and (J) for the State and Treasury Department \n     elements of the Intelligence Community.\n     Section 432. Federal Bureau of Investigation participation in \n         the Department of Justice leave bank\n       Section 432 provides for participation of employees of the \n     FBI in the Department of Justice's Voluntary Leave Bank \n     Program. The Voluntary Leave Bank Program allows federal \n     employees to donate to and to receive donations from a leave \n     ``bank'' to cover absences necessitated by extraordinary \n     medical conditions. Current law does not allow participation \n     by FBI employees in the Department's program, although the \n     FBI is part of the Department. While 5 USC 6372(c) would \n     allow FBI to establish its own voluntary leave bank program, \n     the Director of the FBI has determined that it would be more \n     cost effective and efficient to allow FBI employees to \n     participate in the larger Department of Justice program and \n     has requested a legislative provision to accomplish this \n     objective for the overall benefit of the Bureau and its \n     personnel.\n       Under Section 432, the Director is to consider the \n     protection of sources and methods in allowing for \n     participation in the leave bank program. In providing for \n     leave bank opportunities to cover absences necessitated by \n     extraordinary medical conditions, it is intended that the \n     Director consider any impact on operations of the Bureau when \n     making a decision on whether to allow FBI employees to take \n     part in the program.\n     Section 433. Accounts and transfer authority for \n         appropriations and other amounts for intelligence \n         elements of the Department of Defense\n       Section 433 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer \n     defense appropriations available for the activities of the \n     defense intelligence elements into an account or accounts \n     established for receipt of such funds. These accounts may \n     receive transfers and reimbursement from transactions, \n     authorized by law, between the defense intelligence elements \n     and other entities, and the DNI may also transfer funds into \n     these accounts. Appropriations transferred pursuant to this \n     section shall remain available for the same time period, and \n     for the same purposes, as the appropriations from which funds \n     were transferred. This section is intended to ensure improved \n     auditing of defense intelligence appropriations.\n     Section 434. Report on training standards of defense \n         intelligence workforce\n       Section 434 requires not later than 180 days after \n     enactment the DNI and the Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence to submit to the congressional intelligence and \n     armed services committees a report on the training standards \n     of the defense intelligence workforce. The report is to \n     include a description of existing training, education, and \n     professional development standards applied to the personnel \n     of defense intelligence components, and an assessment of the \n     ability to implement a certification program based on \n     achievement of required training, education, and professional \n     development standards.\n\n\n                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     Section 501. Report on airspace restrictions for use of \n         unmanned aerial vehicles along the border of the United \n         States and Mexico\n       Section 501 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security not \n     later than 90 days after enactment to submit to the \n     congressional intelligence and homeland security committees a \n     report on whether restrictions on the use of airspace are \n     hampering the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by the \n     Department of Homeland Security along the international \n     border between the United States and Mexico.\n     Section 502. Sense of Congress regarding integration of \n         fusion centers\n       Section 502 states that it is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the \n     DNI, should continue to integrate and utilize fusion centers \n     to enlist all of the intelligence, law enforcement, and \n     homeland security capabilities of the United States in a \n     manner that is consistent with the Constitution to prevent \n     acts of terrorism against the United States.\n     Section 503. Strategy to counter improvised explosive devices\n       Section 503 requires the DNI and the Secretary of Defense \n     to establish a coordinated strategy utilizing all available \n     personnel and assets for intelligence collection and analysis \n     to identify and counter network activity and operations in \n     Pakistan and Afghanistan relating to the development and use \n     of improvised explosive devices. Not later than 120 days \n     after enactment, the DNI and the Secretary of Defense are to \n     submit a report containing the strategy to the congressional \n     intelligence and armed services committees and implement such \n     strategy.\n     Section 504. Sense of Congress regarding the priority of \n         railway transportation security\n       Section 504 states that it is the sense of Congress that \n     railway transportation security, including subway transit \n     security, should continue to be prioritized in the critical \n     infrastructure threat assessment developed by the Office of \n     Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland \n     Security and included in threat assessment budgets of the \n     Intelligence Community.\n     Section 505. Technical amendments to the National Security \n         Act of 1947\n       Section 505 updates certain references in sections 3(6), \n     506(b) and 506A of the National Security Act of 1947 from the \n     ``Director of Central Intelligence'' and the ``National \n     Foreign Intelligence Program'' to the ``Director\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\n     of National Intelligence'' and the ``National Intelligence \n     Program.''\n     Section 506. Technical amendments to Title 18, United States \n         Code\n       Section 506 updates references in 18 USC 351(a) to the \n     Director and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and \n     provides that the amended section includes the DNI, the \n     Principal Deputy DNI, and the Director and Deputy Director of \n     the CIA among officials covered by the provision.\n     Section 507. Budgetary effects\n       Section 507 states that the budget effects of this Act, for \n     the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act \n     of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman Feinstein in \nthanking my colleagues for their support of the fiscal year 2012 \nIntelligence Authorization Act. Over the past several months, the \ncommittee has worked hard to resolve the final details of the bill and \nconcerns raised by other committees and individual Members. The end \nresult of this effort is a solid bill that ensures vigorous \ncongressional oversight and provides needed authorities to the \nintelligence community.\n  Of course, the vast majority of what the committee authorized is \nclassified, so I cannot discuss specifics. I can say that the \nclassified annex is designed to improve the operations of the \nintelligence community--from counterterrorism and counterproliferation \nto the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and everything in between.\n  This bill also implements fiscal discipline. Difficult economic times \ndemand austerity, but cuts in this bill are specific and targeted to \neliminate waste while preserving the critical work the intelligence \ncommunity does to protect our country.\n  In the unclassified area--and one of great importance to me--we \nreached an agreeable compromise with the Administration that gives the \ncommittee the information we need about the transfer of Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees. As the recidivism rate among former detainees rises over 27 \npercent, it is critical that the committee have full insight into the \ntransfer and resettlement process. The vast majority of detainees are \nfree when they are transferred, and this committee needs to know \nwhether the countries charged with monitoring them are capable and \nwilling to do so. Several provisions in this bill will help the \ncommittee do that.\n  The bill also addresses concerns from other committees with national \nsecurity interests and from the House. As we go forward, I hope the \ncommittees of the Senate will do a better job of making sure that \ncommittees with oversight of national security issues get the \ninformation they need, without automatic objections based on perceived \njurisdictional lines. Too often, the intelligence committee includes \nother committees on receipt of reports or other products, but does not \nget the same treatment in return. That's just not good for oversight or \nfor fulfilling our responsibility to the American people.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to reach reasonable solutions for \nauthorities requested by the intelligence community. The bill allows \nfor the reimbursement of burial expenses for certain government \nemployees who are killed as the result of hostile or terrorist \nactivities or die in connection with a risky intelligence activity. In \nthese difficult financial times, we worked hard to make sure that the \nprovision is in line with benefits for the families of fallen soldiers \nand with the funeral costs generally paid by ordinary Americans. We \nalso ensured that individuals in the same agency, like the FBI, are \nentitled to receive the same reimbursement. The bill also refines the \nadministration of the CIA's foreign language proficiency requirements \nand allows for more flexible personnel management by the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  I thank Chairman Feinstein for her hard work and leadership in \ngetting this bill through the Senate. I also thank the committee staff \nfor once again showing their dedication and commitment to protecting \nthe national security of this country.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be agreed to; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no further intervening action or debate; and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
