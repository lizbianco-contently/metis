Mr. President, when it comes to the state of our \neconomy, the American people have seen enough choreographed rallies on \nfactory floors and speeches that sound good but lead to nothing.\n  After 2 years of chronic joblessness, they want results.\n  And that is why we have seen a growing consensus in Washington over \nthe past few weeks that something serious must be done about our \nNation's debt.\n  Even Democrats now admit that failing to bring down the debt would be \nfar more damaging to our Nation's economy in the long run than failing \nto raise the debt ceiling. The situation has been described as the most \npredictable crisis in American history. People on both sides of the \naisle now realize that the warning bells are too loud to ignore. And \nlast month, President Obama himself made a crucial admission.\n  In a sign that he too is starting to worry about the prospects of \ninaction, the President said that failing to produce a serious plan for \ntackling the deficit and the debt could be a bigger drag on the economy \nthan anything else.\n  So more and more people see the problem. Now the challenge is \nachieving a result.\n  And that is why I proposed a few basic principles yesterday that I \nbelieve could guide us to success.\n  This morning, I want to reiterate those principles ahead of the \nmeeting at Blair House.\n  By setting out clear principles up front, we are far more likely to \nget somewhere. And to prevent this crisis before it strikes.\n  First: It is time our friends on the other side stop pitting one \ngroup of Americans against another. Solving this crisis will require \nall of us working together. Let's act like it.\n  Second: The level of spending that Democrats want to maintain just is \nnot possible without raising taxes on the middle class, which we know \nis not going to happen. We are only going to solve this crisis by \nadmitting up front that we have a spending problem.\n  Third: Entitlements need to be a part of this discussion. So let's \ndrop the scare tactics and work together on reform. Nobody is talking \nabout taking anybody's Medicare.\n  Fourth: Raising taxes is the last thing we should be doing in the \nmiddle of a recession. What's more, a bipartisan majority here in the \nSenate opposes it. So let's set that idea aside and find some common \nground instead. If we recognize these things, we can avert this crisis. \nIf we do not, we will not. And I assure you we will all answer for it.\n  Very few people saw the last crisis coming. This one, on the other \nhand, is clear as day. Failing to work together in good faith on a \nsolution is completely indefensible. Everybody agrees\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nthis is a crisis. More people, including the President, agree that \nfailing to address it would be disastrous for jobs and the economy. And \neverybody knows the upcoming debt limit vote is the best opportunity we \nhave to do something about it.\n  So what are we waiting for?\n  Doing something meaningful about the debt is the centerpiece of any \nserious jobs agenda in Washington.\n  Other things will help on that front. And the President made a small \nbut important step in the right direction yesterday by announcing he \nwas ready to begin talks on a free trade agreement with Colombia, \nsomething we have been calling on him to do for years.\n  Ratifying this agreement, along with other agreements with South \nKorea and Panama, will open markets to U.S. goods and create thousands \nof jobs. It was just one of the ideas Republicans included in a \ncomprehensive jobs agenda we released this week, an agenda that focuses \non expanding opportunity, lowering costs, and clearing away \nbureaucratic barriers to growth.\n  But at the top of our list of the things we need to do to create jobs \nis bringing down the debt. If we can not get spending under control, we \nwill never get the economy moving.\n  If the economy does not grow, we will not be able to reduce our \ndeficits and our debt.\n  And if we do not reduce our massive Federal debt, we face a crisis \nthat makes the financial panic of 2008 look like a slow day on Wall \nStreet.\n  So this debate couldn't be more important to our near-term and long-\nterm fiscal health.\n  Everyone has a stake in this debate. If we face up to it like adults, \nwe will not only prevent this most predictable crisis, we will help \npreserve our way of life. And the best part is no one side will be able \nto claim the credit. This is the moment. We cannot let it pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2702-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In regard to the comments made by my friend the Republican \nleader, as I listened to him, I picked up about three or four points \nthat I think are fairly obvious. One is, do not touch the tax cuts for \nthe rich; No. 2, do not touch the tax cuts for the rich; and No. 3 is \nthat they want to go after entitlements. The largest, of course, are \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.\n  We know the Ryan budget calls for privatizing Medicare. Even the \nRepublican majority leader today is quoted in the papers as saying that \nwe are going to have to back off that. I am paraphrasing that, but \neveryone can read it. It is on the front page of the Washington Post \nnewspaper. But the Ryan budget has a number of ways of saving money. \nThe most significant way of saving money is to destroy Medicare.\n  The fourth point, after recognizing that, as my friend the Republican \nleader said, we need to go after entitlements, is, don't tax the rich.\n  We on this side of the aisle realize we have some problems with \nspending and we have to do something about it. The problem is not as \nmuch about spending as it is about deficits. What are we going to do \nabout these deficits that accumulate every year?\n  Well, we have some experience from recent years on how to handle \nthat. During the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we were \nspending less money than we were bringing in. We were retiring the \nnational debt. In fact, the criticism came from a number of important \neconomists that we were retiring the debt too quickly, that we had to \nback off that. Well, when President Bush took office, he took that to \nheart. At the time he took office, there was about an $11 trillion \nsurplus over 10 years. He took care of that. In fact, when President \nObama took office, that had been evaporated. It had evaporated. We lost \n8 million jobs. It evaporated because we had two wars, all paid for \nwith borrowed money. We had all of those tax cuts paid for with \nborrowed money.\n  So on this side of the aisle, we want to do something to rein in \nthese deficits, and we have had experience. We know how to do that. One \nof the things we did during the Clinton years was unique, but we did \nit, and it was hard. We had something called the pay-go rules. Without \nany Washington inside jargon, what this means is that if you have a new \nprogram, you have to pay for it. You either have to pay for it by \ntaking other programs and getting rid of those or raising revenue in \nsome way. We did that in the Clinton years. When President Bush took \noffice, his Republican colleagues here in the Congress worked with him \nand got rid of those rules. That is why we had everything that was \nunpaid for, and, in fact, ``unpaid for'' is an understatement. It was \nall borrowed money.\n  So we know there is a problem with deficits, and we want to work on \nthose.\n  Today at the Blair House, there is a meeting. I have appointed a \ncouple of people to represent the Democrats in the Senate: Senator \nInouye, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee. The other three leaders in the \nCongress have appointed people. They are going to meet and talk \nseriously about ways of reducing the yearly deficits we have.\n  I would hope one of the things Vice President Biden talks about with \nthem--I am confident it will be--is that we don't need to talk about \nspending caps; we need to talk about deficit caps. We have to be able \nto work toward reducing these staggering debts by looking at \neverything.\n  I am like most everybody here in this body; we do everything we can \nto protect these brave men and women who are in the military. But the \nGovernment Accountability Office told us in a report recently filed \nthat there is $100 billion a year in the Pentagon that is wasted--$100 \nbillion. When asked in a hearing how many private contractors the \nmilitary has, they said: We don't know. Upon further questioning, they \nsaid: Well, it is between 1 million and 9 million people who are \ncontractors. There is a lot of fat in this. These are the same people \nwho, during the Iraq war, from the hearings conducted by Senator \nDorgan, were using wads of hundred-dollar bills to play football. We \ncan save a lot of money by looking at domestic discretionary spending, \nmilitary spending, and doing a better job of making our tax system more \nfair.\n\n  To show how unfair our tax system is today, we tax the American \npeople about $1 trillion a year--a lot of money--but we give tax breaks \nto corporations and individuals of $1.1 trillion. The point is we give \nmore in tax breaks than we have as revenue in this country. We ought to \nchange all this. My friend, who is the Presiding Officer, and I see my \nfriend from Utah who will be the ranking member of that important \ncommittee, the Finance Committee, are going to have to work together to \nmake this tax system more fair.\n  I appreciate my Republican friend talking about all the things we \nneed to do, but one thing that is very clear that he doesn't want to \ntouch is the\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\ntax cuts to the rich. It is very clear he doesn't want to do anything \nto deal with the tax cuts to the rich, and he wants to go after \nentitlements--and he said so this morning--which are Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and Medicaid.\n  We have a lot of work to do. The only way we are going to work our \nway through this is on a bipartisan basis. It is the only way we can do \nit. The heavily Republican House has to recognize that, the Democrats \nin the Senate have to realize that, and the President has to realize \nthat. And he does. That is why he has convened this bipartisan meeting \nat the Blair House today, conducted by the Vice President of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2703-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an unfortunate and, \nquite frankly, disturbing matter.\n  While we were all back home during the most recent Senate recess, the \nNational Labor Relations Board's acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, \nafter 17 months of indecision, issued one of the most far-reaching and \noutrageous complaints ever issued by the Board against a private \nbusiness. This complaint against Boeing is one of the most outlandish \nand regrettable complaints I have seen in all my years in the Senate.\n  The NLRB's acting general counsel--emphasis on the ``acting''--\nsitting in his ivory tower in Washington, DC, essentially substituted \nhis business judgment for that of a private corporation. In essence, \nMr. Solomon claimed the authority to determine where and how a private \ncompany is permitted to do business.\n  This is a specious claim. Boeing did nothing wrong, and I am \nconfident it will ultimately prevail. Yet this complaint carries a \npotential cost of billions of dollars and thousands of new jobs for the \ncompany in the community where it chose to operate.\n  So why make this decision at all? Why attack a private company with a \nlegal challenge that will cost an enormous amount of money to defend, \ndisrupts business, undermines the efforts of States to increase jobs \nand promote economic recovery but that will fail for its lack of merit? \nThe answer is simple. The unions want it. This is another chapter in \nthe sorry relationship between unions, big government, and the party of \nbig government.\n  I have to say, I admire Mr. Solomon's moxie. By making this decision \nduring a congressional recess, it is almost as if he thought it might \navoid our scrutiny. Maybe he thought news such as this might not make \nits way back to the States. To that I say: Nice try, but you will not \nescape the scrutiny of the American people when it comes to an action \nthis over the top. Sunshine will fall on a decision this politically \nmotivated. In the light of day, the decision and the decisionmakers are \ngoing to look awfully bad.\n  The NLRB's Boeing complaint has been widely criticized in the media, \nin the Senate by a number of my colleagues, and throughout the business \ncommunity as a prime example of a Federal bureaucracy run amok. But \nthis is more than another example of an unaccountable bureaucracy \nharming job creators and employees. What makes this case particularly \nugly is, this is a case of regulators conveniently supporting the \ninterests of big labor against private enterprise. What makes this case \nappalling is, it is a gift-wrapped present to the interests that just \nso happen to be the largest contributors to Democratic Party campaigns.\n  The NLRB issued its complaint against Boeing--one of our Nation's \niconic companies--for allegedly transferring assembly work on its \nDreamliner 787 fleet of airplanes from Puget Sound, WA, to North \nCharleston, SC. Boeing made a legitimate business decision to open a \nnew plant with new workers in a new more business-friendly climate. It \nchose South Carolina, in part, to avoid labor disputes and crippling \nstrikes which had befallen the company repeatedly over the past few \nyears.\n  When Boeing first made this decision way back in 2009, it had \nexperienced four major labor strikes in 20 years. The most recent work \nstoppage--a 58-day strike in 2008--cost the company $1.8 billion.\n  Was the decision to bring new work to South Carolina a prudent \nbusiness decision? Boeing faces significant global competition. The \nFrench company, Airbus, is anxious to take Boeing's business with the \nhelp--and backing, I might add--of the French Government.\n  Was the decision good for American workers? Clearly, Boeing's \ndecision was. In the current marketplace, many of Boeing's competitors \nmight have considered moving jobs overseas. Instead of following that \ncourse, Boeing saved American jobs.\n  The President likes to talk about jobs he has created and saved. \nWell, not a single job--union or nonunion--was lost in the State of \nWashington as a result of Boeing's decision. In fact, over 2,000 new \njobs have been created in Puget Sound since the company's announcement \nto begin work on the new facility. This is not to mention South \nCarolina, where hundreds of new jobs were created. Added jobs in \nWashington plus added jobs in South Carolina sounds like a win-win for \nAmerican workers to me.\n  So, yes, Boeing's decision to build its new plant in South Carolina \nwas good for just about everybody. Yet, without asserting any evidence \nof anti-union animus on the part of Boeing or of an adverse impact on \nunion workers exercising their legal rights, the NLRB filed its \ncomplaint and has sought to step in and make Boeing's business \ndecisions for them.\n  As South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley described it in an April 26 Wall \nStreet Journal editorial:\n\n       The excitement of South Carolina turned to gloom for \n     millions of South Carolinians who are rightly aghast at the \n     thought of the greatest economic development success our \n     state has seen in decades being ripped away by federal \n     bureaucrats who appear to be little more than union puppets.\n\n  Governor Haley should be applauded for calling the NLRB's decision \nfor what it is: a hand-wrapped present to big labor, courtesy of their \nfriends in the Federal bureaucracy and the administration.\n  Let's take a look at the NLRB's complaint for a moment. First, let's \nconsider the timing of the complaint. It is highly suspect, if you ask \nme. The Boeing complaint comes just a few short months before the new \nSouth Carolina facility was scheduled to open in July and well after \nmost of the construction was completed and the new workers were hired. \nIn other words, after most of Boeing's substantial investments had been \nmade, the heavy hand of the Federal bureaucracy intervened to dictate \nthat its business decision must be reversed.\n  In its April 21 editorial, the Wall Street Journal describes the \nBoeing complaint saying:\n\n       After 17 months and $2 billion, the NLRB sandbags Boeing.\n\n  The editorial continued:\n\n       There are plentiful legal precedents to give business the \n     right to locate operations in Right to Work states. That \n     right has created healthy competition among the states and \n     kept tens of millions of jobs in America rather than \n     overseas.\n\n  An opinion editorial by Steven Pearlstein in the April 26 Washington \nPost is even more telling. Although Mr. Pearlstein was, not \nunexpectedly, somewhat supportive of big labor and the NLRB's actions \nin this case, he nevertheless acknowledged that:\n\n       [i]f the agency prevails and is able to force Boeing to \n     open an additional production line\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\n     for its new 787 Dreamliner in Seattle, it could finally put a \n     brake on the steady flow of manufacturing jobs to right to \n     work states in the South.\n\n  Pearlstein hits it on the head here. The decision to file this \ncomplaint is an attack on business-friendly States that are attracting \ncompanies and creating jobs. It is an effort by Washington Democrats \nand career bureaucrats to force unionism on the entire country. Yet, in \nmy view, Pearlstein does not adequately state the radicalism of the \nNLRB's position.\n  The fact is, if the NLRB--doing the bidding of the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers--prevails, it will give \nthem the right to dictate business location decisions everywhere, even \nin non-right-to-work States.\n  There is a great deal of misinformation coming from those who support \nthe NLRB's actions. In this article, Pearlstein inaccurately describes \nBoeing's new manufacturing facility in South Carolina as a runaway \nshop. Boeing had no legal obligation to locate any and all new work in \nPuget Sound. It was not obligated, under any collective bargaining \nagreement, to keep the work there. It simply chose to locate new work \nand new expansion in a business-friendly, right-to-work State. Is that \na runaway shop? I think not, and I think most everybody would think \nnot.\n  Apparently, the NLRB agrees with me because the complaint does not \nallege that this was a classic runaway shop. In those situations, \nbargaining unit work that is contractually obligated to be performed by \nmembers of the union is shut down unilaterally by management. Employees \nare laid off, and the company stealthily slips out of town with little \nor no notice, only to reopen in a new location to perform the exact \nsame work on a union-free basis. Under the law, that is wrong.\n  The NLRB makes no such allegations because that is not what happened \nin this case. Instead, the complaint falls back on the broad, catchall \nargument that Boeing's actions were inherently destructive of union \nworkers' section 7 rights, referring to the rights protected by section \n7 of the National Labor Relations Act which, in this case, means the \nright to strike. If that theory were to apply to all cases such as this \none, if companies cannot factor labor conditions into decisions \nregarding new operations without it being inherently destructive of \nsection 7 rights, there is no logical end to what private decisions can \nbe overruled by the NLRB.\n  This is an agency run amok and trying to take the place of this \nCongress.\n  Fortunately, the legal precedents dealing with this type of decision \ndo not support the acting general counsel's interpretation in the \nBoeing complaint. The cases cited in the complaint are all \ndistinguishable. Not one of them deals with fact patterns involving new \nwork because there is nothing unlawful about opening a new facility to \nperform new work that is not obligated under an existing collective \nbargaining agreement.\n  Put simply, this is just another effort on the part of the union-\npacked Obama NLRB to undo years of legal precedent to satisfy big \nlabor. If Boeing's actions are inherently destructive of the union's \nrights, where is the antiunion discrimination? Once again, not a single \nunion worker lost a job or even lost an hour of work as a result of \nBoeing's business decision.\n\n  Let's be perfectly clear. Boeing workers in the State of Washington \nactually gained new work and gained 2,000 new jobs following the \ndecision in 2009. These jobs are among the best paid in America. Does \nthat sound like anti-union discrimination? Of course not.\n  This was not a stealth move in the dark of the night. No one was \nsurprised or caught off guard. The machinists' union knew Boeing was \nbuilding a new facility in South Carolina. Boeing had even discussed a \nnew location with them. Workers knew about Boeing's plans as well and \nso did the NLRB. But before issuing his complaint, the acting general \ncounsel stewed for 17 months, while new facilities were being \nconstructed at great expense in South Carolina, at a cost of billions \nof dollars, and workers were hired to run the assembly lines.\n  It goes without saying that if Carolina workers wanted a union, they, \nsimilar to any other private sector employees in South Carolina or any \nother State, could file a petition with the NLRB for a union \nrepresentation election. There was no evidence--zero evidence--of anti-\nunion discrimination by Boeing to any union petition or union \nrepresentation election. But--and I can't stress this enough--the most \nimportant factor is, the work in South Carolina was new work which \nBoeing was not obligated to perform in the State of Washington under \nits collective bargaining agreement. Boeing simply decided, for sound \nbusiness reasons, to open a new facility to perform new work in a \nbusiness-friendly State. This is something businesses can do all the \ntime and do do all the time; that is, they used to do it all the time \nbefore President Obama's acting general counsel and the might of the \nFederal bureaucracy, under the heavy-handed control of big labor, \ndecided to step in and interfere with Boeing's decision. If this \ncomplaint is upheld and this interpretation becomes the new status quo, \nwho knows how it will impact businesses in the future?\n  Every citizen in South Carolina and every Member of Congress--\nRepublican or Democratic--ought to be outraged by the National Labor \nRelations Board's decision and action. To borrow from Frank Sinatra, if \nthey can do it there, they can do it anywhere. If the NLRB can do this \nin South Carolina, disrupting business and killing jobs, it can happen \nanywhere, including Utah or any other right-to-work State. It can \nhappen even in non-right-to-work States as well.\n  But the most appalling part about this complaint is not the NLRB's \nborderline frivolous interpretation of the law. No, it is the remedies \nthe agency is seeking. After asserting that Boeing unlawfully \ntransferred bargaining unit work to South Carolina, the acting general \ncounsel--a career NLRB bureaucrat who, throughout his government legal \ncareer, has never been responsible for making a single entrepreneurial \ndecision or creating a single job--sought an order stipulating that \nBoeing's work on the 787 Dreamliner could not be performed in South \nCarolina and would have to be moved back to the State of Washington. \nWell, not back; it would have to be moved to the State of Washington. \nThis is a new business.\n  As is typical in these cases, the Boeing complaint will surely be \nsubject to lengthy litigation, while Boeing's foreign competitors \neagerly seek to supplant Boeing's business orders. Even if Boeing \nultimately prevails in the litigation battle, it could lose the \nbusiness war to fierce global competition. That is stupid to put them \nin this position.\n  The Machinists know that and so does the NLRB.\n  Might I remind supporters of the NLRB that justice delayed is justice \ndenied. Here, the longer the wheels of justice turn, the worse it is \nfor Boeing's business and the worse it is for American jobs and \nprosperity.\n  Delay does not favor Boeing, but it plays right into the hands of its \nglobal competitors, as well as the Machinists Union and President \nObama's acting general counsel at the NLRB, who, it seems, would force \nthe company into accepting a settlement that cements an untenable \nbusiness decision in law.\n  This is no less than economic warfare being waged by the NLRB on \nbehalf of President Obama's friends--the labor unions--against Boeing, \nagainst the workers in South Carolina and all South Carolinians, and \nagainst all the 22 right-to-work States across the country. It may even \nbe against the rights and the privileges and the benefits of the people \nin Washington because if Boeing, to be competitive, has to move \noffshore, they are going to lose their jobs. In the end, it is economic \nwarfare by the Obama administration against all business friendly \nStates and against capitalism and free enterprise everywhere.\n  I am not the only one saying this. I note, for example, that the \nattorneys general in nine States across the country--Nevada, Virginia, \nTexas, Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama, Florida, and South \nCarolina--have written to Mr. Solomon asking that the Boeing complaint \nbe withdrawn.\n  Their April 28 letter states:\n\n       This complaint represents an assault upon the \n     constitutional right of free speech, and the ability of our \n     states to create jobs and recruit industry. . . . The only \n     justification for the NLRB's unprecedented retaliatory action \n     is to aid union survival. Your action seriously undermines \n     our citizens' right to work as well as their ability to \n     compete\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n     globally. Therefore, as Attorneys General, we will protect \n     our citizens from union bullying and federal coercion. We \n     thus call upon you to cease this attack on our right to work, \n     our states' economies, and our jobs.\n\n  Editorials from newspapers across the country have criticized the \nBoeing complaint. Even the Seattle Times wrote in an April 22 \neditorial:\n\n       This page regretted Boeing's decision, but has never \n     thought of it as something that could be, or should be, \n     reversed by the federal government.\n\n  The article continues, saying:\n\n       [T]he National Labor Relations Board has labeled Boeing's \n     decision an unfair labor practice, and is asking a federal \n     court to order the line to be moved to Washington . . . we \n     would celebrate the day Boeing decided to do that--but it is \n     Boeing's decision.\n\n  Later the same editorial concluded:\n\n       The company has the right to build assembly plants. It can \n     build them in South Carolina or in Afghanistan if it likes. \n     Its decision may be unwise, but it is Boeing's.\n\n  These same sentiments were expressed in the President's hometown \nnewspaper. A Chicago Tribune editorial on April 22 described the NLRB \nacting general counsel's actions a ``gross intrusion.'' The editorial \ncontinued:\n\n       Boeing, the Chicago-based aviation company, already has one \n     government-induced headache. Its main rival, Airbus SAS, has \n     received from European nations about $20 billion in subsidies \n     that are prohibited by international trade agreements. That \n     is challenging enough for Boeing as it tries to compete in an \n     international market. But when the U.S. government tries to \n     dictate where Boeing can do business . . . that's even harder \n     to stomach.\n\n  The Tribune editorial concluded:\n\n       The disastrous, unintended message to a major U.S. \n     employer: Keep your mouth shut and find another country to do \n     business.\n\n  The Detroit News has the President and his pro-union administration \npegged. About this decision, the editors wrote:\n\n       President Barack Obama has made conciliatory sounds seeking \n     to reassure business, but the actions of the NLRB illustrate \n     the real face of his administration. Congress ought to hold \n     hearings on reining in the NLRB.\n\n  So if the NLRB's complaint is so transparently awful, what is this \nall about? Let's see. An unfair decision comes late in the game. It \nthreatens to destroy rather than create jobs, and it is based on \nspecious legal reasoning. Rest assured, the issue is not jobs. The \nissue is union jobs, and the issue is not better pay for workers. The \nissue is about money in the union coffers. Ultimately, the issue is \nabout the 2012 elections, because money in union coffers means money \nfor Democratic candidates.\n  The International Association of Machinists Union is important to \nPresident Obama. It endorsed him and contributed substantial resources \nto his campaign. While President Obama could not deliver on such \nlegislative initiatives as the Employee Free Choice Act, he appears \ndetermined that every level of government--especially at the National \nLabor Relations Board--will be turned in the union's favor.\n  The contempt for the American people on display in this decision is \nastounding. The President and congressional Democrats were unable to \nenact the Employee Free Choice Act, even with supermajorities in \nCongress. That is the card check bill. But not to worry. Just have some \nbureaucrats do it for them. Since the Congress could not act, why not \nhave these bureaucrats usurp Congress's position and do it for them?\n  Keep this episode in mind next time we hear progressives talk about \nthe need for enlightened administration. Keep it in mind when we hear \nprogressives--liberals--claim the President is just interested in doing \nwhat works and that he is not ideological.\n  Progressives ultimately have little respect for the rule of law or \nfor the people themselves.\n  For all their talk about nonpartisanship and doing what works, what \nthey promote is a supposedly enlightened bureaucracy that, in fact, \nwill push liberal policies, regardless of what the people want.\n  Progressives are to nonpartisanship as Donald Trump is to subtlety.\n  Ultimately, progressives are as partisan as they come, and they push \ntheir liberalism through a vast and permanent bureaucracy that plods \nalong day after day, largely out of sight of the American people, who \nwould never elect representatives who would actually promote this \nleftist, antibusiness agenda. When former Speaker of the House Nancy \nPelosi said elections should not matter as much as they do, this is \nwhat she meant. Liberalism should advance no matter what the people of \nthis country actually desire. The foot soldiers who will advance the \ncauses of progressive leftism day in and day out are the unelected and \nlargely unaccountable bureaucrats that churn out page after page of \nregulation and infiltrate the decisionmaking process of every business, \nno matter how small the decision or how small the business.\n  Which brings me to the NLRB's acting general counsel.\n  How did he even wind up in a position to cause this level of economic \nmayhem? Not under the established procedure for appointing an interim \ngeneral counsel under section 3(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, \nwhich provides very clearly as follows:\n\n       In case of vacancy in the office of the General Counsel the \n     President is authorized to designate the officer or employee \n     who shall act as General Counsel during such vacancy, but no \n     person or persons so designated shall so act (1) for more \n     than forty days when the Congress is in session unless a \n     nomination to fill such vacancy shall have been submitted to \n     the Senate, or (2) after the adjournment sine die of the \n     session of the Senate in which such nomination was submitted.\n\n  President Obama ignored the clearly established statutory procedure \nfor appointing an acting general counsel under the National Labor \nRelations Act and instead made Mr. Solomon his personal acting general \ncounsel under the more generous terms of the Federal Vacancies Act, \nwhich is intended to apply to government vacancies in general.\n  Even if he is technically authorized to do so, the President should \nnot use the Vacancies Act to supplant or displace specific statutory \nprocedures for appointing Federal employees to vacancies where, as here \nunder the National Labor Relations Act, the organic law is perfectly \nclear as to the intended process.\n  Why did President Obama make the appointment under the Vacancies Act \nrather than follow the more preferred and traditional procedure \nprovided under the National Labor Relations Act? The answer is pretty \nsimple.\n  Under the Vacancies Act, Mr. Solomon is allowed to stay in the job in \nan acting capacity, without Senate approval, for an initial 210 days--\nrather than the 40 days provided under the National Labor Relations \nAct--and then be reappointed again for another 210 days, and a third \ntime for yet another 210 days, until the end of President Obama's term.\n  This is yet another example of the President end running the law in \norder to ensconce in office individuals who would have a difficult time \nsurviving the constitutionally required confirmation process--a process \nthat ensures the people and their representatives have some meaningful \noversight of the appointee.\n  So why did no one complain about this appointment before now? I \nsuppose some should have. I suppose after the battle over the \nnomination of AFL-CIO and SEIU Associate Counsel Craig Becker to the \nNLRB, many were convinced they could do a lot worse than having a \ncareer NLRB civil servant serve as acting general counsel. I am not so \nsure anyone feels that way now. In fact, in light of his recent \nactions, including the Boeing complaint, it is hard to conceive of a \nworse choice for acting general counsel.\n  That decision should be revisited. That is why I am writing to \nPresident Obama to request that he withdraw the appointment of Mr. \nSolomon.\n  As far as President Obama's nomination of Mr. Solomon for a full term \nas general counsel is concerned, it is difficult to imagine how Mr. \nSolomon could ever be confirmed by the Senate, in view of his actions \nwhile serving as acting general counsel.\n  Government actions such as the ones we have seen with the Boeing \ncomplaint are debilitating to our economy at a time when we are \nstruggling to recover from one of the Nation's worst recessions since \nthe Great Depression. Such bureaucratic decisions cost jobs at a time \nwhen we are struggling to reduce unemployment. They delay business \ndecisionmaking and interfere with competition. They undermine business \nconfidence in government.\n  Why should companies invest in expanding business in the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nif, with the drop of a hat, a Federal bureaucrat can simply reverse \nthat decision and destroy that investment?\n  At this point, we are left scratching our heads. Why would the acting \ngeneral counsel do this outrageous act? Unfortunately, the answer \nappears to be that the decision to issue the complaint was a political \none designed to placate an important ally of the President's--organized \nlabor. That answer, while unacceptable, is the only logical answer.\n  As the April 21 Wall Street Journal concluded:\n\n       Beyond labor politics, the NLRB's ruling would set a \n     terrible precedent for the flow of jobs and investments \n     within the United States. It would essentially give labor a \n     veto over management decisions about where to build future \n     plants.\n\n  That must never be allowed to happen. The NLRB should withdraw the \nBoeing complaint.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand that maybe there is an \nagreement that another Member will speak at 11, so I will yield at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2706-S2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GREATEST FINANCIAL RISK\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am concerned about the financial \nstatus of our country. We are clearly on an unsustainable spending \npath. The people are rightly furious with their Congress. We should, as \nthey well know, never have gotten ourselves in the financial situation \nwe are in today, where we are projected to have a deficit this fiscal \nyear, of $1.5 trillion--the largest deficit the country has ever had--\non top of deficits of the last 2 years of $1.2 trillion and $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  We are on a path to doubling the entire U.S. debt in less than 4 \nyears. In the next 3 to 4 years we will double the entire debt of the \nUnited States. We are on an unsustainable path, as every witness who \nhas testified in recent years before our Budget Committee has stated. \nIt is an unacceptable situation.\n  There was a shellacking in the last election of people, the big \ngovernment folks. We have not even had a budget in 2 years--in 735 days \nwe have not had a budget. The Budget Act requires the Congress to pass \na budget by April 15. The House has done theirs. The Republican House \nhas passed a budget, a historic budget. The Democratic Senate is now \ntalking about commencing hearings on Tuesday. I hope we have a good \nhearing. Maybe we will.\n  I just say that our members, the Republican members of the Budget \nCommittee, asked our chairman to do as the House did and make public \ntheir budget in advance of the hearing so it can be examined--it is a \ncomplicated document, hard to examine, and it takes some time and \neffort--and not just plop it down the day the hearing starts. I have \nbeen informed that business as usual will continue--unlike what the \nHouse did in having a document out early. They will bring out a budget \nthat day, and I guess we will commence to try to vote on it.\n  I don't think that is a healthy way to succeed. We are facing the \ngreatest financial risk, maybe, this country has ever faced. The \nPresident appointed a fiscal commission--we call it the debt \ncommission--cochaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who were \nappointed by the President. They wrote a document and presented it to \nus with their remarks, which said this Nation is facing the most \npredictable economic crisis in its history. In other words, they are \nsaying the path we are on is so unsustainable that it is easy to \npredict that we are facing and heading toward a financial crisis.\n  There is no higher duty or responsibility for Members of the Congress \nof the United States than to protect the people of this country from a \nforeseeable danger. When asked by Chairman Conrad when we might have \nsuch a crisis, Mr. Bowles said it could be 2 years, a little less or a \nlittle more. We could have a financial crisis like the one Greece had, \nor another recession, a surge of inflation, or a surge in interest \nrates. Senator Simpson, cochairman of the commission, said he thinks it \ncould be 1 year.\n  The S bond evaluators warned that they could downgrade our debt. In \nfact, Moody's, in December, warned that they could reduce the rating of \nthe American debt in less than 2 years. We are in a serious \nunsustainable position. We haven't even had a budget. Well, the \nPresident is required by law to submit a budget. Every President does.\n  I asked, when he made his State of the Union Address, that he would \naddress and discuss the danger we are in, why the Nation needs to \nreduce spending, why it is not some partisan brouhaha but a real threat \nto the future of the country, and why it is that we must take steps to \npull back. He really did not do that in his State of the Union Address. \nHe talked about investments and more investments.\n  Then I asked that he produce a budget that helps get us over the \nunsustainable path. I was never more disappointed in the President's \nbudget. He claimed it would save $1 trillion over 10 years. How much is \nthat? Well, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which \nobjectively analyzes these things, the deficit will increase, at the \nrate we are spending, over the next 10 years, $14 trillion.\n  What is saving $1 billion? Not nearly enough to get us off the \nunsustainable path. The debt commission recommended a $4 trillion \nreduction in spending, which was not enough, either. This was his own \ncommission that he appointed. That was not enough. But at least the \nnumbers were fairly honest. The President's numbers, unfortunately, \nwere not even honest.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analyzed his budget, and they \nconcluded that it would not reduce the projected increase in debt by $1 \ntrillion, from $14 trillion to $13 trillion. What CBO said was that it \nwas worse. It would add to the debt $2.7 trillion over the CBO \nbaseline. I said at the time that it was the most irresponsible budget \never presented. Maybe someone can find somewhere in the distant past a \nmore irresponsible budget. But when we know we are facing debts and \ninterest rates the likes of which we have never seen before, we need to \nrecognize that we need to make changes. His budget did not change. For \nexample, his budget called for a 10.5-percent increase in educational \nfunding. It called for a 9.5-percent increase in the Energy Department. \nIt called for a 10.5-percent increase in the State Department. It \ncalled for a 60-percent increase in spending for the Transportation \nDepartment, without any real source of revenue to pay for it, in order \nto have a monumental new program to build high-speed rail and other \nitems. We do not have the money. The inflation rate is not above 3 \npercent, and we are getting double-digit increases when the country \ncannot afford the path we are on. It is unbelievable, really.\n  After taking great heat from objective observers, the President made \na speech. He had a paragraph or two in this speech about the reason we \nneed to have some restraint and reduce spending and why we could not \njust invest, invest, invest, why we needed to restrain spending. That \nwas in his speech. At least he acknowledged it a little bit, although \nit was not the detailed, serious engagement of the American people in a \ndiscussion as to why we cannot continue at the pace we are on. It was \nnot sufficient to my way of thinking. Maybe I am biased. I do not think \nso. I do not think he has done that.\n  In fact, when the Republicans in the House proposed reducing spending \nthis year, he steadfastly opposed it. We have a pattern with the \nPresident. He says he is for doing something about the debt path we are \non. He opposes any specific action that actually makes a difference in \nthat regard. Then, finally, when they were dragged kicking and \nscreaming into saving $300 billion over 10 years, the President took \ncredit for it as if it was his idea when they have been opposing it all \nalong.\n  The Democratic leader here proposed a $4 billion reduction in \nspending, which was nothing. I am worried about where we are heading, \nhow serious we are.\n  The Senate Republican budget staff has looked at the President's \nspeech\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nand tried to see what is in it and see where we could go from there. \nWhat they found is that it does not reduce spending by $4 trillion. His \nframework, as he called it, to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion would \nactually grow the deficit by $2.2 trillion above the Congressional \nBudget Office baseline.\n  The American people deserve an honest, fact-based budget. Instead, \nthe President's deficit speech was the biggest gimmick yet. An analysis \nof the President's April 13 speech exposes the falsity of the claim \nthat this new framework would result in a $4 trillion reduction in the \ndeficit. The announcement reveals that the President's framework is \nsimply a rhetorically repackaged version of the budget he submitted on \nFebruary 14, a budget that the CBO estimated could actually worsen our \ndeficits by $2.7 trillion.\n  The committee staff has concluded that the President's framework, \ncompared to the current CBO baseline, would now worsen the debt by $2.2 \ntrillion over 10 years. The President's speech is a sleight-of-hand \nprocess that creates the impression of bringing new deficit reduction \nmeasures to the table without actually doing so, leaving us at bottom \nwith the original flawed proposal, only presented in language that \nseems to be new.\n  Here is how the process worked in the speech and how we analyzed it. \nI believe this is a fair analysis of it.\n  One, he offers the same proposals in his framework as his formal \nbudget submission but uses new language.\n  Two, he assumes savings from his February budget that the \nCongressional Budget Office has already found to be bogus. He continues \nto assume savings that the objective Congressional Budget Office says \nare not legitimate savings. If you score savings in your budget, you \ncan claim you made savings when you have not. We have seen that time \nand time again. In fact, it is one reason this government is in so much \ndebt.\n  CBO, by the way, is a bipartisan group, but its leaders are selected \nby the Democratic majority. They have the majority. This is a group who \nis not hostile to the President, but they have rejected many of his \nclaims of savings.\n  Three, it calculates the savings over 12 years. Everybody has been \ntalking about 10 years. He submitted a 10-year budget. To make his \nnumbers look better, he extends it to 12 years and claims more savings \nthan otherwise would be the case if you are comparing apples to apples \nand oranges to oranges--a 10-year budget.\n  He adds long-term savings from the just-passed continuing resolution. \nHe claims credit for the spending reductions the House of \nRepresentatives forced on us. Some said it was not nearly enough. That \nis really true. They had proposed saving about $800 billion over 10 \nyears. By the time Democratic resistance had gone forward and the \nPresident had resisted, we ended up with only about a $300 billion \nsavings over 10 years. He claims credit for that in his numbers.\n  As the analysis demonstrates, the framework in his speech offered no \nnew proposals beyond the dangerously flawed February budget. Even if he \nused their own estimates that have been discredited by CBO, the \nframework still falls an astonishing $3.2 trillion short of what the \ndeficit commission he appointed recommended.\n  Perhaps this is why the White House has been unwilling to heed the \ncall of the Senate Budget Committee Republicans. We wrote the \nPresident. He has a huge staff over there who works every year on \nproducing a budget. We said: If you made a speech now and if you \nchanged what you had in your budget, translate that into a new budget \nand send it to us. We had that done in the past a number of times. They \nrefuse. Why? Because a speech is more generalized, it is harder to \nscore, it is harder to analyze, and when you put it into actual print, \nit can be analyzed, the numbers can be totaled, the deficits can be \ncalculated, and you find out whether it actually does anything \nworthwhile. They refuse to do it.\n  As it stands now, we have no plan to have any real reduction of the \ndeficit we are facing from this administration or the Democratic \nSenate, let alone a framework to reduce it by $4 trillion. But they \npretend it is so, and that is offensive. The American people are not \nhappy about it. They know this Senate and this Congress have a \nresponsibility under the law and under any morality and decency to \nproduce a budget that says what we are going to do with their money the \nnext year and how much deficit we are going to incur, how much debt we \nare going to increase. They have a right to see that. All we have seen \nis a pushback and lulling and talk of that kind.\n  So we are heading to it. We are heading to a budget situation in the \ncommittee next week. I hope we will. And I think Senator Conrad, our \nDemocratic chairman, will submit a budget better than the President's \nbudget. Surely it will be. I cannot imagine it will not be \nsubstantially better than the budget the President has submitted. But \nthe question is, Will it be enough? They have already blamed Paul Ryan \nand the House Budget Committee as being Draconian, ideological, and \nunreasonable with their budget which would reduce spending $6.2 \ntrillion in honest numbers that they have laid out and defended \npublicly, which actually confronts some of our long-term spending \nentitlement programs and tries to get them on a rate of growth not \nquite as high as it currently is. They are trying to bring this country \ninto a financially sound position.\n  I do not think the House budget probably goes far enough in the first \n10 years to bring our debt under control, but it is an honest, \nrespected document that every objective commentator has praised. Mr. \nBowles himself said: If you disagree with Mr. Ryan's budget, at least \nit is honest, and you need to put your own out there with the same \ndegree of honesty as he did. Mr. Bowles was President Clinton's Chief \nof Staff, the man chosen by President Obama to head his fiscal \ncommission.\n  This will be perhaps the most important budget in decades--maybe \never--because our debt situation is deep. It is not easy to get out of \nthe fix we are in. A lot of it is driven by long-term commitments we \nhave made that are unsustainable. We have to confront that honestly and \nfind out how to deal with it in a way that is fair and just.\n  They say: We cannot cut spending. We need more money for education, \n10.5 percent. The State Department needs more money, 10.5 percent. The \nEnergy Department needs more money, a 9.5-percent increase--this year \nthey are proposing, commencing with the October 1, 2012, budget. That \nis the number the President has submitted. We do not have it.\n  I ask some of the Members of this body to call Governor Cuomo in New \nYork or Governor Christi in New Jersey or Governor Bentley in Alabama. \nHe just announced he was having to reduce spending by 15 percent, \nprorate the spending for the rest of this fiscal year by 15 percent. I \nfeel as though that is a message that has been lost in this body.\n  I see my colleague Senator Klobuchar here. I wanted to share these \nremarks this morning.\n  I believe the Vice President is meeting with some people--House and \nSenate Republicans and Democrats today. Maybe it will be budget No. 3, \nand maybe the Vice President can fix something. I hope they gave him \nthe responsibility and the freedom to make a decision, or have they \ntold him he cannot cut spending in any significant way? I don't know \nwhat they will tell the Vice President, but hopefully something will \ncome out of that and maybe we can get on a better procedure.\n\n  At this rate, at this point in our process, we are not in a good \nposition. I am worried about it. Hopefully, we can reach some \nagreement. If not, we are going to fight it out on the floor of the \nSenate, of the House, and in conference committee. We are going to \nchange the debt course of this Nation because the American people are \ngoing to demand it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been nearly 3 years since gas \nprices were as high as they are now. Back in July 2008, they peaked at \nabout $4 per gallon. We are approaching $4 per gallon for gas today. \nThe average price in Minnesota is $3.94 per gallon, and the\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\npeak driving season is right around the corner.\n  Back in 2008, I heard from many Minnesotans--from seniors who \ncouldn't afford to drive to their pharmacies to pick up their \nprescription drugs, from workers who couldn't afford to drive to work, \nfrom middle-class moms and dads who had to cancel their summer \nvacations--who couldn't go up north because gasoline was just too high \nfor their budgets.\n  Although it wasn't the only factor, these high fuel prices of 3 years \nago helped to push our economy into a deep recession. We don't want \nthat to happen again. One of the things we learned 3 years ago is that \nrising oil prices were not simply the result of supply-and-demand \nmarket factors. In fact, the dramatic runup in gas prices was due in \npart to rampant price speculation by people who had no business being \nin the oil market.\n  These were not airlines or trucking companies or other businesses \nthat actually need and use oil and gas and who trade in futures in \norder to protect their businesses against volatility in the oil market. \nNo, the most frenzied price speculation was by Wall Street traders and \nhedge fund managers who would never actually touch a drop of oil. They \nwould never use it in their businesses. To them it was just numbers on \na computer screen. They were trying to game the system to make some \nquick profits and then take the money and run, all at the expense of \nthose people in Minnesota or Ohio who are standing there at the gas \npump watching those numbers add up.\n  It is interesting; if we take a look at the gas prices in Minnesota \nback in 2008--we can, in fact, find it on MinnesotaGasPrices.com--\nbetween July and the end of the year, prices dropped from $4 to $1.60 \nper gallon. Numerous experts have concluded that underlying supply-and-\ndemand fundamentals can't account for the sharp rise or decline in \nprices.\n  For example, in the first 6 months of 2008, U.S. economic output was \ndeclining while global supply was increasing. But when we look at the \ncost of oil during that time, it just doesn't match up.\n  In June of 2007, oil cost $65 per barrel. A year later, in June of \n2008, it reached $147 per barrel. It was down to $30 in December of \n2008 and back up to $72 in June of 2009. Even if supply and demand \nwere, over the long run, pushing up the price of oil, that alone \ncouldn't explain the massive volatility in the market.\n  Looking back, we now know much of the dramatic decline in oil prices \nwas the result of Wall Street speculators fleeing the oil market \nbecause the spotlight had finally been put on them. In other words, the \nheat was on, and it got too hot for them to stay.\n  But here we are today, 3 years later, and the price of a gallon of \ngas is nearly $1 higher than it was 10 months ago. Once again, I am \nhearing from Minnesotans who are being squeezed by high prices--\nfamilies, farmers, and businesses large and small.\n  There is no doubt some of these prices can be attributed to reduced \nproduction from countries such as Libya and Egypt. There is no doubt we \ncan increase domestic production of oil, whether in North Dakota, our \nneighboring State, where they literally have doubled their production \nof oil over the last few years, or in Louisiana. Increased domestic \nproduction takes time and, in any case, the impact on prices would not \nnecessarily change things--nowhere near what we are seeing right now \ndue to speculation.\n  That is why a few months ago I wrote to Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission Chairman Gary Gensler urging him to make swift and strong \nimplementation of speculation limits that were included in the Wall \nStreet reform legislation we passed last year. This legislation \nauthorizes the commission to impose limits on the size of speculative \npositions in oil futures markets by investors who are not bona fide oil \ntraders. These ``position limits'' are designed to limit market \nmanipulation and make sure the oil market is operating fairly according \nto supply and demand. We don't want to see Wall Street speculators \nfurther drive up oil prices in the coming months.\n  We also know short-term solutions will only go so far. That is why I \nhave been focused on a long-term energy strategy, a strategy that will \nprovide incentives for our innovators, investors, and entrepreneurs to \ninvest in solutions for our energy future.\n  In 2008, I helped push through the Commerce Committee, along with a \nnumber of my colleagues, the first update to our fuel economy standards \nin decades. These rules, which are now in place, are expected to save \n1.8 billion barrels of oil, about three times as much as Libya produces \nevery year. I am also continuing to work on policies that will increase \nour homegrown energy production.\n  It is important to note that studies suggest that biofuels can \nprovide relief at the pump. A recent study from the University of Iowa \nindicates that from 2000 to 2010 competition from ethanol reduced \nwholesale gasoline prices by an average of 25 cents per gallon, saving \nAmerican consumers an average of $34.5 billion each year.\n  During the gasoline price runup in 2010, the impact of ethanol on \ngasoline prices was substantially larger, reducing gasoline prices by a \nnational average of 89 cents per gallon and by $1.37 per gallon in the \nMidwest. Biofuels are the largest and best alternative to imported oil. \nIn fact, we produce more biofuels in this country than we import \ngasoline from Canada, our largest source of foreign imports.\n  That is why in March I introduced new legislation with Senator Tim \nJohnson that would significantly boost our Nation's biofuels production \nand biofuels infrastructure while also providing long-term standards \nfor increasing renewable energy production and major energy efficiency \nimprovements.\n  First, our bill would provide consumers with more choices at the gas \npump by expanding biofuels infrastructure and increasing alternative \nfuel vehicles. Specifically, it would expand the availability of \nblender pumps that are capable of dispensing different blends of \nethanol and gasoline. It would provide loan guarantees to build new \nbiofuels pipelines and would also require half of the cars produced in \n2015 to be flex-fuel vehicles--natural gas-powered, electric-powered, \nor hybrid vehicles.\n  Second, to help offset costs, the bill would phase down and \neventually phase out the ethanol tax credit. This credit is serving its \npurpose of helping to reduce the price of gasoline and reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil by providing consumers choices at the gas \npump. But it won't be necessary forever.\n  Lastly, the bill would create the first national standards for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency along the lines of Minnesota's \n25-percent-by-2025 standard and a 1-percent annual improvement in \nefficiency.\n  If I could note, our State has an unemployment rate that is \nsignificantly below the national average--two points below the national \naverage. A lot of that has to do with our farm economy, a lot has to do \nwith our innovative companies, but we have done it all with a renewable \nstandard in place--25 percent by 2025. We have done it all with a \nsignificant push on ethanol and biofuels and wind and solar. So I say \nthis can be a model for the rest of the country.\n  Our Nation as a whole has an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent. Gas \nprices are approaching record levels. We continue to send $730 million \na day to foreign countries--many of which have been known to funnel \nmoney to terrorists--to meet our basic fuel needs. That is $730 million \na day for fuel that we send to other countries. I think we should be \ninvesting in the farmers and the workers of the Midwest instead of the \noil cartels of the Mideast. But whether it is biofuels plants in the \nMidwest, electric car factories across this country, electric car \nbattery factories in the Chair's home State of Ohio, that is the \nfuture. It is not continuing to send millions of dollars a day to the \nMideast.\n  Each of the provisions in this bill have some support from both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and I am hopeful the bipartisan spirit of \nthis bill can help advance a serious bipartisan discussion about \nthoughtful solutions to rising gas prices. The key is that everyone \nneeds to realize that inaction is not an option; that bumper sticker \nslogans will only result in our kicking the can down the road. This is \nabout putting sensible limits on speculation that doesn't affect \nlegitimate companies\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nthat are legitimately hedging their risks. This is about a \ncomprehensive energy plan for the future that includes drilling in \nMinnesota and other parts of the country but also includes natural gas, \nincludes hydro, includes geothermal and wind and solar and biofuels. \nThat is what this is about.\n  If we learned anything from Japan--and I support nuclear energy in \nthis country, and I think that should be in the mix as well--it is that \nwe don't want to rely too much on any one source of energy. This idea \nof looking regionally and looking across the country at different \nsources of energy is key as we go forward.\n  During these challenging economic times, we can no longer put our \nheads in the sand and pretend this isn't happening. Talk to anyone who \nis filling up their car at the pump now. Talk to anyone who wants to go \nto their cabin in northern Minnesota for the summer every weekend. They \nwill tell you it does matter. Now is the time to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2709-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2709-S2712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, at some time in the not too distant \nfuture--there is some speculation about exactly when--our country will \nbe dealing with the issue of exceeding our borrowing authority. In \nother words, we have maxed out our credit card. That would be the \nequivalent for the average family when they can't borrow any more \nmoney.\n  So what happens in that event is that Congress has to take action. \nCongress essentially has to raise the country's borrowing authority. It \nis called raising the debt limit. We are coming up on that point in \ntime. It could happen sometime in the July-August timeframe. There is \nsome uncertainty as to exactly when that happens, but the point is it \nwill happen.\n  The reason it will happen is because we have now accumulated $14.3 \ntrillion in debt, and we have hit the limit, the cap, that exists today \non our borrowing authority.\n  Now, $14.3 trillion in the abstract is hard for most people to wrap \ntheir heads around because it is such a massive number. If we translate \nit into individual terms, it amounts to about $46,000 for every single \nperson in the United States, which in and of itself is an astonishing \namount.\n  Our projected deficit this year is $1.425 trillion, which is the \nlargest ever, in nominal terms. According to CBO, it is the second \nlargest as a share of the economy, literally, since World War II. That \nis as much debt as we ran up from our Nation's founding, going back to \nthe origin of this country up until 1984 or the equivalent, just in \nthis one single year that we are going to rack up in terms of the \ndeficit. The interest on that amounts to about $213 billion every \nsingle year or nearly $700 for every person in the United States. That \nis assuming interest rates stay at these historically low levels.\n  While the deficit spending is, in fact, something that will merely \ndelay taxes in the future that somebody is going to have to pay, at \nsome point this is going to have to be paid off, and that burden, in \nall likelihood, is going to fall on our children and grandchildren. But \nit is not just something we will have to deal with down the road \nbecause the implications today, the real-time implications of this \nlevel of spending and debt, are very real for the economy.\n\n  There is a great body of research that has been done. A study done by \neconomists Reinhart and Rogoff found that countries with a debt-to-GDP \nratio of more than 90 percent grew at 1 percentage point less than they \nwould have otherwise. That is a body of research that looks at nations \nover the last half century. It even goes back further than that but \nparticularly in the last half century and particularly developed \nnations that have gotten up to that level of debt that exceeds 90 \npercent of GDP. That is where we are today, 93 percent government debt-\nto-GDP ratio here in the United States.\n  If you take that assumption that anytime you reach that debt level \nand you sustain it over a long period of time, it costs you a single \npercentage point of economic growth every single year, according to the \nPresident's own economic team, that results in the loss of about 1 \nmillion jobs. If you think about the real-time implications of this \nlevel of spending and debt, it means we are losing about 1 million jobs \nevery single year in the economy.\n  You cannot say this is something down the road, that we can continue \nto kick the can down the road. The fact is we are running out of road. \nWe keep kicking the can, but we are at the end of the road. If we do \nnot take steps now, not only is it going to put a crushing burden of \ndebt on future generations and jeopardize the very foundation of our \neconomy, it is going to have real-time implications today, not just in \nthe future.\n  I suggest that as we look at this issue of the debt limit coming up, \nit presents a unique opportunity. I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, Republicans and Democrats, can come together. If we do not \nbring this debt-to-GDP ratio back down, we are going to continue to \nsuffer from these job losses, and the impact of that is really very \nclear.\n  When the government is out there borrowing more money, it crowds out \nprivate investment, so there is less money for private companies and \nindividuals to invest in companies, equipment, plants, housing, \ntraining, all those sorts of things, and it spends money on government, \non things that are probably less efficient, less necessary, more \nduplicative, oftentimes downright wasteful when it comes to the \nprograms and the projects that end up being funded. It means instead of \ninvesting, having funding for new factories for people to work in, we \nhave more bureaucrats in places such as the EPA or the National Labor \nRelations Board who are coming up with all kinds of new regulations \nthat are making it more difficult for our small businesses to create \njobs. We have more unnecessary Federal property being underutilized \nthat the private sector could use more efficiently.\n  Unfortunately, the risk to our economy that comes from this out-of-\ncontrol spending is more than just that, it is more than just the \ncrowding out of private sector investment and the stifling effects of \ngovernment regulation. We are beginning to face the very real \npossibility that our country could face a fiscal crisis. Former \nChairman Greenspan has suggested that the risk of this occurring in the \nnext few years is nearly 50-50--an alarming thought. Likewise, Standard \n& Poor's recently warned of a possible downgrade to the U.S. credit \nrating in the next 2 to 3 years, when they came out with their \nassessment of U.S. credit, and said they have attached a negative \nassessment to it. In most cases--at least in a majority of the cases--\nwithin a year's time, that leads to a downgrade of credit rating. That \nwould be disastrous for a country such as ours which has always taken \ngreat pride and has been the rock out there when it comes to an AAA \ncredit rating.\n  It is notoriously difficult to predict ultimately when a debt crisis \nmight occur, but it would be inexcusable for us to continue to spend at \nthese elevated levels without assuming there is even the slightest hint \nof a risk that this could be very devastating to our country, let alone \nthat risk could be very high. But if it were to occur, we would need \ndrastic spending cuts to drag ourselves out of this fiscal crisis, \nspending cuts that by today's standards would probably be unimaginable.\n  But the worst effect of this would be the deep recession it would \nthrow our economy into. Think about that. If we did have a debt crisis \nin this country, what would that mean? For most people, it is going to \nmean higher interest rates, it is going to lead to countless job \nlosses, pay cuts for a lot of people if you have job losses, and \nprobably significant loss of savings, which would take a terrible toll \non the American people. Those are many of the implications of a debt \ncrisis and the implications it would have on the economy--starting, as \nI said earlier, with higher interest rates. It would make it more \ndifficult for people to borrow money for a home, for a car, for their \nbusiness. All those sorts of things would be impacted.\n  But that does not have to be the case. The reason it does not is \nbecause most experts have suggested--and it is really true--that this \nis the most predictable economic crisis we have ever had. It is not as \nthough we don't see it coming. You see all the warning signs out there. \nYou see all the red flags out\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nthere. It is looking us right in the face. We have an opportunity to do \nsomething about it, but it will require that we have the political \ncourage to take on this issue of Federal spending.\n  Next week, we are going to have an opportunity in the Budget \nCommittee to mark up the 2012 budget, which, incidentally--the budget \nyear starts in a mere 5 months from now. I hope this budget will focus \nprimarily on cutting spending because I think that is the primary \ndriver of our deficits. I am concerned that, instead, it will merely \ncontinue to spend too much, borrow too much, and tax too much.\n  Of course, last year, even though there was a markup in the Budget \nCommittee, there was never a budget brought to the floor of the Senate. \nThe Congress never passed a budget. Nor was there one brought to the \nfloor of the House of Representatives. There was not even a vote on a \nbudget in the House or the Senate last year. We have a $3.8 trillion \nenterprise called the Federal Government that did not even pass a \nbudget.\n  I believe the most fundamental responsibility we have to the \ntaxpayers of this country is to come up with a plan about how we are \ngoing to responsibly use their tax dollars, to indicate to them that \nthey can expect a good return from those tax dollars by the way we do \nour budget. Frankly, that did not happen last year. I certainly hope it \ndoes this year, but it is going to take some leadership here in the \nCongress. In the House of Representatives, the Republicans have the \nmajority. They did pass a budget out of the House. I hope the Senate \nDemocrats here will also put a budget on the floor that we will be able \nto vote on and amend and have a meaningful discussion about spending \nand debt and what we are going to do to get this country back on a path \nof fiscal sustainability.\n  The President, I think you could argue, punted when it comes to the \nissue of spending and debt, first by saying: I am going to appoint a \ncommission to look at this issue. The economists studied it for several \nmonths and came out with some findings and ultimately a report in which \nthey put forward a series of recommendations for dealing with the \nfiscal crisis. The President sort of distanced himself from those \nrecommendations, chose not to take those or to really engage with that \ncommission and its recommendations, and then subsequent to that \nsubmitted a budget this year which, ironically, did not do anything to \naddress the long-term issues of spending and debt but, rather, \nincreased spending over the next decade, massively increased the debt, \nand increased a lot of taxes on small businesses in this country that \nare job creators. So you did have this issue: borrowing, spending, and \ndebt continually being advanced and put forward by this President and \nby many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle here in the \nCongress.\n  The House Republicans put out a proposal that has been criticized by \nsome, but at least they have put forward a plan. They have engaged the \nissue of what we are going to do to rein in out-of-control spending \nboth in the near term but also in the longer term with the entitlement \nprograms--Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid--which represent 60 \npercent of all Federal spending. If we do not rein those programs in or \ncome up with a way of reforming those programs so they are viable, when \nthe 80 million baby boomers retire, we are headed for a train wreck. It \nis inevitable. You cannot, with the numbers facing us and the kinds of \ndeficits we are already running, the amount of debt we have already \naccumulated, in any way assume we can get out of this crisis absent \ntaking on these issues and coming up with meaningful reforms for Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. Whether or not you subscribe to or \nlike the proposals that were put forward by the House Republicans, at \nleast there is a plan out there.\n  There are a number of suggestions being bandied around here in the \nSenate. There is a gang of 6 that is looking at some recommendations. \nAs I said, there is going to be a markup we think next week in the \nSenate Budget Committee. There is now this new commission the President \nhas appointed to look at the issue of, as we approach the vote on the \ndebt limit, what we can do to address spending and debt. But, frankly, \nwe do not have at this point anything in front of us that does deal \ndirectly or meaningfully with this issue of out-of-control spending or \ndebt. I hope some of these discussions are fruitful, that they lead to \nresults, and that they at least put alternatives out there we can \ndebate and discuss. But as of right now, the only proposal we have in \nfront of us is the one put forward by the House Republicans. Again, \nwhether or not you like it, it has created a discussion in this country \nabout what we are going to do to fix our fiscal problems.\n  I believe we ought to at a minimum go back to 2008 spending levels \nbecause if we did that, it would take us back to a time before we had \nthese massive runups or increases in discretionary spending. In the \nlast 2 years, we have seen discretionary spending increase by well over \n20 percent at a time when inflation in the overall economy was a mere 2 \npercent. So Federal spending was increasing literally 10 times the rate \nof inflation over the last 2 years. It makes sense to me that in this \nfiscal environment where our deficits are literally about $1.5 trillion \nevery single year as far as the eye can see, the least we can do is \nrestrain spending and cut it back to that level we were at in 2008, \nbefore we had this massive runup in spending. I think that is a \nstarting point.\n  I believe we also ought to be looking at the entitlement programs, \nwhich, as I said, have trillions of dollars literally of unfunded \nliabilities. Medicare alone is a $38 trillion unfunded liability. We \nare currently on a path where that will bankrupt the Nation if we do \nnot make changes.\n  It strikes me, at least, that you have not only some issues that deal \nwith the near-term spending issues but also those longer term spending \nissues. In the near term, as I said, if we went back to 2008 levels, we \nwould at least tighten our belts a little bit in a way that I think \nmost Americans would find to be responsible. But the longer term issue, \nthese entitlement programs, have to be taken up.\n  There are a series of proposals that would deal with that, one of \nwhich is a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That, \nfrankly, is something I support. I have supported it since I was in the \nHouse of Representatives; I have been a cosponsor of that. In fact, \nwhen I first got to Congress back in 1997, there was a vote here in the \nSenate on a balanced budget amendment which failed by one vote. It \nwould take 67 votes in the Senate--two-thirds of the Senate--to approve \na balanced budget amendment. It failed by one vote.\n  I assume, had it passed at that time in the Senate, we would have \nbeen able to pass it in the House of Representatives because we did \nhave large majorities and we could have sent it on to the States. It \ntakes 38 States to ratify it, but since most States already have \nbalanced budget amendments in their constitutions, I suspect they would \nlike to see their Federal Government operate with the same sort of \nfiscal discipline. But it did not pass at that time. I cannot imagine \nhow different our world would be today had it passed 15 years ago and \nhow different this fiscal picture would have looked because it would \nhave put a straitjacket on Washington, DC--something we desperately \nneed. Congress needs discipline imposed upon it. It has not \ndemonstrated historically the capability to deal with these fiscal \nissues absent some sort of mechanism that puts a straitjacket on the \nCongress so it cannot spend money.\n  The balanced budget amendment is something I think we ought to have a \ndebate about, and I hope we do. In the lead-up to the vote on this debt \nlimit, this is one of the proposals we hope to have considered.\n  As I said before, there are so many States around the country that \nhave balanced budget amendments to their constitutions. Our State of \nSouth Dakota is a good example. In the State of South Dakota, the \nlegislature cannot go home until the budget is balanced. That is a \nrequirement. Many States across the country have that same sort of \nrequirement. It is an imperative that requires these States every \nsingle year to put their books in order. That is something which is \ndesperately lacking here in Washington, DC, and I hope, again, we could \nenact a balanced budget amendment.\n  There are several that have been proposed. I am a cosponsor of a \ncouple of\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\ndifferent versions of that, but we have 47 Republicans who are on a \nbalanced budget amendment, and I hope our colleagues on the other side \nwill join us in at least bringing that to a vote, putting it before the \nAmerican people, and engaging them in a debate about how best to solve \nour Nation's fiscal problems. I think they would agree that a balanced \nbudget amendment is a very simple, straightforward way in which to do \nthat.\n  I also believe we ought to reform our budget process because it is \nclearly broken. We have a dysfunctional budget process when we cannot \npass a budget, when we have a $3.8 trillion enterprise such as the \nFederal Government and we do not even pass a budget. In most years, \ntypically, we have--if there is a budget that passes, the \nappropriations bills that follow it are supposed to be completed by the \nend of the fiscal year, on September 30. Those deadlines routinely are \nmissed.\n  Typically, what happens is we end up with a big so-called omnibus \nspending bill at the end of the year that wraps all the various \nappropriations bills into one massive spending bill, which I do not \nbelieve serves the taxpayers very well. It certainly does not allow us, \nas Members of Congress, to do the appropriate oversight that we should \ndo on various individual agencies of government.\n  When we throw it all into one big spending bill, as so often happens \naround here, we lose the transparency and the accountability that is \nnecessary to an effective functioning government. So I believe we ought \nto reform the budget process.\n  One of the ways I would do that is to go to a biennial budget. \nInstead of passing a budget every single year, we would do it every \nother year. We do it in the odd-numbered years, the years when people \nare not running for reelection. Because what happens in a year when \npeople are running for reelection is they decide the best way to gain \nthe favor of the voters is to provide more money for this particular \nprogram or this program or this constituency or that constituency. As a \nconsequence, there is a momentum to spend more and more money. It \nstrike me that one of the ways we could address that is to do a budget \nin the odd-numbered years when Members of Congress are not running for \nreelection. Then, in the even-numbered years, when they are, we look at \nways of not how can we spend money but how can we save money. We do \nmore oversight, which is something that is desperately lacking, because \nmany of these Federal programs and agencies so often times sort of do \ntheir own thing, absent the appropriate level of oversight. I believe \nwe have a responsibility, as Members of Congress, with whom the \nlegislative responsibility, the power of the purse is entrusted by the \nConstitution, to do the right types of oversight.\n  I came across recently a good example when the Government \nAccountability Office came out with a report. In that report they \nreferenced several different programs. In fact, they dealt with about \none-third of all Federal spending. But in examining that one-third of \nFederal spending, they concluded that there are all kinds of \nduplications and redundancies in Federal spending.\n  I will just give a couple by way of example. They discovered that \nthere are 82 programs, spread across 20 different Federal agencies, \nthat deal with the issue of teacher training, that are designed to \nfocus on the issue of teacher training.\n  Well, I suspect it is arguable about whether that is something the \nFederal Government ought to be doing in the first place, but it is \ncertainly--I think any American would agree--absolutely insane to have \n82 different programs in 20 different agencies doing the same thing.\n  Something else they discovered was that there are 56 Federal programs \nthat are focused on the issue of teaching financial literacy. I have \nsaid this before, and I mean it sincerely, of all places, Washington, \nDC, should not be leading or doing instructions on financial literacy. \nBut that being said, it is 56 programs spread across 10 different \nagencies. Do we need that?\n  That is the kind of thing that gets lost. That is the duplication and \ninefficiency and waste we all talk about. Yet, because we do not do the \noversight we need to, many of these things just continue year after \nyear.\n  Going to a biennial budget, where every other year we do a budget and \nthen in the even-numbered years, the election years, we are doing \noversight, we might actually think of ways to save money for the \ntaxpayers as opposed to spending it.\n  So a biennial budget, to me, makes sense. I would make the budget \nresolution we pass binding because right now it is not. As a \nconsequence, it often gets waived. I believe we need to have buy-in \nfrom the President. Right now, the budget resolution is passed by the \nHouse and the Senate, but the White House does not engage on that. So \nwe do not have teeth in this thing that holds everybody accountable \nwhen it comes to spending. Too often that gets waived.\n  We need to change the way we do things around here with regard to \ndeclaring emergencies. Right now, if we want to spend money outside the \nparameters of the budget, everybody says: Well, it is an emergency. So \ndeclaring an emergency has become the norm rather than the exception. \nIt has become the routine in the Congress. We have all these emergency \ndesignations which allow Congress to spend and spend. Again, there are \nnot any constraints. It is high time we change that.\n  So I would make a number of changes in our budget process, which I \nthink would lead to more transparency, more accountability, a more \nefficient, better-run Federal Government.\n  That being said, it is not the Federal Government that is going to \nlead us back to an economic recovery and getting people back to work. \nIt is the hard-working entrepreneurs, it is the small businesses, it is \nthe people in this country who roll up their sleeves every day and go \nto work trying to make this country stronger and more prosperous.\n  We are blessed because we have a nation that was founded on some core \nprinciples, one of which is economic freedom. We believe in free \nenterprise and free markets. It is a system that has worked \nextraordinarily well for this country. Look anywhere else around the \nworld to try and find a rival to what the hard-working entrepreneurs in \nthis country and those basic core economic principles have been able to \naccomplish. We cannot find one.\n  It is because of those four principles and the incredible ingenuity, \ninnovation, creativity, and hard work of the American people that we \nhave the greatest economy in the world. But that economy, as I said, is \nvery much in jeopardy if Washington does not get its spending habits \nunder control. Because we continue to crowd out private investment, we \ncontinue to make it harder for entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n  As we talk about the whole issue of spending and debt, one final \npoint I would like to make--because there is this discussion right now \nabout whether there ought to be tax increases. Everybody says: Well, \nrevenues are down relative to historical averages. That is true. But \none of the reasons I believe revenues are down is because there are \nliterally trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines in this country \nthat are not invested because of the economic uncertainty based upon \npolicies coming out of Washington--uncertainty about tax policy, \nuncertainty about regulations.\n  We have this tax and regulatory environment that is paralyzing the \nAmerican economy. So businesses out there that have funds they could \ndeploy, capital they could put to work in this country, are not doing \nit because they are worried about what Washington might do next.\n  We have tax policy that is going to expire at the end of 2012. It is \nvery hard to make decisions when tax policies are temporary. It is very \nhard to make decisions when you do not know what that regulatory agency \nis going to do to you next. They have consistently--these regulatory \nagencies--come up with more and more ideas about how to make it more \ncostly, more expensive, more difficult to do business in this country.\n  I have alluded to a couple. The EPA is a good case in point. It is \none that comes into play a lot in my State of South Dakota because we \nare primarily an ag economy and small businesses. Many of those \npolicies are directed at production agriculture and energy development \nand all those sorts of things\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nthat allow our economy in my State to grow and to prosper.\n  So I think one of the reasons tax revenues are down, people are not \ninvesting. When they are not investing, they are not turning those \nresources over. They are not taking realizations, and they are not \npaying taxes. We need to get investment capital put to work. We need to \nget people put back to work. The best way to do that is to provide \neconomic certainty: tax policies, regulatory policies that are \nreasonable and that provide incentives, not disincentives, for \ninvestment.\n  Today, we have tax and regulatory policies that are doing absolutely \nthe opposite. They are discouraging investment, and, as a consequence, \nI think we have a lower level of revenues. But the real problem, the \nreal problem, is not revenues, it is spending. That is abundantly \nclear.\n  If we look at where we have been for the last 40 years in terms of \nwhat we spend as a percentage of our overall economy, that average is \nabout 20.6 percent. That is a 40-year average, historical average, we \nspend on our Federal Government as a percentage of our entire economy. \nThis year we will spend 25.3 percent of our entire economy on just the \nFederal Government.\n  That does not include spending on State and local governments. When \nwe add that up, it is over 40 percent of every $1 we spend in this \ncountry is spent on government. So what we see is the government is \ngrowing relative to our total economy, and the private economy, those \nfolks out there who are creating the jobs in our private economy, is \nshrinking relative to the size of the government. That is a trend we \nhave to reverse. It starts with getting spending under control. This is \nnot a revenue problem. This is not a tax problem. As much as many of my \ncolleagues would like to make it that, we flatly cannot look the facts \nin the face and come to any other conclusion but that spending in \nWashington is out of control, it has to be reined in.\n  We have to attack the issue, not only of discretionary spending--the \npart we annually appropriate for--but these entitlement programs which \nif not addressed are not only going to bankrupt the country but ensure \nthat there is not a Medicare Program and a Social Security Program \navailable to future generations of Americans.\n  These are very tumultuous times. There is a lot of uncertainty. I \nthink the jobs numbers that came out this morning again point to how \nfragile this economic recovery is. It is so dependent upon good, sound \npolicies coming out of Washington. For better or worse, small \nbusinesses, entrepreneurs now, unfortunately, tend to be partners with \nWashington, DC, because there is so much policy coming out of here, \nwhether it is tax policy, regulatory policy, that impacts their bottom \nlines every single day.\n  We need to get out of the way to keep those taxes low, to get Federal \nspending under control, to make sure the regulatory framework in which \nour businesses operate represents the minimum level and not the maximum \nlevel that we can do to make it more difficult for small businesses to \ngrow and to create jobs. If we can do those types of things, address \nthe issue of spending and debt, take it on in a meaningful way, deal \nwith this issue of reforming our Tax Code and making sure our tax rates \nstay low on businesses in this country and make sure regulations and \nregulatory policies coming out of Washington, DC, are not the \nimpediment they are today to investment and job creation, I think we \ncan get this country back on track.\n  But that is where it starts. If we want to create jobs, if we want to \ngrow this economy, if we want to make it more prosperous and stronger \nfor future generations, those are the steps, in my view, we have to \ntake. I hope we get started soon. I do not think we can afford to wait.\n  A lot of people around here think these are all political exercises \nthat we will go through the hoops and the motions, and we will wait to \nsolve this until after the next election. We cannot afford to wait. The \ntime is now. If we do not do it, we are going to put in great peril \nfuture generations and their ability to enjoy the same standard of \nliving, the same quality of life we have enjoyed.\n  That is not fair to them. That is why I believe the time to start is \nnow and the time to get this budget process--not only the reforms of \nthe process but the spending restraints in place--is today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I was presiding, before the \nsenior Senator from Missouri took my place, and was listening to two of \nthe last three speakers talk about their budget religion, if you will. \nI think about this. I think we have to look at a little bit of his \nhistory.\n  I do not think I need a lecture on balancing a budget. I was in the \nHouse of Representatives in the 1990s when, without one Republican \nvote, we passed President Clinton's budget. We had a huge budget \ndeficit in those days. That budget began us on the path to a balanced \nbudget.\n  I supported a balanced budget amendment in the mid-1990s. By 2000, \nthe year President Clinton left office, we had the biggest budget \nsurplus in American history. Then, in 2001, at the push of President \nBush and his Republican colleagues in both Houses, this Congress passed \na major tax cut, mostly for the wealthy in 2001; another major tax cut, \nmostly for the wealthy in 2003, both of which I voted against.\n  President Bush, with intelligence that was not especially sound--\nbeing gentle about it--took us into a war with Iraq, did not pay for \nit; took us into a war with Afghanistan, did not pay for it. I voted \nagainst the war in Iraq.\n  In 2003 or 2004, he pushed through Congress by one vote--I remember I \nwas in the House of Representatives opposing that bill, when they kept \nthe rollcall open for 2 hours or longer that night. President Bush was \non the phone with recalcitrant members of his party in the House of \nRepresentatives--pushed through a Medicare bill that was a bailout to \nthe drug and insurance companies in the name of Medicare privatization, \nwithout paying for it.\n  President Bush leaves office then, leaving the largest budget deficit \nin our history--going from the largest budget surplus, written, by and \nlarge, by the Democrats, because Republicans did not play ball with us \nduring most of the 1990s. Then, after President Bush and the Republican \nleadership in many of those years, House-Senate, President Bush left us \nwith the biggest budget deficit in history.\n  When I hear this revisionist history on the Senate floor--I was not \neven going to talk about this today. But I heard two colleagues, for \nwhom I have respect, one from Alabama, one from South Dakota, talk \nabout this budget deficit in a way that simply is historically \ninaccurate--in the name of this deficit, and we have to deal with this \ndeficit.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is focused on that. A lot of us are \nfocused on that. We have to deal with this deficit. But you don't do \nthe same thing over again where you give big tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans and then privatize Medicare. That is what they are doing. \nThey are cutting health care, saying it is not sustainable, whatever \nthat means, and giving major tax cuts to the rich, and we are saying \nthat is not sustainable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2712-S2714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING NATIONAL TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I wish to talk about teachers. In my State, the \nlegislature just passed something called SB 5, and the Governor in Ohio \nsigned it. It was a direct assault in many ways on the teaching \nprofession.\n  The discussions I hear from conservative politicians and their allies \nin the media--and they have many on editorial boards, especially in \ncentral Ohio--and the lack of respect they show for people who choose \nto teach as a profession is mind-boggling. We trust our children to \nteachers, yet we attack them--or too many politicians attack them.\n  I am going to make it personal. I am going to start with my mom. My \nmom was a high school English teacher born in Mansfield, GA, in 1920. \nShe taught in the era of segregation in Florida and Georgia. Raising my \ntwo older brothers and me in Mansfield, OH--she met my dad coming back \nfrom World War II, ending up in another Mansfield at the end of the \nwar--she taught in an era of a growing American middle class. Like\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\nteachers throughout our history, she taught her students and her sons \nthat education is a gateway to opportunity, that it can integrate a \nsegregated nation and create a prosperous nation.\n  At a time when our Nation needs our teachers the most, when our \neconomy needs our students to succeed, it is appropriate to remind \nourselves--in spite of this background noise I hear from so many \nconservative politicians about teachers' unions and about teachers who \ndon't care, about teachers taking off in the summer and being done at 3 \no'clock and all the kinds of attacks they like to make on teachers, I \nthink it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of our \nteachers.\n  This week, our country recognizes National Teacher Appreciation Week \nto give thanks and gratitude to teachers across our country to whom we \nentrust our children and who have made a difference in our lives.\n  Let me share a few stories about great teachers in Ohio.\n  Linda Michael of Pomeroy, OH, in Meigs County, down on the Ohio \nRiver, works with homeless students from K-12 to make sure they have \nequal access to the same education as other students, from Head Start \nto preschool to doctor referrals. She locates students in shelters, \nmotels, and homes of relatives to make sure they have what they need: \nhousing assistance, clothing, food, utilities, and mental health. Is \nthis a teacher who quits at 3 o'clock and doesn't work during the \nsummer? This is above and beyond the call of duty that most of us do in \nour society. Imagine growing up homeless, going to school, not having \nyour own room, not having a room to share with your sibling, not having \na place to go at night. We need teachers to take care of them. We need \nto do better as a society, but teachers are really a safety net for \nthese children.\n  Michelle Rzucidio-Rupright is an elementary school teacher in \nCleveland. For her, teaching is not a 9-to-5 job. It means going to \nhomeless shelters after school where her students live. It means buying \nsupplies out of her pocket for her students in the classroom. She is a \nrole model in the community.\n  I know Senator McCaskill talks to teachers a lot and hears these \nthings. How many teachers tell us they reach into their pockets? These \nare not Wall Street bankers. They are making sometimes as little as \n$35, $40, $45, $50,000 a year. Do we Senators reach into our pockets \nand buy folders for our office or buy pens? Do Senators do that? Do \nmost businesspeople reach into their pockets to take care of these \nchildren? So many teachers do, to buy construction paper--the ones who \nteach grade school--to buy pens, to give kids money for lunch \nsometimes. Clearly, teachers play a role most people in this country \ndon't play.\n  David Fawcett is a Columbus drama teacher. He has helped generations \nof new immigrants and low-income students see something greater in \nthemselves--more than just a poor immigrant child trying to make it. He \nencourages students to learn language and speech and culture through \nlines of a play or a musical, through elocution lessons under his \nguiding presence. He is another teacher who focuses on the individual \nunique needs of a child who may have been born in another country and \nmay have parents who don't speak English. That child has different \nchallenges from what I had with educated, English-speaking parents in \nMansfield, OH, with lots of ideas and privileges. I was taught by my \nparents to read before I started kindergarten because I was smarter \nthan other kids because I had parents who knew that mattered for me to \nget ahead and for the advantages I had. Mr. Fawcett clearly focuses on \neach child's individual, unique personality needs, situation, all that.\n  John Keller is a government teacher in Orange, a suburb 15 miles east \nof Cleveland. Mr. Keller addresses the complexity of a subject with the \nsimplest of tools: a sense of humor. He engages students as soon as \nthey walk in the classroom, ensuring a passionate debate and empowering \nstudents to always stand up and speak out about the world around them. \nHe makes them laugh. What better way to teach than engaging the \nstudents, having a big personality and making people laugh, and \nsometimes the teacher himself, I am sure, being the butt of the jokes, \nthe humor about himself.\n  Deb Lammers and Paul Lenz, teachers in Miller City in Putnam County, \nOH--one of Ohio's smallest counties, southwest of Toledo--are the kinds \nof math teachers every student deserves. They are patient and kind. \nThey adapt teaching skills to student needs, arriving early and staying \nlate. Again, all this stuff: Oh, teachers quit at 3'oclock; teachers \ndon't work in the summer. All of this kind of thing from conservatives. \nWhy they don't like teachers is beyond me, but why so many conservative \npoliticians attack teachers for all kinds of things, I don't even \npretend to understand. But Ms. Lammers and Mr. Lenz, teaching in Putnam \nCounty OH, arrive early and stay late, being accessible to students \nwhenever they need help.\n  Delette Walker is a retired grade school teacher in Shaker Heights. \nFor decades, she helped children overcome the insecurity of shyness, \ninstilling in them the confidence to read out loud, to sing in a \nmusical to confront their fears. We know how young children--I have \nfour, my wife and I do. And when they were young--they are not so shy \nnow, but when they were young, they were fairly shy, and they had \nteachers who helped bring them out of their shell sometimes. As \nparents, we try to do that, with some success, but I have watched \nteachers with my own children. I have watched them help them believe in \nthemselves, particularly young girls. I wanted to teach my daughters \nthat they could accomplish anything--anything--and the fact of their \ngender, especially in that generation a few years ago, especially when \nI was a kid--girls were treated differently, and girls were not \nexpected to achieve the way boys did or in too many cases the way boys \nwere expected to. I saw teachers, with my own daughters, help them \nbelieve in themselves and in a big, important way. That is what Ms. \nWalker did, now retired, but with grade school children she taught in \nShaker Heights.\n  Diane Skelley, Vicky Hilliard, and Pat Carson are high school \nteachers in West Carrollton, OH, outside of Dayton. Through the written \nword, chemistry equations, or musicals, they are teachers who encourage \nstudents to try harder and reach higher, never to doubt one's talents. \nI know a young woman in my office was taught by these three teachers, \nand I know she believes she can--I know her parents too--take on the \nworld and grow and learn something that women maybe a generation or two \nago might not have been so successful at, and Diane Skelley, Vicky \nHilliard, and Pat Carson--all three of them at West Carrollton helped \nher achieve that and helped countless others in Montgomery County in \nsouthwest Ohio to move forward, whether it was in English, music, or \nchemistry.\n  Vicki Speakman was a Grandview high school teacher. Grandview is \noutside of Columbus. She was a Spanish teacher, a dedicated mother, a \nbedrock of the community. She was diagnosed with cancer. Ms. Speakman \nremained a constant presence at games and concerts, never missing a \nchance to share a smile, tell a joke, reach out to a lonely student. \nTen years ago next month, she lost her fight with cancer, but, like all \ngreat teachers, her memory lives in the countless students whose lives \nare better because of her--not just her memory but the impact she had \non these students. Whether they think of Ms. Speakman every day or \nevery week, they live a life differently because of Ms. Speakman. That \nis true with so many of these teachers.\n  When I think of this teacher--and I did not know Ms. Speakman, but \nwhen I think of her presence at ball games and school plays and I think \nof so many teachers I had at Mansfield Senior High School--my junior \nhigh was one that will probably make the pages here today laugh. The \nname of my junior high school was Johnny Appleseed Junior High School \nin north central Ohio, where Johnny Appleseed, 200 years ago or so, \nused to go around--it was a peculiar life he lived. He went around a \ncountry that was totally forested planting apple trees. But to each his \nown. He became a legend as a result. But I remember, in grade school \nand junior high and high school, so many teachers who would come to our \nplays. I played basketball in eighth grade and played baseball and \nbasketball in high school. I would see teachers--not just the coaches \nbut teachers--come to the games, the Friday\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nnight basketball games or the Tuesday afternoon baseball games or the \nschool plays on Saturday. They were part of the community, cheering on \ntheir students, not showing favorites but caring particularly for \nstudents who were a little more shy or a little less talented who might \nneed a bump up or encouragement from their teacher.\n  The same goes for Jackie Geary, who taught reading for nearly 45 \nyears in Dayton. She was the matriarch of a family of educators. Her \nhusband Mike is a professor at the University of Dayton, one of our \ngreat universities in Ohio. Her daughter Beth is a special needs \nteacher for families of U.S. military personnel in the country of \nJapan. Aside from her constant smile and laughter, she reminded all who \nknew her that one of her great responsibilities was to read to a child \neach and every night. Jackie passed away last month after a long battle \nwith cancer. Up until her very last days, she insisted on teaching the \nmost valuable lesson of all: compassion and love and commitment.\n  Again, these are teachers who go above and beyond the call of duty \nnot just to collect a paycheck, not to go home at 3 o'clock, not to be \noff in the summer and not be a part of the community. Ms. Geary and Ms. \nSpeakman gave so much of their lives to their students. Both passed \naway, Ms. Speakman some time ago, Ms. Geary more recently. Both will be \nremembered, and their impact will be seen throughout.\n  Sandy Ryan is a special-ed preschool teacher in Cleveland. She first \ntaught special needs adults. She then went to college later in life to \nearn a master's degree to teach special needs children. She buys her \nstudents coats in the winter, supplies, including book bags, and coats \nfor children who can't afford them. Again, we don't pay teachers a lot. \nThey are barely in the middle class in terms of their income if they \nare a single parent and on a teacher's salary. Yet they reach into \ntheir pockets. This isn't just buying pencils and pens and occasional \nlunch money; this is a teacher who buys coats in the winter sometimes \nfor her students because she teaches in a low-income area.\n  Ms. Donna Marie Shurr is a high school teacher in Oberlin. She \npartners with local and international projects--water projects in the \ncommunity, to building homes in Jamaica, to schools in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. She inspires students to believe that education is \ncontinuous and service is a lifelong pursuit that extends beyond the \nclassroom. She is a teacher who, by showing by example, teaching by \nexample, helps these students navigate the rest of their lives. They \nhave a commitment to service beyond the classroom, beyond their \nworkday, beyond their family, a commitment to service in the community, \nand it doesn't stop at our borders. With Ms. Shurr from Oberlin, not \nfar from where I live, it is international also.\n  Ms. Dean Blase is an English teacher at Clark Montessori School in \nCincinnati. I visited Clark last year. It was a finalist for the \ncompetition for President Obama to deliver its commencement speech, \nlosing out at the last minute to a school in Michigan. Teachers such as \nMs. Blase instill values of curiosity and wonder in their students from \ndiverse backgrounds, encouraging academic achievement and community \nservice.\n  Teachers are counselors, coaches, mentors. They serve as surrogate \nparents. They are friends of students at the right time. They are \nadvisers, they are cheerleaders, they are partners, they are--fill in \nthe blank--that any of us can do because we have had good teachers in \nour lives. They so often go the extra step. They drive talented pupils \nto competitions and scholarship interviews. They are an essential part \nof our communities.\n  Yet, in Ohio, SB 5 is an amazing thing. It basically takes away \nrights from teachers, collective bargaining rights. I know teachers--\nwhen they collectively bargain, they sit down at the school board and, \nsure they negotiate for decent wages, health care, and a pension, but \nthey also negotiate for class size.\n  I was talking to a teacher at a roundtable at a church right off \nCapital Square a couple of months ago, and she teaches in a Columbus \nsuburb. But she talked about in negotiations how they negotiate class \nsize because she knows, no matter what she is paid or no matter what \nbenefits she has, she wants to be a very good teacher. She cannot be as \ngood a teacher if there are too many students in the classroom because \nshe cannot give them the kind of individual attention she would want to \ngive them.\n\n  Yet the Governor, the legislature, because of this ideological \nmission they are on, want to bust teachers unions, they want to, \napparently, downgrade the respect teachers have in the community. Maybe \nthey think they should become bankers or doctors or lawyers so they can \nmake more money. I do not know why they think that.\n  But what that means is--I am tired of hearing parents tell me and \nyoung people tell me: My daughter or I or whoever was going to be a \nteacher, and they were studying at Miami University or Ohio University \nor Toledo or Hiram College, whatever, and they decided--when they hear \nall these politicians, conservative, mostly Republican politicians, in \nOhio, Columbus, downgrading teachers and criticizing the profession of \nteacher--they think: Why do I want to do that? I am not going to make a \nlot of money. If I am not going to have any respect from the people who \nrun my State, why do I want to be a teacher--in spite of the fact they \ndid want to be a teacher.\n  I am also hearing from young teachers who are now in the classroom \nwaging these fights that it is not easy teaching kids who do not have \nmuch advantage, it is not easy teaching kids who have discipline \nproblems, it is not easy teaching kids whose parents are not \nparticularly engaged for reasons of dysfunctional families or income or \nall the reasons parents are not as involved as we would like them to \nbe. It is hard enough to do that without a bunch of Republican \nconservative politicians criticizing the profession in saying: They \nquit at 3 o'clock, they do not work in the summers, they are lazy, \nwhatever they say about them.\n  So I wished to talk about teachers who have affected my life. Most of \nthese teachers I have mentioned have taught people in my office. We \nwalked around the office and said: Tell me about some teachers. Almost \nevery one of these teachers is somebody who has helped to produce \nstars, absolute stars, in my office. That is one reason I wanted to \nshare their stories, and I wanted to share their stories because I \nthink most of us who are fairminded--unless we are elected to \nlegislatures and rightwing politicians--most of us care about \neducation, most of us care about teachers, most of us appreciate what \nteachers gave to us, most of us honor them and respect them.\n  But you are not honoring and respecting teachers, you are not \nhonoring and respecting perhaps the most important profession in this \ncountry, when you take away their rights, when you downgrade them, when \nyou go after their unions in the name of some ideological mission you \nare on. It is tragic, and I am sorry. I apologize for them and their \nbehavior to the teachers of Ohio and teachers around the country. It is \ntoo important a profession to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I come to the floor to honor a man who touched every \ncorner of my home State of Oregon. Harold Schnitzer left his mark on \nour business community, the arts, health care, education, and \npractically every nook and cranny of my home State.\n  Harold Schnitzer died last week of complications relating to cancer \nand diabetes. He learned of his impending death earlier this year and \nfaced it with extraordinary style, grace, and the wit that marked his \n87 years of life.\n  Those who knew Harold Schnitzer describe him in one of two ways. Many \nknew him as a powerful and philanthropic force in our State. Others \nknew him as approachable, easygoing, and especially as a person who \nnever took himself all that seriously. I knew him\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nin both ways, and I knew him as a friend.\n  Like many in Oregon, I am saddened by Harold's passing. Harold was a \nsuccessful real estate developer. He and his wife of 62 years, Arlene, \ngave generously to my alma mater, the University of Oregon, and to \nPortland State University. They established the Harold Schnitzer \nDiabetes Health Center at the Oregon Health Sciences University. Their \ngifts of art and financial support helped transform our Portland Art \nMuseum into a center for regional art works.\n  The generosity of Harold and Arlene can be found throughout Oregon in \nplaces such as the Oregon Zoo, a special favorite of my children, Lewis \nand Clark College, the Mittleman Jewish Community Center, the Oregon \nSymphony, the Oregon Ballet, and the Portland Opera. A centerpiece of \nOregon's art community is the beautiful Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall \nin our downtown Portland community. It is affectionately known as ``the \nSchnitz.''\n  Harold Schnitzer was a humble man, and he came from humble roots. As \na boy, he earned 25 cents a week polishing metal in his father's \nPortland scrap yard. From there it was on to the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology for a degree in metallurgy, and then he went on \nto a career in real estate.\n  Certainly, our colleagues from the bay area of California know who \nHarold Schnitzer was because with great pride he restored the historic \nClaremont Hotel Club and Spa in Berkeley to its former glory. In true \nHarold Schnitzer fashion, when he sold the hotel in 1998 the proceeds \nprovided the funding for two family charitable foundations.\n  We have lost a man, but, fortunately, we have not lost his vision and \nhis generosity. His wife Arlene will continue to stand for those kinds \nof good works in our home State, and their son Jordan, a successful \nbusinessman in his own right who shares his parents' passion for \nphilanthropy, continues every single day to look for opportunities to \nserve our home State. You can look no further than the Jordan Schnitzer \nMuseum of Art in Eugene and downtown Portland's Simon and Helen \nDirector Park, named for his maternal grandparents.\n  What I liked most about Harold Schnitzer was his very wry sense of \nhumor and particular knack for summarizing the events of our time. I \nremember often when I would see him after a particularly spirited \ndiscussion in the Senate. Harold had a great interest in politics and \nwas a devout consumer of all the Sunday morning talk shows. After a \nparticularly volcanic debate in Washington, DC, about some issue where \nit seemed nothing could get resolved, I would go home and be out and \nabout, perhaps at the grocery store in Portland, and I would see \nHarold. He would tug on my elbow and say: I have been watching what is \ngoing on in Washington, DC, Ron. Got things pretty much worked out back \nthere, do you?\n  He would kind of chuckle and sort of express perfectly his sense of \nthe irony of the challenges we have in Washington, DC. He knew somehow \nwe would always get through them. Whenever I was around Harold, I got a \nsense that he really captured some of the irony of what goes on in \nWashington, DC, very well. He brought that same kind of approach and \nthat light touch and combination of humor and irony to so much of what \nhe did.\n  In my view, Harold Schnitzer represented what was good in humanity. \nHis legacy of good works is going to go forward. But for all those who \ndidn't know him personally, didn't know him like I had the chance to, I \nwanted to take just a few minutes to tell the Senate and our country \nthat Harold Schnitzer was a very special man. In my view, he was what I \ncall a vintage Oregonian--somebody who got up every day and tried to \nmake our State and country a better place. He will be greatly missed.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are many issues which come before \nthe Senate, and some are simple and some are complex. The issue I am \ngoing to speak to today is one which you are personally aware of, Mr. \nPresident, as the Senator from West Virginia, and one that more and \nmore Members are becoming aware of. It is the question of interchange \nfees or swipe fees.\n  For those who do not follow this closely, every time we use a credit \ncard or a debit card in the United States of America, the retailer or \nmerchant we do business with pays a fee to the bank that issues the \ncard. The fee is established by the major credit card networks, Visa \nand MasterCard. They tell the banks how much they will receive each \ntime a customer uses these cards.\n  What it comes down to is the fee that is being charged, the debit \ncard fee, has become a subject of controversy. Let's go back in history \na little bit. I can still remember when people used checks, and some \nstill do but not as frequently. Now we use the plastic form of a \nchecking account. Instead of writing out a check and pushing it through \nthe banking system, and for a few cents watching it be processed, we \nuse a debit card. A debit card draws money directly out of our checking \naccounts to the merchant we are doing business with.\n  So the debit card has, in fact, by a large measure, replaced checks--\nand in many instances replaced cash--as more and more people are using \nplastic for transactions. So I started hearing from merchants and \nretailers all around the United States about the fee that was being \ncharged for debit card transactions.\n  Now, debit card transactions are different from credit card \ntransactions in this respect. When I use my credit card, I am going to \nbe billed each month for what I put on my credit card. There is a \ncollection issue: Will Durbin actually make his monthly payment? Will \nhe make it on time? Is he able to make the payment? And there is a \nquestion about whether this is going to be processed.\n  So there is, I guess, an uncertainty involved in credit card \ntransactions and much less so when it comes to debit card transactions \nbecause that money is coming directly out of our checking accounts to \nthe merchant. So in terms of risk, there is greater risk with a credit \ncard than for a debit card. Nevertheless, over the years what we have \nseen is the swipe fee, or fee charged to a merchant for the use of a \ndebit card, keeps going up, up, and up.\n  People would say: Well, why don't the merchants and retailers bargain \nwith Visa, MasterCard, and the banks to make sure they do not have to \npay an increasingly large fee every time a person uses a debit card?\n  The answer is they have no power to bargain at all. Not at all. So \nthe retailer, the merchant, ends up accepting the debit card, swiping \nthe debit card, paying for the transaction, and then paying a fee, to \nthe point where one would ask: Well, how much of a fee is it?\n  The average debit card fee, found by the recent study of the Federal \nReserve, is about 40 cents a transaction. Now, 40 cents may not sound \nlike much if someone is buying a television--of course, though, it is \ngoing to be a percentage fee--but think about 40 cents if a person \nstanding in front of you in line at the airport is buying a package of \nbubble gum. That 40 cents is all the profit that retailer could ever \nexpect, and it is going right out the window. In fact, they are losing \nmoney on the transaction because of the debit card.\n  So for years retailers and merchants, restaurants, convenience \nstores, hotels, charities, universities, went to Visa and MasterCard \nand said: You cannot keep just raising this fee. It is not fair to us. \nYou are not justifying it in terms of the costs of doing business, and \nwe are paying more and more out of each transaction, even though the \ncost has not gone up.\n  Basically, Visa and MasterCard told them: Go take a hike. We are \ngoing to charge what we want to charge. Take\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nit or leave it, buddy. If you do not want to take plastic, that is your \nbusiness. Try to do business without it. You cannot.\n  So retailers and merchants were on the losing end of this \nconversation. So they came to me and said: Is there a way to do a study \non this issue and determine what is fair? So a few years ago I joined \nwith Senator Bond of Missouri, and the two of us, on the credit card \nreform bill, asked for a public Fed study on fee and cost information. \nWell, it turned out the banking industry did not want any study at all. \nThey killed our amendment for a Fed study and told people--all the \npeople in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans--vote against even a \nstudy of the swipe fee, the debit card interchange fee.\n  So we ended up empty handed. The day came last year when we revisited \nthe issue. This time I came to the floor with an amendment and said: \nHere is what I would like to do. I would like to give to the Federal \nReserve the power to promulgate a rule which says the fee charged for \nthe use of a debit card is going to be reasonable and proportional to \nthe costs incurred by the bank in processing this transaction. We are \ngoing to put in a factor for fraud. If there is something they need to \nadd to take care of fraud, add it in. We went a step further. We said \nthis is not going to apply to every bank and credit union that issues a \ndebit card. We are going to exempt the overwhelming majority of \ncommunity banks and credit unions across America.\n  There are about 15,000 community banks and credit unions across the \nUnited States---15,000. So we said: If your bank or credit union has a \nvaluation of less than $10 billion, you are not covered by this \nreasonable and proportional law. You are exempt. At the end of the day, \nit meant that about 100 banks across America were subject to this new \nlaw and three credit unions. All the rest are exempt.\n  So you say: Well, Durbin, if you exempted all of these banks and \ncredit unions, almost 15,000 of them, and you only affected about 100 \nof them, how can this have any impact? Well, it turns out, of the \nlargest banks in America, three of the big ones--that would be Chase, \nWells Fargo, and Bank of America--really comprise nearly half of all \nthe debit card transactions in the country. Some say even more, 60 \npercent or even more. So by just making this a law that applies to the \nlargest banks, we are affecting the majority of debit card \ntransactions, and we are establishing a reasonable and proportional fee \nfor what the transaction is.\n  So the retailer and merchant, the person running the mom-and-pop \nstore or the person running a big box store is going to get fair \ntreatment in terms of how much is charged.\n  So you say to yourself: Well, how much are they charging now? The \nFederal Reserve estimates they are charging about 40 cents a \ntransaction, and the actual cost to the bank and the credit card \ncompany is about 10 cents. They are charging four times as much as they \nshould on each transaction.\n  How much money is it worth to the banks? The estimates range from \n$1.3 to $1.7 billion a month--a month. Now, these banks, the big banks \nthat I am addressing with this law, they are not having little \ncollections outside the bank to keep themselves in business. They are \nbringing in quite a bit of money. They are very profitable, and to say \nthat they should have a reasonable charge for retailers and merchants \nacross America, small businesses and large businesses alike, I do not \nthink is unreasonable. Remember, we exempted the community banks. We \nexempted the credit unions. It is only the big ones that are going to \nbe affected by this.\n  Well, one would think I had done the worst thing in the world to \nthese banks and credit card companies. They have unleashed, with the \ngreatest fury they can possibly put together on Wall Street, this \nattack against the Durbin amendment. They are sending out letters--\nChase is--to all of the people who have debit card accounts and credit \ncard accounts saying if this Durbin amendment goes through, we are \ngoing to charge extra fees here and extra fees there.\n  Well, at the end of the day, that is the threat that we always hear \nfrom them. The fact is, since they are virtual monopolies in their \nbusiness, they are increasing their fee charges regularly. People \nacross America know it. Every time we put in a reform, they race to \nraise their interest rates and race to raise their penalties. They give \nthese ``free'' checking accounts loaded with penalties if you stumble \nand do not pay on the exact day or whatever it happens to be.\n  So it has become quite a battle. It is a battle between Visa, \nMasterCard, and the biggest banks in America versus the retailers and \nmerchants of America. They are both engaged. Now, the retailers and \nmerchants cannot hold a candle to the big banks and credit card \ncompanies when it comes to their investment in this fight. But they are \ntrying valiantly, and we are organizing small businesses across the \nUnited States--in Illinois, West Virginia, all over the place--to step \nup and say: Come on. This is an important part of business.\n  Now, I ran into one of my colleagues on the Senate floor, and she \nsaid: What I am worried about is even if you reduce the fee charged to \nthe retailer for using the debit card, how is that going to help the \ncustomer? How is that going to translate into anything more than \nprofits for the business?\n  Well, Mr. President, in your family background, you have been \ninvolved in business. If you have a competitor across the street, \nwhether it is a gas station, a drug store, a grocery store, a \nrestaurant, you know your price competition is an important part of \nwhether a person chooses your store over the other store. So when you \ngive the owner of the store a break on the fee that is being charged by \nthe credit card companies and banks, then you give them an opportunity \nto engage in more price competition.\n  But what about Walmart? This is the monster of retailers in terms of \nsize, about 10 percent of all of the sales in America. I can tell you, \neven with Walmart, Target is looking over its shoulder. It is watching \nthe prices of goods and deciding whether it can be competitive. So \nthere is competition at this level.\n  If we give retailers a break when it comes to the amount they have to \npay to the banks and credit card companies, I think it is going to end \nup in consumer benefits. The consumer organizations, the major ones in \nthis town, support what I have done. They aren't supporting the \nposition of the big banks and credit card companies.\n\n  One of the arguments that comes down is interesting. The lion's share \nof the argument against my amendment is not coming from the people \ndirectly affected by it. We are not hearing as much in Washington from \nthose big banks on Wall Street or the credit card companies, and they \nare the ones most affected by it. Why? They don't have much credibility \naround here. These are the folks who came filing in for a bailout when \nthey made some pretty bad decisions and got billions of dollars from \nthe Federal Government to bail them out, and then, of course, they \nturned around and gave bonuses and all sorts of high-level compensation \nto their officers. So they are not the most popular crowd on Capitol \nHill. So they have brought in surrogates to argue their position, and \nthe surrogates, as my colleagues know, are the small banks and small \ncredit unions saying the Durbin amendment is terrible.\n  The first thing we have to say to them is: You are exempt. You are \nnot covered by the Durbin amendment. If you have $10 billion in assets \nor less, you are not covered. Still, they argue, at the end of the day, \nwe think this might hurt us.\n  I have taken an extra step, beyond the law, to try to deal with some \nof their concerns because I value these community banks and credit \nunions. I worry they have now become part of the banking industry--in \ncapital letters--instead of what they were traditionally: our \nneighborhood banks, our small town banks, our local credit unions. They \nhave now become part of this big banking industry thing. I don't think \nit is healthy for them, and I don't think it is healthy for the economy \nor for consumers. So what I did was go to the merchants coalition on my \nside of this issue, the retailers, and ask them to put out a statement \nof policy when it comes to whether they are going to discriminate on \nthe card that is presented.\n  Let me be more specific. If you are running a restaurant in Wheeling, \nWV,\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nand somebody walks through the door and puts a debit card--these are \nall debit cards--puts a debit card down to pay for the meal, will your \nrestaurant take a close look and say: Oh, that is a community bank with \na higher interchange fee than it might be with a card from Chase Bank, \nfor example? That is one of the concerns expressed by the community \nbanks and credit unions. Even though you exempted us, all these \nretailers could discriminate against us because our swipe fee is higher \nthan it might be coming out of Chase.\n  We ended up with a letter--an important letter--which I have shared \nwith every one of my colleagues, and it is a letter from the Merchants \nPayment Coalition, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Merchants Payments Coalition,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Dick Durbin,\n     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: We understand that some in the \n     financial services industry are claiming that the Durbin \n     Amendment exemption from interchange ``swipe fee'' regulation \n     for financial institutions with assets under $10 billion will \n     not be effective in practice because merchants will \n     discriminate against debit cards with higher swipe fees. On \n     behalf of the undersigned trade associations, and the tens of \n     thousands of merchants and retail locations we represent, we \n     are writing to make clear that we have no contractual or \n     practical ability to treat debit cards issued by small \n     financial institutions or credit unions differently than \n     those issued by large institutions. Furthermore, our member \n     companies are committed to customer service and it is not in \n     their interest to discriminate against debit cards that so \n     many customers carry.\n       Currently, merchants are subject to Visa and MasterCard \n     network rules that require us to accept all Visa and/or \n     MasterCard debit, regardless of which bank or credit union \n     issues the card. This is called the Honor All Cards rule and \n     we risk the threat of $5,000 per day fines--or higher--if we \n     break this rule, so we assure you that merchants have no \n     intention of violating this term of brand acceptance. These \n     rules also prevent merchants from pricing goods differently \n     based upon the financial institution that issued the card.\n       Additionally, even if these rules were not in place, \n     merchants have no practical ability at the point-of-sale to \n     distinguish between big bank and small bank cards, nor the \n     swipe fee rates associated with those cards. Indeed, in many \n     if not most retail environments, employees never see the face \n     of the card the customer is using: the customers swipe their \n     cards themselves.\n       Lastly, even if merchants could differentiate between card \n     issuers, there are no market or economic incentives to \n     discriminate against mid-sized and smaller financial \n     institutions' cards. If a customer wants to pay with a card, \n     merchants will let them use that card because the retail \n     industry is fundamentally all about competing to deliver \n     value and customer service. If merchants didn't accept the \n     card, they would risk losing the sale and losing the \n     customer; a risk very few in the competitive retail industry \n     are willing to take. Additionally, most consumers only have \n     one debit card in their wallet. We would absolutely prefer \n     they pay with that debit card, rather than with a credit \n     card, because while debit card per transaction rates have \n     grown exponentially over the past several years, credit card \n     swipe fees are far higher and continue to be a significantly \n     more costly burden on businesses of all sizes.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight \n     regarding the many misrepresentations being made about the \n     Durbin Amendment, and you have our commitment that the retail \n     community across the nation will do its part to help ensure \n     that the exemption of financial institutions with less than \n     $10 billion in assets from the swipe fee reforms on debit \n     cards will work in the marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Beverage Licensees; Coalition of Franchisee \n           Associations; Food Marketing Institute; Interactive \n           Travel Services Association; International Franchise \n           Association; National Association of College Stores; \n           National Association of Community Pharmacists; National \n           Association of Convenience Stores; National Association \n           of Shell Marketers; National Association of Theatre \n           Owners; National Association of Truck Stop Operators; \n           National Council of Chain Restaurants; National \n           Franchisee Association; National Grocers Association; \n           National Restaurant Association; National Retail \n           Federation; National Small Business Association; \n           Petroleum Marketers Association of America; Retail \n           Industry Leaders Association; Society of Independent \n           Gasoline Marketers of America.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me quote a few words from \nit. This is a letter to me, dated May 2:\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin:\n       We understand that some in the financial services industry \n     are claiming that the Durbin Amendment exemption from \n     interchange ``swipe fee'' regulation for financial \n     institutions with assets under $10 billion will not be \n     effective in practice because merchants will discriminate \n     against debit cards with higher swipe fees. On behalf of the \n     undersigned trade associations, and the tens of thousands of \n     merchants and retail locations we represent, we are writing \n     to make clear that we have no contractual or practical \n     ability to treat debit cards issued by small financial \n     institutions or credit unions differently than those issued \n     by large institutions. Furthermore, our member companies are \n     committed to customer service and it is not in their interest \n     to discriminate against debit cards that so many customers \n     carry.\n       Currently, merchants are subject to Visa and MasterCard \n     network rules that require us to accept all Visa and/or \n     MasterCard debit, regardless of which bank or credit union \n     issues the card. This is called the Honor All Cards rule and \n     we risk the threat of $5,000 per day fines--or higher--if we \n     break this rule, so we assure you that merchants have no \n     intention of violating this term of brand acceptance. These \n     rules also prevent merchants from pricing goods differently \n     based on the financial institution that issued the card.\n\n  The No. 1 complaint of community banks and credit unions about \ndiscrimination against their cards is addressed directly by this \nletter. I have made this a part of the Record. It is being sent to \nevery Member of the Senate.\n  There is a second part of this argument. The question is whether Visa \nand MasterCard, the networks, will continue to allow the community \nbanks and credit unions to charge a higher interchange fee than the big \nbanks. Under our law, there is no reason to change it. So I am \nchallenging Visa and MasterCard and these card networks to state \nclearly and unequivocally, as this letter has stated, that they will \nnot discriminate against these smaller banks, community banks, and \ncredit unions. The merchants have come forward as a matter of record, \nand it has been put in the Congressional Record this day, to say there \nwill be no discrimination. At the end of the day, if Visa and \nMasterCard will make the same promise of no discrimination, then \nultimately there is no disadvantage to the community banks and credit \nunions. None. Now the burden is on the big credit card networks to step \nup to the plate.\n  I am sending a letter today to the president and CEO of the Illinois \nBankers Association, the Illinois Credit Union League and the Community \nBankers Association of Illinois and we are going to send it to their \nnational affiliates as well, sending them a copy of this merchants \nletter so they can no longer make the claim that they are going to be \nvictims of discrimination by merchants and retailers and asking them to \nnow step up and join us in challenging Visa and MasterCard and the \nmajor card networks. That, to me, resolves the most fundamental issue \nthat has been brought to the Members of the Senate. They can no longer \nclaim that these retailers are going to discriminate against them. As a \nmatter of record, they will not.\n  I think it is important for us to change this system, and I think it \nis important for these virtual monopolies of Visa and MasterCard to be \nheld accountable. I think what we have done in passing this law and \ngiving the Federal Reserve the authority to establish this rule is the \nright thing to do.\n  Now there is a big effort afoot to stop us. The Presiding Officer \nknows that. They are lobbying such as I have never seen before on \nCapitol Hill. You would think there was $1 billion a month at stake, \nand there is. They are determined to stop the Federal Reserve from \nissuing a rule which says that retailers and merchants across America \nwill be treated fairly. They are going to stop them, if they can, and I \nam going to fight them all the way. I am hoping my colleagues who \njoined me in this vote and those who share my feelings about small \nbusiness across America will stand with me.\n  I know the alternative. The largest banks in America and the credit \ncard companies have a lot of friends, and they are very powerful, but I \nthink we ought to give the Federal Reserve the chance to issue \nreasonable final rules.\n  In fact, talk to any bank across the country, and they are going to \ntell you that the current system is working just fine. They don't want \nreform. They don't want any change. They\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nwant to keep it as is. It is worth billions of dollars to the major \nbanks to keep this charge as is, at the expense of businesses across \nAmerica.\n  I favor transparency and I favor competition and I wish we didn't \nhave to bring the Federal Reserve into this conversation. But we looked \nfor a neutral regulatory agency that would establish a reasonable and \nimpartial fee, promulgate a rule, issue it after a public comment \nperiod and implement it, and that is what we are striving to do.\n  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who is a friend of mine--or at least he \nused to be--Jamie Dimon, has called interchange reform downright \nidiotic. He spent a good portion of his recent annual shareholder \nletter criticizing this reform. Chase has also sent a letter to its \ncustomers warning about my amendment, and Chase is constantly \nthreatening to raise fees on its customers unless they stop the Durbin \namendment. A few weeks ago, I sent Jamie Dimon a letter and responded \nto some of his criticisms. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2011.\n     Jamie Dimon,\n     Chief Executive Officer and President, JPMorgan Chase & Co., \n         New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Dimon: In your recent annual letter to your \n     company's shareholders, you wrote a lengthy and dismissive \n     critique of the debit interchange fee reform legislation that \n     I drafted and that Congress enacted last year. You have also \n     been quoted describing my amendment as ``counterproductive,'' \n     ``price fixing at its worst,'' and ``downright idiotic.'' I \n     am compelled to respond, and I ask that you share this \n     response with your shareholders as well as your customers.\n       Clearly, debit interchange reform has displeased many in \n     the financial services industry. Your industry is used to \n     getting its way with many members of Congress and with your \n     regulators, and my amendment and the Federal Reserve's draft \n     regulations were not written the way you wanted. But that \n     does not mean they were written poorly or that the process \n     that created them was flawed. To the contrary, interchange \n     reform will carefully but firmly rein in the fee collusion \n     that your bank and thousands of other banks currently engage \n     in through Visa and MasterCard. The wisdom of this reform is \n     confirmed by the irrationality of the arguments that your \n     industry raises against it--arguments that are based upon \n     misrepresentations and threats rather than evidence or logic.\n       The American people deserve to know the real story about \n     the interchange fee system and the ways that banks in \n     general--and Chase in particular--have abused that system. I \n     have said and written much on this topic already, but I will \n     respond to five of your specific criticisms below.\n       1. Your letter claims that my reform amendment ``is an \n     example of a policy that has little basis in fact or \n     analysis.'' In fact, the amendment was drafted based upon \n     years of Congressional hearings, Government Accountability \n     Office reports, academic articles, and published studies by \n     the Federal Reserve's economists and payment system experts. \n     These analyses showed that the debit interchange system is \n     uncompetitive, inefficient, and harmful to consumers. Your \n     industry often acts like these analyses do not exist, so I \n     will explain what they reveal.\n       The debit interchange system is not a properly functioning \n     market. For years, card-issuing banks like Chase have agreed \n     to let the Visa and MasterCard duopoly fix the interchange \n     fee rates that banks receive from merchants each time a debit \n     card is swiped. The banks get the fees but they do not set \n     the fees. This system of price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard \n     on behalf of thousands of banks has gone entirely \n     unregulated.\n       There are two core problems with Visa and MasterCard's \n     fixing of interchange rates. First, centralized rate-fixing \n     does not give card-issuing banks incentive to manage their \n     operational and fraud costs efficiently. This is because all \n     banks in the network are guaranteed the same network-fixed \n     interchange rate whether they are efficient or inefficient. \n     Competition is absent and inefficiency is subsidized when \n     fees are set in this manner.\n       Second, Visa and MasterCard have incentive to constantly \n     increase interchange rates and there is no countervailing \n     market force to temper these fee increases. Visa and \n     MasterCard want as many of their debit cards to be swiped as \n     possible because they are paid a network fee by merchants \n     each time a card is swiped. By raising interchange rates, \n     Visa and MasterCard can entice banks to issue more of their \n     cards. Because Visa and MasterCard have enormous market power \n     and control around 80 percent of the debit cards in \n     consumers' wallets, merchants cannot realistically say no to \n     accepting Visa and MasterCard and have no leverage to \n     negotiate fee rates with them. There is no naturally-\n     occurring market force in today's interchange system that \n     would ever lead rates to go down.\n       So merchants are stuck with ever-rising debit interchange \n     fees that add up to more than $16 billion each year. These \n     fees not only affect merchants, but also universities, \n     charities, government agencies and all others who accepts \n     debit cards as payment. The fees end up getting passed on to \n     consumers in the form of higher retail prices for groceries \n     and gas. Consumers, and particularly unbanked consumers, \n     ultimately bear the cost of subsidizing the interchange \n     system.\n       We owe it to our nation's consumers and businesses to \n     ensure that the interchange system is efficient, transparent, \n     and subject to competitive market forces. Studies have shown \n     that Americans pay the highest debit interchange rates in the \n     world, and that these rates have continued to increase in \n     recent years. The Federal Reserve has also found that the \n     high interchange rates charged today far exceed what it \n     actually costs to conduct a debit transaction. Nearly every \n     other industrialized country has established reasonable \n     regulation over their debit systems, and these countries have \n     achieved improved efficiency, lower fraud, and consumer \n     benefits. The time has come for reasonable reform of the \n     dysfunctional U.S. debit interchange system, and my amendment \n     will make that reform a reality.\n       2. You say that ``it's a terrible mistake and also bad \n     policy for the government to get involved in price fixing.'' \n     Of course, my amendment does not create price fixing--it \n     constrains the price fixing that Visa and MasterCard \n     currently perform on banks' behalf. Visa and MasterCard \n     cannot simply be trusted to fix interchange prices in a way \n     that is fair for all participants in the debit card system. \n     They have not proven worthy of that trust.\n       Last year Congress decided that there should be reasonable \n     regulatory constraints placed on Visa and MasterCard to \n     ensure that they cannot use their market dominance to funnel \n     excessive interchange fees to the nation's biggest banks. A \n     strong bipartisan majority supported my amendment, which said \n     that if Visa and MasterCard are going to fix fee rates on \n     behalf of banks with over $10 billion in assets, those rates \n     must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing \n     the transaction. It is important to make clear that if Chase \n     wants to set and charge its own fees in a competitive market \n     environment, the amendment does not regulate those fees. The \n     only regulated fees are those fees that banks let card \n     networks fix on their behalf.\n       3. You criticize the law Congress passed because it does \n     not consider ``the cost of fraud.'' Your comment highlights \n     how the current interchange system, which supposedly does \n     consider the cost of fraud, creates exactly the wrong \n     incentives when it comes to fraud prevention. Fraud rates are \n     far lower for PIN debit transactions than for signature debit \n     transactions, but Visa and MasterCard set higher interchange \n     fees for signature debit than for PIN ostensibly to cover the \n     higher cost of fraud. Banks now urge cardholders to pay with \n     signature in order to get the higher fees. For example, on \n     April 21, 2010, the American Banker reported that your own \n     bank sent a mailing to your debit customers that strongly \n     suggested they should ``always select'' signature.\n       Chase's practice of steering American cardholders toward \n     fraud-prone signature debit stands in stark contrast to \n     Chase's practices in Canada. The Chase Canada website \n     indicates that ``chip and PIN technology will become \n     available for all Chase Canada MasterCard and Visa cards in \n     2011.'' Your Canadian-based subsidiary Chase Paymentech \n     Solutions says on its website that chip and PIN technology \n     provides ``Enhanced Security and Fraud Reduction--Chip \n     technology is virtually impossible to copy and combining its \n     use with a PIN helps reduce lost, stolen or counterfeit \n     transactions.'' It is frankly inexcusable that your bank \n     would urge your American customers to ``always select'' a \n     fraud-prone technology while you provide your Canadian \n     customers with technology that enhances security and reduces \n     fraud.\n       In contrast to the current U.S. interchange system which \n     rewards banks for promoting fraud-prone signature debit, my \n     amendment will allow interchange fee increases only to those \n     banks that successfully prevent fraud. The Federal Reserve \n     can implement this in its final rulemaking by setting target \n     fraud prevention metrics and allowing increased interchange \n     for banks that meet those targets.\n       4. You say that Chase needs debit interchange fees to pay \n     for the ``fixed costs of servicing checking accounts and \n     debit cards'' such as ``printing and mailing of the cards,'' \n     ``operational and call center support to service the cards,'' \n     and ``the costs of ATMs and branches.'' Here you are using \n     the old financial industry trick of first conflating the cost \n     of conducting debit card transactions with the cost of \n     offering other checking account-related services, and then \n     arguing that network-fixed debit interchange rates should be \n     used to cover this whole basket of costs. It is a clever \n     argument that aims to justify Visa's and MasterCard's \n     exorbitant price-fixed rates, but the shortcomings of this \n     argument are evident.\n       The costs you cite in your letter are costs which banks \n     should be incentivized to manage efficiently, and allowing \n     Visa to fix interchange fee rates across all its member banks \n     to supposedly cover these costs is a recipe for inefficiency \n     and excess. Card network companies like Visa are not \n     positioned to know what the appropriate level of cost is\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\n     for operating ``ATMs and branches,'' nor are they equipped to \n     determine how much of a particular bank's ``printing,'' \n     ``mailing,'' ``operational'' and ``call center'' costs are \n     attributable to debit cards instead of ATM cards or credit \n     cards. Further, Visa has no way of knowing if a particular \n     bank is using debit interchange revenue not to cover \n     legitimate costs but instead for rewards, ads, profit, or \n     executive bonuses. Indeed, because Visa itself profits by \n     incentivizing banks to issue more and more of its cards, Visa \n     has every incentive to inflate the interchange fees it fixes \n     to levels that compensate banks far in excess of their costs. \n     In order to correct these incentives for inefficiency and \n     excess, my amendment limits network interchange price-fixing \n     on behalf of the 3 biggest banks to an amount that is \n     reasonable and proportional to the costs that are necessary \n     to authorize, clear and settle a particular debit transaction \n     over the network's wires.\n       Also, your claim that interchange fees must be high enough \n     to cover all checking account-related costs is undermined by \n     the fact that banks also charge many other high consumer fees \n     under the premise of covering those exact same costs. Banks \n     like Chase charge consumers many fees for maintaining and \n     accessing funds in their checking accounts--monthly fees, \n     overdraft fees, failed payment fees, ATM withdrawal fees, \n     failure to maintain a minimum balance fees, account closing \n     fees, and more. Bank revenues from these consumer fees have \n     not gone down in recent years as interchange fee revenues \n     have gone up; to the contrary, bank revenues from consumer \n     fees have also reached record highs. I would draw your \n     attention to the November 12, 2008, Wall Street Journal \n     article entitled ``Banks Boost Customer Fees to Record \n     Highs'' and the July 1, 2009, New York Times article entitled \n     ``Bank Fees Rise as Lenders Try to Offset Losses,'' both of \n     which discuss your bank and other banks' efforts to raise \n     consumer fees long before my amendment was ever written.\n       5. You say that the amendment ``potentially will harm \n     consumers'' because ``banks will be forced to lose money on \n     debit interchange transactions and likely will compensate by \n     increasing fees in some way for deposit customers.'' This \n     threat defies both facts and logic.\n       First, there is no evidence that banks cannot continue to \n     offer debit cards profitably with reduced interchange. As \n     Andrew Martin explained in the excellent January 4, 2010, New \n     York Times article entitled ``How Visa, Using Card Fees, \n     Dominates a Market,'' up through the early 1990s banks used \n     to offer debit cards even though they received no interchange \n     fees. In fact, many banks used to pay merchants for accepting \n     debit cards, because debit cards saved money for banks when \n     compared to the banks' costs of processing paper checks. The \n     current high-fee debit interchange system in this country \n     only developed because Visa entered into and took over the \n     debit market the mid-1990s through an antitrust violation, \n     and Visa then imported credit card-type interchange fees into \n     the debit space. Studies have shown that many other countries \n     enjoy vibrant debit systems with interchange fees strictly \n     regulated or prohibited entirely. In short, past experience \n     in this country and present examples in other countries \n     demonstrate that banks like Chase can easily continue to \n     offer debit card services without the excessive subsidy of \n     high interchange fees.\n       Second, if Chase follows through on threats to increase \n     consumer fees (beyond those increases you have already made \n     in recent years), market competition would suggest that many \n     of your deposit customers would take their business \n     elsewhere. In fact, many of those customers would likely take \n     their business to the small banks and credit unions who are \n     exempted from my amendment's interchange fee regulation and \n     for whom Visa and other debit networks have already agreed to \n     set a higher tier of interchange rates. And for those who \n     continue to speculate that my amendment will hurt small banks \n     and credit unions, I recommend they read Simon Johnson's \n     excellent analysis in the April 7 New York Times entitled \n     ``Big Banks Have a Powerful New Opponent.''\n       In conclusion, I recognize that Chase will likely see \n     decreased revenue from interchange reform, but I urge you to \n     keep some perspective. Last year Chase had $17.4 billion in \n     profits--up 48 percent from the previous year--and a 15 \n     percent profit margin. Your own personal compensation \n     ``jumped nearly 1,500 percent to $20.8 million in 2010'' \n     according to Reuters. In contrast, middle-class American \n     families are struggling to get by in a tough economy--an \n     economy that went south because of the banking industry's \n     unregulated excesses.\n       There is no need for you to threaten your customers with \n     higher fees when you and your bank are already making money \n     hand-over-fist. And there is no need to make such threats in \n     response to reform that simply tries to spare consumers from \n     bearing the cost of interchange fees that are anticompetitive \n     and unreasonably high.\n       Interchange reform is necessary and it is long overdue. \n     Right now the Fed is working diligently to craft a set of \n     final regulations that will reflect the comprehensive \n     information it has gathered and that will respond to the \n     valuable comments it has received. In the coming weeks I am \n     confident the Fed will produce a reasonable set of reforms \n     that will enhance the efficiency, competitiveness and \n     fairness of the debit system. This will neither be \n     ``counterproductive'' nor ``idiotic.'' It will be good news \n     for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J. Durbin,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I haven't had a reply yet from \nMr. Dimon. He called me. I called him back. That seems to be the end of \nour exchange. But I would like to hear his response. I encourage him to \nshare my letter with the same shareholders and customers to whom he has \nwritten. After all, in his shareholder letter, Mr. Dimon said he wanted \n``analysis in the full light of day'' of the Durbin amendment, so I \nfigured he would want his audience to be informed on my position. I \ndon't think Chase has done that yet. I hope they will.\n  I know the banking industry prefers for the giant Wall Street banks \nto stay in the background when it comes to this fight because they are \nnot that popular. Estimates indicate that about half of all debit swipe \nfees go to just 10 big banks and the Big Three, Bank of America, Chase, \nand Wells Fargo, make the most of all, well over $1 billion a year \neach. But the banking industry knows the public isn't happy with big \nbanks, so the industry is using small banks and credit unions as their \npublic face in this battle. Industry argues that even though my \namendment exempts all but the largest 1 percent of banks from fee \nregulation, the exemption will not work and small banks are going to \nget hurt. Well, this letter makes it clear that when it comes to \nretailers and merchants, there will not be any pain inflicted. They \nare, in fact, exempt under the law and they will be exempt in practice.\n  As I said, I received a letter from 20 of the Nation's largest retail \nassociations that reaffirms what I just said. I think the letter is \ncompelling. In this letter, these merchant groups make it clear they \ndon't have the contractual authority, the practical ability or the \neconomic incentive to discriminate against small bank or credit union \ndebit cards. They point out that Visa and MasterCard contracts impose \nstrong penalties on them even if they try. Second, they point out that \nin many, if not most, retail environments, the merchant doesn't have \nthe practical ability to distinguish between a small bank or a large \nbank card at the point of sale.\n  I had Wendy Chronister, whose family owns a chain of gas stations in \ndownstate Illinois, come to my office and talk about this. I have known \nher mom and dad a long time, and Wendy is running the business and \nrunning it well. She said: Senator, for goodness' sake, when they put \nthe plastic on the counter we take it. We need the sales. We are not \ngoing to argue with them about who issued the credit card or debit \ncard. That just stands to reason. They are not going to ask them to put \ntheir debit cards away when they come to a cash register. They will \nlose sales and customers if they do it.\n  Finally, the merchants make the observation that most customers only \nhave one debit card, so if you want to make a sale, they are going to \ntake that debit card.\n  What I have tried to do with this letter is to show that those on my \nside of this debate--the small businesses, the retail merchants, \nconvenience stores, hotels, and restaurants across America--are trying \nto be reasonable. Had the credit card companies and major banks been \nreasonable on this issue, I never would have introduced this amendment. \nThey refuse--refuse--to bargain with the retailers and merchants. They \nsaid it was a ``take it or leave it,'' and they did it in the obscurity \nof retail contracts and regulations which are almost impossible to work \nthrough.\n  I think those who are asking for a delay and study of this issue \nshould be called out for what they are asking. Every month they delay \nmeans customers and consumers across America will pay over $1 billion \nmore in these fees on debit cards--money taken away from retailers, \ntaken away from small business, and taken away from our economy. When \nthese small businesses have the advantage they can get under the Durbin \namendment, they are going to be able to be more profitable, expand \ntheir businesses, and hire more people. How many times have we heard a \nspeech on the floor that the key to economic recovery in America is \nsmall business. If you truly believe, then you cannot vote for this \n2\\1/2\\-year delay and study of this issue, if you truly believe\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nin small business. I think the issue is very clear.\n  I urge my colleagues not to fall for this game the banks and card \ncompanies are playing. Don't let them delay and derail the swipe fee \nreform consumers need so badly. The Senate has already voted to \nestablish a process for interchange reform. We should let that process \ncontinue and we should let the Federal Reserve issue their rules, which \nthey are planning to do in just a matter of weeks, and I think at that \ntime we will see that there is a reasonable way to deal with this that \ndoesn't create a disadvantage for community banks and credit unions.\n  (Mr. CARDIN assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2720-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2720-S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, according to the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, the average price of gasoline is $3.96 a gallon \nnationwide. I have my own specially appointed monitor of gasoline \nprices in the State of Illinois: my wife. I called her yesterday \nmorning and she said to me: Senator, it is up to $4.20 a gallon in \nSpringfield. What are you going to do? So she put me on the spot. Since \nshe is my No. 1 constituent, I said: I will at least make a speech, and \nthat is what I am going to do on the floor of the Senate.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the price is well over $4 a gallon--not \njust in Springfield but statewide. Every time they go to the pump, \nfamilies and small businesses feel the pinch. At the same time, the \nfive largest oil companies in the country made $33.9 billion in profit \nbetween January and March of this year. ExxonMobil earned almost $11 \nbillion in the first 3 months of this year--69 percent greater profits \nthis year compared to last year. The high oil and gas prices are \nforcing many American families to make tough choices about what to \nforgo so they can fill the tank.\n  It gets worse. While operating at substantial profits, oil companies \nwill get an estimated $4 billion this year in Federal subsidies. Think \nabout that. These companies making $11 billion in the first 3 months of \nthe year are asking for Federal subsidies. We don't have the money to \nsubsidize them. In fact, we have to borrow.\n  How do you pay for higher gas prices in America? You are going to pay \nit three ways. First, you pay at the pump, sometimes 80 or 90 bucks to \nfill your tank, even in Maryland. Secondly, you are going to pay when \nyou pay your taxes because your tax dollars are going back to the oil \ncompanies to subsidize their operations.\n  But you are going to pay a third time. Do you know why? Because we \nhave to borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend in America and we borrow \nit primarily from China and we have to pay China back with interest. So \nyour children and your grandchildren are going to pay interest on the \nmoney we borrowed to provide a subsidy--an annual subsidy--of $4 \nbillion to oil companies that are making recordbreaking profits.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Is there anybody left in this town \nwho is willing to fight for families and small businesses that are \ngetting nailed with these high gasoline prices?\n  The interesting thing--and I know the Presiding Officer, who was a \nformer Congressman from Maryland, knows what I am saying is accurate--\nthere are rights of spring in America: the opening of the baseball \nseason, the Easter egg hunts, seder dinners for our Jewish friends, and \nskyrocketing gasoline prices. Every single year, right before the \nsummer vacation season, the oil companies raise gasoline prices at the \npump, and politicians line up at microphones, such as this one, and \nbeat the heck out of oil companies and talk about how fundamentally \nunfair it is and then we replay this movie next year--every year, year \nafter year.\n  For the oil companies, why do the prices go up? Any excuse will do. \nThis year, it was Libya. Qadhafi is in trouble. We are going to raise \nprices at the pump by 40 cents, 50 cents or $1. It turns out Libya is \nresponsible for about 3 percent of the world's oil supply, and even if \nthere is an interruption of the supply from that place, most of their \noil goes to Europe. But, as I said, any excuse will do when it comes to \nraising gasoline prices.\n  Next week, we are going to take up a bill I support that would end \nthese tax subsidies to big oil companies. Have you seen their \nadvertising? These oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, that made $11 \nbillion in the first 3 months of the year, say, if we cut their \nsubsidies, they are going to raise gasoline prices even higher. Talk \nabout being at the end of a gun here: Your money or your life.\n  The Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act would end the special treatment \ngiven to several companies with leases in the Gulf of Mexico. These \ncompanies have been allowed to drill and pump oil without paying the \nFederal Government for the oil they extracted. Ending the special \ntreatment and tax breaks we give to oil companies will generate \nbillions of dollars. We suggest--I suggest--let's take the money that \nis going to these highly profitable--recordbreaking profitable--oil \ncompanies and put it in to reduce the deficit. How about that for a \nstart? Reduce the amount of money we are borrowing from China so we do \nnot have to pay interest on it.\n  This bill is not intended to punish the oil companies for turning a \nprofit. But it certainly is not going to reward them with more \ntaxpayers' dollars. It simply asks large wealthy international \ncompanies--in an industry that has existed for over 100 years--to pay \ntheir fair share and no longer depend on the government for a handout.\n  Some of these tax breaks started almost 100 years ago. They were \ncreated to encourage companies to explore for oil. However, at $113 a \nbarrel, how much more encouragement do these oil companies need?\n  Domestic oil production, incidentally--I hear about this all the time \nfrom some of the critics--domestic oil production in this country has \nbeen increasing consistently since the year 2008. Domestic production \nwas 1.8 billion barrels in 2008. It was 2 billion barrels in 2010.\n  In 2004, about 60 percent of oil consumption in America was from \nimports, and imported oil as a percentage of consumption has dropped a \nlittle more each year. Last year, it dipped to 50 percent--still too \nmuch, but the amount of imported oil has come down as domestic \nproduction has gone up.\n  The United States is currently the third largest oil producer in the \nworld behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. This is despite the fact that we \nhave less than 2 percent of the world's total proved oil reserves.\n  Oil production, incidentally, has also been increasing on Federal \nlands and waters since 2008.\n  Some of the critics are saying: You know why gas prices are up? They \nwill not let the oil companies go out and drill in the Gulf of Mexico \nand other places. Shouldn't we be careful about drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico? I think so. BP taught us that lesson last year. But having said \nthat, oil production has increased on Federal lands and waters since \n2008.\n  In the last 2 years, oil production from the Federal Outer \nContinental Shelf has increased by more than one-third--446 million \nbarrels in 2008 to over 500 million barrels in 2009 and more than 600 \nmillion barrels in 2010.\n  Oil production on Federal lands increased 5 percent in 2010 over \n2009. But greater domestic production of oil has not led to lower \ngasoline prices. We have higher gasoline prices. Drill baby drill is \nnot the solution to rising gas prices in the short or long term.\n  The United States consumes each year 25 percent of the oil that is \nproduced in the world. We have the capacity to produce 2 to 3 percent. \nWe cannot drill our way out of this challenge.\n  Crude oil prices went up in February with the spread of political \nunrest in the Middle East and North Africa, even though domestic \nproduction in the United States was going up too.\n  The oil industry has access to millions of acres of Federal land and \nwater--land they have bought leases on and land they will not drill on. \nFor them to argue the government is stopping them from drilling, the \nobvious question is, So what about the land you currently have to drill \non? Why aren't you taking that lease land and putting it into \nproduction?\n  Out of the 41 million acres under lease across the United States, the \noil industry is only using 12 million acres for production. That leaves \n29 million acres under lease to oil companies that are not being used \ntoday.\n  Thirty-eight million offshore acres are currently under lease, but \nonly 6.5\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nmillion acres of them are in active production. The Bureau of Land \nManagement issued over 4,000 drilling permits last year--4,000 of \nthem--but approximately 2,500 of them still remained unused at the end \nof the year.\n  So this argument that the requests for permits to drill are stacking \nup in some bureaucratic office in Washington and if they would just \napprove them, these oil companies would start drilling more oil and gas \nprices would come down, is not the truth. The Bureau of Land Management \nissued 4,000 drilling permits last year; 2,500 of them went unused.\n  I support measures proposed by my colleagues to force the oil \ncompanies to use their leases or lose them. The bill would require \nnonproducing leases to pay an annual fee of $4 an acre. These leases of \npublic lands should be actively used for domestic energy production, \nnot kept idle as we face higher oil prices.\n  Let me close by saying I recently returned from a trip to China--10 \ndays in China. China is an enigma. On the one hand, they are the most \nsignificant economic partner of the United States. They are our largest \ncreditor. They loan us more money than any other country. On the other \nhand, they are our most significant economic competitor. Partner and \ncompetitor, that is the relationship.\n  When you go to China, you are struck by the fact that their air \npollution is horrible. In every city we visited, I cannot imagine how \npeople live there full time and do not develop serious health problems \nbecause of the terrible pollution they have in their country. But \ndespite the pollution, they are creating an expanding economy. They are \nbuilding right and left. What are they focusing on as the No. 1 area \nwhere China wants to dominate the world? Clean energy. In every \ndirection: solar panels and wind turbines and new research on clean \nenergy.\n  I wish I could say the same for the United States. But I am afraid I \ncannot. We do not have an energy policy. We are still dependent on \ntraditional fuels. We still have to recognize those fuels create \nenvironmental issues we have to face, and, unfortunately, we are not. \nWe are not acknowledging the fact that if we are not careful, China is \ngoing to dominate in the world when it comes to clean energy throughout \nthe course of this century.\n  We need an energy policy in this country, not just to deal with the \nterrible gas prices we are facing today but to deal with a future which \nmakes us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again touch on a \nsubject that is important to me. I know it is very important to the \nPresiding Officer because the Commonwealth of Virginia and the great \nState of Maryland have a large number of Federal employees. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, this week we celebrate Public Service \nRecognition Week to honor public servants at all levels of government \nfor their admirable patriotism and contributions to our country.\n  I wish to begin by commending our military intelligence professionals \nfor the coordinated and painstaking work that was responsible for \ntracking down Osama bin Laden. There are a number of nameless, faceless \nFederal workers who have been investigating his whereabouts for more \nthan a decade. I was proud to be in this Chamber with the Presiding \nOfficer and colleagues from both sides of the aisle when, on Tuesday \nafternoon, this body recognized their work.\n  Our military and intelligence professionals are not the only ones on \nthe front lines of keeping our country safe. Today, I rise to honor a \nresident of Reston, VA, Carl Pike, the Assistant Special Agent in \nCharge of the Special Operations Division at the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA. This is a photo of Carl and his whole team.\n  We have all seen reports in recent years detailing the violent and \ninhumane acts of the Mexican drug cartels that terrorize cities and \ncontrol a significant percentage of the narcotics flowing into the \nUnited States. Mr. Pike is the head of a complex multiagency task force \nset up to catch many of these violent criminals and disrupt the flow of \ndrugs. Last year, he and his team led the largest strike ever against \nLa Familia, one of the most ruthless Mexican drug cartels and a major \ntrafficker of methamphetamine in the United States. The strike, dubbed \n``Project Coronado,'' was an operation that spanned 20 States, 50 \ncities, 2 countries, and multiple Federal agencies. Attorney General \nEric Holder said the ``unprecedented, coordinated U.S. law enforcement \naction'' was a ``significant blow to La Familia's supply chain of \nillegal drugs, weapons and cash flowing between Mexico and the United \nStates.''\n  The strike would not have been possible without Mr. Pike, as so many \nof his colleagues attest. One DEA Special Assistant Agent in Charge \nsaid:\n\n       He oversaw the broad interests of the law enforcement \n     community, displayed phenomenal negotiating and planning \n     skills, and facilitated collaboration between agencies and \n     international partners that often had competing interests.\n\n  In the end, Project Coronado led to the arrest of 1,200 associates of \nLa Familia and the seizure of 1\\1/2\\ tons of methamphetamine, $32 \nmillion in cash, and 400 weapons. It truly was a significant \nachievement.\n  Carl Pike and his team should be recognized for removing dangerous \ndrugs and criminals off our streets--something for which we can all be \ngrateful.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Pike and his team \nas well as all those at the DEA for their excellence and service to our \nNation.\n  I was also proud to be part of a group earlier today recognizing a \nnumber of Federal employees--nine from the Commonwealth of Virginia and \nmany from the State of Maryland--who were part of a national \ncompetition that recognizes quality work of government workers.\n  As we see this week in broad display those military intelligence \nprofessionals in this most dramatic action against Osama bin Laden, as \nwe see Mr. Pike and his team taking on drug cartels, and as we see the \nhundreds of thousands of other Federal workers who day-in and day-out, \noften without recognition, do the job of keeping our government \noperating and in many ways keeping our country safe, I hope my \ncolleagues will join in saluting those efforts and recognize that this \nweek, Public Service Recognition Week, is to honor all of our public \nservants.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, do I understand correctly that we are \ncontinuing in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on several occasions I have risen to \naddress my colleagues on the topic of Russia and the continuing sad \nstate of the rule of law in the Russian Federation. Today, I rise once \nagain to address the latest information regarding the absence of a \nrule-of-law framework in Russia's approach to businesses and investors. \nSpecifically, this situation negatively impacts the United States and \nthe entire international community.\n  There have been a number of poor decisions around the world related \nto the Yukos Oil issue that highlight Russia's hostility toward \ninvestment and business. As my colleagues may be aware, GML, the \nmajority shareholder of the former Yukos Oil, previously headed by \nbusinessman and now political prisoner Mikhail Hoarders, has a $100 \nbillion arbitration claim against the Russian Federation to obtain \ncompensation for the Yukos assets which were summarily taken between \n2003 and 2005.\n  Several recent developments demonstrate yet again that international \ncourts do not recognize Russia's 2003 expropriation of Yukos Oil \nCompany as legitimate and that former stakeholders of the company may \npursue compensation for their assets that were seized improperly and, \nin essence, nationalized by the Russian State.\n  Court victories handed to shareholders involved in the dispute \nindicate that the international legal system\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\nwill not recognize the validity of Russia's bankruptcy of Yukos. In \nDecember 2009, the New York Times detailed one of these victories in \nwhich an independent arbitration panel made a jurisdictional ruling \nthat shareholders of the former Yukos Oil Company, GML, had the right \nto file and pursue an estimated $100 billion in damages from the \nRussian Government. The tribunal determined that Russia, as a \nsignatory, was bound by the Energy Charter Treaty and must adhere to \nits provisions. This claim now moves to the next stage, with a decision \nexpected in October 2013--regrettably slow but moving surely.\n  The most recent victory occurred in December of last year and \ninvolved a second international arbitration tribunal in Stockholm, \nwhich awarded RosInvestCo UK, a minority shareholder of Yukos, $3.5 \nmillion for the damages resulting from the Russian Government's \nactions. This was the first case in which anyone seriously examined the \nclaims of an individual Yukos shareholder. The panel independently and \nunanimously concluded that the Russian Federation was liable for \nexpropriating RosInvestCo's assets. I stress to you that this was a \nunanimous decision even though the tribunal included a Russian \narbitrator.\n  I bring these developments to the attention of my Senate colleagues \nbecause I believe they demonstrate a growing movement in the \ninternational community that holds Russia accountable for its actions \ntoward investors, and it is a movement the United States should \nsupport.\n  Minority shareholders, such as RosInvestCo, are just the tip of the \niceberg when it comes to shareholders who lost billions that were \nrightfully theirs as a result of the seizure of Yukos assets. In the \nUnited States alone, shareholders were stripped of $6 billion to $12 \nbillion.\n  Russia's actions toward Yukos remind us that investment in Russia is \nextremely risky. The international community is taking note. Americans \nare taking note. American legislators should take note.\n  Recent court decisions indicate that the legitimacy of the Russian \nGovernment's claims over Yukos assets are suspect at best.\n  With these thoughts in mind, I urge my colleagues to continue working \nto ensure protection and adequate mechanisms for U.S. shareholders and \nbusinesses doing business in Russia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2722-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2722-S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GULF SHUTDOWN ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, tomorrow, May 6, will mark the 1-year \nanniversary of the formal moratorium placed on Gulf of Mexico energy \nproduction by President Obama and Secretary Salazar. I wish to speak on \nthe eve of that occasion, particularly as our constituents continue to \nsee the price at the pump go up and up, with really no end in sight. I \nthink those two facts are deeply related because I think this \nmoratorium, which continues as a de facto moratorium--a ``permatorium'' \nor a permit logjam to this day--is really one of the most poorly \nthought out, mismanaged, and ill-conceived energy decisions in terms of \ndomestic energy production in our history.\n  The first of these moratoriums in the gulf--there are actually three \ndifferent formal moratoriums--was announced on behalf of President \nObama by Secretary Salazar 1 year ago tomorrow, May 6, 2010. It was \ndone, in retrospect, we find out, very hastily and without scientific \nbacking and justification. I say that because after that first \nmoratorium was put down on May 6, 2010, on June 22 a Federal judge, \nMartin Feldman, of the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled against this \njob-crushing moratorium. It banned drilling below 500 feet of water for \n6 months. But Judge Feldman put it on hold because he found that under \nFederal law it had failed to properly weigh a number of factors, \nincluding the economic impact it would have on the industry and \nsurrounding communities.\n  I might add, in a hearing we had in the Senate about the \nadministration's decision to place the moratorium in effect, it was \nshocking to hear administration officials say very directly--no holds \nbarred--that they never considered any economic impact in the decision \nwhatsoever. Again, failing to properly weigh the economic impact of the \ndecision has been a chronic problem in some agencies, such as the EPA.\n  Unfortunately, this administration seems to have brought that same \nknee-jerk reaction to the Interior Department with the same economic \nilliteracy. In the Interior Department's infinite wisdom, on July 12, \nSecretary Salazar issued a backup second moratorium. The court struck \ndown the first moratorium on the basis of existing Federal law, so he \njust came and issued a second moratorium on deepwater drilling. The \nsecond moratorium would soon be met with resistance and disappointment \nas coastal Louisiana communities would realize there was nothing they \ncould do to stop Interior, which seemed hell-bent on adversely \nimpacting their jobs.\n  On October 12, Secretary Salazar celebrated an illusory victory by \nlifting that moratorium, and at the time, he claimed that ``the policy \nposition we are articulating today is that we are open for business.'' \nThat is what Secretary Ken Salazar said on October 12. Unfortunately, \nthose of us who live in Louisiana and along the gulf coast know that is \nnot true. What he should have said is, the policy position we are \narticulating today is that we are open for business as long as you \ndon't need a permit from the Interior Department, because that second \nformal moratorium was lifted, but that brought us to the initiation of \nthe third moratorium--not a formal moratorium but a de facto one, a \npermatorium, a complete permit logjam in this administration and at the \nDepartment of the Interior. Again, this has been commonly and \naccurately referred to as a de facto moratorium, sometimes a \npermatorium, an absolute permit logjam. Secretary Salazar has \nperpetuated that, and Director Bromwich has perpetuated that. They \nrepeatedly stated it doesn't exist, but the facts, the statistics, the \nnumbers make bare that lie.\n  It would not be for 4 more months--until February 28 of this year--\nthat the Interior Department would issue the very first permit to drill \nin deep water an exploratory well. So, again, big celebration, big \nannouncements that the formal moratorium was lifted, but for 4 months \nzero permits and only 4 months later the first deepwater exploratory \npermit.\n  To date, even since February 28 of this year, there have only been 12 \ndeepwater permits issued in the gulf. That pace is well below the pace \nbefore the BP disaster--about 60 percent slower than the prespill \npace. This is for shallow and deep water combined. The pace of only \ndeepwater new well permits--permits that would increase domestic \nsupplies and our reserves--is forthcoming at the average pace of one \nper month--just a trickle, just a tiny percentage of the predisaster \npace.\n\n  Tomorrow will be 1 year since the Obama administration implemented \nthis moratorium policy, the first of three crushing moratoriums, two \nformal moratoriums, the ongoing de facto moratorium. The Energy \nInformation Administration--and that is a nonpartisan division of the \nDepartment of Energy--is now estimating that the falloff in domestic \nproduction this year alone will be about 200,000 barrels per day--that \nis a lot of oil, 200,000 barrels per day--and an additional 200,000 \nbarrels per day in 2012. To put this falloff in production that is \nexpected from the Obama administration's policy in perspective, as a \nresult of the permitting logjam, by 2012 we would lose as much \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico as we currently import from Brazil and \nColombia combined. These are the two countries, by the way, that are \nsupported with taxpayer-funded guaranteed projects related to their \nenergy production. This falloff in production in the gulf by 2012 is \nroughly equivalent also to what we imported in January from Iraq.\n  There are several points I would like to highlight for tomorrow's \nanniversary of the initiation of this moratorium policy.\n  First, the price of gasoline at the pump is now $3.98 a gallon. It \nhas more than doubled since President Obama took office. There is \nperhaps not a greater antistimulus for our economy than the doubling of \nthe price at the pump.\n  Second, seven deepwater rigs have left the Gulf of Mexico. They are \ngone,\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nand they are not coming back anytime soon. In addition, five are cold-\nstacked or without a contract. That is a total of 12 rigs. Ironically, \nthat is exactly the same number of deepwater permits the Interior \nDepartment has issued--a trickle compared to pre-BP levels.\n  Third, what minor credit I should give the Interior Department for \nthis abysmal pace of permitting will be noted when I release my hold on \nthe nomination of Dan Ashe. I am currently holding that nomination of a \ntop-level Interior Department official. I said I would hold it until we \ngot at least 15 deepwater exploratory permits. At the time I initiated \nthat, there were zero. As I said, that is now finally up to 12. I said \nI would lift the hold when we got to 15. We are just three away. We \nwill get there. I will lift the hold. But that is merely a trickle of \nwhat our pace needs to be.\n  Fourth, today I will be introducing an important piece of \nlegislation. It is called the Agency Overreach Moratorium Act. We need \na moratorium. We need a moratorium on regulatory overreach, agency \noverreach, as we see in the Interior Department, in EPA, in many other \nagencies. This legislation is intended to prevent Federal action that \nwould unilaterally destroy jobs on Federal lands on the OCS. That is \nhappening every day at the Interior Department. Instead of issuing \npermits to find American energy, they are issuing regulations, the most \nrecent on a whole new category of contractors--completely unnecessary \nbecause they were already regulating the drillers. That is regulatory \noverreach, and that is job-killing action. My Agency Overreach \nMoratorium Act will lay out the real moratorium we need on job-killing \naction out of Washington, out of this administration, not on domestic \nenergy production.\n  I thank all of my colleagues, and I hope we will all come together \nsoon around a commonsense, proactive domestic energy policy. It needs \nto include a lot. I am a fervent believer in all of the above, but it \ncertainly needs to start lifting the continuing de facto moratorium on \nU.S. energy production, on U.S. jobs, on good additional Federal \nrevenue to the U.S. Treasury to lower our deficit if we are going to \nget on the right energy path.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I rise to speak specifically about \nthe alarming situation in Syria, where the regime of Bashar al Asad is \npursuing a barbaric campaign of indiscriminate repression against the \nSyrian people.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, the crackdown pursued by Asad has markedly \nescalated. There can no longer be any doubt about his intentions. As a \nreport by a respected nongovernmental organization, the International \nCrisis Group, warned this week:\n\n       The regime's hope appears to be that a massive crackdown \n     can bring the protestors to heel. . . . Such a course of \n     action would entail loss of life on a massive scale and it \n     could usher in a period of sectarian fighting with \n     devastating consequences for Syria. It could destabilize its \n     neighbors. And, ultimately, it is highly unlikely to work.\n\n  Madam President, in the city of Deraa, the Asad regime has deployed \ntanks against the civilian population. It has cut off phone lines, \nwater, food, and electricity, and deployed snipers--according to human \nrights groups--who have been firing at anyone who ventures outdoors. \nThat includes young people who are sent outdoors by their families to \ntry to buy food.\n  In short, what we see in Deraa is a broad-based, indiscriminate \nassault by Asad's military forces against the people of his own \ncountry. The evidence is growing that international crimes are being \nperpetrated by Bashar Asad himself in the city of Deraa in Syria.\n  The attack on Deraa is just one part of a course of a broader \ncrackdown by Syrian security forces across the country--a crackdown \nthat has left several hundred people dead. Tanks and military forces \nhave been reported being deployed in other cities in Syria. According \nto Human Rights Watch, the number of arbitrary detentions of civilians \nand enforced disappearances around the country has skyrocketed in \nrecent days as the Asad regime has swept up not only demonstrators but \nwomen, minors, and family members of activists. Another Syrian human \nrights group has documented more than 500 arrests in Deraa alone since \nlast week, and thousands more nationwide have also been detained or \ndisappeared arbitrarily.\n  As the report by the International Crisis Group argued--the report I \nreferenced before that came out earlier this week:\n\n       The regime is also fanning the flames of sectarianism, \n     spreading rumors of impending acts targeting specific groups. \n     Sectarian tendencies no doubt exist in parts of the country, \n     but the authorities' tactics betray a determined and cynical \n     attempt to exploit and exacerbate them.\n\n  What is most remarkable of all is that in the face of and despite \nthese outrageous inhumane actions by the Asad regime, the people of \nSyria refuse to be silenced. They refuse to be intimidated. In the face \nof tanks and snipers, the people of Syria have continued to cry out and \ndemonstrate for their fundamental human rights, and they have continued \nto do so peacefully. Moreover, despite the sectarian provocations by \nPresident Asad, the message of the protesters has remained steadfastly \none of Syrian national unity.\n  Tomorrow, Friday, it is expected that thousands of brave Syrians will \nonce again take to the streets of their cities and towns in protest of \nthe totalitarian dictatorship that currently controls their country. As \nthey do so, I want them to know that the United States and the rest of \nthe civilized world stands unequivocally on the side of the people of \nSyria in solidarity with them in their courageous struggle for their \nhuman rights. They should know also that we are increasingly confident \nthat the people of Syria can and will prevail over the Asad regime.\n  There is much we in the United States can and must do to help the \nSyrian people in their fight for freedom. Last week, the Obama \nadministration issued an Executive order authorizing targeted sanctions \nagainst individuals and organizations responsible for the human rights \nabuses in Syria. The administration used this newest authority to \nsanction three Syrian officials, including Maher al Asad, the brother \nof Bashar al Asad. This was a very important action, and I thank and \ncommend the Obama administration for taking it.\n  There is, however, more that now can and must be done. To begin with, \nit is clear there are many more individuals in the Syrian Government \nthan the three named so far who are responsible for the human rights \nabuses and worse that are taking place throughout Syria. It is urgent \nand essential that the Obama administration expand the sanctions to \ncover these additional Syrian officials.\n  Members of the Syrian security forces and government must understand \nthey face a choice in the days ahead. If they stick with the Asad \nregime and participate in the barbaric crackdown against their fellow \nSyrians, their names are going to be made famous around the world, and \nthey will be held accountable.\n  It is also critical that the United States impose sanctions on Bashar \nal Asad himself, for he is the head of the regime that is \nsystematically carrying out large-scale human rights abuses. It is he \nwho is directing his military forces to fire on his own people. Surely, \nit requires a willing suspension of disbelief to think the order to use \nmilitary force against the Syrian people did not originate with the \nPresident of Syria himself--Bashar al Asad. He must be held \naccountable.\n  I respectfully urge President Obama to speak out as soon as possible, \ndirectly and personally, about what is happening in Syria. The moral \nauthority of the President of the United States matters enormously at \nhistoric moments such as the one in Syria now. Unfortunately, there are \nstill many in Syria and throughout the Middle East who believe the \nUnited States is hedging its bets in Syria. It is time to put those \ndoubts to rest.\n  I have met over the last few weeks, as recently as yesterday, with \nSyrian\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\ndissidents, and I have heard the same question from them again and \nagain: Why has President Obama not spoken out personally about what is \nhappening in Syria?\n  I say: The administration has made statements.\n  They say: We need to hear and see the President and hear his voice--\nPresident Obama--making clear his disdain and refusal to accept what is \nhappening in Syria today.\n  So I respectfully urge the President to answer these appeals by \nSyrian freedom fighters for support of their cause. I hope the \nPresident can make clear once again, as he did so effectively in the \ncases of Egypt and Libya, that Bashar al Asad has lost the legitimacy \nto lead Syria, and it is time for Bashar to go.\n  The United States can also work with our allies and partners to \nincrease international pressure on the Asad regime. Press reports \nindicate, I am pleased to note, that the European Union is preparing to \nput in place an arms embargo against Syria, and it is also considering \ntargeted human rights sanctions against top Syrian officials. I \nfervently hope our European friends and allies take these and further \nsteps to increase the pressure on the Asad regime.\n  I am especially encouraged that the French Foreign Minister this week \ncorrectly called for Bashar al-Asad to be sanctioned directly himself, \nto tie up his economic assets, to limit his mobility. In addition to \nour EU partners, I wish to say I believe Turkey can also play a unique \nleadership role in the days and weeks ahead to support a successful \ndemocratic transition in Syria.\n  No one has worked harder than Prime Minister Erdogan to encourage \nBashar al-Asad to reform, to accept the legitimate demands of the \nSyrian people, and embrace democracy. Unfortunately, despite these \nefforts, Asad has ignored the wise counsel of the Turkish leader and \nrefused to respond with action. I, therefore, hope President Obama will \nfind a way to partner directly with Prime Minister Erdogan on \ndeveloping a new strategy toward Syria, one that recognizes that \ndespite our hopes and efforts, there will be no real progress as long \nas Bashar al-Asad remains in power in Damascus, a policy that aligns \nour two democracies--America and Turkey--unequivocally with the \ndemocratic aspirations of the Syrian people.\n  We should also work with our allies on the U.N. Human Rights Council \nto ensure that the investigative mission to Syria, which was agreed \nupon by the Council last week, is undertaken immediately. Every day \nmatters. We should work to refer Asad's regime to the International \nCriminal Court--again, as we did in the case of Libya.\n  What the Asad regime is doing to the people of Syria looks every day \nmore the mirror image of what the Qadhafi regime has done to the people \nof Libya. For its actions in the city of Deraa and throughout the \ncountry, the Asad regime deserves to be investigated by the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n  I respectfully urge our own administration to use the diplomatic \nclout that we have at the United Nations to put what is happening in \nSyria on the agenda of the U.N. Security Council.\n  I have no illusions about the challenges and obstacles that exist at \nthe Security Council at this time to taking action with regard to what \nis happening in Syria, but we must try. If the Security Council fails \nto take up what is happening in Syria, perhaps because of the \nopposition of the Russians and the Chinese, it does so at the expense \nof its own international credibility and legitimacy.\n  Finally, I hope President Obama will work together with our \ninternational allies to provide the Syrian people with the humanitarian \nassistance that they urgently need--food, water, and medical supplies--\nand to restore communications linkages that the Asad regime has cut \namong the freedom fighters in various communities in Syria. Asad has \ncut them in an effort to prevent news and information about what is \nhappening in Syria also from reaching the outside world.\n  The situation in Syria is fast approaching the point of no return. \nThe fact is, several hundred Syrians have been killed by Asad's \nsecurity forces. This is a regime that I conclude is beyond self-\ncorrection. Bashar al-Asad is not a reformer. He is a corrupt dictator \nand an inhumane thug and his regime has long been one of the worst in \nthe Middle East. It is time for him to go.\n  Let me conclude by adding that nearly a decade after the attacks of \nSeptember 11, Americans and people throughout the world awoke Monday \nmorning to a safer, better world with Osama bin Laden gone. It is \nfitting that Osama bin Laden has been killed just as Arab democracies \nacross the Middle East and North Africa are being born, are coming to \nlife. The peaceful, youth-driven democratic revolutions now taking \nplace in Syria, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya are the true repudiation of \nthe extreme ideology that I will call bin Ladenism. To rid our world \nnot only of bin Laden but of bin Ladenism, it is critical that we now \ndo everything in our power to help the democratic forces in Syria and \nacross the Middle East succeed, for it will ultimately be quite \ncorrectly and powerfully at the hands of his fellow Arabs and Muslims \nthat the hateful and violent ideology of bin Laden and its \nmanifestations of a different sort in dictatorships across the Middle \nEast are finally discredited and abandoned on the ash heap of history \nwhere they belong.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this month people all over the country \nwill grab their tackle boxes and head off in pursuit of the elusive \ntrout in mountain streams. Mothers and fathers will turn on their \nkitchen faucets and hand their children glasses of clean, pure drinking \nwater that we have in this country. Farmers will irrigate their spring \nplantings in vegetables and grains with clear water from nearby \nstreams.\n  All over the United States, Americans will take advantage of the \nsimple but priceless natural resource of America's water. Thanks to the \nactions taken by the Obama administration last week, we can rest \nassured these vital resources are being protected by the full strength \nof the Clean Water Act.\n  Last week, the Obama administration released a guidance document on \nthe jurisdictional waters of the United States. The document was a \nsensible response to the confusion left in the wake of recent Supreme \nCourt rulings. The draft document that was released last week will help \nthe Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency in the near term as they make decisions about whether projects \nwill impact the waters of the United States and therefore require \nprotective permits.\n  Eventually, this draft document will be replaced by formal \nregulations that will ensure the Clean Water Act continues to protect \nAmerica's waters. For nearly 40 years, the Clean Water Act has \nsafeguarded almost all of our Nation's waters. These safeguards protect \nour rivers, streams, and wetlands from pollution in accordance with \nCongress's intent that the landmark statute, ``restore and maintain the \nchemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters.''\n  Nowhere in America is this more important--the enforcement of the \nClean Water Act--than the Chesapeake watershed. We understand more than \n100,000 rivers and streams come together to form North America's \nlargest estuary, and they are all critical to the health of the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  These streams and rivers, along with their associated wetlands, serve \nas a habitat for hundreds of species, buffers for slowing the flow of \npollutants into the bay, and sponges that soak up and hold large \namounts of floodwater and stormwater runoff.\n  Despite major steps forward that have resulted in a majority of the \nNation's waters now being safe for fishing, swimming, and other uses, \nrecent Supreme Court decisions have placed this progress at risk. The \nguidance developed by professional scientists and\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nimproved by the Obama administration provides strong protection for our \nNation's waters and restores the ability of Federal agencies to enforce \nthe Clean Water Act. I also wish to underscore the fact that the \nguidance reflects the longstanding agricultural and other exemptions \ncodified in the Clean Water Act.\n\n  This is a commonsense solution right in the mainstream of American \nvalues.\n  The Supreme Court's recent rulings put millions of acres of wetlands \nand thousands of miles of streams at risk. The Court's decision in its \n2001 ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its more \nrecent rulings in 2006--Rapanos v. United States and Caravell v. Army \nCorps of Engineers--threatened to roll back the Clean Water Act, making \nnearly 60 percent of our Nation's waters vulnerable to polluters.\n  The waters threatened by the narrowing of the Clean Water Act \nprotections are important for fish and wildlife habitat, flood \nprotection, and supply of drinking water. More than 117 million \nAmericans receive drinking water supplied, at least in part, by \nheadwaters and similar streams. These vital streams and wetlands are \nalso critical to the health of our most treasured water bodies from the \nChesapeake Bay, to the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, to Puget Sound.\n  Millions of small streams and wetlands provide the fresh water that \nflows into these regional economic engines. If we do not protect this \nincredible network of waters, we cannot hope to restore these water \nbodies to health.\n  As Americans, we cherish clean water and the magnificent bounty we \nare blessed with. That is why last week's announcement was met with \nsuch strong support from a broad range of Americans, especially from \nour sportsmen. Among the groups supporting the administration's actions \nare Ducks Unlimited, the Izaak Walton League of America, the National \nWildlife Foundation, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, \nand Trout Unlimited.\n  As chairman of the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, I am especially pleased the administration \nhas taken such a strong and sensible approach to protecting our \nNation's waters. Too often we raise our voices in criticism of the \nactions of others. Today, I am proud to add my voice to the chorus of \nthanks to the Obama administration for a job well done.\n  Thank you, Madam President. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n158 are located in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I come to the Senate floor as a \nphysician who practiced medicine in Caspar, WY, for about a quarter of \na century, and I will talk about the concerns I have about the \nPresident's health care law, part of which has taken over $500 billion \nfrom our seniors on Medicare and taken that money not to help Medicare \nor to help save Medicare or to strengthen Medicare but to put a whole \nnew government program in place.\n  They want to put about 16 million or so people on Medicaid. It is a \nprogram that is not functioning well now. Many doctors don't want to \ntake care of patients on Medicaid. Yet as part of this health care law, \nthere is something called the Medicaid maintenance of effort, and 33 \nGovernors have written to the President saying they don't want this to \napply to them.\n  I am delighted to be a cosponsor of a piece of legislation called the \nState Flexibility Act. I do that and come to the floor with that as a \nphysician who practiced medicine, and I have been coming to the floor \nweek after week with a doctor's second opinion.\n  Today, my second opinion is that this State Flexibility Act is a good \nidea. It gives States the flexibility they need to give the Governors \nthe flexibility they have requested. It is a bipartisan effort in the \nsense that Governors, whether they be Republican or Democrat, are \nlooking for more flexibility with this Medicaid Program, and \nspecifically the Medicaid maintenance of effort.\n  I ask my colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, if he \ncould perhaps tell us a little bit about this effort that he has now \nintroduced, which I have cosponsored, the State Flexibility Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I appreciate his \nperspective on this important issue because he is a physician. The \nSenator has cared for Medicaid patients, and he understands the \nMedicaid Program better than anyone in this body. The Senator has also \nserved in the State legislature, so he has that experience. He \nunderstands that, unlike Washington, States must balance their budgets \nevery year.\n  I want to talk about the rollback of the Medicaid maintenance of \neffort or MOE requirement threatening both Medicare beneficiaries and \nthe financial health of many States throughout the country. I think it \nis important to go through a little history on this subject.\n  When Medicaid was first established as a limited State-Federal \npartnership, less than 5 million Americans used this program. Today, \nnearly one in four is enrolled in this government program. Medicaid \nspending now absorbs nearly one-quarter of all State government \nbudgets, often forcing severe cuts to other critical State programs.\n  Unfortunately, this situation is getting even worse with the Medicaid \nmandate first imposed in the stimulus bill and again in the partisan \nhealth care law. As a result of these Washington mandates, States are \nbeing forced to make drastic cuts to important priorities, such as \neducation and law enforcement.\n  Unlike Washington, which too often just prints money to pay for out-\nof-control spending, States actually have to make tough budget \ndecisions every year. States are facing the worst budget crisis since \nthe Great Depression, with a collective $175 billion shortfall. \nWashington's micromanagement of State Medicaid programs makes it \nincredibly difficult for the States to balance their budgets and \nprovide for those who are most in need. Because of the overly generous \nbenefit programs that Washington forces on the States, they are unable \nto target health services to those most in need of assistance. \nGovernors are unable to undertake commonsense reforms that root out \nprogram waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The result of these MOE requirements is nothing short of a \nWashington-induced State fiscal crisis.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask my colleague this: We are from neighboring \nStates, Wyoming and Utah. I ask if the Senator could perhaps explain \nexactly how these Medicaid maintenance of effort mandates--and I \nbelieve they are onerous Washington mandates--directly impact Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. In my home State of Utah, the fiscal year 2012 budget \nshortfall will be approximately $390 million. That is a lot of money. \nMy State has said:\n\n       MOE requirements imposed by the Federal Government will \n     cost the State $3.2 million annually.\n\n  This might not sound like a lot to the people in Washington, DC, who \ndon't bat an eye at trillion-dollar deficits, but in Utah that is a lot \nof money in the State budget. My close friend in Utah, Governor Gary \nHerbert, said:\n\n       Not a State in this Nation is immune to tough budget \n     decisions, and sometimes Washington makes it even harder. \n     Utah must seriously weigh the real cost of Medicaid, one of \n     the largest and most expensive programs we have. \n     Unfortunately, Federal mandates tie our hands. Utah has zero \n     flexibility to respond to economic conditions, or the option \n     to scale the program back in a way that reflects local values \n     and priorities.\n\n  Governor Herbert and many others across the Nation have repeatedly\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nasked Washington to repeal these onerous Medicaid mandates. We have \nintroduced legislation--the State Flexibility Act, as the Senator \nmentioned--to do exactly what the Governors have asked.\n  The State Flexibility Act fully repeals these burdensome Medicaid MOE \nregulations. It starts to put States back in control to balance their \nbudgets while simultaneously lowering Federal entitlement spending. Our \nlegislation will save taxpayers $2.8 billion over just the first 5 \nyears. That is a lot of money.\n  Regardless of political affiliation, I am confident this bill has the \npotential to garner strong, bipartisan support in Congress, and it \nrepresents a strong first step toward achieving comprehensive Medicaid \nreform. Any Senator who has talked to his or her State's Governor knows \nwe need to pass this legislation to enable States to survive the \ncurrent fiscal crisis and to better care for the most vulnerable \nMedicaid beneficiaries in their respective States.\n  It is time for Congress to roll back these unreasonable MOE mandates \nand put the States, not Washington, back in charge.\n  I personally thank the Senator, my colleague from Wyoming, Mr. \nBarrasso, for working with us on this legislation. Without him here, I \ndon't think we would be able to do anywhere near as much as we are \ndoing. The Senator, in particular, brings a unique perspective to the \ndebate over MOE requirements, and I don't know of any Senator who is \nserving his State any better than he.\n  I would appreciate hearing more of the Senator's thoughts on this \nmatter because he has the experience, and he has operated on countless \npeople, and he has done it whether they have been Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, people who have insurance, or people who have nothing. I \nknow that. I have great admiration for the Senator from Wyoming. These \nStates have been heavily burdened with MOE requirements, which are \nbureaucratic unnecessaries. I would like to hear from the Senator how \nimportant that is.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I appreciate the comments of my colleague. I have taken \ncare of Medicaid patients over the years, and I know this is a program \nthat is burdensome. I also served in the State legislature, and I know \nthe mandates coming out of Washington make it harder for the people \nback home to take care of patients and harder for our State \nlegislatures to deal with helping people on Medicaid, making it more \ndifficult for physicians to take care of those patients, and making it \nmore expensive. There is a lot of waste in the mandate.\n  When Senator Hatch talked about the comments from his Governor, I \nhave comments from ours as well, Governor Matt Mead, who has been in \noffice only just since January. He wrote and was one of the 33 \nGovernors who signed a letter to President Obama saying that the costs \nof maintaining their Medicaid Programs are fast becoming a serious \nthreat to the State's general funds.\n  We live in a State where we have to balance the budget every year. He \nwent on to say that Wyoming needs to have flexibility, which is the key \nword and the title of the bill introduced by Senator Hatch, S. 868, the \nState Flexibility Act.\n  That is what Governors are asking for, flexibility, because with that \nflexibility they can do better for the patients, and they can do it \ncheaper. Wyoming needs the flexibility at the State level to ensure \nthat the Medicaid Program is operated efficiently and effectively.\n  People do not believe they are getting efficiency and effectiveness \nout of Washington these days. They do not think they are getting value \nfor their money. I agree with the American people. I have heard them \nloudly and clearly. I said it when I was practicing medicine and I say \nit as a Member of the Senate.\n  Our Governor goes on: Wyoming strongly supports the removal of these \nmaintenance of effort requirements. This is why I come to the Senate \nfloor every week to talk about this health care law, the implications \nof it, the impact on the people of this great country, and why I think \nthis health care law is one that is ultimately bad for patients, bad \nfor providers, the nurses and the doctors who take care of those \npatients, and also bad for the American taxpayers. At a time when we \nare borrowing 41 cents for every $1 we spend in this country, we cannot \nafford to continue to waste money.\n  Our problem in this country is not that we are taxed too little, it \nis that we spend too much and do not spend it well. We have to begin \nfocusing differently, and one of the ways we can do it--my \nunderstanding from looking at this is actually the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which does the scoring on legislation, scored Senator Hatch's \nState Flexibility Act as actually saving, I think, $2.8 billion total \nover 5 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Isn't that what we are trying to do: save money, help \npeople, do it more efficiently, more effectively? That is why I am \nproud to cosponsor with my friend, Senator Hatch, the State Flexibility \nAct.\n  Mr. HATCH. And give the States flexibility to do what they can do \nbetter than the Federal Government. As a former medical liability \ndefense lawyer back in my early days, I represented doctors, health \ncare providers, nurses, and hospitals in defending them from what were, \nin most cases, frivolous suits that run up the cost of medicine.\n  I cannot tell you what it means to me to have Senator Barrasso in the \nSenate with all the medical experience he has had. Frankly, the States \ncan do the job, but they cannot do it within budget if we keep piling \nregulation and onerous burdens on them, such as the partisan health \ncare bill does.\n  Frankly, I want the Senator from Wyoming to know I feel it is an \nhonor to serve with him and an honor to have a couple of medical \ndoctors on our side. Dr. Barrasso and Dr. Coburn are both excellent \ndoctors. They have lived through these problems. They know what they \nare like. They do not have to have anybody tell them what is wrong with \nthe approaches we are taking. They know what is wrong.\n  Frankly, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for being willing to serve \nhere.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I appreciate the kindness and I appreciate the fact \nthat Senator Hatch is allowing me to work with him. He has a long and \nillustrious career of leadership in the Senate, and he has been a \nchampion over the years of the fact that States are better than \nWashington to make decisions because what works in one State may not \nwork in another State. If we give States the flexibility, ultimately \nthey will do it better. They are the laboratories of democracy. That is \nwhy we believe in limited government and making decisions at the local \nlevel as close to home as possible, which is why I know so many \nGovernors across the country support the State Flexibility Act. I am \nhoping we get a successful vote in the Senate on it because whenever \nWashington makes a one-size-fits-all decision, it hardly ever works for \nmost folks back home.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. I believe this will have great bipartisan \nsupport among the Governors and hopefully in this body. I thank Senator \nBarrasso for bringing this to our attention.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank Senator Hatch.\n  Madam President, I will tell you, I still believe this is a law that \nis bad for patients, it is bad for health care providers of this \ncountry, the nurses and doctors who take care of them, bad for \ntaxpayers. I will be back at home in Wyoming over the weekend visiting \nwith patients, as well as providers, as well as taxpayers, listening to \nwhat they have to say. I know the people of Wyoming have great concerns \nabout this health care law and would like the kind of flexibility that \nis described in S. 868, the State Flexibility Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n170 are located in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I would like share the good work being done \nby my friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nPeter Welch.\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\n  As Democrats and Republicans continue their discussions, I am proud \nthat Peter is bringing a Vermont perspective and Vermont values to the \ndebate. He understands the dangers the United States faces if we \ndefault on our debt, but the burden of addressing our mounting national \ndebt must be shared fairly. Budgets are a reflection of our national \npriorities, and we simply cannot balance our budget on the backs of the \nmost vulnerable alone.\n  I applaud Peter for bringing his reasoned and responsible message to \nthe debate. I ask unanimous consent that an article on Congressman \nWelch from today's The Hill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Rep. Welch: Partisan Division Begs Clean Vote To Raise Nation's Debt \n                                Ceiling\n\n                            (By Mike Lillis)\n\n       Lawmakers seeking a bipartisan deficit-reduction plan to \n     accompany the looming debt-ceiling vote are deluding \n     themselves about the efficiency of Congress, according to the \n     Democrat spearheading the push for a clean debt-limit bill.\n       Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who has emerged in recent weeks \n     as the staunchest proponent of a standalone debt-ceiling \n     hike, said the parties are simply too far apart ideologically \n     to reach a budget deal in time to avoid the market turmoil \n     many fear would attend inaction on the debt limit.\n       In a sit-down interview with The Hill from his fourth-floor \n     Longworth office, Welch noted the recent fight over 2011 \n     spending took the country to the very brink of a government \n     shutdown.\n       The battle over the long-term budget will be even tougher \n     to resolve, he warned, and thus should be tackled separately \n     from the must-pass debt-limit hike.\n       ``If the leadership thinks it can make progress on some \n     steps that would move us toward a better long-term \n     sustainable budget--fine,'' Welch said Monday. ``But if any \n     of us are candid--and we saw how just the simple question of \n     trying to keep the lights on in the government brought us to \n     the midnight hour--do we realistically think that the gap \n     between the [Democrats'] approach on the budget and the \n     [Republicans'] approach on the budget can be bridged in that \n     period of time?''\n       Congress's systemic dysfunction was on display last month, \n     Welch charged, when Standard & Poor's revised its U.S. debt-\n     rating outlook from ``neutral'' to ``negative.'' That move \n     was largely influenced not by fiscal considerations, he \n     noted, but by ``a lack of confidence in Congress and its \n     ability to make the compromises that are required to get from \n     here to there.''\n       With that in mind, Welch last month spearheaded a letter \n     urging Democratic leaders to unite behind a clean debt-limit \n     bill. It was endorsed by 114 Democrats. The potential \n     economic fallout of flirting with default, he warned, is too \n     serious to saddle the debt-ceiling vote with politically \n     charged budget conditions.\n       ``This is not a matter of ripping up the credit card; this \n     is a matter of paying off the credit card,'' Welch said. \n     ``And if you don't allow us to do that . . . we're basically \n     saying we're going to stiff our creditors.''\n       For almost a century, Congress has set a cap on the \n     nation's debt, allowing the government to issue bonds to fund \n     its deficit spending--up to a certain level.\n       Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has projected the \n     government will surpass the current $14.3 trillion ceiling on \n     May 16. Recognizing the improbability that Congress will act \n     before then, Geithner on Monday told lawmakers he can take \n     ``extraordinary measures'' to stave off default for several \n     more months. He set the new deadline at Aug. 2.\n       All sides of the debate agree that Congress will ultimately \n     raise the debt ceiling. The question remains how it will do \n     that.\n       Republican leaders have insisted that the debt-limit vote \n     be coupled with a strategy for bringing down deficits over \n     the long haul--a sentiment shared by a growing number of \n     Senate Democrats.\n       ``The vehicle upon which something is likely to be achieved \n     to reduce government spending is the debt ceiling,'' Senate \n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters \n     Tuesday. ``I don't intend to vote to raise the debt ceiling \n     unless we do something significant about the debt.''\n       In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suggested \n     Tuesday that Republicans might stage a vote on a clean debt-\n     ceiling bill just to prove it can't pass--a strategy Welch \n     blasted as a ``political stunt.''\n       Rep. John Larson (Conn.), chairman of the House Democratic \n     Caucus, said this week that Democrats are ``amenable'' to \n     strategies that couple the debt-ceiling vote with a long-term \n     deficit-reduction plan--with a major caveat.\n       ``They just have to be consistent with not touching Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid and dismantling the social \n     compact between the American people and [their] government,'' \n     Larson told The Hill on Tuesday.\n       Therein lies the trouble, as GOP leaders are eyeing cuts to \n     all of those programs as part of their deficit-reduction \n     plans.\n       Leaders from both parties, representing both chambers, will \n     meet Thursday with Vice President Biden in the first official \n     attempt to reach a long-term budget agreement.\n       Welch, a chief deputy whip, doesn't have much faith in a \n     quick resolution.\n       ``The more the clock ticks, the more apprehension you'll \n     start to see in the markets,'' he warned. ``When this \n     happens, it could happen very quickly--and with devastating \n     consequences.''\n       It's not the first time Welch has emerged on the national \n     stage amid a thorny budget debate. In December, he was among \n     the fiercest opponents of the agreement between Obama and \n     McConnell to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts through \n     2012, even for the wealthiest Americans.\n       This week, he tempered that criticism with a bit of \n     pragmatism.\n       ``It was not a great deal, but it was the best deal [we \n     could get],'' he said. ``My criticism also acknowledges that \n     the president had his reasons, and we in the House--the \n     Democrats--didn't have the votes.''\n       Welch was also highly critical of the cuts to low-income \n     energy subsidies contained in Obama's 2012 budget proposal--\n     cuts Welch said would ``literally freeze'' his constituents \n     who rely on them to pay their heating bills.\n       ``A lot of us understood that the president was making a \n     statement,'' Welch said Monday of that critique. ``I \n     respected what motivated the president.''\n       In some sense, Welch's rise to prominence is as improbable \n     as passage of the clean debt-ceiling hike he's lobbying. The \n     third-term liberal is a relative newcomer to Capitol Hill. \n     And the Vermont he represents hardly shares the national \n     political reputation that characterizes many of its New \n     England neighbors.\n       Yet lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say Welch's \n     emergence is no accident. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), a Blue \n     Dog leader who shares a Capitol Hill apartment with the \n     liberal Welch, said his roommate studies hard and uses his \n     experience as a state legislator to great advantage in \n     Washington.\n       ``Peter is a nerd, just like me,'' Cooper said in an e-\n     mail. ``He actually takes the time to read legislation and \n     understand the issues, which has become a rarity in \n     Washington. Coming from state government, where you need to \n     balance the budget every year, he understands the importance \n     of paying for legislation. This has made him a key consensus \n     builder in the House and one of the strongest advocates of \n     fiscal responsibility in the Progressive Caucus.''\n       Rep. Peter Roskam (Ill.), the Republican chief deputy whip, \n     called Welch ``a happy warrior''--the rare legislator who \n     ``firmly believes in a set of principles'' but is also quick \n     to engage the other side.\n       ``When the country looks at Washington, they feel like \n     members are just talking past each other,'' Roskam told The \n     Hill this week. Welch, on the other hand, ``is very \n     engaging.''\n       The bookshelf in Welch's office tells a similar story. It \n     holds volumes by Nancy Pelosi as well as T. Boone Pickens; it \n     boasts the 9/11 Commission Report but also a collection of \n     poems by Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet and mystic.\n       Welch is also one of the few Democrats willing to go face \n     to face with Sean Hannity, the conservative--and \n     characteristically combative--Fox News pundit.\n       Welch conceded Monday that he ``got the Democratic \n     treatment'' during his recent Hannity appearance. But only by \n     reaching across the aisle, he said, will lawmakers in \n     Washington ever be truly effective.\n       ``A lot of us get in arguments as though it's an \n     ideological battle to be won, rather than a practical problem \n     to be solved. . . . That doesn't work for the country,'' he \n     said. ``I hope that we all can take a step back--all of us--\n     and see that there's real advantage to us trying to work \n     together.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2727-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2727-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senate Majority \nLeader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell in offering the strongest \npossible support for the Senate resolution honoring our heroic military \nand intelligence communities responsible for carrying out the mission \nthat resulted in the death of one of the most reviled murderers and \nnefarious menaces of our time--Osama bin Laden.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I \ncannot begin to commend our Armed Forces and intelligence professionals \nenough for their absolutely exceptional and flawless heroism in \nconducting the most perilous and consequential of operations. With the \nhighest level of perseverance, professionalism, service, and sacrifice \nconceivable, our bravest and finest joined forces and brought the day \nof reckoning and justice that long awaited this wretched terrorist.\n  This landmark event is indeed a significant stride in the war on \nterrorism. Since 9/11, the efforts of our tireless and dedicated Armed \nForces and intelligence operators have sought to keep our homeland safe \nand make the world more secure. On May 1, 2011, these efforts \nculminated in the death of one of\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nterrorism's global leaders, marking a decisive milestone in the war \nagainst terror. We are blessed with such brave and valiant men and \nwomen serving this country at home and abroad. These heroes have made \nselfless sacrifices and put their lives on the line for our Nation. \nWhile we are sleeping at night, they are fighting on our behalf. During \nthis now-legendary May 1 raid, their mettle and courage were brought to \nthe forefront for all the world to see.\n  As a result of the horrendous events of September 11, 2001, that are \netched upon our consciousness for all time, we will never be the same. \nOut of the rubble of September 11 rose our resolve, out of despair grew \nour determination, and out of the hate that was perpetrated upon us \nstood our humanity. We illustrated in word and deed that the iconic \nAmerican spirit is stronger and more permanent than any pain or \nsuffering that can be inflicted upon us.\n  If the likes of Osama bin Laden laid bare the unimaginable cruelties \nof which humankind is capable, it also imbued forever within our minds \nthe heights to which the human spirit can rise--even and especially in \nthe face of the most daunting of circumstances. The resilience we \nrecaptured as a country remains pressed upon our national psyche and \nthe memory of the inspirational sacrifices of so many heroic Americans \nwho perished that September morning will forever have a home in our \nhearts and our prayers.\n  I think about all of the servicemen and women who willingly joined \nthe military specifically to fight because of what happened on 9/11, \nand the sacrifices of their families and the lives that have been lost. \nToday, and every day, we express immeasurable gratitude to the over \n6,000 Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan who have given their lives to \nmake the world a safer place. Without their vital contributions, we \ncould not have achieved this milestone today. This resolution will \nstand as a testament that without the stalwart efforts and unwavering \ndedication of our valorous men and women in uniform and within our \nintelligence community, this threshold moment in our nation's history \nwould not have been possible.\n  While justice has been brought to the face of terrorism for the last \ndecade, we must remain vigilant. In the aftermath of bin Laden's death, \nthe threat posed by al-Qaida and other terrorist groups continues real \nand unabated--and we must remain on high alert. British statesman \nEdmund Burke once famously said ``all that is necessary for the forces \nof evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing.'' \nThese heroic patriots whom we laud today tracked their target with \nprecision, preparation, and patience, as well as an unmistakable sense \nof duty and valor reserved for only the best among us, and they \ndelivered a death knell that will reverberate for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ERICA QUIN-EASTER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, women-owned businesses are growing \nat one and a half times the national average in the United States. This \nastonishing statistic alone is impressive, but it should also be noted \nthat despite this growth women owned small businesses face unique \nchallenges. Thankfully there are programs in place that provide \nguidance to these entrepreneurs by individuals with specialized \nknowledge in women's business issues.\n  Today I commend and recognize an exceptional woman who epitomizes the \ncore values of entrepreneurship with conviction and competence--Erica \nQuin-Easter, a microenterprise coordinator at Maine Centers for Women, \nWork & Community in Presque Isle. Ms. Quin-Easter was recently named \nMaine's 2011 Women in Business Champion by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, and she is being recognized today for this achievement \nat a luncheon in Bangor. This is a richly deserved honor as Ms. Quin-\nEaster continuously focuses on enhancing women's abilities to bring to \nfruition their dreams of small business ownership.\n  Maine Centers for Women, Work & Community was founded in 1978. It \nserves as the only statewide comprehensive women's economic development \norganization in Maine. In 2008, Ms. Quin-Easter joined the Maine Center \nfor Women, Work & Community at the Presque Isle location. The Presque \nIsle location serves Aroostook County, our State's largest and \nnorthernmost county. Since joining Women, Work & Community, Ms. Quin-\nEaster has assisted nearly 500 entrepreneurs on topics from loans to \ntaxes to business plans.\n  Ms. Quin-Easter also strives to educate the greater small business \ncommunity, extending her reach beyond those who may utilize the \ncenter's resources. For example, this past March she wrote an article \nfor the Bangor Daily News to enlighten small business owners on taking \ncontrol of their business finances. Work such as this demonstrates Ms. \nQuin-Easter's commitment to ensuring that small businesses throughout \nMaine prosper. She also assisted in organizing a day-long seminar for \nwomen called ``ALL for Women''--Aroostook Leadership and Learning for \nWomen--to connect them with other business and community leaders and \nmentors to assist in gathering insight and confidence to reach for \ntheir dreams of self employment.\n  In addition to Ms. Quin-Easter's excellent work for small businesses, \nshe continually seeks to enhance and promote her community. As a long-\ntime musician and composer, Ms. Quin-Easter recently collaborated with \npoets and musicians to arrange ``(F)light.'' This piece will showcase \nWomen in Harmony, a 60-member chorus of women's voices in Portland, \nwith whom Ms. Quin-Easter previously sang.\n  Furthermore, Ms. Quin-Easter works on the board of directors for \nMomentum Aroostook Board and Wintergreen Arts Center. While engaging in \nthese philanthropic endeavors, Ms. Quin-Easter is also a University of \nMaine Canadian-American Center fellow. For one person this is an \nextraordinary workload, but Ms. Quin-Easter's daily energy and \nenthusiasm shine throughout all her work. Her many contributions to \nMaine, and Aroostook County in particular, demonstrate her commitment \nto enhancing cultural diversity across our State and helping others \nimprove their own conditions.\n  Erica Quin-Easter is truly an inspiring individual. Her dedication to \nencouraging and counseling women entrepreneurs and small business \nowners is exemplary and inspiring. I thank Erica for her tireless work \non behalf of women and congratulate her on the distinction of being \nnamed ``Maine's 2011 Women in Business Champion'' by the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, a very well deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2728-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2728-S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \nhonor a very special group of veterans.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the centennial of the establishment of Mother's \nDay; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMother's Day Centennial Coin Commemorative Coin Act. I am proud to be \njoined by a bipartisan group of cosponsors including Senators Manchin, \nCochran, Stabenow, and Whitehouse.\n  With Mother's Day set for Sunday, May 8th, this is a special event \nfor all of West Virginia because this annual tribute to our mothers \nbegan in West Virginia. In 1908, a West Virginian woman by the name of \nAnna Jarvis petitioned her local church to declare May 9th as Mother's \nDay. She hoped that this holiday would serve as a remembrance for \nmothers and a reminder for peace. Within a year, all 46 current States \nheld some sort of Mother's Day and a mere 5 years later, Congress and \nthe President declared the second Sunday of May national Mother's Day. \nThe centennial for the national recognition of Mother's Day will occur \nin 2014, and this bill provides an opportunity to commemorate the \ncentennial of this great holiday and further recognize the millions of \nAmerican mothers whose essential role in life cannot be overstated.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would recognize the centennial \nof Mother's Day by authorizing the Treasury to mint commemorative \nMother's Day coins. Profits generated from the sale of these coins \nwould be donated to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and The National \nOsteoporosis Foundation. Susan G. Komen for the Cure has raised nearly \n$2 billion for breast cancer research since 1982, and the National \nOsteoporosis Foundation is considered our Nation's leading voluntary \nhealth organization.\n  Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer \nand nearly 40,000 die of this devastating disease. This legislation not \nonly honors our Nation's mothers, but also helps to raise funds to \nfight the second most prevalent cancer in women. Thousands of mothers \nhave benefited from the efforts of these organizations and they are \nwell deserving of our support. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues' \nsupport for this legislation to honor every mother in our country and \nto prepare for the upcoming centennial. Celebrating Mother's Day by \nhelping to promote the health of American mothers seems to be a fitting \ntribute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 890. A bill to establish the supplemental fraud fighting account, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with Senator \nGrassley to introduce the Fighting Fraud to Protect Taxpayers Act of \n2011. Combating fraud is a vital issue on which Senator Grassley and I \nhave a long track record of working together, and with great success. \nIn these trying economic times, cracking down on the fraud which has \nharmed so many hardworking Americans is more important than ever. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Grassley, and with Senators from \nboth parties, to quickly pass this crucial legislation.\n  In the last Congress, one of the first major bills the Senate \nJudiciary Committee considered, and one of the first bills President \nObama signed into law, was the Leahy-Grassley Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act. That bill gave fraud investigators and prosecutors \nadditional tools and resources to better hold those who commit fraud \naccountable. We heard about the significant success that has already \nresulted from the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act and other key \nfraud fighting provisions we championed in a Judiciary Committee \nhearing earlier this year, but it is clear that our work is not done.\n  In the past two years, we have learned much more about the scourges \nof financial fraud, mortgage fraud, government contracting fraud, \nhealth care fraud, and oil and gas fraud. I have also been very \ndisturbed by the ongoing reports about inaccurate, forged, or \nfraudulent documents in the housing foreclosure process. Today's bill \nreflects the ongoing need to invest in enforcement to better protect \nhard-working taxpayers from all of these insidious types of fraud.\n  In the last fiscal year alone, the Department of Justice recovered \nwell over $6 billion through fines, penalties, and recoveries from \nfraud cases--far more than it costs to investigate and prosecute these \nmatters. The recovery of these vast sums of money demonstrates that \ninvestment in fraud enforcement pays for itself many times over.\n  The Fighting Fraud to Protect Taxpayers Act capitalizes on this rate \nof return by ensuring that a percentage of money recovered by the \nGovernment through fines and penalties in fraud cases and other \ncriminal cases is reinvested in the investigation and prosecution of \nfraud cases. That means that we can ensure more fraud enforcement, more \nreturns to the government, and more savings to taxpayers, all without \nspending new taxpayer money.\n  The bill also makes other modest changes to ensure that prosecutors \nand investigators have the tools they need to combat fraud. It extends \nthe international money laundering bill statute to tax evasion crimes. \nThis will deter individuals from evading our tax laws by hiding their \nmoney overseas. It also protects American consumers from identity theft \nby strengthening the prohibition against trafficking in passwords and \nthe federal identity theft statute. As more and more business is \nconducted online, we must ensure that consumers' personal information \nremains protected.\n  The Secret Service has responsibility for investigating a variety of \ncomplex financial fraud crimes, including identity theft. This bill \ngives the Secret Service additional tools to conduct critical \nundercover investigations. Fraud cases are often complex and difficult \nto prove, so undercover investigations can be a key way to ferret out \ncriminal activity.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Grassley and I worked together to \nstrengthen the False Claims Act, which empowers whistleblowers to shine \na light on fraud and recover stolen tax dollars that would otherwise go \nundiscovered. These new laws are already paying off. Since January \n2009, the Department of Justice has recovered more than $6.8 billion in \nFalse Claims Act cases, far more than any other 2-year period. Today's \nlegislation asks the Attorney General to report to Congress on False \nClaims Act settlements, which will help ensure that the False Claims \nAct remains a valuable tool for fighting fraud.\n  Finally, the bill promotes accountability within Government. Along \nwith requiring reporting, it takes modest steps to ensure that the \nresources already entrusted to the Justice Department are used \nresponsibly by strengthening oversight of the Department's Working \nCapital Fund.\n  Major fraud cases take time to investigate and prosecute. The renewed \nfocus on fraud enforcement we have seen from this administration and \nfrom Congress will continue to yield significant results. But we must \ncontinue to give law enforcement agencies the tools and resources \nnecessary to root out fraud so that they can continue to recoup losses \nand protect taxpayer funds. Everyday, taxpaying Americans deserve to \nknow that their Government is doing all it can to hold responsible \nthose who commit fraud and to prevent future fraud.\n  Americans are worried about their budgets at home. We need to protect \ntheir investment in their government. Fighting fraud and protecting \ntaxpayer dollars are issues Democrats and Republicans have worked \ntogether to address in the past, and in these difficult economic times, \nwe need to continue in that spirit of bipartisanship. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Grassley, the administration, and Senators of both \nparties to crack down on fraud by passing the Fighting Fraud to Protect \nTaxpayers Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fighting Fraud to Protect \n     Taxpayers Act of 2011''.\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfinancial assistance to the State of Louisiana for a pilot program to \ndevelop measures to eradicate or control feral swine and to assess and \nrestore wetlands damaged by feral swine; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill be a critical component in our efforts to recover and rebuild \nLouisiana's vast coastal wetlands. My bill works to address the \nthreatening problem of coastal wetland deterioration in Louisiana \ncaused by non-native, invasive feral swine populations. Few are aware \nthat the marsh and wetlands along Louisiana's coast comprise some 40 \npercent of the Nation's total salt marshes. Louisiana's coastline is a \nnational treasure. Yet, this national treasure is disappearing at an \nalarming rate due to a number of natural and man-made factors, \nincluding the destruction of wetlands caused by non-native feral pig \npopulations that are literally eating away the coast.\n  Louisiana's coastline is an increasingly fragile and finite source of \nprotection. It protects against storm surges, the varied effects of \nclimate change, and it protects the many communities that thrive on the \ncoastal plains of Louisiana. The survival of the affected acreage is \ncrucial not only to the continued existence of my State and the states \ndirectly above mine--which will be affected if Louisiana's wetlands \ncontinue to deteriorate--but also to our Nation's energy independence \nand security. Forty percent of America's refining capacity flows from \nthe Gulf Coast to service the rest of our Nation, and if Louisiana's \ncoastline continues to disappear, our Nation's refiners and energy \ninfrastructure will be jeopardized. As such, the loss of our\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nwetlands threatens not only our teeming wildlife, but also land, lives, \nenergy infrastructure, and navigation.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the Feral Swine Eradication and \nControl Pilot Program Act of 2011, to address the challenges these \nspecies pose to our efforts to reverse coastal wetland deterioration.\n  Every 30 minutes, a portion of Louisiana's coast the size of a \nfootball field is converted from healthy marsh into open water. Since \n1930, 1.2 million acres have been lost. That is an area roughly the \nsize of Delaware. Scientists predict that Louisiana will lose another \n700 square miles of coastal wetlands by 2050. That is an area the size \nof the greater Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas.\n  Exacerbating this problem is the irresponsible introduction of the \nferal hog to Louisiana. This invasive species has caused extensive \ndamage to our natural wildlife habitat. In Louisiana, the wild \nomnivores compete with native wildlife for food resources; prey on \nyoung domestic animals and wildlife; and carry diseases that can affect \npets, livestock, wildlife and people. Scientists now believe that the \nferal hogs are not only imposing enormous damage to the marsh, but are \nalso negatively impacting native freshwater mussels and insects by \ncontributing E. coli to water systems.\n  According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the \nwild pig is the most prolific large mammal in North America and given \nadequate nutrition, its populations in an area can double in just four \nmonths.\n  Louisiana's landscape has already been ravaged by the nutria rodent. \nIn 2002, the first program was created to combat the increasing nutria \npopulations. This program, the Coast-wide Nutria Control Program, CNCP, \nincentivized trappers to catch nutria in return for monetary \ncompensation. This program has proven successful at decreasing nutria \npopulations and significantly reducing their impact to coastal \nwetlands.\n  However, more effort was needed to further reduce the nutria damage \nto wetlands, both in Louisiana and in other marshy environments, \nincluding Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. The Nutria Eradication and Control \nAct was enacted in 2003 to provide a critical supplement of funding to \nstrengthen the Coast-wide Nutria Control Program. In July of 2009, I \njoined my friend and colleague Senator Cardin in introducing the re-\nauthorization of the Nutria Eradication and Control Act. These two \nmeasures to combat nutria populations have been instrumental in \nreducing the nutria damage to Louisiana's wetlands.\n  Unfortunately, now Louisiana has another pest eroding its marshes and \nwetlands. Feral swine are listed by the World Conservation Union, IUCN, \nas one of the top 100 invasive species worldwide. If action is not \ntaken to control the feral swine population, our biologists fear these \nanimals will undo much of the progress Louisiana has made in \ncontrolling the nutria population. It is my hope that with the help of \nmy colleagues, we can pass this bill to help eradicate these pests from \nour vanishing coastline once and for all.\n  For these reasons, it is imperative that we control the feral swine \nin Louisiana. As such, the bill I am introducing today authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to allocate funding to create a pilot program \nmodeled off of the Nutria Eradication and Control Act. This program \nwill assess the nature and extent of damage to the wetlands in \nLouisiana and develop methods to eradicate or control the feral swine \npopulation, and restore the coastal areas damaged by this invasive \nspecies. It is a small program, but the benefits are potentially vast. \nIt is my hope that by creating this program, we can achieve similar \nsuccess at combating feral hogs as we have had at controlling nutria \npopulations.\n  It is for all of these reasons that this legislation is crucial. I \nask that my colleagues support its prompt passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Webb, Mr. Tester, \n        Mr. Begich, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Brown of \n        Massachusetts, Mr. Moran and Mr. Boozman):\n  S. 894. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nan increase, effective December 1, 2011, in the rates of compensation \nfor veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of \ndependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain \ndisabled veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Veterans' \nCompensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2011.\n  Effective December 1, 2011, this measure directs the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to increase the rates of veterans' compensation to \nkeep pace with a rise in the cost-of-living, should an adjustment be \nprompted by an increase in the Consumer Price Index, CPI. Referred to \nas the COLA, this important legislation would make an increase \navailable to veterans at the same level as an increase provided to \nrecipients of Social Security benefits.\n  All of my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs: Senators \nBurr, Rockefeller, Akaka, Sanders, Brown of Ohio, Webb, Tester, Begich, \nIsakson, Wicker, Johanns, Brown of Massachusetts, Moran, and Boozman \njoin me in introducing this important legislation. I look forward to \nour continued work together to improve the lives of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Last year, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Public \nLaw 111-247, which would have increased veterans' compensation rates \nhad there been an increase in the CPI. While there was no cost-of-\nliving increase in 2011 due to a decline in the CPI, the 2012 \nadjustment was projected to be .9 percent in the President's fisal year \n2012 budget submission.\n  The COLA affects so many important benefits, including veterans' \ndisability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for \nsurviving spouses and children. It is projected that over 3.5 million \nveterans and survivors will receive compensation benefits in fiscal \nyear 2012.\n  As the daughter of a disabled veteran, I understand the critical \nnature of these benefits as many recipients depend upon these tax-free \npayments for their most basic needs, in addition to the needs of their \nspouses and children. We have an obligation to the men and women who \nhave sacrificed so much to serve our country and who now deserve \nnothing less than the full support of a grateful Nation.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to clarify that uncertified States and Indian tribes have \nthe authority to use certain payments for certain non-coal reclamation \nprojects and acid mine remediation programs; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill important to \npublic health and safety and the environment. This legislation \naddresses an interpretation by the Department of the Interior, DOI, \nwhich restricts the ability of states to use certain funds under the \nAbandoned Mine Land, AML, Program authorized by the Surface Mining \nControl and Reclamation Act, SMCRA, for non-coal abandoned mine \nreclamation and for the remediation of acid mine drainage. This bill is \nidentical to legislation that was reported by voice vote by the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources last Congress.\n  Amendments to SMCRA, passed as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care \nAct of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, reauthorized collection of an AML fee \non coal produced in the United States and made certain modifications to \nthe AML program. The amendments also provided that so-called ``make-\nup'' funds, amounts that had accrued to the states and tribes for \nseveral years under the formula in SMCRA but had not been previously \nappropriated, be paid out to the states and tribes over a period of \nyears as mandatory payments.\n  Under the AML program, which is administered by DOI, funds are \nexpended to reclaim abandoned mine lands, with top priority for \nprotecting public health, safety, general welfare, and property, and \nrestoration of land and water resources adversely affected by past \nmining practices. The program is largely directed to abandoned coal \nmine reclamation, but beginning in 1977 when SMCRA was first enacted, \nfunds have been available pursuant to section 409 to address abandoned \nnon-coal mine sites. A review of the legislative history of this \nprovision and the long-standing administrative interpretation of \nsection 409 reveals that the section is intended to address ``non-coal \nmine reclamation'' on abandoned mine lands.\n  Western states such as New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah have \nprioritized the use of AML funds to undertake the most pressing \nreclamation work on both abandoned coal and non-coal mine sites. While \nactivities on non-coal mine sites have consumed a relatively \ninsignificant portion of the funding provided for the overall AML \nprogram, the results in terms of public health and safety in these \nstates is considerable, and there is significant work yet to be done.\n  Similarly, the use of AML funds for remediation of acid mine drainage \nhas been important in many areas, especially in the Appalachian states, \nsuch as Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Until enactment of \nthe 2006 amendments to SMCRA, states and tribes with approved AML \nprograms had been able to set aside up to 30 percent of their AML funds \nfor acid mine drainage remediation without respect to time limitations \nthat would otherwise apply.\n  In 2007, the Solicitor at the Department of the Interior interpreted \nthe amendments as limiting the ability of uncertified states and tribes \nto use the ``make-up'' AML funds for priority non-coal abandoned mine \nreclamation and acid mine drainage set-aside programs. See Memorandum \nOpinion M-37014. The Solicitor found that these make-up funds cannot be \nused for priority non-coal mine reclamation in the case of states and \ntribes that had not certified completion of their coal reclamation work \nand likewise cannot be used for acid mine drainage set-aside programs.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would correct what I believe is \nan unfortunate and unintended interpretation of the 2006 amendments by \nmodifying the language of SMCRA to clarify that the funding would be \navailable for non-coal abandoned mine reclamation and acid mine \ndrainage set-aside programs as it was prior to the passage of the \namendments in 2006.\n  I want to underscore that the bill does not increase funding to the \nstates and tribes. It simply clarifies that states and tribes can have \nflexibility to use AML funds that they receive under existing law for \nthese two important uses, as was the case prior to the 2006 amendments. \nI hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, which has \nimportant implications nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary to establish a comprehensive design standard program to \nprevent, control, and treat polluted stormwater runoff from federally \nfunded highways and roads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that \nwill help prevent millions of gallons of pollution from entering our \nNation's precious water resources. The season we are in makes my \nlegislation particularly timely. Spring is one of the wettest times of \nyear, and with every Spring shower polluted stormwater runoff washes a \nmyriad of chemicals pollutants, sediment, debris, oil and grease, and \nother contaminates from our nation's roads and highways into our lakes, \nrivers, streams, bays, and coastal waters.\n  Stormwater is the Nation's largest source of water pollution. While \nrain itself contains air pollution particulates that are deposited in \nevery drop, most stormwater pollution is picked up on the surface and \ncarried off as runoff. Stormwater washes contaminants like oil, grease, \nheavy metals, nutrients, asbestos, sediments, road salts and other de-\nicing agents, brake dust, and road debris from the millions of miles of \nAmerica's roads and into storm drains that discharge into nearby \nwaters. Almost all of this polluted stormwater is discharged without \nany treatment.\n  When rain falls on these hard, impervious surfaces it often has no \nwhere to go but down the channels created by curbs and retaining walls, \ninto storm drains and into the nearest natural water body. According to \nresearch compiled by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric \nAdministration's, NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center, the U.S. is \ncovered by more than 112,600 square kilometers of impervious surfaces. \nThat is a space larger than the State of Ohio. With 985,139 miles of \nFederal aid highways stretching from every corner of the country, \npolluted highway runoff is no small problem facing our Nation's waters.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n  The effects of polluted stormwater runoff are real. For example, the \nAnacostia River--Washington's ``other'' and often forgotten river--can \nbe seen from the Capitol Dome as it flows out of Prince George's \nCounty, MD, and into the District and on to its confluence with the \nPotomac. Runoff from within the 176 square mile watershed of the \nAnacostia, most of which is in Maryland, but also includes the east \nside of D.C. and the entire Capitol complex, all makes its way into the \nAnacostia. The stormwater that enters the Anacostia is extremely \npolluted from the thousands of acres of road surfaces that cover the \nwatershed, which exacerbates the incidence of combined sewer overflows \nand has impaired the Anacostia for many years. It is no coincidence \nthat the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has found the Anacostia's bottom-\nfeeder catfish to have the highest incidence of liver tumors than any \nother population of catfish in the country. The cause of the tumors are \nthe high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a by-product of \nfuel combustion, that come from vehicle tailpipe emissions and are \ndeposited on the road and in the air and then washed into the river \nwith every shower or thunderstorm.\n  This is not a problem unique to Maryland or the Chesapeake Bay \nregion, nor is it a problem unique to urban environments as opposed to \nrural environments. Polluted runoff is a problem that affects any \nwatershed where impervious paved road and highway surfaces have altered \nthe natural hydrology of a watershed. Over time, federal highway policy \nhas come to recognize the drastic impacts highways and surface \ntransportation can have on the environment and on water quality. Title \n23 of the U.S. Code states: ``transportation should play a significant \nrole in promoting economic growth, improving the environment, and \nsustaining the quality of life'' through the use of ``context sensitive \nsolutions.'' The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, \nISTEA, authorized using transportation enhancement funds for \n``environmental mitigation to address water pollution due to highway \nrunoff.'' It is important to note, however, that this is just one of 12 \ntypes of eligible enhancement projects and only 1.1 percent of \nenhancement project funds have gone toward environmental mitigation \nprojects since 1992.\n  In 2008, at the request of the House Transportation & Infrastructure \nCommittee, the Government Accountability Office issued a report \nexamining key issues and challenges that need to be addressed in the \nnext reauthorization of the transportation bill. That report \nhighlighted the clear link between transportation policy and the \nenvironment. Taking a policy approach to require that the planning, \ndesign, and construction of highways are done in an environmentally \nresponsible manner, with an eye toward mitigating the water quality \nimpacts highways have on our Nation's water resources, will help \naddress this issue and better meet our Nation's transportation goals. \nThis legislation also helps advance the October 5, 2009, Executive \nOrder affirming that Federal policy and Federal agencies shall \n``conserve and protect water resources through efficiency, reuse, and \nstormwater management; eliminate waste, recycle, and prevent pollution; \nand leverage agency acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable \ntechnologies and environmentally preferable materials, products and \nservices.''\n  Over the years, The U.S. Department of Transportation has established \ndesign standards for federal-aid highways to improve the performance \nand safety of our highway infrastructure. These design standard \nimprovements were the result of obvious safety and engineering problems \nthat needed to be addressed. These design standard are essential to \nensuring that the Federal Government's investment in transportation \ninfrastructure is resulting in a well-designed, safe and reliable \n``product'' for the benefit of the American people.\n  The same can be said for the need for establishing environmental \ndesign standards for Federal-aid highways as a means of protecting \nwater quality. While stormwater runoff from highways may be classified \nas non-point source pollution, it is unquestionably the source of a \nwide range of contaminants that impair rivers, lakes, streams and \ncoastal waters; create costly remedial situations; and detract from the \nvalue and health of our precious water resources. Requiring Federal-aid \nhighways to meet an environmental standard for protecting water quality \nwill improve the value of the Federal Government's investment in our \nNation's highway infrastructure.\n  The approach my legislation takes to mitigate polluted highway runoff \nis through the implementation of a design standard, developed by the \nUnited States Department of Transportation, requiring the maintenance \nor restoration of the pre-development hydrology of a federal-aid \nhighway project site. This same approach was made law by the Energy \nIndependence & Security Act of 2007 for the development of new Federal \nbuildings and facilities.\n  My bill would require that all substantial federal highway projects \nmust be planned and designed ``to ensure that covered projects are \nsited, constructed and maintained in accordance with design standards \nintended to protect surface and ground water quality and ensure the \nlong-term management of stormwater originating from Federal-aid \nhighways.'' This would be achieved by approaches that avoid and \nminimize alteration of natural features and hydrology and maximize the \nuse of onsite pollution control measures using existing terrain and \nnatural features.\n  My bill also recognizes that geography and other physical \ncharacteristics of the land may not always allow on-site treatment of \npolluted highway runoff. When conditions are impracticable my \nlegislation would allow for an ``appropriate off-site runoff pollution \nmitigation program'' within the watershed of a Federal-aid highway \nproject site that can protect against the water quality impacts of the \nproject.\n  The Clean Water Act requires that we protect the waters of the United \nStates. As with most pollution abatement strategies, preventing \nstormwater pollution is cheaper, more effective, and easier to \nimplement than trying to clean up and remediate the problem after \ncontamination has occurred.\n  Not addressing stormwater pollution at its source just kicks the \nproverbial can down the road for someone else to deal with. When water \nresources are contaminated by polluted highway runoff, mitigating the \npollution, which is a preventable discharge in the first place, should \nnot be the responsibility of local goverments, wastewater treatment \nfacilities, or drinking water utilities.\n  Water pollution has many sources and our nation's highways produce a \ntremendous volume of contaminated stormwater. Time and time again, \nexperience has taught us that addressing pollution at its source is the \nmost effective means of abating pollution. It is time we applied this \nprinciple to our Nation's Federal-aid highways. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my legislation and help move our country closer to meeting the \ngoals of the Clean Water Act and the goals of our national \ntransportation policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Merkley, and Mrs. Hagan):\n  S. 899. A bill to provide for the eradication and control of nutria; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to reintroduce the Nutria \nEradication and Control Act of 2011 along with my colleagues, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Mikulski, Senator Merkley, and Senator Hagan. This \nlegislation will build on the successful Nutria Eradication and Control \nAct of 2003. This program encourages habitat protection, education, \nresearch, monitoring, and capacity building to provide for the long-\nterm protection of coastal wetlands from destruction caused by nutria.\n  Invasive species are one of the largest threats to biodiversity in \nthe United States today. As invasive species go, the nutria is one of \nthe most destructive creatures we have, especially in my home State of \nMaryland and in Louisiana.\n  The nutria is a large, semi-aquatic rodent that was originally \nbrought to the United States to bolster the fur trade in the early 20th \ncentury. Unfortunately, we underestimated their strong appetite and \nhigh reproductive\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\npotential. Since their introduction, the nutria have damaged millions \nof acres of wetlands and countless miles of shoreline and have even \nearned a spot among the International Union for Conservation of \nNature's list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. By the \nearly 1990s, the Chesapeake Bay/Delmarva Peninsula population was \nestimated to exceed 150,000 animals.\n  These ``eating machines'' can consume up to 25 percent of their body \nweight in plants per day, feasting directly on plant roots. This wrecks \nhavoc on our wetlands, turning our once productive lands into barren \nmud flats. The destruction exacerbates the damaging impacts of ongoing \nland subsidence and sea level rise.\n  We understand how important our wetlands are and provide numerous \necosystem services to our society. They provide fish and wildlife \nhabitat, flood protection, erosion control, and water quality \npreservation.\n  In my own State of Maryland, nutria invaded the Blackwater National \nWildlife Refuge nearly 6 decades ago, destroying vital habitat for \nnative shorebirds, muskrats, and blue crabs. They are responsible for \nthe loss of more than 5,000 acres of wetlands in this refuge alone.\n  We must remember this has a significant impact on people--people who \ndepend on it for their livelihood and for people who use it for \nrecreation. The loss of Blackwater wetlands, that are vital to the \nfishery, was estimated to cost Maryland's economy nearly $4 million \nannually. Millions of Americans spend billions of dollars pursuing \ntheir fishing, hunting and wildlife watching activities, which \ncontribute to millions of jobs in industries and businesses that \nsupport wildlife-related recreation.\n  In 2000, Congress established a Federal funding source to develop a \nsuccessful public-private partnership program to address nutria in \nMaryland. This financial support has directly led to the successful \neradiation of nutria from 150,000 acres of the approximate 400,000 \nacres of wetland habitats that they infest. The project success is due \nto strategic planning, permanent and dedicated staff members, and \ncooperation with private landowners.\n  In Louisiana, an incentive program is used to encourage trappers to \ntrap nutria. Since the implementation of the program, the damage to \ncoastal wetlands has been reduced from 90,000 to 20,000 acres.\n  The management techniques developed in Maryland and Louisiana have \nalready been exported to other states like Oregon and Washington to \ncontrol their own nutria populations and minimize the damage done to \ntheir marsh habitats. Healthy wetlands are returning to places where \nnutria have been removed. But the job is not yet done.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of \n2009 to continue and improve the successful nutria eradication program \nin Maryland and Louisiana and expand it to other significantly impacted \nstates like Oregon and Washington. This bill passed out of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in 2009 and had the support of \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Department of Natural \nResources, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries, and the \nNature Conservancy.\n  Today, I proudly rise again and rededicate myself to passing the \nNutria Eradication Control Act of 2011. This bill will authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance to the states \nof Maryland, Louisiana, Delaware, Oregon, Washington, the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, and North Carolina to eradicate and control nutria \npopulations and restore nutria-damaged wetlands.\n  We know how valuable our wetlands are. We know how destructive the \nnutria is. We know what we can do to stop the nutria and that these \nprograms work. I urge my colleagues to remember that we have a \nresponsibility to be good stewards of the earth and to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to award \ngrants to educational organizations to carry out educational programs \nabout the Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Simon \nWiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act. This important \nlegislation would provide competitive grants for educational \norganizations to make Holocaust education more accessible and available \nthroughout this Nation.\n  I would like to commend my former colleague in the House, \nCongresswoman Maloney, for her leadership on this issue. I also want to \nthank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, for agreeing to \nbe an original cosponsor.\n  This past Monday, we solemnly commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day, \nin memorial of perhaps the greatest crime ever perpetrated against \nhumanity. As we reflect upon the tragedies of the events surrounding \nthe Holocaust, the lives lost, the families destroyed, the potential \nunfulfilled, we must renew our oath to never forget, so this dark \nchapter in history will never be repeated.\n  We must forever remember the approximately six million Jewish men, \nwomen and children, as well as millions of others who faced \npersecution, displacement, and death at the hands of the Nazis. We must \nremember their stories not just to honor their lives, but more \nimportantly, to educate the next generation about the dangers of \nintolerance, ignorance, and bigotry. I could not think of a better \nnamesake for this bill, Simon Wiesenthal, who honored the memories of \nthose lost by dedicating his life to bringing those responsible to \njustice.\n  Some people might ask why we need to learn more about something that \nhappened over 65 years ago and an entire ocean away. The same critics \nmight argue that anti-Semitism, while terrible, is a relic of the past \nthat will never be repeated. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and \nwe, as a Nation, must not ignore this appalling truth.\n  Even to this day, we do not have to go half way around the world to \nfind examples of intolerance and hate; rather we can look into our own \nneighborhoods and communities. According to the FBI, there were 1,376 \nhate crimes motivated by religious bias in 2009. More than 7 out of 10 \nof these crimes were perpetrated against Jews because of their \nreligion. In fact, even in my own State of New Jersey, a State of \nimmense diversity, tolerance and understanding, we have seen a number \nof incidents that tear at the fabric of our society.\n  In July of 2010, a Rabbi and his 12 year old son were subject to \nanti-Semitic slurs from an unidentified man in a sedan as they walked \ntowards their synagogue in Edison, NJ.\n  A few days after, the Edison Police Department investigated a second \nanti-Semitic incident at a Lexus dealership where eight cars had been \nvandalized with swastikas.\n  Last year in Chatham, New Jersey, anti-Semitic leaflets with the \nwords ``Kill Jews'' were littered throughout the town. Local police \nfound the culprit and arrested him. However, Chatham Township Police \nsaid they could only charge the offender with littering because he was \nnot apparently targeting an individual.\n  New Jersey college students at Rutgers University have also \nexperienced this terrible discrimination on numerous occasions. This \npast fall, when a guest speaker came to present at a Jewish event on \ncampus, he was continually harassed by a large group of students that \nshouted slurs and disrupted his speech several times. Since then, there \nhas been an escalation of anti-Semitic incidents. One of which included \na student event this past January that attempted to exploit the \nHolocaust and accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing. When students showed \nup in peaceful protest, they were charged an admission fee, while \nsupporters of the event were admitted for free.\n  These troubling events do not occur in a vacuum. They are fed by \nbigotry, hatred, and above all else: ignorance. This ignorance is \nfueled by provocative, dangerous, and bigoted rhetoric that both \nthreaten the safety and well being of individuals, while also insulting \nthe honor of millions of Jewish people. So called academics seek to \nrewrite history to minimize and spin the facts surrounding the \nHolocaust; the government of Iran has waged campaigns not just to \nrewrite, but to simply erase an inconvenient truth. This is not an \nacademic issue shrouded in intellectualism; Holocaust denial is bald-\nfaced anti-Semitism, rooted in hate, and it has no place in our \nsociety.\n  We cannot sit idly by and hope that time alone will heal these \nwounds. We must take proactive steps to ensure that our society may \nproperly study and take lessons from the Holocaust. Holocaust education \nis essential for school children so that we may achieve this goal.\n  Although some States now require the Holocaust to be taught in public \nschools, the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act goes \nfurther and makes grants available to organizations that instruct \nstudents, teachers, and communities about the dangers of hate and the \nimportance of tolerance in our society. This legislation would give \neducators the appropriate resources and training to teach accurate \nhistorical information about the Holocaust and convey the lessons that \nthe Holocaust can teach us today.\n  However, while much growth and healing have come about in the 66 \nyears since Auschwitz was liberated, there remains a significant \nbarrier that we must break through. After 6 decades, many of our youth \nmay view the Holocaust as an event that occurred in the distant past. \nOnly by proper acknowledgement of the incredible loss of life during \nthe Holocaust, will we ever be able to ensure that such an event never \nhappens again.\n  It is in our common interest to raise our voices against anti-\nSemitism and against all hatred and discrimination. Funding accurate \neducational programs on the Holocaust is a step toward winning this \nbattle.\n  So as America stands with Israel and all followers of the Jewish \nfaith in condemning anti-Semitism, let us do everything in our power to \nend discrimination and educate future generations about the danger of \nhatred and bigotry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 902. A bill to amend part D of title V of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the repair, \nrenovation, and construction of elementary and secondary schools; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, safe, modern, healthy school buildings are \nessential to creating an environment where students can reach their \nfull academic potential. Today, too many students in the United States, \nparticularly those most at risk of being left behind, attend school in \nfacilities that are old, overcrowded and run-down. The 2009 \nInfrastructure Report Card compiled by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers gives public schools a D grade. Too many of our Nation's \nschools were built over a half century ago, and are not equipped to \nmeet the needs of 21st Century students and teachers. School-facility \nneeds are impacting the preparedness of our children for work in \ncritical fields, such as mathematics and science.\n  The National Center for Education Statistics reported in 2000 that \nthe Nation's elementary and secondary\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\nschools required approximately $127 billion to repair or upgrade their \nfacilities. A 2008 State-by-State analysis by the American Federation \nof Teachers found that the Nation's school infrastructure needs total \nan estimated $255 billion. While the condition of public school \nbuildings is primarily a state and local responsibility, the Federal \nGovernment can and should help, especially when it comes to closing \ndisparities between affluent and disadvantaged school districts. The \ncurrent economic environment makes it exceedingly difficult for States \nand school districts to renovate and in some cases build new schools to \nmeet this important need.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the School Building Fairness \nAct. This legislation provides $1 billion to States for competitive \nmatching grants to local educational agencies; LEAs, for school repair, \nrenovation, and construction. In awarding the grants, States must \nconsider poverty, condition of school facilities, capacity, adherence \nto green building standards, and likelihood of maintenance. I have seen \nthis work in Iowa with the success of the Iowa Demonstration \nConstruction Grant Program, which provided over $121 million in federal \nassistance to over 300 school districts and leveraged more than $600 \nmillion of additional local funding through the matching requirement. I \nam sure that it will work across the rest of the country. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Building Fairness Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Providing safe, healthy, and up-to-date public \n     elementary and secondary school facilities is a crucial \n     component of improving student academic performance and \n     retaining high-quality, committed educators.\n       (2) The 2009 Infrastructure Report Card compiled by the \n     American Society of Civil Engineers gives public schools a D \n     grade.\n       (3) The National Center for Education Statistics, in 2000, \n     reported that the Nation's elementary and secondary schools \n     required approximately $127,000,000,000 to repair or upgrade \n     facilities.\n       (4) A State-by-State analysis by the American Federation of \n     Teachers in 2008 concluded that the Nation's school \n     infrastructure needs an estimated $254,600,000,000.\n       (5) The Department of Education documented in 1998 that the \n     average age of a public elementary or secondary school \n     building was estimated at 42 years old, past the age when \n     schools tend to deteriorate rapidly.\n       (6) School districts spent more than $304,000,000,000 for \n     public school construction contracts from 1995 through 2004, \n     according to data collected by McGraw-Hill Construction.\n       (7) According to a 2006 report by the Building Educational \n     Success Together coalition, the per-student investment made \n     in the most affluent school districts to repair or construct \n     schools was nearly double the amount of the per-student \n     investment made in the most disadvantaged school districts.\n       (8) Since 1998, the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant \n     Program has provided $121,000,000 in Federal assistance to \n     over 300 school districts for school repair and construction. \n     That Federal investment in school repair and construction has \n     leveraged more than $600,000,000 of additional local funding \n     through a match required by the State government.\n       (9) Green schools use an average of 33 percent less energy \n     than conventionally built schools, and generate financial \n     savings of about $70 per square foot, according to the 2006 \n     report ``Greening America's Schools: Costs and Benefits''.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR SCHOOL REPAIR, RENOVATION, AND \n                   CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7241 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n                    ``Subpart 22--School Facilities\n\n     ``SEC. 5621.

A bill to improve jobs, opportunity, benefits, and services \nfor unemployed Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof a bill that, if enacted, would empower the States to more wisely \nspend the $31 billion in unemployment funds that have been allocated to \nthem for the remainder of this year. This bill will allow states to \navoid job-killing unemployment tax hikes while strengthening the safety \nnet program for unemployed workers. I am honored to introduce this \nlegislation simultaneously with a bill being introduced today in the \nHouse by The Honorable Dave Camp, Chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  The Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Services Act of 2011, or JOBS Act \nfor short, is just that. A pro jobs bill that goes to the heart of what \nunemployment benefits are meant to be: not a permanent welfare payment, \nbut a bridge to help unemployed workers until they can find a new job. \nA hand up, not a hand out. This bill is sorely needed. Since the \nrecession began, 33 States have borrowed $48 billion in Federal funds \nto pay for unemployment benefits. These loans, if gone unpaid, will \nresult in increased taxes on employers and job creators. Three States \nalready have been forced to do so, and experts predict that 21 \nadditional States will be required to raise taxes on jobs this year if \nnothing is done.\n  The JOBS Act allows states the flexibility to manage their \nunemployment funds to pay benefits, reduce their borrowings, or \nestablish programs to help unemployed workers get jobs. The States can \ndecide for themselves where their greatest needs lie. Under current \nlaw, States don't have the flexibility they need to adapt. The Federal \nGovernment pays for up to 73 weeks of unemployment, an all-time record. \nBut not every state needs to spend the money the way Washington \ndictates. For example, North Dakota has only a 3.6 percent rate of \nunemployment, but the unemployed can collect up to 34 weeks of \nunemployment paid for with Federal funds, in addition to the normal 26 \nweeks under pre-recession law. This bill would allow States to more \nwisely direct those Federal funds.\n  How does the bill work? The $31 billion in Federal funds already \nallocated to the States will be advanced to them and will remain \navailable for unemployment benefits or, if the State chooses, some or \nall can be used to repay their loans in order to avoid raising taxes, \nor enact programs that will lead to the rapid reemployment of \nunemployed workers. What this bill will not do is add any new Federal \nspending or reduce the amount of Federal funds a State is already \nscheduled to receive for unemployment insurance or mandate that States \nchange the way they use those funds. It is up to the States to decide \nwhat is best for them and their citizens based on local conditions. \nThis bill truly is a ``win, win'' for States, workers and the \nbusinesses struggling to expand and hire.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 907. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nrestore the 80 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses.\n  By way of background, business meals previously were fully \ndeductible. In 1986, the Congress reduced the allowable tax deduction \nfor business meals and entertainment from 100 percent to 80 percent. In \n1993, the deduction was further reduced to its current level of 50 \npercent. The business meal deduction should be reformed to better \nreflect the basic principle that business expenses should be fully \ndeductible. Increasing the limitation to 80 percent would better align \nthe provision with these objectives.\n  More importantly, at a time when the Nation is getting back on \nstronger economic footing, the legislation is particularly critical \nespecially for the small businesses and self-employed individuals that \ndepend so heavily on the business meal to conduct business. Small \ncompanies often use restaurants as ``conference space'' to conduct \nmeetings or close deals. Meals are their best, and sometimes only, \nmarketing tool. Certainly, an increase in the meal and entertainment \ndeduction would have a significant impact on a small business's bottom \nline.\n  In addition, the effects on the overall economy would be significant. \nResearch has shown that increasing the business meal deduction to 80 \npercent would increase business meal sales by over $7 billion and \nincrease the number of jobs by over 200,000. Moreover, restaurants \nservice more than 130 million guests every day. Every dollar spent \ndining out generates $2.05 in business to other industries, totaling \nmore than $1.7 trillion in overall economic impact.\n  The impact of the restaurant industry on the Nation's economy is \nconsiderable and felt in every State. Accompanying my statement is the \nNational Restaurant Association's, NRA's, State-by-State chart \nreflecting the estimated economic impact of increasing the business \nmeal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 percent.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na State-by-State chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF REDUCTION IN BUSINESS MEALS AND \n                   ENTERTAINMENT TAX DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274(n)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to only 50 percent of meal and \n     entertainment expenses allowed as deduction) is amended by \n     striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``80 percent''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 274(n) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking paragraph (3).\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The heading for section 274(n) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``Only 50 Percent'' and inserting ``Portion''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n

A bill to provide for the addition of certain real property \nto the reservation of the Siletz Tribe in the State of Oregon; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill that \nwill address the cumbersome and time consuming process under existing \nlaw within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This piece of legislation will \nstreamline the land acquisition process for the Confederated Tribe of \nSiletz Indians. The current process for taking land into trust is not \nworking, and I believe there are changes that need to be revived in the \nexisting process. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Merkley in this \neffort.\n  The original Siletz Coastal Treaty Reservation, established by the \nExecutive Order on November 9, 1955 was diminished and then eliminated \nby the Federal Government's allotment and termination policies. Tribal \nmembers and tribal government have worked to rebuild the Siletz \ncommunity since the Western Oregon Termination Act of August 1954 \nstripped the Siletz people of Federal tribal recognition, and since \nthen the tribe has been struggling to rebuild its land base. This \nlegislation would work to facilitate the tribe's land into trust \nprocess within the original Siletz coast reservation to overcome the \nchronic Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, delay in processing \napplications. Instead of having two processes to bring each piece of \nformer reservation land back into the reservation after purchase, one \nto bring the land into trust, and another, to make it reservation land, \nallows the tribe to combine the process.\n  In this case, because the original reservation was disassembled, the \ntribe terminated and provided a very small land base upon restoration, \nvirtually every tract of land the tribe seeks to place into trust today \nis considered by BIA pursuant to ``off reservation'' procedures. ``Off \nreservation'' requests would mean that the ``. . . secretary gives \ngreater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of anticipated benefits . \n. .''\n  By applying the on-reservation fee-to-trust criteria for lands within \nthe Siletz Tribe's original reservation, this legislation allows the \nTribe to take land into trust that will ultimately provide for vital \ntribal programs such as housing, government administration, and jobs--\nfor both tribal and county residents. In addition, the bill emphasizes \nthe importance and the intent of the Indian Reorganization Act of \n1934--which allows the Secretary of Interior, in his or her discretion, \nto take land into trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe or of \nindividual Indians. Essentially, reversing the loss of tribal lands and \nrestoring some of the Tribe's original land base by allowing the Tribe \nto take land into trust under the same provisions as other Indian \ntribes within their reservations.\n  This bill underscores the importance of economic stability and self-\ndetermination for the confederated tribe of Siletz Indians and its \nmembers. Oregon Tribal communities suffer some of the greatest hurdles, \nwhether it is health care, education, or crime on reservations, this \nbill would alleviate much of the cost and much needed resources \nassociated with the bureaucratic hoops the tribe has had to jump \nthrough for years--which mean a significant savings of time and \nresources.\n  As a result of the great working relationships, the Siletz Tribe has \napproached all six involved counties, and obtained their support. This \nlegislation establishes and confirms a positive and beneficial \npartnership between the Federal Government, Siletz Tribe and local \ncounties Lincoln, Lane, Tillamook, Yamhill, Benton, and Douglas.\n  That is why I am introducing--the process has not sped up and we \nrecognize the need for more action. It's always great to see Tribes and \nlocal counties work together to come up with proactive, inventive \nsolutions for their communities to tackle challenging economic \nconditions.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the citizens and community and \ntribal leaders who have worked to build their communities. They \nrepresent the pioneering spirit and vision that defines my state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2744-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 165--DESIGNATING JULY 23, 2011, AS ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                         THE AMERICAN COWBOY''\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, \nMs. Murkowski, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Roberts) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution today \nto honor the distinguished 39-year career of ADM Thad Allen, retired \nCommandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Our Nation's first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, \nobserved that ``a few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the \nentrance of our ports, might at a small expense be made useful \nsentinels of the laws.'' These words inspired the creation of the \nmodern day U.S. Coast Guard. More than 200 years later, the Coast Guard \nis today dutifully executing its diverse and challenging missions, \ndemonstrating their dual functionality as both a military service and a \nlaw enforcement authority.\n  Despite limited resources and a broadened scope of responsibility, \nthe Coast Guard has risen to the increased challenges it faces. Time \nand time again, the men and women of the Coast Guard prove the value of \ntheir presence and their important role in protecting the public, as \nwell as the environmental, economic, and security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  For almost four decades, Admiral Allen dedicated himself to these \nmissions and capped his career by providing meritorious leadership to \nour Nation's oldest continuous seagoing service.\n  Thad Allen was born and raised in Tucson, AZ. His parents were chief \ndamage controlman Clyde Allen and Wilma Allen. After graduating from \nthe U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1971, he served in a variety of \nassignments, eventually becoming Commandant. He often refers to himself \nas the ``unlikely admiral.''\n  It has been said before, and I think it is worth repeating: ``When \ntimes are at their worst, the Coast Guard is at its best.'' Admiral \nAllen deserves credit for providing the leadership skills that allowed \nthat statement to remain true during some of the most difficult times \nfor our Nation in recent years.\n  I came to know Thad Allen in a time of hardship. My home State of \nMississippi and other Gulf Coast States had just experienced two of the \ndeadliest hurricanes in our Nation's history in Katrina and Rita. He \nwas the principal Federal official for response and recovery from those \nnatural disasters. I will never forget the destruction we witnessed--\nhomes, schools, and big oak trees that had stood for decades were \ncompletely leveled. But through his efforts and those of the brave men \nand women throughout the Coast Guard, over 33,500 gulf coast residents \nwere rescued from rooftops and flooded homes.\n  Admiral Allen proved himself to be a man of not just sterling \ncourage, with compassion to match, but also a man of great integrity \nand an enormous capacity for hard work. He is a direct reflection of \nthe guardian ethos and an inspiration of those who have had the good \nfortune to work with him.\n  Admiral Allen will, of course, be the first to say that the brave men \nand women throughout the ranks of the Coast Guard are the ones who \ndeserve the credit for success. He has made a habit of openly praising \ntheir sacrifice and often thankless service.\n  Today, I am proud to say that my State, due in part to his leadership \nand those Coast Guard men and women who have served under him, has made \na great deal of progress in recovering from the most severe natural \ndisasters in our Nation's history.\n  As the Coast Guard's motto is ``Semper Paratus''--always ready--\nAdmiral Allen is an embodiment of that motto. We do not need to look \nback too far to find an example, most recently, when the President \nselected him to serve as national incident commander in the wake of the \nDeepwater Horizon oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico. Admiral Allen stood \nready and provided resolute leadership, overseeing the Federal \nGovernment's response efforts and remaining on Active Duty for an \nadditional 3 months past his slated retirement.\n  In Mississippi, we are grateful for the service and leadership of ADM \nThad Allen, which will be long remembered and appreciated. I know the \nadmiral and his family will enjoy the new opportunities that come with \nretirement, in addition to a well-earned respite from the demands and \nchallenges of his exemplary career in the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2746-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2746-S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 171--RECOGNIZING AND SUPPORTING NATIONAL TRAIN DAY ON \n                              MAY 7, 2011\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nSanders, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Merkley) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Res. 172\n\n       Whereas in 2011, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States, with 1,500,000 \n     Americans expected to be diagnosed with cancer and more than \n     500,000 expected to die from the disease;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent the leading cause of \n     death for Americans under age 85, and the second leading \n     cause of death for Americans overall;\n       Whereas the national investment in cancer research has \n     yielded substantial returns in research advances and lives \n     saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1 percent decline \n     in cancer mortality saves the United States economy \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas advancements in the understanding of the causes, \n     mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer \n     have led to cures for many types of cancers and have \n     converted other types of cancers into manageable chronic \n     conditions;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for all cancers has \n     improved during the 30 years prior to the date of approval of \n     this resolution to more than 65 percent, and as of 2011, \n     there are more than 12,000,000 cancer survivors living in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the \n     general public, survivors and patient advocates, \n     philanthropic organizations, industry, and Federal, State, \n     and local governments have led to advanced breakthroughs, \n     early detection tools that have increased survival rates, and \n     a better quality of life for cancer survivors; and\n       Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant \n     implications for the treatment of other costly diseases such \n     as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, \n     and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the \n     invaluable contributions of the researchers in the United \n     States and worldwide and who are dedicated to reversing the \n     cancer epidemic;\n       (2) designates May 2011, as ``National Cancer Research \n     Month''; and\n       (3) supports efforts to make cancer research a national and \n     international priority so that one day the more than 200 \n     diseases known as cancer are eliminated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2747-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \nWORLD MALARIA DAY, AND REAFFIRMING UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT \n     FOR EFFORTS TO COMBAT MALARIA AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE \n                  PRESIDENT'S GLOBAL HEALTH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Boozman, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \nMerkley) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being completely \n     preventable and treatable;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 35 countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, account for 98 percent of global malaria deaths;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, with \n     estimates that children under the age of 5 account for 85 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates that malaria infection causes 400,000 \n     cases of severe maternal anemia and from 75,000 to 200,000 \n     infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria over recent years have \n     made measurable progress and have helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2010 reports that in 2010, more African households (42 \n     percent) owned at least one insecticide-treated mosquito net \n     (ITN), more children under 5 years of age (35 percent) were \n     using an ITN compared to previous years, and household ITN \n     ownership reached more than 50 percent in 19 African \n     countries;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2010 further states that a total of 11 countries and \n     one area in the African Region showed a reduction of more \n     than 50 percent in either confirmed malaria cases or malaria \n     admissions and deaths in recent years (Algeria, Botswana, \n     Cape Verde, Eritrea, Madagascar, Namibia, Rwanda, Sao Tome \n     and Principe, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zanzibar, \n     United Republic of Tanzania), and that in all countries, the \n     decreases are associated with intense malaria control \n     interventions;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment is critical to continue to reduce malaria deaths \n     and to prevent backsliding in those areas where progress has \n     been made;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a major \n     leadership role in the recent progress made toward reducing \n     the global burden of malaria, particularly through the \n     President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the United States \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       Whereas, on World Malaria Day in 2009, President Barack \n     Obama stated, ``The U.S. stands with our global partners and \n     people around the world to reaffirm our commitment to make \n     the U.S. a leader in ending deaths from malaria by 2015. . . \n     It is time to redouble our efforts to rid the world of a \n     disease that does not have to take lives.'';\n       Whereas, under the Global Health Initiative (GHI), the \n     United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive, whole-\n     of-government approach to global health, focused on helping \n     partner countries to achieve major improvements in overall \n     health outcomes through transformational advances in access \n     to, and the quality of, healthcare services in resource-poor \n     settings; and\n       Whereas recognizing the burden of malaria on many partner \n     countries, PMI has set the target for 2015 of reducing the \n     burden of malaria by 50 percent for 450,000,000 people, \n     representing 70 percent of the at-risk population in Africa: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the achievable target of ending malaria deaths by \n     2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria deaths and prevalence, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) reaffirms the goals and commitments to combat malaria \n     in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few brief remarks about \nthe fact that this week we are celebrating National Charter Schools \nWeek in America and in the Senate. I am pleased to join my colleague, \nLamar Alexander, in cosponsoring this resolution, which I hope will be \nhotlined tonight, and that means passed unanimously without the need to \nbring it to the floor for debate because there are so many Members of \nthe Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, who recognize the value of \nhigh-quality charter schools and the difference they are making in the \nadvancement of education reform and the extraordinary achievements \nbeing reached by students and teachers in communities because of them.\n  I wish to make a brief statement on the Senate floor and then share \nsome interesting and exciting statistics from my own experience in the \ncity of New Orleans, which is the city that has the highest percentage \nof children in charter schools in America today.\n  As a parent of two precious and delightful children, I know firsthand \nthe value of a quality education to secure their futures. Many American \nfamilies are fortunate to live in places where public schools provide \nengaging and effective instruction and a culture of achievement that \ninspires students to aim high and thrive. Other families have the \nfinancial means to provide their children with a top-notch private \nschool education. The Presiding Officer knows, whether it is in \nMissouri or Louisiana or Texas or right here in DC, that education can \nbe quite expensive in our top private elementary and secondary schools \nin our country. Sometimes tuition can reach up to $25,000 a year and \nbeyond. As hard as that might be for some to believe, that is true. \nUnfortunately, too many Americans are left without either option for \ntheir children, and their children are falling through the cracks. This \ncannot continue if America is going to maintain a leadership role and \nproduce young adults who have the knowledge and skills to compete and \nwin in this new worldwide marketplace.\n  Fortunately, in a growing number of communities, including several in \nLouisiana and particularly in New Orleans, there is another exciting \noption for parents and students: high quality public charter schools.\n  This week, as I said, we celebrate the 12th annual National Charter \nSchool Week. It is a good time to take stock of how successful many \ncharter schools have been and what we can do to replicate them across \nthe country and, more importantly, what we can do to improve them; what \nwe can do to eliminate poor charter schools and strengthen the great \nones and make the good ones even better. Charter schools are public \nschools that receive public funding and serve the same neighborhood \nstudents as traditional public schools.\n  Currently, it may surprise people to know there are over 5,000 \ncharter schools in our country serving more than 1.6 million children. \nThese schools are required to meet the academic student achievement \naccountability requirements under all of our laws and in the same \nmanner as traditional public schools. However, they differ from \ntraditional public schools in several important ways. Charter schools \noperate free from many of the district rules and regulations so they \nhave more freedom to innovate, to experiment, to explore, to think \noutside of the box, to try new approaches. Charter schools have \nautonomy in areas such as the length of the school day and year, as \nwell as principal and teacher recruitment, selection, and development. \nWith this freedom, however, comes greater accountability for improved \nstudent achievement. Unlike public schools in many places, charter \nschools that aren't successful can actually lose their charter, be \nforced to close, or be forced to transition to a new model. There are \ncountless examples of high-performing charter schools that are \nproducing impressive results, and they continue to show that our \nstudents, including--and most importantly--our low-income and minority \nstudents and disadvantaged students can and are rising to great \nacademic heights.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, there are 90 public charter schools, \nincluding 61 in the city of New Orleans, representing almost 72 percent \nof our city's student population--a higher proportion than any other \nschool system in the United States. The city's Sci Academy is one \nremarkable example of a successful charter school, and I had the great \npleasure to skype with some of their students earlier this morning.\n  Sci Academy opened in 2008 with 90 ninth graders entering a rigorous \nand inspiring environment. More than half of the ninth graders who \nentered Sci Academy's inaugural class had failed State promotional \nperformance tests, and more than 70 percent read well below the ninth \ngrade level. Many of these students had missed a full year of school \nbecause of Hurricane Katrina and were significantly behind other \nstudents of their age.\n  Incredibly, that same freshman class later scored 76 percent on our \nState's test, making it the third most successful high school in New \nOrleans. The other high schools that beat it out actually had selective \nenrollment. What is extraordinary about Sci Academy is that it is open \nenrollment, focusing on the quality of teachers and the quality of \nteaching. It is remarkable.\n  Right here in the District of Columbia--and I am proud to have had a \nhand in the development of this in the District of Columbia as a former \nchair of a subcommittee and a partner with Eleanor Holmes Norton and \nothers who have worked so hard with the District on its reform \nefforts--charter schools are an integral part of improving educational \noutcomes in this city, our Nation's Capital.\n  Starting with two small campuses in 1996, DC public charter schools \nnow educate almost 40 percent of the school-aged children in the \nDistrict, and they are serving the highest percentage of low-income and \nminority students in the city's most economically disadvantaged \nneighborhoods. DC's public charter schools outperform the city's \ntraditional public schools from the fifth grade up, and they graduate \n84 percent of their students--higher than both the city and the \nnational average.\n  Where quality charter schools exist, parents have real choices, \nexciting choices, and they are overwhelmingly choosing public charter \nschools. Many of these schools have long waiting lists. In fact, more \nthan 50 percent of charter schools report having waiting lists, and the \ntotal number of students on these waiting lists is enough to fill more \nthan 1,100 average-sized charter schools--quite a number on these \nwaiting lists.\n  Over the past 17 years, Congress has provided $1.6 billion in funding \nto the promising charter school movement throughout the country through \ngrants for planning, program design, initial implementation, \nreplication, expansion, dissemination, evaluation, and for improving \nfacilities. Our efforts at the national level are beginning to show \nreal results. Maintaining and increasing where possible funding for \ncharter schools is a winning proposition for parents, for students, for \ntheir teachers, for our community, and, may I say, for our Nation, for \nour workforce of the future, and for our economic security.\n  Make no mistake. America will only go as far as our collective talent \nand ability will take her. Our future will continue to be shaped by how \nwell we prepare today's students for tomorrow's challenges. Parents who \nare doing everything they can to give their children an opportunity for \nsuccess deserve not only a quality choice but a solution to the \nchallenges of our educational system. Successful charter schools \nprovide that choice, and in many areas they provide the solution. Now \nit is time to make them a central component of our educational strategy \nall over the country.\n  Senator Lamar Alexander and I are pleased to chair the charter caucus \nin the Senate, to join with President Obama and Secretary Arne Duncan \nin a focus on quality education for all children in America. President \nObama and Secretary Duncan often say charter schools are one tool, not \nthe only tool, to get us from failing and mediocre public schools to \ngreat and exciting public schools in our country that are making a real \ndifference.\n  I wish to share some extraordinary results that were given to me just \nthis week as I hosted a roundtable with staffers and Senators about the \naccomplishments of charter schools. This comes from a wonderful group \nin New Orleans, New Schools for New Orleans,\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nthat is one of the leaders in the charter school movement nationally. \nThey are helping the city of New Orleans and many of our organizations, \nin partnership with all sorts of funders and philanthropies, and the \ncity of New Orleans, the mayor, and the city council, and others who \nare so supportive of what is going on. Our universities, I might say, \nincluding the University of New Orleans, Tulane University, Dillard, \nand Xavier have also been on the forefront of this movement as well.\n  Let me share these results because they are quite extraordinary. This \nchart shows that in 2005, 62 percent of students in the city of New \nOrleans--not 15 percent, not 20 percent, but 62 percent--were \nacademically unacceptable. Based on standards set by our State and by \nthe Federal Government, in 2005 basically 62 percent of all the \nstudents in New Orleans were failing. They were not up to just basic \neducational levels in reading and math.\n  We had a terrible event happen, as many people will remember. In 2005 \nwe had Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the crashing of our levee \nsystem, the failing of our levee system, and 100 of our 146 public \nschools were virtually destroyed and remain unusable. Through the great \nefforts of local leaders, State leaders, and Federal leaders, and with \nFEMA's help and some new, out-of-the-box thinking, we were able to pool \nthe money the Federal Government was going to reimburse each individual \nschool and present one check to the city of New Orleans and the school \nboard and the recovery district, and we have been building a new school \nsystem ever since. Charter schools are the foundation of that \nrebuilding.\n\n  It is quite extraordinary that in only 5 years, when you look at the \nsame population, virtually--there have been some families who have not \nyet come back, but they are on their way; there have been some families \nwho left and are not coming back--it is a population still of a great \nnumber of minority students and disadvantaged and lower middle-class \nstudents, as well as middle-class and some wealthy students in our \npublic school system, and we have moved from 62 percent unacceptable to \nonly 17 percent unacceptable in 5 years. I do not know of any other \ngroup of schools anywhere in the country that has made such remarkable \ngains. So when people question, do charter schools work, let me say \nthat the evidence is in. Quality charter schools work. In every place \nthey exist, they outperform even their suburban counterparts and in \nlarge measure suburban counterpart public schools that are among some \nof the best.\n  Many of these charter schools are in rural areas where there is not a \nlot of opportunity for White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian kids. Some of \nthem are in intercities that do not have the same opportunities.\n  We, again, have taken 62 percent of our population who were \nunderperforming and now it is only 17 percent.\n  As it says on this chart, I have in the Chamber, the New Orleans \nstudents' test scores demonstrate the first significant improvement in \nthe city's history--a 30-percent increase--and, finally, closing the \nachievement gap between New Orleans' schools and State schools by more \nthan 50 percent.\n  A Thomas B. Fordham Institute study ranked 30 major cities on six \ncritical reform categories. New Orleans, I am proud to say, was ranked \nthe No. 1 reform-friendly city in the country, followed by Washington, \nDC, New York, Denver, and Jacksonville.\n  But the great news is that there are cities and counties and States \nwaking up to the exciting opportunities of education reform. We know \nthat in America today, it should be unacceptable in some of our \ncommunities where 50, 60, 70 percent of our children are failing to get \nout of high school. We should be ashamed that even when some of our \nchildren walk across that stage and get that diploma that signifies \nthey have graduated, they are leaving truly, in many places, without \nthe skills to get the job that will give them a living or saving wage \nbecause our schools have been handing out diplomas that are not worth \nthe paper on which they are written. That has to come to an end. That \nis what we are fighting for. That is what charter schools help us to \ndo.\n  Now, is it possible for public schools that are not charters to \nachieve this success? Yes. And that is also happening. But I found in \nmy own experience, trying to work with a system that was unwilling to \nmake too much change, that charter schools provide the kind of \ncompetition and spark and challenge to an otherwise system that is run \nby a monopoly. This provides a diverse set of providers to education. \nIt encourages new kinds of educators to come in as teachers. It gives \nthe schools the freedom they need to make it work for the students who \nwalk through that front door and want so desperately to walk across \nthat stage with a diploma that means something and a future ahead of \nthem.\n  I am proud to help lead this effort here in the Senate. I thank my \ncolleagues for supporting this effort for the 12th year--a resolution \ncommending high-quality charter schools in America.\n  Let me say in conclusion that we are not resting on our laurels. I \nhave introduced a bill, along with others. Senator Durbin and Senator \nKirk have introduced a companion bill, if you will. Both bills are in \nan effort to take the bar even higher, to say to the country: Let's get \nrid of our low-performing charter schools. Let's focus on strengthening \nthe authorizers of these charter schools. We do not want authorizers \nout there who are giving out charters to run schools to people who have \nno idea what they are doing.\n  We do not want this movement to fail. We want this movement--we know \nit can be successful. We know it can be a real choice for parents. \nThink about it. Think about the value of a quality education. If you \nhave to pay for it in the private sector, you are paying $25,000 to \n$30,000 a year in some of our communities. Maybe you are lucky enough \nto be in a Catholic school, an Episcopal school, where the tuition is \nsubsidized and you can get the student in and out for $6,000 to $10,000 \na year, but for many families with four children or five children, that \nis out of reach. They cannot possibly afford that. So having quality \npublic schools is essential in every community in our country.\n  I believe that if we can do this in New Orleans, which is one of the \npoorest cities--not the poorest, but we struggle, as you know, in the \ncity of New Orleans; we have a very broad demographic population--if we \ncan do it here, trust me, it can be done anywhere with political will \nand with the support of your State and local governments, and, of \ncourse, the Federal Government.\n  So I am pleased to cosponsor the ALL-STAR bill, which is a grant \nprogram for growth and replication of high-quality charter schools, and \nto have introduced my own bill, the Charter School Quality Act. I am \ngoing to be working very closely with Senator Harkin, who has been open \nin many ways to these new ideas, and working with him as we authorize \nthe Elementary and Secondary Act, and be reminded of the great success \ncharter schools are having.\n  Ultimately, we would like to have 100 percent of the public schools \nin the city of New Orleans be charters, with some of the most exciting \ncharter providers, some of the best in the world operating our schools, \nchallenging our kids, giving parents real choices where they want to \nsend their kids based on the personalities of the children and the \ndesires and dreams of that family. That is really what America is all \nabout--competition, choice, and opportunity. We just are not quite \ndoing enough in this regard in our country today. But perhaps the \nsuccess of this movement can show us a way forward.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I hope we can get that resolution \nadopted without further delay tonight. Again, I wish to congratulate \neveryone who has worked so hard on making this National Charter School \nWeek a success here in DC, in our Nation's Capital, and around our \ncountry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the amendment to the preamble which is at the desk be \nagreed to, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 158\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality public \n     education and challenge all students to reach their \n     potential;\n       Whereas charter schools promote innovation and excellence \n     in public education;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that--\n       (1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and \n     students in the United States; and\n       (2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, \n     choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, charter \n     schools are held accountable by their sponsors for improving \n     student achievement and for the financial and other \n     operations of the charter schools;\n       Whereas 40 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam have \n     passed laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas in 2011, close to 5,000 charter schools are serving \n     more than 1,600,000 children;\n       Whereas in the past 17 fiscal years, Congress has provided \n     a total of more than $2,600,000,000 in financial assistance \n     to the charter school movement through grants for planning, \n     program design, initial implementation, replication, \n     expansion, dissemination, evaluation, and facilities;\n       Whereas numerous charter schools improve the achievements \n     of students and stimulate improvement in traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools are required to meet the student \n     achievement accountability requirements under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) \n     in the same manner as traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools often set higher and additional \n     individual goals than the requirements of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) to \n     ensure that charter schools are of high quality and truly \n     accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools--\n       (1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools;\n       (2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and\n       (3) must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and the communities served by the charter \n     schools;\n       Whereas more than 50 percent of charter schools report \n     having a waiting list, and the total number of students on \n     all such waiting lists is enough to fill more than 1,100 \n     average-sized charter schools;\n       Whereas the 12th annual National Charter Schools Week is \n     scheduled to be held May 1, through May 7, 2011: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the students, parents, teachers, and \n     administrators of charter schools across the United States \n     for--\n       (A) ongoing contributions to education;\n       (B) the impressive strides made in closing the persistent \n     academic achievement gap in the United States; and\n       (C) improving and strengthening the public school system in \n     the United States;\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of the 12th annual \n     National Charter Schools Week, a week-long celebration to be \n     held May 1 through May 7, 2011, in communities throughout the \n     United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to hold \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during \n     National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for \n     charter schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/05/senate-section/article/S2752-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2752-S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed en bloc to the following resolutions which were submitted \nearlier today: S. Res. 166, 167, 168, and 169.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions en bloc.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has once again \npassed a resolution commemorating our Nation's law enforcement officers \nand National Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Senate's official \nrecognition of National Peace Officers Memorial Day is a tradition I am \nproud to support each year.\n  In 2010, 158 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty. We honor their memory. Each year, we commemorate the bravery \nof the many law enforcement officers and peace officers who deserve our \nthanks and support. National Peace Officers Memorial Day is an \nopportunity to recommit ourselves to provide them with the tools they \nneed to stay safe and to do their jobs as effectively as they can.\n  There are more than 900,000 men and women at work protecting our \ncommunities, our schools, and our children. They investigate and \napprehend the most violent criminals and strive to keep our communities \nsafe and secure. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, the \nnames of 18,983 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice have been added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides the people of the \nUnited States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in \nthe Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice year after year by those members of \nour police forces. More than 20,000 peace officers are expected to \ngather in Washington in the days leading up to May 15 to join with the \nfamilies of their fallen comrades. It is right that the Senate show its \nrespect on this occasion, and I am proud to honor their service and \ntheir memory.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 169\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony and documents in an action before the Merit Systems \nProtection Board brought by the Social Security Administration against \nan administrative law judge in SSA. Among the matters for which SSA has \nbrought this action against the administrative law judge is conduct by \nthat administrative judge during a visit with staff in the office of \nSenator Landrieu in April 2009.\n  Counsel for the administrative law judge against whom the action is \nbrought has subpoenaed for deposition two employees of Senator \nLandrieu's office and also sought by subpoena the production of \ndocuments from Senator Landrieu's office.\n  Senator Landrieu would like to cooperate and make the employees \navailable for depositions. Accordingly, this resolution would authorize \nSherae Hunter and Wes Kungel, the subpoenaed employees in Senator \nLandrieu's office, to testify at depositions in this matter. The \nresolution would also authorize production of relevant documents sought \nby subpoena, except where a privilege should be asserted, and would \nauthorize representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of the two \nsubpoenaed employees.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed to, \nthe preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc, that there be no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to these matters be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 166\n\n(Commemorating May 8, 2011, as the 66th anniversary of V-E Day, the end \n                       of World War II in Europe)\n\n       Whereas on December 11, 1941, 4 days after the Japanese \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, Germany and Italy declared war on the \n     United States;\n       Whereas on November 8, 1942, United States and Allied \n     forces began Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa;\n       Whereas German and other Axis forces in North Africa \n     surrendered on May 13, 1943;\n       Whereas in July of 1943, United States and Allied forces \n     landed in Sicily;\n       Whereas on September 8, 1943, Italy surrendered to United \n     States and Allied forces, although German troops in Italy \n     continued to fight until May of 1945;\n       Whereas more than 150,000 Allied soldiers landed in France \n     on June 6, 1944, known thereafter as ``D-Day'';\n       Whereas on August 25, 1944, United States and Allied forces \n     liberated Paris;\n       Whereas from mid- to late- December, during the Battle of \n     the Bulge, United States troops heroically resisted a major \n     German offensive in Belgium and France;\n       Whereas United States troops crossed the Rhine River at \n     Remagen on March 7, 1945;\n       Whereas Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Western \n     Allies at Reims on May 7, 1945, and to the Soviet Union on \n     May 9, 1945, in Berlin;\n       Whereas during World War II, an estimated 292,000 members \n     of the United States Armed Forces were killed in action and \n     more than 400,000 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     died; and\n       Whereas United States President Harry S. Truman declared \n     May 8, 1945, ``V-E day'', the end of World War II in Europe, \n     although war with Japan continued until August 14, 1945: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic contribution made by United \n     States veterans of World War II to human liberty and the \n     safety of the United States and its allies;\n       (2) honors veterans who served in the European Theatre of \n     Operations and elsewhere during World War II;\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\n       (3) remembers with gratitude the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces who made the ultimate sacrifice during \n     World War II; and\n       (4) commemorates May 8, 2011, as the 66th anniversary of V-\n     E Day, the end of World War II in Europe.\n\n                              S. Res. 167\n\n  (Recognizing the historical significance of the Mexican holiday of \n                             Cinco de Mayo)\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of great importance by the \n     Mexican and Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which the Battle of Puebla was fought by Mexicans \n     who were struggling for their independence and freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become one of the most famous \n     Mexican national holidays and is celebrated annually by \n     nearly all Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, north and south of \n     the United States-Mexico border;\n       Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many \n     battles that the courageous Mexican people won in their long \n     and brave struggle for independence and freedom;\n       Whereas the French, confident that their battle-seasoned \n     troops were far superior to the almost amateurish Mexican \n     forces, expected little or no opposition from the Mexican \n     army;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half \n     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an \n     outnumbered, ill-equipped, and ragged, but highly spirited \n     and courageous, Mexican force;\n       Whereas after three bloody assaults on Puebla in which more \n     than a thousand gallant Frenchmen lost their lives, the \n     French troops were finally defeated and driven back by the \n     outnumbered Mexican troops;\n       Whereas the courageous and heroic spirit that Mexican \n     General Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic \n     battle can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for \n     the causes of justice and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on \n     Cinco de Mayo;\n       Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was \n     instrumental in keeping Mexico from falling under European \n     domination;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the \n     foundation of the United States is built by people from many \n     nations and diverse cultures who are willing to fight and die \n     for freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the \n     close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'' \n     (``The respect of other people's rights is peace''); and\n       Whereas many people celebrate during the entire week in \n     which Cinco de Mayo falls: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historical struggle for independence and \n     freedom of the people of Mexico; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n (Commemorating and acknowledging the dedication and sacrifice made by \n the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have been \n                 killed or injured in the line of duty)\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of the peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting \n     the schools and schoolchildren of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2010, 158 peace officers across the United \n     States were killed in the line of duty;\n       Whereas Congress should strongly support initiatives to \n     reduce violent crime and to increase the factors that \n     contribute to the safety of law enforcement officers;\n       Whereas there are recorded 18,983 Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of \n     duty while protecting their fellow citizens, and whose names \n     are engraved upon the National Law Enforcement Officers \n     Memorial in Washington, District of Columbia;\n       Whereas in 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May \n     15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2011, more than 20,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, District of Columbia, \n     to join with the families of their recently fallen comrades \n     to honor those comrades and all others who went before them: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates and acknowledges the dedication and \n     sacrifices made by the Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement officers who have been killed or injured in the \n     line of duty;\n       (2) recognizes May 15, 2011, as ``National Peace Officers \n     Memorial Day''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     that day with appropriate ceremony, solemnity, appreciation, \n     and respect.\n\n                              S. Res. 169\n\n      (To authorize testimony, documents and legal representation)\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Social Security Administration v. \n     Charlotte N.
