L. PILLARD TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the \nfollowing nomination which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Cornelia T. L. Pillard, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Senate Rules and Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just listened to the majority leader \ncomplaining about what we are doing this week. He is the one in charge \nof the schedule. He has spent a week here on nonessential nominations, \nnone of which are emergencies, all of which could be handled later. It \nwas his choice to spend the week on nominations that are not \nemergencies as opposed to doing things like passing a DOD authorization \nbill or things like taking up a budget resolution or things like doing \na farm bill. So the majority leader has a choice as to what we are \ngoing to spend time on. He has chosen to spend this week on 10 \nnominations.\n  Yesterday I talked about the left's ``ends justify the means'' quest \nfor power and the lengths to which they are willing to go to satisfy \nit. The Obama administration and its allies have done just about \neverything to get what they want one way or the other, even \nfundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they could \nnot get their way by playing by the rules.\n  We saw the culmination of that with the majority leader's power grab \nin the Senate last month. The real world consequences of that power \ngrab are most sharply illustrated by the very nominee before us, which \nI believe I heard the majority leader commenting on what a stellar \nnominee this person is.\n  Professor Pillard may be a fine person, but she is not someone who \nshould receive a lifetime position on the second highest court in the \nland. She will be confirmed, however, because of the Democratic \nmajority's power grab a couple of weeks ago. So let's take a look at \nher legal views. They certainly make one thing clear: The nominee \nbefore us is a liberal ideologue; in other words, just the kind of \nperson this administration is looking for to rubberstamp its most \nradical regulatory proposals on the DC Circuit.\n  Let's take the so-called Hosanna-Tabor case. Last year the Supreme \nCourt reinforced a core First Amendment principle when it ruled \nunanimously that churches, rather than the government, could select \ntheir own leaders.\n  Every single justice sided with the church's argument in that case. \nEvery single one. It makes sense. Freedom of religion is a bedrock \nfoundation of our democracy. I think every member of this body would \nsurely agree that the government does not have any business picking a \ngroup's religious leaders for them. But Professor Pillard seemed to \nhave a very different view. Prior to the Court's unanimous decision, \nshe said the notion that ``the Constitution requires deference to \nchurch decisions about who qualifies as a minister'' in the case before \nthe Court seemed ``like a real stretch.''\n  This is the nominee, after the power grab, the Senate is about to \nconfirm, who said that, ``It is a real stretch that a church would be \nable to pick its own leaders.'' This is an astonishing judgment from \nsomebody who is about to end up on what we believe is the second most \nimportant court in the land.\n  But she went on from that. The position of the church in the Hosanna-\nTabor case represented a ``substantial threat to the American rule of \nlaw.'' How do you like that, Mr. President? It is a substantial threat \nto the American rule of law that a church should be able to pick its \nown leaders. A substantial threat to the American rule of law.\n  This was a case decided the other way from Professor Pillard's \nposition, 9 to 0. Talk about radical. Talk about extreme. No wonder \nthey wanted a simple majority to be available to confirm a nominee like \nthis. I mean, even the Court's most liberal justices, as I mentioned, \ndisagreed with Professor Pillard on this one.\n  One of them characterized that kind of position as ``amazing.'' This \nis a member of the Supreme Court in the 9-to-0 decision, characterizing \nProfessor Pillard's view as ``amazing.'' In other words, Professor \nPillard must think that even the furthest left Supreme Court Justice is \nnot far enough left for her. So you get the drift of where she is.\n  We rightly expect justices on our nation's highest courts to evaluate \ncases\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nbefore them with a judge's even-handed mindset, not the absolutism of \nan ideologue. But just listen. Listen to the kinds of things Professor \nPillard has said.\n  She has expressed sympathy with the idea that the rights of our \nConstitution--the same Constitution she would be charged with \nupholding--have ``just about run out,'' and that this necessitates a \nshift toward international law--a shift toward international law. \nApparently, she feels the U.S. Constitution is no longer adequate, and \nwe need to rely on foreign law to determine what we do here in this \ncountry.\n  She has said that abortion, essentially without limits, is necessary \nto avoid ``conscription into maternity;'' That even commonsense laws \nmany American men and women support serve to ``enforce incubation.''\n  She has referred to the types of ultrasound images that are now \navailable to so many proud moms and dads to be as ``deceptive images.''\n  Ultrasound is a ``deceptive image,'' according to Professor Pillard, \nperpetrated by the ``anti-choice movement.'' In other words, she \nappears to think that proud moms and dads should not believe their own \neyes when they look at the images science has made increasingly \navailable to us over the past few years.\n\n  It is an understatement to say that these sorts of views are worrying \nfor someone the President wants on one of our Nation's top courts. In \nshort, Professor Pillard does not seem like a person with the mindset \nor the temperament of a judge. She seems like a person with the \nattitude and disposition of a leftwing academic, someone who seems to \ncome to conclusions based on how well they support her own theories.\n  Judges are charged with fairly evaluating the law that is actually \nbefore them, not the law as they wish it to be. So I will be voting \nagainst the Pillard nomination. It is important to keep this in mind as \nwell. Nearly every single Democratic Senator voted to enable the \nmajority leader's power grab last month. Those Senators are responsible \nfor its consequences. That includes the confirmation of Ms. Pillard, \nregardless of how they vote on her nomination.\n  So I would urge Democrats to rethink the kind of nominees brought to \nthe floor moving forward because now they are all yours. You are going \nto own every one of them. A simple majority. You own them. Extremist \nnominees like Professor Pillard are the reason the President and Senate \nDemocrats took the unprecedented step of going nuclear 2 weeks ago. \nThey unilaterally changed more than two centuries of history and \ntradition and violated their own prior statements and commitments so \nnominees like this could rubberstamp the President's most leftwing \nagenda items.\n  This is the playbook. Forget the rules. Forget checks and balances. \nCertainly forget the will of the American people. Do whatever it \ntakes--whatever it takes--to get the President's agenda through. The \nother side of this, of course, is that Democrats are determined to \nchange the subject from ObamaCare--anything to change the subject.\n  We now know that this President engaged in a serial deception in \norder to get his signature health care bill enacted into law. The White \nHouse debated whether to tell the truth or not on whether folks would \nbe able to keep the plans they have. They decided not to tell the \ntruth, a conscious decision to mislead the American people going back \nto 2009.\n  Their view was that the talking point was just too useful. They \nneeded it in order to get what they wanted. So I would probably be \nlooking to change the topic too if I were our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. Change the subject to Senate rules or nominees or \nanything else for that matter.\n  The last thing the majority wants to talk about is ObamaCare, because \nthey own it 100 percent. Not a single Republican in the House or Senate \nvoted for it. Every single Senate Democrat did. The problem is what \nSenate Democrats have done by going nuclear here in the Senate is \nreally no different from what they did on ObamaCare. Once again they \nsaid one thing and did another.\n  The majority leader said publicly and repeatedly he would not break \nthe rules, and then he did. He said he would not break the rules, and \nthen he did. As I said a couple of weeks back, he might as well have \nsaid: If you like your Senate rules, you can keep them.\n  Here we are today. Here we are today ready to watch Senate Democrats \nrubberstamp an extremely liberal nominee to a lifetime position on a \nvote threshold the majority leader, back when he was in the minority \nand supported minority rights in the Senate, said would be disastrous \nfor our democracy.\n  Anything it takes. Anything it takes to get this President's agenda \naround the checks that have been established to restrain power. \nAnything it takes to get around anybody who disagrees with them, \nwhether it is ObamaCare or the judges they expect to defend it. \nAnything it takes, they are willing to do.\n  Let me say again that nobody who supported this rules change can walk \naway from nominees like Professor Pillard or their rulings. They own \nthem.\n  Let's get back to ObamaCare for a few minutes because that is the \nissue the American people are most concerned about now. That is the \nissue the Democrats want to distract us from.\n  The American people should know what the liberal playbook is. The \nleft believes the President's agenda runs straight through the DC \nCircuit Court. That is why they pressured Democrats to change the rules \nof the Senate to pack this court with folks like Professor Pillard.\n  The goal here is actually twofold: First, grease the skids for an \nagenda that can't get through the Congress. Then build a firewall \naround it by packing this court with your ideological allies. That way \nDemocrats can keep telling folks what they think they want to hear \nabout ObamaCare and anything else, but they can also rest assured that \nnobody is going to tamper with it.\n  All of this is in the context in which the national debate over \nObamaCare and its failures should be viewed. None of it should distract \nus from what ObamaCare is doing to our health care system or to the \nmillions of ordinary Americans who have been suffering under its \neffects.\n  Over the past couple of months the American people have been witness \nto one of the most breathtaking indictments of big-government \nliberalism in memory. I am not only talking about the Web site--the \nsubject of late-night comedy--I am talking about the way in which \nObamaCare was forced on the public by an administration and a Democrat-\nled Congress that we now know is willing to do and say anything to pass \nthe law. They are willing to do or say anything.\n  In the Senate we had the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' we had the ``Gator \naid,'' we had the ``Louisiana Purchase,'' and they finally got up to \nthe 60 votes they needed. They had to get every single Democrat, and \nthey got them any way it took. This is coupled with the grossly \nmisleading statement: If you have your policy and you like it, you can \nkeep it. If you have your doctor and you like him or her, you can keep \nthem. The President and his Democratic allies were so determined to \nforce their vision of health care on the public that they assured them \nthey wouldn't lose the plans they had, that they would save money \ninstead of losing it, and that they would be able to keep using the \ndoctors and hospitals they were already using. The stories we are \nhearing now on a near-daily basis range from heartbreaking to comic.\n  Americans are very upset. Finally, the big-government crowd messed \nwith an issue that affects every single American. In my State they have \nshut down the coal industry. That has had a big impact by creating a \ndepression in Central Appalachia. One could argue they can go after the \ncoal industry because it is confined to certain areas of the country. \nBut on health care they are messing with everybody. The one issue every \nsingle American is affected by and cares about is their own health \ncare.\n  The attention-getting stunts the President has engaged in--we can \nhave those until we are blue in the face, but they don't change \nanything. All they do is remind folks of the way Democrats continue to \nset up one set of rules for themselves and another for everybody else. \nThere is one set of rules for us and another set for everybody else.\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\nWhether it is ObamaCare or the IRS or the NLRB or pushing the button on \nthe nuclear option, it is all basically the same debate: We are going \nto do what we are going to do. We don't care what the rules are; we \nwill break the rules. We will do whatever it takes to get what we want. \nIt is a party that is clearly willing to do and say just about anything \nto get its way.\n  Millions of Americans are hurting because of a law Washington \nDemocrats forced upon them. What do they do about it? They cook up a \nfight over judges on a court that doesn't even have enough work to do. \nThis is a court that they were arguing a few years ago shouldn't have \nany additional members because they had a light workload, and now the \ncourt has an even lighter workload.\n  We know what this is about. As I indicated, I would want to be \ntalking about something else too if I had to defend dogs getting \ninsurance while millions of Americans lost theirs. It isn't going to \nwork. The parallels between the latest move and the original ObamaCare \npush are all too obvious to ignore.\n  The majority leader promised over and over that he wouldn't break the \nrules of the Senate in order to change them. On July 14 he went on \n``Meet the Press'' and said: ``We're not touching judges.'' This was on \nJuly 14 of this year. That echoed the promise he made in January of \nthis year. It sounds very similar to ``If you like your policy, you can \nkeep it.''\n  Then there are the double standards. When the Democrats were in the \nminority, they argued strenuously against changing the rules. And let's \nnot forget about the raw power at play. The American people decided not \nto give Democrats the House or to restore the filibuster-proof majority \nthey had in the Senate in the last two elections--an inconvenient truth \nfor our friends on the other side.\n  They don't own the place anymore. They did in the first 2 years, with \n60 votes in the Senate and a 40-seat majority in the House, but not \nanymore. The American people took a look at that first 2 years and \nissued a national restraining order in November of 2010. Our friends \ndon't want to be deterred by that. They are going to pursue their \nagenda through the courts and through the regulatory schemes the \nadministration propounds. They changed the rules of the game to get \ntheir way. It is pretty clear that if one can write the rules of the \ngame, they ought to be able to win.\n  Earlier this year the senior Senator from New York said Senate \nDemocrats intended to ``fill up the DC Circuit one way or another.'' It \ncouldn't be any more clear than that. We will do it one way or the \nother. We break the rules, change the rules, and do what we want to do. \nThe arrogance of power is on full display by an arrogant majority. It \nis on full display in the Senate.\n  Our colleagues evidently would rather live for the moment and try to \nestablish a storyline that Republicans--I just heard it here from the \nmajority leader--Republicans are intent on obstructing President \nObama's judicial nominees. It is a storyline that is patently \nridiculous. One can keep saying things over and over, but it doesn't \nmake it true. It doesn't make it true to keep saying the wrong thing \nover and over.\n  Here are the facts. Before this current Democratic gambit to ``fill \nup the DC Circuit one way or another,'' as the senior Senator from New \nYork said, the Senate had confirmed 215 judges and rejected 2--some \nprovocation for breaking your word and breaking the rules of the Senate \nin order to change the rules of the Senate. That is a confirmation rate \nof 99 percent. Republicans have been clearly willing to confirm the \nPresident's judicial nominees. And on the DC Circuit, we recently \nconfirmed one of the President's recent nominees by a vote of 97 to 0.\n  The Democratic strategy of distract, distract, distract is getting \nold. It is not working. The American people are not listening to this \nridiculous argument. They are worried about their health care and are \nangry at the people who caused them to lose their policies. In my State \n280,000 people have lost their policies, and on the exchange 26,000 \nhave been able to get private policies. The rest of them are all \nMedicaid recipients.\n  The Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw \npower--the same playbook that got us ObamaCare--has to end. With the \nhelp of the American people, we will end it in 1 year. Meanwhile, \nRepublicans are going to keep pushing to get back on the drawing board \non health care--to replace ObamaCare with real reforms that help rather \nthan punish the middle class.\n  At this point I am going to refer to some constituent letters I have \nreceived related to ObamaCare that the Senate would find noteworthy.\n  This is a letter from a constituent in Bowling Green:\n\n       I am a 35-year-old college graduate and represent many \n     hardworking middle-class Kentuckians who are being directly \n     impacted by . . . ObamaCare. I am a married father of 2 young \n     children. We are, by most accounts, an average American \n     family. Before [ObamaCare] was passed, my family was insured \n     through a health insurance policy purchased on the open \n     market. We shopped several different policies and chose the \n     one that was the best fit for our needs.\n       Recently, we received a notice from our insurer that our \n     plan didn't meet the requirements of the [new health care \n     law]. According to the letter, we were required by law to be \n     transitioned into a plan that did meet these new \n     requirements. Also included in the letter was our new \n     premium. That is what shocked us. According to the letter, \n     our premiums would be increasing by 124%, more than double \n     what we had budgeted for this expense.\n       According to a speech by the Vice President on September \n     27th [of this year], a family of four earning $50,000 a year \n     could get coverage for as little as $106 a month. Should I \n     have to pay 8 times that amount because my wife and I both \n     work hard to provide for our family and earn more than the \n     Vice President's limit of $50,000 a year? Why should the \n     price of a product be based on my ability to pay?\n\n  That is a very good question: ``Why should the price of a product be \nbased on my ability to pay?''\n  He continues:\n\n       Would that work at the gas station? Should the price of a \n     gallon of gas be decided by my income tax return? Or at the \n     grocery store? Should the price of a gallon of milk be \n     determined by my income tax return? Or in shopping for a \n     home loan? Should the interest rate on my mortgage be \n     higher if I earn more than $50,000 a year? This predatory \n     pricing structure runs contrary to the basic American \n     foundational principles of Free Enterprise and is illegal \n     in every other marketplace. It should be illegal in health \n     care too.\n\n  Larry Thompson from Lexington:\n\n       My health plan that I have had for 10 years just got \n     canceled, and the least expensive plan on the exchange is a \n     246 percent increase--that means hundreds of extra dollars \n     per month we don't have. Obama lied and made a promise he \n     couldn't keep when he said repeatedly if we wanted to keep \n     our current health care policy we could.\n\n  That is what Mr. Thompson from Lexington said. And he continues:\n\n       He has really affected our lives for the worse--much worse. \n     I'm so mad. We must stop insurance companies from canceling \n     policies--now.\n\n  And of course the reason they are having to cancel policies is \nbecause the law makes them.\n  Sherry Harris from Nicholasville in my State:\n\n       Did you know the Lake Cumberland Hospital in Somerset is \n     not on the Anthem network? Which means anybody in Pulaski and \n     surrounding counties that qualify for a subsidy and want to \n     use it will have to drive to London, Corbin or Lexington to \n     get care?\n\n  Harriet White from Rockfield, which is in Warren County, near Bolling \nGreen:\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am deeply upset because of the \n     effect this health care act has had on our family's health \n     insurance. It has negatively impacted our finances and our \n     quality of care. The President promised that if you had \n     health care, you would not be impacted. The sad truth is \n     that, like my coworkers, my deductible has doubled, along \n     with my premiums. The only way to be able to adjust is for us \n     to either reduce or stop our 401(k) contributions. This is \n     hardly affordable health care. I don't understand why such a \n     blatant lie has been allowed to go this far. Do we not as \n     American citizens have the right to choose basic services? I \n     don't think the government should make choices for the people \n     that impact us in such a negative way. Thank you for your \n     time, and please keep fighting this gross abuse of power.\n\n  Aaron McLemore from Louisville:\n\n       Seeing as I'm a single male (31, policy being cancelled) \n     with no kids or dependents, and I'm paying for pediatric \n     dental care and maternity care, it doesn't make a whole lot \n     of sense to me.\n\n  This is a single male, age 31, having to pay for pediatric dental \ncare and maternity care, and he says it ``doesn't make a whole lot of \nsense to me.'' He makes more than $100,000 a year and doesn't qualify \nfor a subsidy on the\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nObama exchange. So the current policy of this 31-year-old is being \ncanceled. A new policy from the exchange will more than double his \nmonthly premium and nearly double his yearly out-of-pocket maximum. His \nhigher costs aren't subsidizing lower income policyholders whose \nsubsidies have already been paid by the government, but he is providing \na subsidy in another way: The new act requires him to buy a policy with \nfeatures he doesn't need.\n  What ObamaCare is doing is moving McLemore out of the individual \nmarket, where people are sorted by age and health history and scope of \ncoverage, to a market more like the traditional employer-based group \npolicy in which young and old workers get the same coverage and pay the \nsame premium.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Spears from Louisville:\n\n       I think you should know what is going on here in Kentucky \n     with Kynect--\n\n  That is the Kentucky Web site--\n\n       I had to sign my wife up since our governor canceled all of \n     the KyAccess policies effective January 1, 2014. I signed up \n     through the benefits firm, advising them that I wanted no \n     subsidies since we have always paid our way in 42 years of \n     marriage. He told me the full pay option of $517 per month \n     and advised no income verification was necessary since no \n     subsidies were involved. So I chose the Kentucky Co Op plan, \n     as I felt the monies would stay in Kentucky with this plan.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       And then I received four mailings from Kynect. One stating \n     she was declined coverage unless I sent income verifications; \n     also one stating I have to fill out a voter registration and \n     return as they have no information on my voting record.\n\n  So what does whether you are registered to vote have to do with \nsigning up for ObamaCare?\n  The letter continues:\n\n       I called Kynect today and advised them I am receiving no \n     subsidies and do not feel I should be required to send this \n     information to them. And if they wanted this information, I \n     file taxes every year and would be easily accessed. In \n     regards to voter registration, I advised this has nothing to \n     do with health registration, and I strongly objected to the \n     language linking the two in the letter. Any clear thinking \n     person would be upset at our State government trying to bring \n     voter registration into this mess, not to mention personal \n     information they should not need since no subsidies are \n     involved.\n\n  These stories go on and on.\n  Lana Lynch from Brandenburg:\n\n       My out-of-pocket expenses for my family of five went from \n     $1,500 a year to $7,000 a year. The best policy that is \n     available by my employer has a $7,000 out-of-pocket a year \n     [provision].\n\n  And she works for a very large health care provider.\n  Jeannine Gentry from Ekron:\n\n       We are covered under my husband's policy through his \n     employer. We have not found out exactly how much the premium \n     is going to rise but have been told to expect between 150 to \n     300 percent increase per paycheck. We do know for certain \n     that our deductible will rise from $5,000 annually to $8,500.\n\n  Ann Knauer from Sheperdsville:\n\n       I received my insurance papers from United Healthcare and \n     found that my premiums had risen from $214 to $480 a month. I \n     only get $1,181 in Social Security a month. That's after my \n     Medicare payment. So I went online to see if I could get my \n     husband signed up for this ACA insurance. I filled out the \n     information, but was told that what I stated for our income \n     was incorrect and that I needed to send in proof of my \n     income. Then they insisted we fill out this form about voter \n     registration. We are already registered to vote and felt this \n     was completely unnecessary. The form did have a spot that \n     stated that we were already registered, but I just don't \n     trust the Web site, so we declined. We got forms in the mail \n     anyway. I'm just going to stick with my old insurance and pay \n     the higher premiums because I know what it covers. I have \n     Medicare and United Healthcare. I have kept this insurance \n     because of my husband, who is also retired but not covered \n     under any other insurance. My insurance came from my job that \n     I had before I retired, as part of the retirement package.\n\n  Mike Conn from Prestonsburg. And I might say that Prestonsburg is in \neastern Kentucky, in the heart of Appalachia, which is also suffering a \ndepression as a result of this administration's war on coal. So this \nperson who corresponded with me is also living in the middle of a \ndepression-riddled part of my State also created by the Obama \nadministration.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       A policy that has similar coverage to what we had would \n     cost us around $1,100 a month. This is a 100 percent increase \n     for me and my wife. I was informed by the individual that was \n     helping me find coverage that it was because we live in \n     eastern Kentucky.\n\n  Apparently their insurance company is not available there.\n  Finally, he says:\n\n       We will not pay that.\n\n  Giselle Martino from Prospect:\n\n       My premium health care, at premium cost to me, is being \n     canceled. I paid a very high premium to have a major medical \n     plan. I am now forced into the exchange for a lesser plan \n     with more exclusions and higher deductibles. I will most \n     likely never reach these deductibles. How does this help me? \n     I'm basically paying into the plan for the others. If I must \n     pay for my higher tier heart drugs anyway, why should I \n     bother with the health plan? What a disappointment this \n     administration has caused.\n\n  Cheryl Russell from Owensboro:\n\n       We got a letter from our insurance company saying our \n     current policy will not meet the Affordable Care Act, which \n     means it will go away. According to our insurance company, we \n     will have to take pediatric dental and vision insurance. We \n     don't have kids. They said it was because of ObamaCare. They \n     are allowing us to keep our plan until December 2014, for an \n     additional $38 more a month, so we can find another plan. \n     Another plan through this company that we had our whole life \n     will cost us at least $900 to $1,000 a month. It will cost us \n     over $150 more a month plus our deductible goes up to $5,700. \n     I sent you a message last week. I am sending this again. \n     Please keep taking a stand against ObamaCare. Our President \n     lied to us. Not only are we going to lose our insurance, but \n     when we go to a different policy we have to pay more. We will \n     never be able to retire. We are 58 and 56 years old. We will \n     have to work the rest of our lives just to pay for our own \n     insurance. The company we work for doesn't provide it. This \n     isn't fair and it isn't right. Thanks for taking a stand for \n     all those who are in Kentucky.\n\n  So, Mr. President, in wrapping up my remarks, here is the situation. \nOn Christmas Eve 2009, on a straight party-line vote--60 Democrats \nvoting for and 40 Republicans voting against--the administration jammed \nthrough a 2,700-page rewrite of 16 percent of our economy. The goal, \none could argue, was a noble goal--that of trying to reduce the number \nof uninsured in America from an estimated group of about 45 million \nAmericans.\n  The first problem with this particular solution is that CRS--the \nCongressional Research Service, which doesn't work for either \nRepublicans or Democrats--says when all is said and done we are still \ngoing to have 30 million uninsured. So what is the cost-benefit ratio \nof taking $1 trillion out of the providers of health care--roughly $750 \nbillion in reductions; cuts to hospitals, home health care, nursing \nhomes and the like, hospice; billions of dollars in taxes on medical \ndevices; taxes on health insurance premiums kicking in the first of a \nyear; a $1 trillion impact on the providers of health care--and over on \nthe consumer side I have just given a series of stories about how it \nimpacts the consumers of health care: higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, lost jobs, a record number of part-time employees, and \nwreaking havoc on the American economy, the consumers of health care, \nand on the providers of health care--all to reduce the number of \nuninsured from 45 to 30 million.\n  This has to be the worst cost-benefit ratio in the history of \nAmerican government, all of this disruption--this catastrophic impact \non 16 percent of our economy--in order to make a marginal reduction in \nthe number of uninsured. This has to be the biggest mistake in modern \ntimes. In fact, I am hard-pressed to think of a single bigger mistake \nthe Federal Government has made, and it has made some whoppers over the \nyears. I am hard-pressed to think of a single example that comes \nanywhere close to this, a gargantuan, massive mistake, which has had a \nlot to do with the fact that we have had such a tepid recovery in our \ncountry after a deep recession.\n  The pattern since World War II has been that the deeper the \nrecession, the quicker the bounce-back--until this one: a deep \nrecession, a tepid recovery. The government itself is the reason for \nthat: massive overregulation, an army of regulators who will now have \ntheir work sped through the DC Circuit Court who believe if you are \nmaking a profit you are up to no good; you are obviously cheating your \ncustomers and mistreating your employees. They are here to help you. \nThis massive bureaucratic overreach has definitely slowed our recovery.\n  So I hope the American people will give us an opportunity in the not \ntoo distant future to pull this thing out root and branch and start \nover and do this right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                          A Nuclear-Armed Iran\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to speak about an issue of \ngreat importance to the national security of the United States and to \nall of our allies--which is, preventing Iran from ever having a nuclear \nweapon. There is no doubt in my mind that we will in fact do that, but \ncertain things have to happen. The question is how, not whether, we \nprevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  For the first time in years, there is a real opportunity to take a \ngood step to verifiably eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons capability \nthrough tough negotiations rather than the alternative--which is, \ninevitably, acts of war.\n  The initial interim agreement between the P5+1 and Iran is an \nencouraging first step, and I urge my colleagues not to put it at risk. \nHow would they do that? By passing new sanctions right now. There is a \nlot of talk about that, and it is easy to look tough. I am kind of \namazed, to be honest with you, that, I don't think, anybody from our \nside has gotten up and made a speech about this subject on the Senate \nfloor. I meant to yesterday but I couldn't. I thank Senator Johnson, \nchairman of the banking committee, who has come to the rescue of all of \nus. He is not going to allow it to happen, and I totally congratulate \nhim for that act of quiet and strong courage.\n  Instead, we should simply state the obvious: If Iran reneges or plays \ngames, there is no question in anybody's mind in this Senate that we \nwill quickly pass new sanctions the very moment the need arises. To me, \nthis is a clear-cut case. Again, I frankly do not understand why more \nof us, at least on this side, have not gotten up to make this case. I \nthink I have some ideas, but I do wonder.\n  There is still a long way to go, no question. But this diplomatic \nopportunity is real. Why? Because Iran wants and needs to find a way \nout of the financial isolation that our crippling sanctions have \ninflicted on its government, its business, and its people. It is \ndevastating what our sanctions have done.\n  Iran's people elected a president who proposed a different path. \nAyatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, has given President Rouhani \nsome flexibility to try and find an agreement. That is unprecedented, \nand most people think it is for real. We shall see. They did in fact \nagree to the initial deal. So already, one step has been taken with a \ngood result. I don't think it is a coincidence.\n  The immense power of U.S.-led global financial sanctions, backed up \nby our allies, has created the opportunity to resolve this issue \ndiplomatically, with verifiable agreements and skeptical inspectors, \nrather than with bombs or boots on the ground.\n  I have spent much of my tenure on the Intelligence Committee, going \nback before 9/11, with the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, \nthe NSA, the FBI, and the Treasury Department to build our tools to \nexploit and to freeze the international web of financial networks that \nenable terrorist and proliferation programs--particularly Iran's \nnuclear programs. I have staunchly supported the powerful multilateral \nsanctions regime that is currently suffocating the Iranian economy and \nforced the current Iranian regime to the negotiating table. They would \nnot have been there otherwise. The effect of inflation and devastation \nof economic production and all the rest is devastating.\n  This initial agreement is the first concrete result of those \nsanctions. It stops progress on Iran's nuclear program. It neutralizes \nIran's most dangerous stockpile of nuclear material--that is, 20 \npercent of enriched uranium--and it establishes strong monitoring \nmechanisms that enable inspectors to verify that Iran is in compliance \nwith its commitments.\n  The first step maintains the powerful sanctions regime that has \nforced Iran to the table. The agreement maintains that. The very small \namount of targeted and reversible financial relief that it provides--\nroughly $7 billion out of $100 billion in sanctions that the agreement \nleaves fully in place--only underscores the grip that we and our allies \nhave on Iran's financial position. The grip will not loosen during this \n6-month agreement as we try to go to a next step. We will continue to \ncontrol and limit Iran's access to money during the 6-month agreement. \nIf Iran in fact reneges on the terms of the interim deal, Iran will not \neven get all of the small relief that we have agreed to. They will, \nhowever, get more sanctions, and over the next 6 months, the small \namount of financial relief that Iran can gain in the deal will be \ndwarfed by the amount of their loss in oil revenue that our continuing \nsanctions will deny Iran. That was in place; that is in place. Iran \nwill be in worse shape financially 6 months from now than it is today. \nThat is a fact. The pressure does not relent. It just keeps going. So \nit is a good situation--tough, agreed to, and in place.\n  That is why Iran needs to complete a final comprehensive agreement to \neliminate its nuclear weapons capabilities. Does that guarantee it? No, \nit doesn't. But we are a step further than we were before because this \ninterim agreement does not give Iran what it needs to escape financial \nruin--which counts.\n\n  I appreciate the concerns of colleagues who want more now. But we \nmust give this opportunity a chance. However you see the first step, \nwhatever your view of it is, the fact is that today Iran is further \nfrom a nuclear weapon than it would have been without this deal that we \nhave just completed. We have accomplished this first step through \ndiplomatic strength, without a shot fired. I think we can agree that is \npretty good.\n  We all want to put pressure on Iran to comply with the commitments it \nhas made to the interim agreement--and we will--and to agree to a long-\nterm comprehensive deal--and we hope--that will prevent it from ever \ndeveloping a weapon. But we have taken the first step.\n  My colleagues, the pressure already exists for Iran to continue on \nthis diplomatic path. Again, if Iran reneges on the commitments it has \nmade in this agreement or balks at a final deal that verifiably ends \nits nuclear weapons capabilities, we will go right to, without doubt, \nthe Congress imposing new and ever more powerful sanctions on Iran. But \nwe don't have to do that now. In fact, it is a terrible mistake to do \nthat now.\n  Given the indisputable credibility of that threat, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider how unnecessary and how risky it would be to \npreemptively introduce new sanctions right now. New sanctions now could \nbe criticized as a violation of the interim agreement. It could be \nblown up that way. Such a move would separate us from our negotiating \npartners in the P5+1 and it could complicate the already difficult \nnegotiations of a final agreement which we all pray for.\n  I know some Senators doubt these risks. But I ask my colleagues this: \nIf there is any chance at all that new sanctions right now might \ndisrupt the agreement or jeopardize a future agreement, why on earth \nwould we risk that? Why would we risk that? We know where we stand. We \nknow where we are going. We can't be sure that we are going to get \nthere, but we know that we always have the power to increase sanctions \nif they try to avoid certain things. But they haven't. So why pile on \nnow and threaten to blow the whole thing up? Why would we risk an \nopportunity that may very well be the only chance we have to resolve \nthis enormous problem without the use of military force? I do not know \nof an alternative to that.\n  If we lose this diplomatic opportunity, then the use of force will be \nthe only option to stop Iran's path to a nuclear bomb. All of us have \nlived with war for the past 12 years. Intimately, painfully, \nhorrifically, we have all seen close up the incalculable financial and \nhuman cost that has come with these wars and the burden that the wars \nnow put on our troops, their families, our economy, and, therefore, our \npeople. This has only hardened my resolve to ensure that this immense \nsacrifice never happens unnecessarily--that we take great care to \nexhaust every possible avenue to diplomatic resolution.\n  Colleagues, we have now an opportunity to eliminate Iran's nuclear \nweapons capabilities. We can do it peacefully. Let's not put that at \nrisk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, President Lincoln once said:\n\n       Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. \n     The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real \n     thing.\n\n  It is my distinct privilege to rise today to speak on two nominees \nthat are indeed the real thing--Justice Brian Morris and Judge Susan \nWatters. The Senate will soon take up both Justice Morris's and Judge \nWatters's nominations for United States District Judge for the District \nof Montana.\n  One of the most important responsibilities I have is providing advice \nand consent to the President on nominations to the Federal bench. I \napproach each vacancy with the same criteria--I want the best, \nregardless of whether they are Republican or Democrat, liberal or \nconservative. Justice Morris and Judge Watters are the best. Their \nquality of character and breadth of experience are remarkable.\n  Montana Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris is one of the brightest \nlegal minds to ever come out of Montana. Justice Morris was born and \nraised in Butte, MT, and graduated from Butte Central High School. He \nearned bachelors and masters degrees in economics from Stanford \nUniversity and received his law degree with distinction from Stanford \nUniversity Law School in 1992.\n  Justice Morris's experience after law school is as varied as it is \nnoteworthy. He clerked for Judge John Noonan, Jr., of the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the United \nStates Supreme Court. He spent time working abroad as a legal assistant \nat the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague and as a legal officer at \nthe United Nations Compensation Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. He \nalso spent time in private practice, handling criminal and commercial \nlitigation with the Bozeman, MT, firm of Goetz, Madden, & Dunn.\n  Justice Morris also served for years as the State's Solicitor \nGeneral. He was elected to his current position on the Montana Supreme \nCourt in 2004, and has demonstrated integrity, fairness, a steady \ndisposition, and superb analytical skills on Montana's highest court. \nJustice Morris is known for his approachability, even-handedness, and \ndown-to-earth manner. After all, he is from Butte. He can often be \nfound reading to students at Smith Elementary School in Helena.\n  Justice Morris has commanded the respect of his colleagues at the \nhighest levels of the law. For more than 8 years, he has served the \npeople of Montana on the bench and in the community. His nomination is \nan extraordinary cap on an already remarkable career, and I have no \ndoubt that he will continue to serve at the highest level. I \ncongratulate Justice Morris, his wife Cherche, and their children Max, \nMekdi, Aiden, and William, on this achievement.\n  In 1916, Montanans elected Jeanette Rankin to be the first woman to \nserve in Congress 4 years before women had the right to vote. We are \nespecially proud of this fact. Judge Susan Watters, our second nominee, \nis another trailblazer we can be proud of. Not only is Judge Watters a \nrespected jurist and dedicated public servant, but once confirmed, she \nwill be the first woman to serve as a United States District Court \nJudge for the State of Montana.\n  Judge Watters was born and raised in Billings, MT, and graduated with \nhonors from Eastern Montana College. Judge Watters raised 2 young \ndaughters while attending the University of Montana Law School, \nreceiving her law degree in 1988. Since then, Judge Watters has \ncemented her reputation as a skilled trial lawyer and judge.\n  After law school, Judge Watters served as Deputy County Attorney for \nYellowstone County, handling civil and criminal cases. In 1995, Judge \nWatters entered private practice, taking hundreds of cases to final \njudgment in State and Federal court. In 1999, Governor Marc Racicot \nappointed her to sit as a State district court judge for Montana's 13th \njudicial district in Billings. Since her appointment, Judge Watters has \nbeen reelected 3 times, most recently with over 80 percent of the vote.\n  Judge Watters has tried hundreds of cases during her 14-plus years on \nthe bench. She has heard civil, criminal, probate, juvenile, and family \nlaw cases. Her trial court experience is remarkable.\n  She further served her community by establishing the Yellowstone \nCounty Family Drug Treatment Court in 2001, the first of its kind in \nMontana. Its overwhelming success has made it a national model.\n  Judge Watters is known for being fair, hard-working, possessing \nstrong analytical skills and an excellent judicial temperament. Her \nextensive trial experience as a practicing lawyer and trial judge will \nbe an invaluable addition to Montana's Federal bench.\n  Judge Watters embodies the qualities that service on the Federal \nbench requires. She has served the people of Yellowstone County for \nover a decade, and I am absolutely confident that she will bring the \nsame professionalism and dignity to the Federal bench. I want to \ncongratulate Judge Watters, her husband Ernie, and their daughters \nJessica and Maggie on this outstanding achievement.\n  Justice Morris and Judge Watters are supremely qualified. Their \nservice is sorely needed. We have two vacancies in our State. We have \nthree Federal district court judgeships. The vacancies that Judge \nWatters and Justice Morris will fill are both considered judicial \nemergencies. Chief Judge Dana Christensen, our lone active judge, \ntravels over 300 miles round trip to hear cases. In fact, I just spoke \nto him yesterday, telling him we would be filling these positions in \nMontana. He said, Max, I am getting in the car right now to drive. \nWhat's the distance? I won't say the distance. It is a 4-hour drive to \nGreat Falls, MT, from Missoula, so he could sit and hear some cases in \nGreat Falls. Judge Don Molloy travels over 340 miles one way. That is \ngreater than the distance between Washington, DC and Hartford, CT. He \ndoes that to hear cases. We need our replacements.\n  Justice Morris and Judge Watters embody the qualities Montanans \ndemand of their Federal judges--their intellect, their experience, and \nintegrity above reproach. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \ntheir nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise to address the nomination of \nCornelia Pillard for the DC Circuit. It appears to me the environment \nin which we are discussing these nominations is a good example of the \nnew rules of the Senate. We are already getting a taste of the new \nworld order around here. It did not take long. It has only been a few \nweeks but we are already experiencing life in the new Senate. Those in \nthe majority who wanted to change the rules are now certainly getting \ntheir wish.\n  It should have been obvious that the rule change would impact the \nSenate in many unforeseen ways. We in the minority have had to find \nother ways to make our voices heard. As we watch the majority use its \nnew power to move whomever it wants through this body, we should \nrealize that we have started down a course from which we will never \nreturn. Indeed, we should expect more changes in the future. The \nmajority changed the rules because it did not like how they were \noperating to frustrate their ambitions and agenda. If other things come \nabout that frustrate the majority, we may have new changes to get rid \nof those frustrations too. The invocation of the nuclear option has set \nus on an irreversible course.\n  A few weeks ago I came to this floor and quoted our former \nParliamentarian Bob Dove. He and Richard Arenberg, one-time aide to \nformer majority leader George Mitchell, wrote a book called ``Defending \nthe Filibuster.'' This is what they said, and it bears repeating:\n\n       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's \n     rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of \n     Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that \n     give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And \n     there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of \n     Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that \n     power in order to give the minority greater voice in crafting \n     legislation.\n\n  Unfortunately, the majority didn't seem to care about the concern \nthese wise men raised and went ahead with their rule change anyway. Now \nwe are feeling the effect.\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n  This power grab is having other consequences too. Today I attended a \nhearing in the rules committee as the ranking member, for nominees to \nan agency called the Election Assistance Commission. You probably never \nheard of it. Madam President, I doubt if you have ever heard of it. It \nis a small agency with 4 commissioners--2 Democrats and 2 Republicans. \nNominations to bipartisan commissions have traditionally been paired \nand moved jointly. This practice ensured each party has a voice in such \nbodies.\n  Before the rules were changed, the minority could be assured that \ntheir consent would be needed for appointments. That assurance is now \ngone. Will the majority just make its own appointments to commissions \nsuch as this now? I hope not. That is under discussion in the rules \ncommittee. But what motivation do they have to ever confirm any \nRepublican nominee, if they so choose to even consider minority views \nin this regard? We are going down a dangerous path, and no one knows \nwhere it will lead.\n  The same is true in regard to the atmosphere that we find with the \naffordable health care act. For some reason, the executive has decided \nto make any changes to the law without really considering coming back \nto the Senate or the House or the Congress to make these changes. So in \npart I come to the floor to speak about an issue that continues to keep \nme up every night--and every Kansan as well--that is the implementation \nof this affordable health care act, the health reform law.\n  This is, indeed, the President's legacy legislation. Based on what I \nam hearing from Kansans at home, I would think the President would want \nto be remembered for something else entirely. Unfortunately, since the \nimplementation of ObamaCare began, the stories and reports have only \nconfirmed the many warnings that I and my colleagues have made during \nthe debate for the last 3 years.\n  People cannot keep their coverage. Despite the many, even hundreds of \npromises made by this President and the supporters of this law, people \nare losing their coverage. Premiums are increasing, even though the \nPresident and supporters of this law said premiums would decrease by \n$2,500 for all Americans. Most of the stories I hear, and especially \nfrom Kansans, involve many hundreds of dollars in increases in monthly \npremiums.\n  Even more recently, folks are realizing that what they had to pay in \nout-of-pocket costs are going to skyrocket. Deductibles are higher and \nthe products, drugs, and services Kansans have to pay to reach their \ndeductible has virtually exploded. This doesn't even count the \nincreases to copays and other costs that patients are seeing, \nespecially with regard to prescription drugs.\n  This is being done in a way so that patients are getting the full \ninformation they need. So much for being the most transparent \ngovernment in history.\n  Along these lines I believe it is my responsibility to come to the \nfloor and remind Kansans about several other provisions of ObamaCare \nthat patients may not be aware will put the government between the \npatient and the doctor--their doctor. During the health care reform \ndebate, I spoke at length in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and in the Finance Committee, and on the Senate floor about \nsomething called rationing, a subject that is very controversial. \nSpecifically, I want people to know about the four rationers--boards, \ncommissions, whatever you want to talk about--the four rationers \nincluded in ObamaCare.\n  First is the CMS Innovation Center, the Center for Medicaid Services \nInnovation Center, which was given an enormous budget to find a way to \nreform payments and delivery models. What this really means is CMS can \nnow use taxpayer dollars in ways to reduce patient access to care. It \ngives CMS new powers to cut payments to Medicare beneficiaries with a \ngoal to reduce program expenditures, but the reality being that they \nwill reduce patient access.\n  There are new authorities also granted to the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. The USPSTF used to be a body that was scientific \nand academic, that reviewed treatment, testing, and preventive health \ndata and made recommendations for primary care practitioners and health \ncare systems.\n  I guess many would agree that is still what they do today. However, \nthe weight of their recommendations holds significantly more weight as \nof today, due to the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. Because of this \nlaw, the health care law, the USPSTF, can now decide what should and, \nmore importantly, should not be covered by health care plans. If the \nUSPSTF doesn't recommend it, then it will not be covered by your health \nplan and you will bear the cost of the procedure. We are already seeing \nthis with prostate exams, mammograms for breast cancer, which many \npeople say have saved their lives. You reach a certain age and they \nwill not do a PSA test. The same kind of criteria--with some degree--to \nmammograms.\n\n  Rationale No. 3, the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute or \nPCORI. This outfit was given millions and millions of dollars to do \ncomparative effectiveness research, also known as CER. I am not \nopposed--I don't know of any Member in this body who is opposed--to \nresearch, especially when it is used to inform the conversation between \na doctor and their patients.\n  But there is a reason this was formerly called cost-effective \nresearch. There is a very fine line between providing information to \ndoctors and patients to help them make the right decision that works \nthe best for them and then using that information to decide whether the \ncare or treatment is worth paying for. I have long been concerned that \nthis research will be abused to arbitrarily deny access to treatments \nor services in order to save the government money by Federal Government \ndecree.\n  Finally, there is my personal nemesis IPAB, which stands for the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, and is just now making news as \nvarious people within the media are finally recognizing IPAB. This is a \nboard made up of 15 unelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to \nstay and what gets to go in Medicare coverage. They will decide what \ntreatments and services will be covered and which will not, all to \nallegedly save money with no accountability. There is no accountability \nwhatsoever.\n  When proposed--I remember it well both in the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee--supporters of the health care law told me we are too \nclose to our constituents. Really? We are too close to our \nconstituents. It makes it too difficult to make the hard decisions. \nLet's have somebody else do it. It will be more fair. We know them too \nmuch. We trust them too much.\n  I could not believe it. I believe I am elected to make the hard \ndecisions--I and others in this body--and take the hard votes. I \nbelieve that is the way Kansans and every other State constituency also \nwants it.\n  Even worse is the fine print of IPAB. Get this. If Kansans determine \nthey do not like the direction the IPAB is taking and call my office, \nand every other office in the Senate, to ask us to do something about \nit--to ask me to do something about it--we in Congress can overturn \ntheir decision, but it has to be by a certain margin. On the surface \nthis sounds OK until you realize the President will never support \nCongress overturning the recommendation of this Board, so he will veto \nit. Overriding a veto takes a two-thirds vote, which is 66 votes to \noverturn a decision by IPAB.\n  My colleagues have been changing the rules around here because they \nthink 60 votes is too high a threshold. What are the chances of \nreaching 66 if a decision is made by IPAB with regard to Medicare?\n  But wait. There is more. If the Secretary appoints a board unable to \nmake recommendations for cuts to Medicare, then she gets the authority \nto make the decision of what to cut. This President has already cut \none-half trillion dollars from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare, and he \ngave himself the ability to go after even more Medicare dollars and \nhave no accountability with IPAB. This is egregious, if not ridiculous, \nbut it is not new.\n  I have been talking about the four rationers for a long time and what \nit means to patients. I will have more to say about it when the \nopportunity presents itself.\n  What scares me, as I watch all the other warnings and broken promises\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\ncome true, is what is going to happen to Kansans--and I know other \nSenators have this same fear--when the warnings about the four \nrationers do come true.\n  We need to protect the all-important relationship between the doctor \nand the patient, which I believe the four rationers put at risk. In \norder to do that, we need to repeal--and most important--and replace \nObamaCare with real reforms that work for Kansans.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  In this atmosphere of uncertainty and new Senate order, I would like \nto talk about another subject that is related, for the lack of any \nprogress we might have.\n  This is becoming an all too familiar situation for Kansas farmers and \nranchers and all of American agriculture. In some respects we are \ncloser to signing a farm bill into law than 1 year ago, but we still \nhave not yet completed this important task. As 1 of the 41 Members \nnamed at the conference committee in October, I was able to give a \nquick opening statement outlining my biggest priorities for the farm \nbill, including addressing regulations that protect crop insurance and \nreforming SNAP; i.e., food stamps.\n  Unfortunately, that was the one and only time the full conference \ncommittee has met to date. With time in short supply, the four \nprincipals of the agriculture committee both in the House and the \nSenate--the ranking member, the chairwoman, the chairman, and the \nranking member in the House--are trying to make the majority of \ndecisions as best they can among themselves and behind closed doors.\n  Sometimes you can get things done behind closed doors without 37 \npeople offering their opinion. I understand that. But with all due \nrespect to those Members, we have real policy differences that deserve \nto be debated publicly, particularly in the commodity and the nutrition \ntitles. The other 37 of us have been ready and willing to be put to \nwork. Yet the conference committee has only met once with no future \nmeeting scheduled.\n  I am very disappointed that an agreement on the farm bill may be \nclose and yet some of our ideas and suggestions and concerns will go \nunheard or unanswered, such as the new environment we live in, in the \nSenate.\n  As I said during the agriculture committee markup and our only \nconference meeting, I have real concerns with the direction of the farm \nprograms in this year's bill. We have what are called target prices--we \nmight as well just say subsidies or countercyclical payments or adverse \nmarket payments--which have proven to be trade and market distorting.\n  For some commodities these prices are set so high that they may cover \na producer's cost of production. That is right. We have a government \nsubsidy over the producer's cost of production. That will essentially \nguarantee that a farmer profits if yields are average or above average.\n  In this budget environment, and at a time when we are looking to make \nsmart cuts, I simply don't know how to justify this subsidy program \nthat can pay producers more than the cost of production and essentially \nbecomes nothing more than an income transfer program, not a risk \nmanagement tool.\n  After the committee markup, I had hopes we could improve the farm \nbill to more resemble the risk-oriented and the market-based approach \nthe Senate had previously taken, working with the distinguished \nchairwoman from Michigan and myself as ranking member.\n  Last year I worked with the Senate leadership from both parties to \nconsider the farm bill through, of all things, regular order. Everybody \nhad a chance to offer an amendment. The first amendment that was \noffered had nothing to do with the farm bill. That amendment was by \nSenator Paul. Regular order gave all Senators the chance to improve the \nbill or make their concerns known.\n  However, this year we considered a mere 15 amendments. The last time \naround it was 73 with 300 offered. Although 250 amendments were offered \nthis time, we only had 15 amendments. All amendments regarding the new \ntarget price program were blocked from consideration and votes on the \nSenate floor--all of them. Senator Thune had amendments, Senator \nGrassley had amendments, Senator Johanns had amendments, and I had \namendments. We all serve on the agriculture committee.\n  Of course, the real problem with farmers planting for a government \nprogram and not for the market is that these programs only serve to \nextend the period of low prices due to overproduction.\n  Besides high target prices for all commodities, the House wants to \nrecouple payments with current production for the first time since \n1996. The Chamber of Commerce has warned that if we go down this road, \nwe will quickly invite other Nations to initiate dispute settlements \nagainst the United States and do so with a good chance of success.\n  I also have longstanding WTO, World Trade Organization, concerns, and \nthe United States lost--and I mean really lost--in a case to Brazil in \npart because of the decoupled price program. We are still paying for \nthat.\n  I am hopeful we will come to some agreement that works without \nfurther setting us up for a further trade dispute not ruled in our \nfavor.\n  Another sticking point seems to be SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program. I think everybody is aware of that. It is important \nto note that at least 80 percent of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's budget goes to nutrition programs. SNAP was exempted from \nacross-the-board cuts known as sequestration.\n  The Senate bill only trims $4 billion out of a nearly $800 billion \nprogram in a 10-year budget. That is less than 1 percent of a \nreduction. It doesn't cut anybody's benefits. It looks at eligibility \nand other problems that are within SNAP.\n  We have the responsibility to do more to restore integrity to SNAP, \neliminate fraud and abuse, while providing benefits to those truly in \nneed.\n  I offered an amendment during the committee markup and on the floor \nthat would have saved an additional $31 billion for SNAP. I thought it \nwas a smart and responsible way which would not take away food from \nneedy families.\n  The House took a similar approach and also included work requirements \nfor food stamps and found a total of $39 billion in savings. That is \nabout a 5-percent reduction over 10 years.\n  It has also been mentioned that SNAP has already been cut by $11 \nbillion this year. However, the end of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus boost for food stamps was a temporary \nincrease in benefits to assist individuals and families hurt by the \nrecession. The end of this temporary increase is in no way related to \nthe farm bill, and the Congressional Budget Office agrees that no \nbudgetary savings are achieved. Reconciling the difference between $4 \nbillion and $40 billion in savings has proven very tough so far, if not \nimpossible. However, unlike the majority of the programs in the farm \nbill, if we don't have a bill signed into law, the Food Stamp Program \nor SNAP will go unchanged and there will be no savings or reform to the \nprogram.\n\n  Last week I spoke with the Kansas Farm Bureau--800 members of the \nfarm bureau and their families--and once again the No. 1 priority for \nvirtually every producer was crop insurance. Even after the devastating \ndrought over the last few years, crop insurance has proven to work. \nProducers from Kansas to Illinois and all over the country are still in \nbusiness helping our rural families and our communities.\n  In 2013, producers across the country insured a record number of \nacres, covering nearly 295 million acres and over $123 billion in \nliabilities. The takeaway message is clear: More farmers are purchasing \ncrop insurance policies to protect their crops than ever before. In \nboth versions of the farm bill, we are able to strengthen and preserve \ncrop insurance. We need to keep that commitment through the final \nlegislation.\n  The farm bill is the appropriate time and place to also address \nregulatory overreaches by the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nrest of the administration that impacts farmers and livestock \nproducers. In that respect, I appreciate the House addressing several \nburdensome regulations that I worked on in the Senate, including \npesticides, farm fuels, tank storage, the lesser prairie chicken--bless \ntheir heart--GIPSA, mandatory country-of-origin labeling, also called \nCOOL.\n  Overall, I am disappointed that it looks as though we will not finish \nthe\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nfarm bill before the end of this year, despite the need for certainty \nand predictability all throughout farm country, not to mention the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Our folks back home have to make business \ndecisions regardless of the status of negotiations.\n  Just one example. Kansas wheat growers have already planted their \n2014 wheat crop and have been required to certify their acres; they \njust don't know what programs will be available to them. While we all \nwant to provide long-term certainty to farmers, ranchers, their \nfamilies, and American consumers, we have already let one extension \nexpire in September, and the House may pursue extending the 2008 bill \nyet again. However, our Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said \nyesterday that even if the House passes a short-term extension of the \nfarm bill, the Senate will not pass it.\n\n  A year ago in August I went to the floor, upset with the leader for \nfailing to consider a bill the House passed to reinstate the livestock \ndisaster programs from the 2008 farm bill in response to the \ndevastating drought in the Midwest. It went on for 3 years. At the \ntime, I called it shameful and an abdication of our duty to the \ncattlemen and women who feed the world and warned of the costs of \ninaction. We were able at that time to finalize a farm bill--still the \nsame farm bill a year later--and our livestock producers are continuing \nto work to rebuild their herds after multiple years of drought. Yet \nlivestock disaster programs remain on hold. Then the devastating \nblizzard hit the Dakotas and Nebraska this year, and those producers \nwere left with little Federal support--a problem we could have \naddressed a year ago.\n  All of us on the conference committee and every Member throughout \nCongress should be equally troubled if we leave this year without \naddressing the farm bill. I am committed to resolving these difficult \ndifferences in order to provide certainty and a forward-thinking farm \nbill that is responsible to Kansans and farmers and ranchers and \nconsumers as well as taxpayers.\n  We have to end this environment here where this so-called nuclear \noption has really gotten us into a hole that we keep digging, whether \nwe are trying to get a farm bill done, whether we are striving to \nimprove the affordable health care act or repeal it, or whether we have \na commission that nobody has heard of in the rules committee that is \nsitting doing something, but we know not really what or what to do with \nit.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, who I think would \nlike to be recognized at this time, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1610\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I see my good friend the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on the floor today, and I wish to yield to her to begin \nthis very important discussion on the importance of flood insurance \nrelief for the country. She has been an outstanding spokesperson and a \ntrue advocate to help us get this right, this Flood Insurance Program \nthat can help sustain the program itself for the benefit of the \ntaxpayers as well as for the people in North Dakota, Louisiana, \nPennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey who depend on it so much. So let \nme turn to our leader, Senator Heitkamp.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, we are here today to talk about \nsomething that is critically important to very many middle-class \nfamilies who enjoy home ownership across the country, and business \nownership, and it is the truly bipartisan Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act, which seeks to address the recent flood insurance \nrate escalations across the country.\n  This bill is measured, it is reasonable, and it allows for FEMA to \ncomplete a study on flood insurance affordability and provides Congress \nwith assurance about FEMA's ability to accurately determine flood risk \nbefore implementing pieces of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform \nAct. I think it is true in many cases that the Congress has good \nintentions. They passed the Biggert-Waters provisions, they passed the \nact, but implementation has been a nightmare. I don't think we are \nexaggerating in saying it has been a nightmare for very many of our \ncommunity members, especially across the coastal areas. I think it is \nimportant that I speak as someone from a Plains State who has told \npeople repeatedly that flood insurance is a huge impediment to success \nand to home ownership in North Dakota, in very many of my communities.\n  I wish to mention some of the provisions of the bill. The bill would \ndelay a rate increase for the following properties: primary, non-\nrepetitive loss residences that were grandfathered; all properties sold \nafter July 6, 2012; and all property that purchased a new policy after \nthat date. It is important that the folks out there who have already \ngotten these tremendous flood insurance bills understand that our \neffort is to make this bill retroactive to October 1 of this year so \nthat those rate increases that were mandated by that date don't take \neffect.\n  The basement provision is something we have spent a lot of time \neducating other Members about. It is a provision that affects very many \ncommunities across the country, including 14 in North Dakota, where \nsome of our largest communities have flood-proof basements. They have \nlived by the rules and they have done all that they should do, so they \nhave been granted an exemption from flood insurance, taking a look at \nwhere the foundation is as opposed to where the basement floor is when \nthey determine vulnerability. That basement exemption is in danger of \nbeing repealed by FEMA, and we want to make sure that whatever we do \nrecognizes that when those homeowners have played by the rules, have \ndone what is right and flood-proofed their basements, it is recognized \nin a flood insurance program.\n  Generally speaking, I came to the Senate to fight for North Dakotans. \nI have to imagine most of the Senators are here because they want to \nfight for the people of their States. A major way to do that is to \nprotect American families and their homes and stop putting undue \npressure on them. It is a simple idea, but it is proving much harder to \nimplement than I would like.\n  Flooding is a reality far too often in North Dakota, and there are \nmany other communities across the country that see the same kind of \nplains flooding. Just in the past few years we have seen communities \nsuch as Fargo, Minot, Grafton, and others impacted by severe flooding \nthat has destroyed homes and businesses.\n  This fall flood insurance rates went up for millions of families. \nThis puts families at risk. So many of them have to struggle to pay for \nflood insurance or they have to walk away, literally walk away from \ntheir investment in their home.\n  Biggert-Waters is having an immediate impact on homeowners in my \nState. I will give one example. There is a woman I know from Grafton, \nND, named Alison Skari who, with her husband Kyle, purchased a home in \nthat small community about a year ago. At the time, the flood insurance \nrate was $901 for $100,000 worth of coverage. But when the policy \nrecently came up for renewal, their flood insurance skyrocketed to more \nthan $4,200 a year. Let me repeat those statistics. Their flood \ninsurance cost when they bought their home was at $901. Today their \nbill is $4,200--a 375-percent increase for the same amount of coverage. \nIn an email to me, Allison expressed a desire to raise her children in \nGrafton, but unfortunately they no longer can afford their home--not \nwith these new rates. She said had she and her husband known about \nthese rates when they bought their home, they would never have \npurchased their home.\n  This story reinforces that we need to take a new look. We need to \ntake a new look at this Flood Insurance Program. We need to take a new \nlook at affordability of home ownership.\n  Everybody knows that in the last--certainly since 2008 we have seen a \nslow recovery in home ownership. We have tried to make sure people can \nrealize the American dream, and a big part of that is, in fact, the \nowning of their own home. Yet here we are in the Congress making it \nvirtually impossible for middle-class families to buy and live in and \nenjoy their homes. That was never the intention of the Biggert-Waters \nprovision. The intention was to bring the Flood Insurance Program to a \nmore reasonable, market-based evaluation.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nBut I don't think anyone in this body anticipated these dramatic and \nvery devastating increases.\n  I believe we absolutely need to do something to send a message that \nwe in this body are listening to the middle class. We are listening to \nthe middle class. When every person who runs for office--in their \ncampaign, I bet there isn't one person in this body who didn't say: I \nam there to help protect the middle class. This is our opportunity, in \na bipartisan way, to step up and protect the middle class and to tell \npeople that grasp of home ownership, that piece of the American dream \nis within their reach, and it is within their reach because we aren't \ndoing devastating things here in Washington, DC.\n  I thank my great friend from Louisiana. As a new Member, I preside \nfrequently on the floor of the Senate, and I think that if there has \nbeen a canary on this issue, that early bellwether whom we look to and \nwho said we are going to have problems, it was Senator Mary Landrieu, \nwho alerted this body from the very beginning, who knew these increases \nwere coming and so ably advanced her leadership on this issue. I \napplaud her for that. I applaud Senator Menendez and Senator Schumer \nand so many people on the other side who have worked with us to try to \ndevelop a bill that truly has bipartisan support. I urge this body to \nsend a very important holiday present, a Christmas present to the \nmiddle class of America by passing this reform bill, by delaying these \nincreases and making that dream of home ownership possible in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor her very kind and very generous comments. She underestimates her \nown tremendous leadership skills. Arriving here as a new Member, she \njumped right into this issue. She didn't need a lot of prep work. She \nunderstands her State. She understands basements, which we don't have \nin Louisiana because if we dig down even a few inches, we will hit \nwater. So I had to become very well educated by my good friends, the \nSenators from New York, New Jersey, and North Dakota, about true \nbasements. It just goes to show that when we work together, we can come \nup with good legislation that can really help our people, give them \nrelief, being in partnership with them, helping them to keep and \nstrengthen the equity in their homes and businesses as well as do right \nby the taxpayer. So I thank the Senator very much for her kind \ncomments.\n  I wish to through the Chair recognize the Senator from New York, who \nhas been an absolutely outstanding advocate for the people of the east \ncoast--particularly New York but the entire east coast in the aftermath \nof Sandy. It was so helpful to that region to bring them the relief \nthey needed, which has worked, and I understand it is still going on \nand we have to do more. But if we don't fix this flood insurance issue, \nwhich, in fact, was a manmade disaster, it is going to make the natural \ndisaster of Sandy that much worse.\n  I wish to ask Senator Schumer if he has any comments to add to what \nhas already been said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to assure my colleagues \nthat they don't have to be wearing a blue jacket to be supportive of \nthis legislation, as the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from \nLouisiana, and I happen to be wearing this afternoon.\n  Second, I thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana. What my \nfriend from North Dakota said is exactly right. She has been the Paul \nRevere of this issue, running up and down the aisles of the Senate, if \nyou will, letting people know--``flood insurance increases are coming; \nflood insurance increases are coming''--because she saw it in her home \nState. She has been a great leader, and I hope we will pass the measure \nshe has helped so importantly to craft when it is offered a little \nlater by my colleague from New Jersey.\n  I wish to say to her that she is exactly right about Sandy. We have \nfamilies who were devastated by Sandy. They struggled to rebuild their \nhomes. Then, all of a sudden, because of remapping and because of \nchanges in the flood insurance law, they are hit with a flood insurance \nbill of $800, $900, $1,000. Let's make no mistake about it. These are \nnot wealthy people. Lots of people in New York State who live along the \nwater in Long Island and Queens and Brooklyn and Staten Island are \nworking-class and middle-class people. Their homes are modest. Their \njobs are modest. They can't afford $9,000 a year. For those who were \ntold: Yours isn't going to rise, but when you sell your home it will, \nnow they can't sell their homes.\n  There are some things that make the rest of the Nation scratch their \nheads in wonderment, saying: What the heck is going on in Washington, \nDC? There are too many things, and one of them is flood insurance. How \ncan we demand that average, middle-class people pay up to, in some \ncases, $25,000 or $30,000 a year for a policy that is capped at \n$250,000? How can we have so many homeowners have to pay $5,000, \n$8,000, $10,000 when they can ill afford it? We cannot do that. That is \nwhy this legislation is so important. It is just wrong.\n  When we wrote the original Sandy bill, we put in an affordability \nprovision, and there was supposed to be a study about how people could \nafford the insurance before any increases were put into effect. That \ndid not happen.\n  I have to say, the people at FEMA are good people, but they do not \nunderstand affordability. They are not measuring affordability. They \nare not paying attention to affordability.\n  What is the job of Congress? One of our jobs--when an agency does not \ndo what it is supposed to do--is for us to correct it and oversee it, \nand that is what has happened with FEMA and flood insurance.\n  So we call for a delay until an affordability study is done, until we \ncan figure out a new way to avoid average folks, middle-class folks, \nfrom being forced to either not have flood insurance, abandon their \nhomes, or not sell their homes when they desperately need to do so.\n  FEMA is saying: If we do not charge these people, the program will \nnot be solvent. I will tell you something. If they continue to charge \nthese rates, no one is going to buy flood insurance. People will drop \nout of the flood insurance program, and it will be even less solvent. \nSo we have to come to a reasonable, thoughtful, and careful solution.\n  As the first two of us who have spoken have shown--and my colleagues \nfrom Louisiana, New Jersey, Florida, New Hampshire, who are all here to \ndiscuss this issue--this affects every part of the Nation. It does not \njust affect Florida, although they have hurricanes. It does not just \naffect Louisiana, although they have hurricanes and floods. It affects \nour great river basins--the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. It \naffects the west coast, where flash floods can be very, very dangerous. \nIt affects any place that is near water, which is most of America.\n  We have so many issues. The maps that are drawn are way off base. I \nhave areas in my State that are 5 miles from water and have never been \nflooded and are included in flood insurance. FEMA actually did not even \nmeasure the flood plains in Nassau County and imposed Suffolk County's \nflood plain. We had to force them to go back and start over.\n  There is so much wrong with the way the program is now existing that \nit must be put on hold so we can come up with something better than \nFEMA is doing.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support us. We have bipartisan support. \nThe Senator from Georgia has been a great advocate. Others have been \ngreat advocates on the other side of the aisle. If you say to yourself: \nI am going to object because this is not affecting my State, believe \nme, it will. As FEMA draws maps in State after State across the \ncountry, the very same thing that is now afflicting North Dakota, \nLouisiana, New York, Florida, and New Jersey will afflict your State. \nYou will be coming back to us 2 years from now saying: Hey, let's move \nthat legislation.\n  Let's avoid that problem. Let's do what we have to do. Put this on \nhold, go back to the drawing board, and create a FEMA program that both \nworks and is affordable. I believe we can, if this Senate and this \nHouse will give us the chance.\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, before the Senator from New York departs, \nI want to say this is a real-life example. In Pinellas County, FL, \nwhich is the county that houses Saint Petersburg and Clearwater, a \ncurrent flood insurance premium for a homeowner: $4,000. A new flood \ninsurance premium--10 times as much--$44,000.\n  Do you think that homeowner can afford that? Do you think that \nhomeowner can now sell their house since that is the flood insurance \npremium that is facing a potential buyer? And, of course, the real \nestate market dries up.\n  So it is a question of affordability, and I merely underscore what \nthe Senator has already said and what the great Senator from Louisiana \nis going to talk about; that is, that you have a pause, you get FEMA to \ndo an affordability study, and then you phase this in over time.\n  It just so happens that 40 percent of these policies are in my State \nof Florida. We have more coastline than any other State, save for \nAlaska, and they are not afflicted by the same things we are, and they \ndo not have a population of 20 million people. Lo and behold, our \npeople are hurting, and we have to give them relief.\n  So I beg anybody in the Senate: Please, when this unanimous consent \nrequest comes up, we have to have this relief for our homeowners and \nfor the real estate market.\n  The maps are a different question, and eventually we need to address \nthe issue of the maps because they are obviously drawing some areas \nthat are not flood prone. They are well above the flood stage, and \nsomehow these maps have gotten misaligned. We can address that. But \nright now we have to address the affordability question.\n  This is no fooling time, and I beg the Senate to let this legislation \ngo by unanimous consent. I am anxious to have my colleagues make their \nstatements.\n  Mr. President, I am chairing the Aging Committee hearing right now. I \nlook forward to the Senator from Massachusetts joining us after her \nstatement.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in deference to my colleague, who I \nunderstand may object--and although I have a statement--let me first \nprecede it by making this request. As in legislative session, I ask \nunanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the banking \ncommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1610, the \nHomeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013, and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that an amendment, which is at the desk, \nmaking technical changes to the bill, be agreed to; that no other \namendments be in order to the bill; that there be up to 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided between proponents and opponents of the bill; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third \ntime and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; finally, \nthe vote on passage be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the ranking member \nof the banking committee. This bill has not been through the committee \nprocess and would undo the important rate reforms to the National Flood \nInsurance Program that were put in place in the most recent flood \nreform bill to address the program's $25 billion debt to the taxpayer. \nWe must ensure that all Members have the opportunity to understand and \nweigh in on the changes being made by this action. This unanimous \nconsent request would bypass this important step in the legislative \nprocess, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have to say, I am disappointed to hear \nan objection because this is a bipartisan effort that is being pursued \nin the Senate and the majority leader has been very gracious to offer \nus time to debate and vote on an important proposal. I am sure we will \nbe back here again to try to achieve that. This is not a Republican \nbill or a Democratic bill. It is not a Republican or Democratic \npriority. It is a commonsense measure that has broad bipartisan \nsupport--exactly the type of support and cooperation the American \npeople are yearning to see from their elected officials. More \nimportantly, this legislation is critical to the lives of hundreds of \nthousands homeowners, and we should not simply let Senate procedure get \nin the way of finding solutions.\n  Let me just briefly speak in support of S. 1610, which is the \nHomeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act that we just asked consent \nto bring to the floor. It is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of \nlegislation that would help people afford flood insurance so they can \nstay in their homes and businesses can stay open--all the while \npreventing property values from plummeting.\n  At a time when there is far too little bipartisan cooperation, this \nbill stands as a notable exception. It currently is cosponsored by 23 \nof my colleagues, including 7 Republicans, representing States from all \ncorners of the country.\n  It is supported by the National Association of Realtors, the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders, the American Bankers Association, and the \nIndependent Community Bankers Association.\n  You have heard from several of my colleagues who have spoken to this \nissue--and there are others, such as Senator Warren and my fellow \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker, who I am proud to say has \nchosen this bill as the first piece of legislation to cosponsor in what \nI am sure will be a long and illustrious career in the Senate.\n  The reason for that broad support is because flood insurance is not \njust a coastal or Northeast issue, it is an issue that affects the \nentire country. Every State in the Nation has properties covered by the \nNational Flood Insurance Program, and every State in the Nation will \nsee premiums on some of these properties increase as a result of \nBiggert-Waters.\n  Some of these increases will be modest. Others are going to be \nprohibitively expensive and act as a de facto eviction notice for \nhomeowners who have lived in their homes and played by the rules their \nentire lives. We certainly know this because we are already hearing \nfrom our constituents, and many more of our colleagues are hearing the \nsame desperate cries from across the country, and many more will hear \nthem as flood insurance maps get outlined by FEMA under the \nlegislation, as renewals come up, and all of a sudden they are going to \nhear an outcry from their homeowners, who are going to say: This \nultimately creates a set of circumstances for me where I am going to \nlose my home.\n  The value of their homes will be dramatically reduced. Their ability \nto sell it will be dramatically altered, and they will, in essence, \nhave taken what they have worked a lifetime to achieve and have it \nbecome a human catastrophe--made by the Congress.\n  This is going to drive property values down. The housing market is \nstill struggling to recover, and we all know that declining property \nvalues have a domino effect, causing neighborhood properties to decline \nin value, which, in turn, hurts the broader economy.\n  We need to understand the impact that these dramatic changes in \nBiggert-Waters will have on the housing market before it is too late. \nWe need to understand the impact these rate reforms will have on \nprogram participation, which is already dismally low. In fact, recent \nreports suggest that only about 18 percent of properties in flood zones \nparticipate in the program. If rates are raised too high and too \nquickly, people will simply opt to drop their insurance, decreasing \nparticipation, and the risk pool in the National Flood Insurance \nProgram will ultimately feel the consequences.\n  One study has shown that for every 10-percent increase in premiums, \nprogram participation decreases by approximately 2.6 percent; and the \nsharper the increases, the higher the proportion of dropouts.\n  As with any flood insurance fund, the smaller the risk pool, the \ngreater the risk. So increasing rates could have the\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nunintended consequences of actually making the program less solvent.\n  Reduced program participation would also increase the amount \ntaxpayers are on the hook for in disaster assistance payments. Since \nFEMA grants, SBA loans, and other disaster assistance are reserved for \nunmet needs, more uninsured homeowners mean more disaster assistance \npayouts.\n  We should be incentivizing people to purchase insurance so they have \nskin in the game and they will be motivated to take proactive \nmitigation measures--not pricing them out of insurance so they are \nforced to rely on taxpayer-funded disaster assistance.\n  There is no question that we need to reform the National Flood \nInsurance Program in order to put it on a long-term path towards \nsolvency and sustainability. But, unfortunately, Biggert-Waters forces \nchanges that are far too large and far too fast. It requires FEMA to \nincrease rates dramatically, even before FEMA knows the scope of these \nchanges or how they will impact program participation.\n  Think about that for a second. We are making dramatic changes in \npolicy which could impact more than 5.5 million policyholders and have \nripple effects throughout the housing market in our entire economy \nbefore we even know the extent of these changes or their impact.\n  I have heard from countless New Jerseyans, many who have come to me \nin tears, who are facing this predicament. These are hardworking \nmiddle-class families who played by the rules, purchased flood \ninsurance responsibly, and are now being priced out of their home.\n  That is why we collectively introduced the Homeowners Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act that would impose a moratorium on the phaseout of \nsubsidies and grandfathers included in Biggert-Waters for most primary \nresidences until FEMA completes the study--that I offered as an \namendment that was included in the legislation--completes the \naffordability study that was mandated in the law and proposes a \nregulatory framework to address the issues found in the study.\n  So we are going ahead with all of these actions and all of these \nincreases without--without--knowing the consequences of that study.\n  It would also require FEMA to certify in writing that it has \nimplemented a flood mapping approach that utilizes sound scientific and \nengineering methodologies before certain rate reforms are implemented. \nWe saw this in New Jersey where, in fact, large swaths of communities \nwere put in what we call the V zone, which is the most consequential \nzone in the opening maps. But when we pressed FEMA and brought \ninformation to them, those universes were dramatically reduced.\n  The difference between being in that V zone and not can mean the \ndifference between being able to continue to own your home or not. So \nwe believe that this legislation is critical.\n  Why do we come and ask unanimous consent? Why do we ask unanimous \nconsent? Why did we ask unanimous consent? Why will we continue to ask \nunanimous consent? Because there is an urgency of ``now.'' If we do not \nact, and we go out of session and we come back next year, unless we get \nto this early on and make it retroactive, we are going to see the \nconsequences of this take place across the landscape of this country. \nThat is why we have Members from coast to coast; that is why we have \nMembers from the South; that is why we have Members from the Midwest \nwho all understand the consequences of not acting. That is why we have \ntaken the unusual step, on a bipartisan basis, to ask for that \nunanimous consent request.\n  For any property sales that occur during this period, the homebuyer \nwould continue to receive the same treatment as the previous owner of \nthe property unless they trigger another provision in Biggert-Waters \nnot covered by my bill.\n  For prospective homebuyers, the certainty that they will not see \ntheir rate dramatically increase simply because they purchased a home \nis critically important to maintaining property values.\n  Also, this new legislation would give FEMA more flexibility to \ncomplete the affordability study.\n  It would reimburse qualifying homeowners for successful appeals of \nerroneous flood map determinations.\n  It would give communities fair credit for locally funded flood \nprotection systems.\n  It would continue the fair treatment afforded to communities with \nfloodproof basement exemptions.\n  It would provide for a FEMA ombudsman to advocate for and provide \ninformation to policyholders.\n  Just as important as what this bill would do, it is also important to \nnote what this bill would not do.\n  This legislation would not stop the phase out of taxpayer funded \nsubsidies for vacation homes and properties that have been repetitively \nflooded. It would not encourage new construction in environmentally \nsensitive or flood-prone areas. And it would not stop most of the \nimportant reforms included in Biggert-Waters.\n  This legislation simply provides temporary relief to a targeted group \nof property owners who played by the rules and are now poised to see \ntheir most valuable asset become worthless, all through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  This bill does not include everything I wanted and I know there were \nmany other ideas that other cosponsors wanted to include. But in order \nto reach a true consensus, we limited the provisions in this bill to \nthose that had broad, bipartisan support. That is why we are here \ntoday--Democrats and Republicans--calling for debate and a vote on this \nvital piece of legislation.\n  I must say I am very disappointed to hear objection from the other \nside of the aisle.\n  My friend the majority leader has been very gracious to offer us time \nto debate and vote on this important proposal and we will be back here \nday after day to try to do that.\n  Because as I said before, this is not a Republican bill or a Democrat \nbill--it is not a Republican priority or a Democrat priority. It is a \ncommonsense measure that has broad bipartisan support, exactly the type \nof support and cooperation the American people are yearning to see from \ntheir elected officials.\n  More importantly, this legislation is critical to the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of homeowners. We should not let arguments about \nSenate procedure get in the way of finding solutions to their problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are several other Members. Senator \nMenendez is the leader of our efforts. He and Senator Isakson have \njoined and have put together an extraordinary coalition. I would like \nto read the names into the Record because it is a testimony. In a place \nthat cannot get three Members to agree on anything, we have over 20 \nMembers who agree to change the Biggert-Waters law. I want to read this \ninto the Record and then ask through the Chair for the Senator from \nMassachusetts--both Senators are here--the senior Senator to be \nrecognized for just a moment and then the junior Senator to speak on \nthis issue.\n  But Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson are our leads--again, New \nJersey and Georgia. They are two very different States but have very \nsimilar challenges. They have people--middle-class families, small \nbusiness owners--who have poured their life savings into homes and \nbusinesses, only to be destroyed by a piece of legislation that had \ngreat intentions but disastrous results. We do not have a lot of time \nto fix this. We need to do this before this body leaves, which is next \nweek.\n  Myself, Senator Cochran, Senator Merkley, Senator Vitter, Senator \nHoeven, Senator Scott from South Carolina, Senator Wicker, Senator \nHeitkamp from North Dakota, Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Markey, Senator Warren, Senator Nelson from Florida, Senator \nBegich from Alaska, Senator Manchin from West Virginia.\n  There is no ocean anywhere near West Virginia, but they have many \nmiddle-class families who are getting caught up in a quagmire here. \nThis bill is the only bill that can release them and save taxpayers \nmoney. Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nBooker, Senator Graham--who is also on the floor--and our newest \ncosponsor today, Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska.\n  This is a very unusual coalition. I have been here a long time now. I \nhave hardly seen a coalition this broad and diverse. So clearly we have \nsomething meaningful to say that needs change.\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nPlease let us not let procedures and pride, bad tempers, keep us from \ndoing what we know we need to do for our people.\n  I thank Senator Warren who has been a tremendous help to us in \nputting this bill together, and might I add that it costs nothing. \nThere is no score on this bill. So to anyone that could object because \nit costs the taxpayers: Nada. It does not cost anything. It is a zero \nscore. We have done it that way to be respectful of all of the \ndifferent opinions. But it will help to give us relief.\n  Through the Chair I would like to ask Senator Warren to add her \nterrific voice and perspective on how it is affecting Massachusetts, \none of our most important States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in urging \nsupport for S. 1610, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of \n2013. This is a bipartisan bill that will help homeowners across our \ncountry who are getting hit with the newly revised flood maps and \nincreased flood insurance premiums.\n  I am very pleased to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncall for this commonsense delay which gives FEMA time to get this \nright. I thank Senator Menendez who has been a tremendous leader, \nSenator Isakson, Senator Landrieu, who has gotten in there and gotten \nus all mobilized, Senator Cochran, many others of the cosponsors of \nthis bill for their leadership and their commitment to work on this \nimportant issue.\n  I also thank my partner in all things, Senator Markey, for the work \nhe has done on this bill and for giving me the chance to speak first \nhere so we could get going. Families purchase flood insurance to \nprevent the loss of their homes. But now many families fear that the \nprice of flood insurance could be just as devastating as any storm. You \ncannot protect someone's home by pricing them out of it. Yet that is \nexactly what is taking place around the country. Congress changed the \nNational Flood Insurance Program to move toward a more market-based \nsystem that more accurately reflected the true cost and risks of flood \ndamage.\n  This is a well-intentioned bill, but, unfortunately, homeowners are \nbeing blindsided by high rate increases and new flood zone maps. Many \nfamilies are learning for the first time from news reports and letters \nthat their mortgage companies are sending that they must purchase flood \ninsurance. This is simply not an acceptable way of informing the public \nthat flood insurance bills are skyrocketing.\n  When FEMA released these flood maps this year and last, they knew \nthey were placing hundreds of thousands of homeowners into a flood zone \nfor the very first time. It is critical that these maps be spot on and \ncorrect. But many people do not trust many of the new changes, and \ntheir concerns are growing by the day. In fact, a recent independent \nreview conducted by coastal scientists at the behest of my colleague, \nCongressman Bill Keating, concluded that FEMA used outdated wave \nmethodology better suited for the Pacific coast when they drafted new \nflood maps for Massachusetts.\n  They believe this resulted in FEMA overpredicting the flooding that \ncould occur from once-in-a-century storms for much of our State. We \nneed to pass this bill to give the government the time it needs to make \nsure that the maps are accurate, reliable, and reflect the best \navailable scientific data.\n  We also need to make sure that hard-working families who play by the \nrules can afford these policies. The Homeowners Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act that I have proudly cosponsored will provide relief \nto homeowners who built to code and were later remapped into a higher \nrisk area.\n  Furthermore, this critical bill will delay rate increases until FEMA \ncompletes the affordability study that was mandated by the Biggert-\nWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act, and until subsequent affordability \nguidelines are enacted.\n  Homeowners are facing flood insurance premium increases that can cost \n$500, $1,000, even more per month. Most hard-working families and \nseniors do not have that kind of extra money on hand to spend on flood \ninsurance premiums they never knew they were going to need.\n  FEMA has a lot of work to do.\n  In the meantime, these families should not be hit with high costs \nwhen they challenge the flood map and win their appeal. Our bill will \nhelp address this injustice and will allow FEMA to utilize the National \nFlood Insurance Fund to reimburse people who successfully appeal a map \ndetermination. It also gives FEMA the added financial incentive to get \nthose maps right the first time.\n  I am pleased to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this \ncall for a commonsense delay which will give FEMA time to get this \nright. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this much needed relief \nfor homeowners. I thank Senator Markey for his leadership. I thank \nSenator Landrieu for her amazing leadership, and I thank all of my \ncolleagues who are ready to move on something that is common sense and \nvery much needed by families across this country.\n  I yield for my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Markey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator for her leadership. She and I have \nmet with people all across the State of Massachusetts who are fearful \nof the impact that this can have upon their ability to live in their \nown homes, to sell their homes, to continue to operate their \nbusinesses, to sell their businesses.\n  This is a fundamental issue for our State. Senator Warren and I bring \nthis concern to the floor even as we know that it is a concern that is \nfelt all across the country. It is Louisiana. It is New Jersey. It is \nSouth Carolina. It is West Virginia. It is the coastlines of our \ncountry. Yes, it is.\n  The warmer the climate becomes, the warmer the oceans become; the \nwarmer the oceans, the higher the tides; the more devastating the \nstorms, the more changes that take place in terms of the impact on the \nhomes, the businesses, all along the coastline.\n  But climate change does not only affect the coastal areas. It is \naffecting our whole country--the whole planet. There is a huge change \nwhich is taking place. That is why we are out here. We are out here \nbecause of climate change. The storm that hit New Jersey, Hurricane \nSandy, was devastating. We saw the courage of the people of New Jersey \nand New York in responding to that storm. But just with a couple of \nchanges in the direction of that storm, it could have wiped out \neverywhere from Cape Cod up to Newburyport, Maine, and New Hampshire.\n  But for a small change in that storm, it could have been down in \nDelaware, Virginia, wiping out that coastline. But for the grace of God \ngo the States that we represent. The same thing is true all across the \ncountry.\n  We know that the pollution we pump into the sky heats the water and \nthe air. It gives storms more power. We know this scientifically. With \nmore powerful and more frequent storms, we realize that this tragedy is \nlapping right at the doors of every citizen. We have to do something to \nprevent it from becoming worse.\n  But at the same time, we also have to realize that these families are \ninnocent victims. They did not have anything to do with the policies \nthat did not deal with climate change for a generation, that ignored \nthe science. They are now dealing with the consequences of a failure to \ndeal with that issue. We cannot allow the failure to act to be borne by \nthose who are the least able to afford it.\n  That is what is happening. It is going to be innocent Americans who \nnow have to suffer because we did not have the political will to deal \nwith this issue of climate change.\n  I have heard, along with Senator Warren, from people all over my \nState. I have one business that relocated several years ago thinking \nthat was going to satisfy the need to protect against climate change, \nagainst the change in the flood plain. Now, under the new plan, they \nwill have to move the business again.\n  It is unsustainable long term for any businesses, any family to think \nabout living in these kinds of areas unless we begin to think through \nhow we are going to adjust to this law that is on the books which will \nhave an almost immediate impact upon families all over our country.\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n  We need to fix the flood insurance provisions that would have \ndevastating economic impacts on our coastal communities. That is why I \nam proud to support the legislation of the Senator from Louisiana, the \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, Senator Menendez, Senator \nMerkley, and everyone who has worked on this issue.\n  We have to ensure that we address the issue of affordability for \nthese homeowners, affordability for these businesses in terms of the \nincrease of the flood insurance rate caused by the new flood maps and \nensure that we put that before any crippling flood insurance rate \nincreases.\n  We have to deal with affordability first. If affordability is not \ngoing to be dealt with, then there is going to be a devastation that is \nfelt by millions of homeowners and businesses across this country.\n  Climate change is real. It is here. It is dangerous, but the fear of \nrising floodwaters should not be compounded by the fear of an \nunaffordable spike in insurance premiums for homeowners and businesses \nacross this country.\n  I thank my colleagues for all their work on this issue. It is an \nindispensable part of the business of this Congress this year to pass \nthis legislation. We must find a way to work together before we leave \nin order to pass this legislation.\n  I call upon all of my colleagues to work together with us. This is as \nbipartisan as it gets in the Senate. We have to find a way.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Louisiana for all of her great work.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the Senator from South Carolina on the floor to \nspeak, but I wish to give some concluding remarks in this very \nimportant hour about this very important issue. We are down to the \nwire, and we do not have any time left to provide relief to homeowners \nand business owners all over this country.\n  About 1 hour ago there was an objection registered from the \nRepublican ranking member of the banking committee. I have a great deal \nof respect for that particular Member. I hope he will consider the \ntragic ramifications of his objection for millions of homeowners and \nbusinesses around the country and work with us over the next few days \nto mitigate any of his objections so we can move this bill to the floor \nand provide 2 hours of debate. We will accept, those of us in our \ncoalition, a 60-vote threshold.\n  Let me remind colleagues that a hearing was held in the banking \ncommittee by Senator Merkley, who chairs the subcommittee. This bill \nhas been discussed for hours and hours in committee, in public. There \nare hundreds of stakeholder groups led by, I am very proud to say, GNO, \nInc., Greater New Orleans, Inc., a very broad coalition of business \nowners and parish residents. They reached out across the country, down \nthe coast, the gulf coast, to the east coast, to the west coast, North \nCarolina, to the good Senator on the floor from South Carolina, \nreaching out in areas in the Midwest and up in the Northwest.\n  The reason they did that is because there are new flood maps going \ninto effect in all of these places. I call attention to the diagram of \nflood maps in the United States. In purple, these were the flood maps \nthat were in effect as of July 2012. In the green, these are proposed \nflood maps that have been introduced. We can see how many green \ndesignations there are.\n  In the gold color, there are new flood maps possible. There is no \nState that is going to escape these new flood maps. As Senator \nElizabeth Warren said, they are inaccurate. They don't have the \ncapability, the finances, the resources to produce--or the technology, \nin some cases--accurate flood maps. There have been a record number of \nmistakes made that we have provided for from the public testimony.\n  In addition, I wish to show a map of where levees are. There are many \nlevees. I was surprised, myself, having become an expert on levees, I \nthought. No, I am not the expert I thought I was because I did not \nrealize how many levees there were in other States. I have been so \nfocused on mine that broke in 52 places and almost destroyed a great \ninternational American city, New Orleans. We are on the mouth of the \nMississippi River, and I am well aware of the levee system that was one \nof the great engineering feats ever in the world, on the planet. It \nkeeps the Mississippi River in its channel so we can have the great \ncommerce we have had that helped build this great Nation. I am well \naware of the great story about that.\n  I was not aware of the tremendous flooding risk in California, in \nArizona, in New Mexico, and in Montana, of all places. I knew about \nArkansas, Illinois, and St. Louis because of the Mississippi River up \nto Minneapolis.\n  Look at Pennsylvania. I was shocked to see so many flooding areas in \nthe State of Pennsylvania.\n  I wish to say it is not only a coastal issue, it is a national issue. \nWe are the national Congress. These rates are going up now and it needs \nto be fixed now.\n  I hope the Republican opposition will think clearly about their \nobjection, the ramifications it will have, and find a way to say yes--\nfind a way to say yes.\n  The bill that Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson are offering costs \nzero. It helps millions of people and ultimately will make the program \nfiscally sound.\n  As the Senator from New York said so eloquently and so accurately: If \nyou price people out of the program, there will be no one to support \nthe program. The program will default, taxpayers will still have to \npick up the debt associated with that program, and then we will also \nhave millions of people losing their homes and their businesses. It \nmakes no sense. It makes no financial sense.\n  I am not going to speak too much longer, but I do wish to state I am \nvery happy, as an American, there are many newspapers we can read. \nThere are many blogs, a lot of radio shows, and all sorts of different \nopinions. We have to read a lot, think a lot, and get different views \nto find the truth.\n  I am going to read the first paragraph of the Wall Street Journal \nbecause they need to listen to a couple of other bloggers or writers \nbecause they are way off base. The Wall Street Journal said last week: \n``Federal flood insurance is a classic example of powerful government \naiding the powerful, encouraging the affluent to build mansions near \nthe shore.''\n  That statement is so inaccurate it is laughable.\n  The people I represent in Louisiana--we hardly have a beach. I don't \nknow if anyone has visited Louisiana. We don't have beaches. We have \nmarshes. No one I know who lives in New Orleans or Baton Rouge is \nanywhere near a beach. I am going to read a letter from a very affluent \nand powerful person:\n\n       I am a 66-year-old woman and have lived in the same house \n     in Broadmoor since 1974.\n\n  I knew this neighborhood when the letter arrived at my desk because \nthat is the neighborhood where I grew up and still reside. There is not \na beach within miles of Broadmoor.\n  She continues:\n\n       I lived there with my family, raised a son who also lives \n     and owns a house in Broadmoor--\n\n  It is a very middle-class neighborhood that we come from.\n  Continuing:\n\n       --and plan to stay in my home for the remainder of my life. \n     I live on a very strict budget and have just this month \n     received my first Social Security payment. If something is \n     not done to change the law that will potentially raise my \n     flood insurance by the thousands, it will not be possible for \n     me to keep my home nor sell it.\n\n  I wish to have the Wall Street Journal editorial board hear this. \nThis is not a millionaire mansion on a beach. This is a 66-year-old \nwoman who just received her first Social Security check. If this law is \nnot changed by the 100 Members of this body in the next few days, she \ncan either stay in her house or sell her house.\n  Please do not lecture to us from some high place in some big \ncorporate office about Senators on the floor of the Senate trying to \nfight for powerful interests for people in mansions who live on fancy \nbeaches. That is not what this bill is about.\n  I have hundreds of pictures. If the Wall Street Journal or any \nnewspaper wants to editorialize about this, please check my Web site, \n``My Home Story.'' I have hundreds of pictures and other Senators have \nhundreds of pictures. I don't see a mansion.\n  All I see are cries of people who say: Wait a minute. My house has \nnever\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nflooded. I live in a simple neighborhood. I am a simple person. I am an \nAmerican who works hard, and you are running me out of my home.\n  The bill that passed, Biggert-Waters, was well intentioned but \ndrafted inappropriately and has some very pernicious guidelines or \nrules in it that can only be changed by Congress. Some people wish to \nthink that FEMA can wave a magic wand and make it work. FEMA cannot \nwave a magic wand. We have to do our job as Senators. I hope the Senate \nwill do its job.\n  We cannot agree on everything that needs to be fixed, I understand. \nThere are many arguments about other things that some people think need \nto be fixed and others don't. But I don't know of anyone nor have I \nheard anyone on the floor give us one good, solid reason that the \nMenendez bill shouldn't pass, such as: I don't like section 1, I don't \nlike section 2, I don't like section 10, maybe section 5--not one. It \nis all posturing.\n  Please let us get over the posturing and help people who live nowhere \nnear a beach, who are going to lose their homes and need us to act. I \nbelieve we can do it. As I said, we have great Republican leadership \nand great Democratic leadership.\n  In closing, the Senator on the floor has my great respect. Also, \nSenator Isakson, who is the lead Republican Senator, is known in this \nbody as an expert on real estate and finance. He is very clear in his \nappreciation and understanding that the real estate market is going to \nbe shaken to its core, as well as homebuilders and community bankers \nwho are holding mortgages on these 5 million properties.\n  We have come too far. We have come too far in restoring this housing \nmarket. This bill was well intentioned but poorly drafted, stuck into a \nconference committee report at the last minute, not with as much \noversight as we should have given. We can fix it. Let's do this.\n  I thank the Senator for being so generous. It is a very important \nissue. I am prepared to stay here for as long as it takes before \nChristmas--even, I hate to say, up to Christmas Eve, as I wish to get \nhome for a little bit of time, but this needs to be fixed before we \nleave for Christmas.\n  The House can come back in January, take up this bill, and we can \nsend it to the President's desk early in February, make it retroactive, \nand give people relief. This is not about helping out powerful \ninterests and millionaires on the beach. This is about helping many \nAmericans who have done nothing wrong and everything right. They have \nbeen in their homes since the 1960s, 1950s, in some cases from the \n1800s, and are going to be priced out of their home. Their equity will \nbe stolen from them by a poorly drafted piece of legislation.\n  We can do better and we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination of \nCornelia Pillard for the DC Circuit.\n  My colleagues, I have enjoyed my time in the Senate very much, \nalthough we live in a very difficult time. Politically, there are a lot \nof influences on individual Senators and parties and the body as a \nwhole, so these are very difficult times. I can only imagine writing \nthe Constitution today. I always thought that would be a good \n``Saturday Night Live'' skit: Go back to Philadelphia hall and have all \nthe satellite trucks parked outside and the bloggers and talk radio, \nmoveon.org--fill in the blank--all putting pressure on our Founding \nFathers not to do this or that. We live in different times.\n  It is absolutely good that people have a voice and influence and \ncreate organizations to advocate their cause. There seems to be an \norganization for almost every aspect of the economy. So lobbying the \ngovernment, having a say about legislation, trying to push your \nrepresentatives to do something you think is good for the country is \nvery much a part of democracy, but eventually we have to govern.\n  Democracy is a journey, sort of like when you are on vacation or you \nare driving to a place with your kids and they always ask: Are we there \nyet? But democracy is not an end state, it is a process. Democracy is \nreally about protecting losers, not so much winners. Winners tend to do \nwell in any system. Democracy protects the loser by having a rule of \nlaw, a process that says: If you lose the election or you are in the \nminority in a body, there will be rules there to give you a voice.\n  One of the problems in the Mideast and throughout the world is that \npeople are afraid to lose. In the Mideast it is a winner-take-all \nenvironment. The reason there are so many militias is that people don't \ntrust the police or the government to be fair to their sect or their \ntribe, so they arm themselves, believing that if they don't take care \nof themselves, nobody else will. But that just leads to an endless \nstate of conflict.\n  So democracy is really a process, and it is designed to ensure that \nlosers in a democratic process will still have basic rights. You can \nlose the election and not get fired. It is illegal to fire somebody \nbecause they are in the opposite party, unless it is a political job \nwhere one expects that to happen. You don't lose your right to speak up \nbecause you lost the election.\n  When you find yourself in the minority in politics, it is important \nthat you have a say. It is also important that the majority has the \nability, having won the election, to do certain things--to run the \nplace, for lack of better words.\n  The Senate is an unusual body in traditional democracy. \nParliamentarian systems are different from what we have set up. You \nhave two houses in most places, such as the House of Lords. I don't \nknow what power it has, but it is not too great. The parliamentary \nsystem is where you have to form coalitions. At the end of the day it \nis a completely different setup than we have here, where the party in \ncharge, if they can form a big enough coalition, can basically just run \nthe place.\n  The House is a winner-take-all body. If you are in the majority in \nthe House, you can decide what bills to bring to the floor, what \namendments will be allowed on those bills, and how long to debate those \nbills. You have an almost absolute dictatorial ability to run the \nHouse. You determine everything. The minority has some say but not a \nwhole lot. The House is sort of gang warfare. I have been there and \nlove the institution. You will find that majorities will be fighting \namong themselves a lot in the House because that is where the action is \nin the House.\n  I have been in the House, and I have been in the Senate. I loved \nbeing in the House, and I understood the way the rules worked--that if \nyou were in the minority, what came to the floor was determined by the \nmajority, what amendments were in order was determined by the majority, \nand that is just the way it was.\n  When I was in the House, we would pass one measure after another that \nwould go to the Senate and never be heard from again, and that was \nfrustrating. But the older you get, you sort of realize maybe some of \nthe things you wanted were not in the best interest of the country as a \nwhole. And the fact that you knew that if it went to the Senate there \nwould be a filtering process, unlike in the House, became somewhat \nreassuring over time.\n  House majorities are more partisan, generally speaking. They are \ninfluenced by 2-year election cycles. It is a more passionate body \nbecause you are always up for election and the winner takes all. And \nwhen you win in the House, the people who got you there expect you to \ndo things consistent with your party's agenda. Nothing wrong with that.\n  In the Senate there has been a conscious effort to put some brakes on \nthat kind of governing. When you send a bill to the Senate, you still, \nto this day, have to get 60 votes to bring the legislation to the floor \nand to get cloture, and the minority has the ability to say not only \nwhether they want the bill to come to the floor, with a certain amount \nof amendments, but then they can negotiate with our friends in the \nmajority to get the amendments we want and to allow the legislation to \ncome forward. There are probably a lot of times when Republicans in the \nHouse voted understanding that this idea wouldn't make it through the \nSenate and that was probably OK.\n  Here is what I feel. A lot of my colleagues have talked about Ms. \nPillard, the nominee, being a radical judge and\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nbeing out of the mainstream. I don't want to get into that. All I can \nsay is that my view of a Presidential appointment is for the Senate to \nprovide advice and consent--constitutionally required--but to recognize \nthat the President won the election and the Senate has the advise and \nconsent powers, not the House.\n  I have found myself in all kinds of judge fights since I have been \nhere. I was a lawyer before I was a politician. I love the law. What I \nlove about the law is that, in theory, it is a place where the poorest \nguy, the most unpopular person can still get a fair shake. Of course, \nthat wouldn't happen in a political environment. It is a place where \nthe richest guy or gal in town doesn't have to pay because they can \nafford to, only because they have a legal responsibility to. I love the \nidea of an independent judiciary, a jury of one's peers, protecting \npeople's interests in a way politics never could.\n  I would argue that the strength of the rule of law in this country \nhas been our great saving grace. Elections happen all over the Mideast. \nSaddam Hussein got 90-some percent. We haven't been able to get there \nyet. I would argue that electing Saddam Hussein was a joke, that it is \nthe institutions of government that really do provide freedom for \npeople. An independent judiciary has been a Godsend to our country. It \nis not perfect by any means, but it was the courts that basically broke \nthe stronghold of segregation because politically it would have taken \nfar longer to get there.\n  At the end of the day, in Bush v. Gore, maybe one of Vice President \nGore's finest moments contributing to democracy was his acceptance of \nthe ruling of the court. He fought like crazy, he lost a national \nelection by a few hundred votes, all of his supporters are telling him \nthey did this here and they did that there, and the next thing you know \nthe Supreme Court rules 5 to 4, and he graciously accepted the \ndecision.\n\n  What has happened here is that the rules of the Senate have been \nchanged in a very dramatic way for the first time really in 200-some \nyears. Our colleagues on the other side decided that we would no longer \nrequire 60 votes to get a nomination to the floor or to approve a \njudge. Now it is majority rule--majority rule on judicial nominations, \nexcept Supreme Court and executive appointments.\n  A lot of average people might say: Well, they won the election; why \nisn't 51 enough? My response is this: I think we all understand the \nbenefits of being able to slow things down that come out of the House. \nAnd having to pick up some votes from the other side to get the 60 to \npass legislation has probably saved the country a lot of heartache in \nterms of emotional legislation coming through the House to the Senate \nthat would never make it into law. A lot of things I wanted have been \nkilled in the Senate, and a lot of things I hoped never would see the \nlight of day have died in the Senate. So it kind of works out.\n  When it comes to judges, I have tried very hard to make sure that \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents are treated fairly. I do not \nbelieve it is my job as a Senator from South Carolina to vote or block \nan appointment because I wouldn't have chosen that judge.\n  I remember during the Bush Presidency there was a wholesale \nfilibuster of Bush's judicial nominations, and we were thinking about \ndoing the nuclear option. But seven Democrats and seven Republicans \nsaid: Wait a minute. Unless there is an extraordinary circumstance, we \nshouldn't filibuster judges. An extraordinary circumstance really is \nabout qualifications or something unusual.\n  I can say to my Democratic colleagues that we have denied two \njudicial picks by not allowing cloture. If advise and consent means \nanything, it means that, on occasion, you can say no. So there have \nbeen only two.\n  As to the DC Circuit Court, this dispute about how many judges there \nshould be on the DC Circuit Court has been going on at least for a \ndecade--ever since I have been here. The Bush administration wanted to \nadd judges to the DC Circuit because that is the circuit all appeals go \nto when government regulation is challenged by somebody in the private \nsector, an individual or a business. If you want to sue about ObamaCare \nregulations or the detention policy or the NSA's programs, it goes to \nthe DC Circuit. So every President, quite frankly, would like to have \nan advantage there because it protects their administration's policies.\n  I guess what I would say is that changing the rules because we have \nsaid no to two picks--outside of the DC Circuit--was, quite frankly, \nirresponsible, and it is going to change the Senate forever.\n  As to the DC Circuit, no one can say this debate hasn't been going on \nbefore we all got here. Senator Grassley has been the most consistent \nguy in the world about the DC Circuit, even when Republicans were in \ncharge. There are more needs out there. These judges are fine people. \nThey could be put in the other spots where the need is greater.\n  But we are where we are. So our colleagues decided, after two--I \ndon't know how many have been approved, but two have been denied--\nenough is enough on the judge side, along with the attempt to grow the \ncourt in the DC Circuit.\n  We have had disputes about executive nominations. I remember \nAmbassador Bolton. And Mel Watt--really, honest to God, I like Mel. He \nis a great guy. I just don't think he is the right choice for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. And to my colleagues here, you are all wonderful \npeople, but there is not one person in the Senate whom I would pick for \nthat job because it has a very technical requirement to it.\n  So here we are.\n  Very quickly--and then I will turn it over to Senator Grassley--what \ndoes this matter in the long term? I think the first casualty of this \nrules change is going to be the judiciary itself, and here is what I \nmean by that. Now that we don't have to cross the aisle to pick up a \nfew votes to get to 60 when there is a disagreement--and these are very \nrare; we don't filibuster everybody; they are fairly rare--we are going \nto have more ideological-driven picks on judicial nominations because \nonce the filtering device of having to at least talk to the other side \nis removed, once that no longer exists, the pressure in the conference \nto pick the most ideologically pure, hardnosed, fire-breathing liberal \nor conservative is going to be immense.\n  So what my colleagues have done is they have changed the face of the \njudiciary probably forever. And shame on you. I think that is going to \nbe your legacy that will stand out long after all of us have gone \nbecause I don't see how you go back and put this genie in the bottle.\n  I think we are going to find that judicial selections in the future \nare going to be those whom the most rabid partisans are going to pick--\nthe most faithful to the cause, not the most faithful to the law.\n  I don't know what it is like on the Democratic side, but I can tell \nyou what it will be like on the Republican side.\n  There are a lot of people out there who have a list of judges they \nwant to see on the court--yesterday. Some of these people are going to \nbe tough for you to swallow, and I am sure you will do the same to us.\n  What you are doing is making the majority self-regulated. There is no \nlonger the excuse, for lack of a better word: I can't ``push'' this \nperson through because I have to get somebody in. Those who want to \nmake sure they are picking the best person who is not an ideologue, you \nare going to have a hard time of it.\n  I think the judiciary is the biggest casualty over time, only equal \nto the Senate itself. It will not be long--and I don't know how long it \nwill be--before the rules change for Supreme Court picks, because there \nwill be replacements of several members of the Supreme Court in the \nnext decade. That is just the way the life is. There will be opposition \nfrom the party out of power. There will be frustration. Somebody will \nbe blocked that makes the party in power mad and they are going to \nchange the rules. That is just going to happen. We are now about \noutcomes. We are not about process.\n  The Senate is slowly but surely becoming the House, where winner \ntakes all and ends justify the means: Anything you can do over there, \nwe will do over here. That is just the way it is going to be.\n  It will not be much longer until we have a Senate and a House and a \nWhite\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nHouse in one party--as happens every now and then--and there is going \nto be a centerpiece of legislation that has been the Holy Grail to that \nparty that is an absolute nightmare to the other side; it is going to \npass the House on a party-line vote, it is going to come to the Senate, \nand somebody is going to get frustrated and say: I have 51-plus votes. \nI may have 57 votes. I don't have 60. And they are going to change the \nrule on legislation because the pressure to do it, now that we have \ngone down this road, is going to be immense. I am by no means perfect. \nBut when this happened on our watch, I tried to find a way to avoid it. \nBut we are where we are.\n  Finally, about ObamaCare. Let me tell you from a Member of Congress \npoint of view something you should consider. All of us are Federal \nemployees and we get a subsidy for our health care premiums similar to \nevery other fellow employee. It is not a unique deal to Congress. If \nyou are a member of the Federal Government, you get up to 72 percent of \nyour premium subsidized. Other employers do that, but it is a darned \ngood deal that is available to all Federal employees.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Grassley. He said: If we are going to \nhave ObamaCare, we ought to be in it. We, the Congress, and our staffs. \nUnder the law that was passed--I think Senator Grassley was the \noriginator of this idea--Members of Congress and our staffs have to go \ninto the exchanges. But we have the ability to go into the District of \nColumbia exchange, and the law is written such--and every Member of \nCongress who takes this subsidy is entitled to do it. I don't blame \nthem one bit. You have to go into the exchange, and your premiums are \ngoing to go up, but the subsidy will continue.\n  Senator Vitter believes, and so do I, that because we are leaders we \nshould take the road less traveled and experience more pain than those \nwho follow. So I have been of the opinion that if you are going to \nchange this law, the Congress should not only go into the exchange, we \nshouldn't get a subsidy any longer. Why? Because most Americans are \ngoing to lose their employer-sponsored health care as it exists today--\nmaybe not in total but their premiums are going to go up dramatically \nbecause employers cannot afford to pay the increased premium under the \nold system. So they will either lose employer-sponsored health care and \nbecome an individual or they are going to have to pay more because \ntheir employer is in a bind and they can't afford the subsidies that \nonce existed--because premiums for employers, similar to individuals, \nare going to go through the roof.\n  I wish to give an example about what I have chosen to do. I have \nchosen not to go into the DC exchange but to enroll in South Carolina \nbecause that is where I live. Enrolling in the South Carolina exchange, \nI will not get a subsidy. That was my choice. I accept that choice. Why \nam I doing this? To try to lead by example what I think is coming to a \nlot of Americans in some form or another.\n  So here is what happens with me: Under the old system, I was paying \n$186 a month. If I went into the DC exchange, my premiums would go up \nbut not a huge amount. But now that I am enrolling as a 58-year-old \nshort White guy in South Carolina, my premiums are based on the county \nI live in and my age, with no subsidy, because I make too much money to \nget a subsidy. People at my income level don't deserve a subsidy \nbecause it would bankrupt the Nation more than we are already doing if \nwe did that.\n  Under ObamaCare in South Carolina, I chose the Bronze plan. Why? It \nis the cheapest one I could find. I am not independently wealthy. I \nmake a very good living as a Member of the Senate, almost $180,000, but \nat the end of the day here is what is coming my way:\n  My premium goes up to $572 a month from $186. That is $400 a month, \nalmost, a 200-percent increase.\n  Under my old health plan if I went to the doctor, I paid a $20 copay. \nUnder the new Bronze plan, I pay $50.\n  Under the old plan if I saw a specialist, it was $30. Under the new \nplan, it is $100.\n  My old deductible was $350 a year. My new deductible is $6,350--a \n$6,000 increase.\n  My old plan had a $5,000 out-of-pocket limit. The new one is $6,350.\n  You also get rated not just on your age but where you live. I am \npaying $70 a month more than a county that is 40 miles away.\n  The bottom line is that what I am experiencing a lot of other people \nare going to experience. I am paying a lot more for a lot less. How can \nthat be?\n  When you are told that you get more and you pay less and a politician \ntells you that, you ought to be very leery. That hasn't worked out in \nmy life: You are going to get a lot more, but you are going to pay \nless.\n  The reason these premiums are going up is that all the uninsured--and \nI want to provide coverage to the uninsured as much as anybody else--\nget insurance coverage with a subsidy. Who is paying those subsidies? \nThe rest of us.\n  So we are going to see next year employers having to back out of \nemployer-sponsored health care either in total or in part. What we are \ngoing to find throughout this country is that people who had employer-\nsponsored health care, just like the individual markets, their premiums \nare going to skyrocket--maybe not as much as mine, maybe not 200 \npercent. The deductibles are going to go up--maybe not as much as mine \nat $6,000, but everybody in the country doesn't make $176,000.\n  So every Member of Congress should look at what would your life be \nlike if you didn't have a Federal Government subsidy, if you didn't \nenroll in the DC exchange, if you went back home and had to pick a plan \nsimilar to everybody else in your State? You ought to sit down and look \nat what your individual life would be like. If you just look, you will \nbe shocked. I sure was.\n  This is not about me, even though I am giving you an example about \nmyself. It is about an idea called ObamaCare that is going to destroy \nhealth care as we know it in the name of saving it and making it \nbetter.\n  I think we all agree we need to reform health care. But I think most \nAmericans believe their old health care system was working pretty good \nfor them, but it could always be made better.\n  So I would ask every Member of Congress, whether you go into your \nState exchange, if one exists, or not, do the math. You are going to be \nshocked at how it would affect you. Let me tell you, it is going to \naffect people you represent in similar fashion.\n  So what do you do? Why don't we just try to sit down and start over \nand see if we can do better before it is too late?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there is a reason why the favorability \nrating of the Congress is somewhere, on a good day, around 10 percent. \nThe reason I think is pretty simple: The American people are hurting. \nThey look to their elected officials to try to do something to address \nthe problems they have and the crises facing our country. Time after \ntime, they see the Congress not only not responding to the needs they \nface but in many cases doing exactly the opposite. In poll after poll, \nthe American people tell us the most pressing issue they face deals \nwith the economy and high unemployment.\n  When we look in the newspapers, we are told the official unemployment \nrate is 7 percent. By the way, that is a rate which has in recent \nmonths gone down, and that is a good thing. But the truth is, if you \ninclude people who have given up looking for work and people who are \nworking part time when they want to work full time, real unemployment \nin this country is 13.2 percent. That is enormously high.\n  The unemployment rate for our young people is close to 20 percent, \nand there are parts of the country where it is higher than that. \nAfrican-American youth unemployment is close to 40 percent.\n  So what we are looking at all over this country are millions and \nmillions of people who want jobs, who want to work, and who can't find \nthose jobs. We are looking at a younger generation of workers who \ncannot get into the economy. If you are a young person and you leave \nhigh school, for example, and you can't get a job in your first year \nout there or your second year, if you think\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nthis does not have a cataclysmic impact on your confidence, on your \nself-esteem, you are very mistaken.\n  I fear very much and worry very much about the millions of young \npeople out there who are not in school, who are not working. \nTragically, many of those young people will end up on drugs. Some of \nthem are going to end up in jail. These are issues we have to consider.\n  What the American people tell us over and over is: Yes, the deficit \nis a serious problem. I believe it is. Everybody in the Congress \nbelieves it is. But what the American people also say is: High \nunemployment is an even more serious issue.\n  According to a March 2013 Gallup poll, 75 percent of the American \npeople, including 56 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of \nIndependents, and 93 percent of Democrats, support ``a Federal job \ncreation law that would spend government money for a program designed \nto create more than 1 million new jobs.''\n  What the American people are saying is, yes, we have made progress in \nthe last 4 years. We have cut the deficit in half. We have to do more. \nBut what the American people are saying loudly and clearly is that we \nneed to create jobs.\n  What they also understand, and poll after poll indicates this, is \nthat when we have an infrastructure that is crumbling--roads, bridges, \nwater systems, wastewater plants, our rail system--when we have an \ninfrastructure that is crumbling, we need to invest in rebuilding that \ninfrastructure. When we do that, we create significant numbers of jobs. \nThat is what the American people want us to do. When is the last time \nyou even heard that debate here on the floor of the Senate?\n  The unemployment crisis, the need to create jobs--that is what the \nAmerican people want us to do, and we are not even talking about that \nissue.\n  There is a second issue about which the American people are very \nclear. It is a funny thing--sometimes the media writes about how \npartisan the Congress is, how divisive the Congress is. Senator \nGrassley and I supposedly hate each other, we do not talk to each \nother, and all that nonsense. That is not the reality. The truth is \nthat among the American people, surprisingly enough, there is a lot of \nconsensus. I mentioned a moment ago that the American people very \nstrongly believe that we should invest in our infrastructure and create \njobs. Unfortunately, that is not what we are doing.\n  Here is another issue about which the American people are loud and \nclear. They understand that--tragically in today's economy--most of the \nnew jobs that are being created are not good-paying jobs. That is the \nsad reality. Most of the new jobs that are being created in today's \neconomy are low wage jobs and many of them are part-time jobs. If you \nare making $8 or $9 an hour and you are working 30 hours a week, you \nare going to have a very hard time supporting yourself, let alone a \nfamily.\n  What do the American people say? They say raise the minimum wage. \nRaise the minimum wage.\n  Let me quote from today's Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Americans strongly favor boosting the Federal minimum wage \n     to $10.10 an hour but oppose raising it above that, a Wall \n     Street Journal/NBC News poll finds. In the survey, 63 percent \n     supported a rise to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25 \n     rate.\n\n  Sixty-three percent of the American people support that. Democrats \nstrongly support it, Independents support it, and many Republicans \nsupport it. One would think, therefore, when the vast majority of the \nAmerican people understand that $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and \nthat we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour, we \nwould be moving on it. Maybe we would get a UC on it, a unanimous \nconsent. Let's get it done. I fear very much that right here in the \nSenate we are going to have a very difficult time gaining 60 votes. I \nhope I am wrong, I sincerely do, but I am not aware at this point that \nthere are any Republicans prepared to support an increase of the \nminimum wage to $10 an hour. I believe in the Republican-controlled \nHouse it would be extremely difficult to get legislation widely \nsupported by the American people through that body.\n  But not only will my Republican colleagues not do what the American \npeople want in terms of raising the minimum wage, quite incredibly, I \nhave to tell you that many of my Republican colleagues do not believe \nin the concept of the minimum wage. Many of them believe we should \nabolish the concept of the minimum wage, so that if you are in a \nsituation in a high-unemployment area where workers are desperate for \nwork and an employer says: Here is $4 an hour; take it or leave it, \nthat is OK for some of my Republican colleagues.\n  Again, we are in a situation where the vast majority of the American \npeople want to do something about low wages. They want to raise the \nminimum wage, and we are going to have a very difficult time getting \nthat legislation through. I hope I am wrong, but I do know that unless \nthe American people stand up, get on the phone, start calling their \nSenators and Members of Congress, we probably will not succeed in doing \nwhat the American people want.\n  Interestingly enough, what the American people also understand is \nthat raising the minimum wage will help us with the Federal deficit in \na variety of ways. It may be a surprise to some Americans to know that \nthe largest welfare recipient in the United States of America happens, \ncoincidentally, to be the wealthiest family in America. The Walton \nfamily, which owns Walmart, is worth about $100 billion. They are the \nwealthiest family in America. They own more wealth as one family than \nthe bottom 40 percent of the American people--extraordinary wealth. One \nof the reasons they are so wealthy is the American taxpayer subsidizes \nWalmart because Walmart pays low wages, provides minimal benefits, and \nmany of their workers end up on Medicaid, they end up on food stamps, \nand they end up in government-subsidized housing. I am not quite sure \nwhy the middle-class working families of this country have to subsidize \nthe Walton family because they pay wages that are inadequate for their \nworkers to live a dignified life.\n  My hope is that when the American people are loud and clear about the \nneed to raise the minimum wage, their Congress will respond, but I have \nto tell you that I have my doubts.\n  What we also hear--and most recently from Pope Francis--is an \nunderstanding that there is something profoundly wrong about a nation \nand increasingly a world in which so few have so much and so many have \nso little. In the United States of America today we have more wealth \nand income inequality than at any time since the late 1920s, and we \nhave more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on \nEarth. Today the top 1 percent of our population owns 38 percent of the \nwealth of America, financial wealth of this country, and the bottom 60 \npercent owns 2.3 percent. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the \nwealth of America, and the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. Is that \nreally what America is supposed to be about? I think not. I think Pope \nFrancis recently talked about that issue. He talked about the moral \naspects of that issue. He is exactly right.\n  Those are some of the issues we have to talk about.\n  Another issue out there that I think we have to be very clear about--\nand again the American people are extraordinarily clear about this--the \nAmerican people understand that Social Security has been probably the \nmost successful Federal program in the modern history of this country. \nFor the last 70-plus years it has kept seniors out of poverty. In fact, \nbefore Social Security 50 percent of seniors in this country lived in \npoverty. Today that number, while too high, is about 9.5 percent. That \nis a significant improvement. And Social Security, despite what is \ngoing on in the economy--in good times and bad times--has never once \nfailed to pay all of the benefits owed to every eligible American.\n\n  Today Social Security has a $2.7 trillion surplus. It can pay every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American for the next 20 years. Do you \nknow what the American people say about Social Security? They say it \nloudly and clearly. Republicans say it, Independents say it, and \nDemocrats say it. Do not cut Social Security. Do not cut Social \nSecurity. Yet I have to tell you that virtually all Republicans think \nwe should cut Social Security. Some Democrats believe we should cut \nSocial Security. The President of the United States has talked about a \nchained CPI--a very bad idea--about cutting Social Security.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n  Maybe we should listen to the American people and make it very clear: \nNo, we are not going to cut Social Security. In fact, we are going to \ntake a new look at Social Security and see how we can make it solvent \nnot just for 20 years but for 50 years and in addition to that increase \nbenefits. There are pretty easy ways to do that, including lifting the \ncap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security trust fund. As \nyou know, today, if somebody makes $100 million and somebody makes \n$113,000, they both contribute the same amount into the Social Security \ntrust fund. Lift that cap. You can start at $250,000, and you will \nsolve the Social Security solvency issue for the next 50 or 60 years. \nThat is exactly what we should do, and that is what the American people \nwant us to do.\n  In terms of Medicare, people say Medicare has financial problems, and \nit does. The issue--and interestingly enough, it gets back to what \nSenator Graham was talking about. He was talking about his health care \nplan in South Carolina. It sounds like a pretty bad plan to me, I agree \nwith him. What is the issue there? The issue we have to look at, which \nwe don't for obvious issues, is how does it happen that in the United \nStates of America--before the Affordable Care Act; things will change a \nlittle bit--before the Affordable Care Act, we have 48 million people \nwho are uninsured, we have tens of millions more people who have high \ndeductibles, like Senator Graham--a $6,000 deductible is \nincomprehensible--and high copayments. At the end of the day, 48 \nmillion people uninsured, high deductibles, high copayments, health \noutcomes that are not particularly good--better than some countries, \nworse than other countries--infant mortality worse, longevity worse, \nlife expectancy worse, yet we end up spending twice as much per person \non health care as any other nation. How does that happen? How do we \nspend so much and get so little value? Is that an issue we are prepared \nto discuss? I guess not because the private insure companies say: Don't \ntalk about that. We are making a whole lot of money out of the current \nhealth care system, including the Affordable Care Act. We make a lot of \nmoney, our CEOs do. Yes, we are spending 30 cents of every dollar on \nadministrative costs, on bureaucracy, on advertising. Don't touch that \nbecause that is the American health care system. I suggest we have to \ntake a hard look at what goes on in the rest of the world.\n  People have said we have the best health care system in the world. \nThat is not what the American people say. The polls I have seen show \nthat there is less satisfaction with our system than exists in other \ncountries around the world, for obvious reasons. We spend a lot. We get \nrelatively little.\n  Are we prepared as a Congress to stand up to the insurance companies? \nAre we prepared to stand up to the drug companies that charge us far \nhigher prices for prescription drugs than any other country on Earth? \nAre we prepared to stand up to the medical equipment suppliers?\n  I don't think so because that gets us into the issue of campaign \nfinance, where people get their money to run for office, because these \nguys contribute a whole lot of money.\n  Are we prepared to stand up to Wall Street? We have six financial \ninstitutions on Wall Street that have assets of over $9 trillion--\nequivalent to two-thirds of the GDP of the United States of America. \nThey write half of the mortgages in this country, two-thirds of the \ncredit cards. Do you think maybe it is time to break up these guys or \nare we going to march down the path of too big to fail and have to bail \nthem out again? Do you hear a whole lot of discussion about that, Mr. \nPresident? No, not too often.\n  Let me conclude. We had the president of the World Bank here \nyesterday talking about global warming. As I think most people know, \nthe entire--well, virtually the entire scientific community, people who \nstudy the issue of global warming, understands that the planet is \nwarming significantly, that it is already causing devastating problems, \nthat the issue is manmade, and that if we do not address this crisis by \ncutting greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from fossil fuels, the \nhabitability of this planet for our kids and our grandchildren will be \nvery much in question. That is what the scientific community says. Have \nyou heard any debate on this floor about how we are going to \naggressively transform our energy system? We do not do it.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. There is a reason the Congress has a \nfavorability rating of about 10 percent, and that is that the American \npeople are hurting and we are not responding to that pain. We are not \naddressing the many crises facing this country, and the American people \nare saying to Congress: What world do you live in? How about joining \nour world? How about changing your attention to our needs?\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in postcloture debate on the \nnominee for the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. I want to \nspeak on that nomination, but I am also going to take time to speak on \nissues dealing with the Defense Department, the farm bill, and the new \nnominee for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I will take a few minutes to discuss the President's ongoing scheme \nto stack the DC Circuit with committed ideologues so that the \nPresident's regulatory agenda doesn't run into judicial roadblocks.\n  Yesterday, the Senate confirmed the first of three nominees to the DC \nCircuit that the court does not need. Let me emphasize that: Does not \nneed. Of course, the Senate denied its consent on these nominees just a \nfew short weeks ago.\n  Some may ask: What has changed during that time? The vote count \ncertainly has not changed. It is not as if Democrats persuaded some of \ntheir Republicans colleagues to change their minds.\n  That is what you would expect in a body that operates based upon \nrules that guarantee the minority a voice. That is what you would \nexpect in what is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body on \nEarth. That is what you would expect under normal circumstances, but as \nI explained in an earlier speech this week on another nominee for the \nsame court, these are not normal circumstances.\n  No, today's circumstances are different.\n  Today the President's legislative agenda cannot get traction in \nCongress. And, no, it is not because Republicans will not negotiate \nwith the President. It is because the President of the United States is \nout of step with the American people.\n  Today the President's signature health care law, which was passed \nwithout a single Republican vote, is becoming more and more unpopular \nwith each passing day. And no, it is not because the administration has \nnot done a good job of ``messaging'' ObamaCare. It is precisely because \nof that message.\n  Today, the President can't get climate change legislation passed by \nCongress, and, no, it is not simply because of Republican opposition. \nIt is because the President's agenda is too extreme even for some \nSenate Democrats.\n  The President and his agenda are out of step with the American \npeople, and as a result, he cannot get his agenda adopted in this \nCongress. But that doesn't seem to matter to the radical liberal \ninterest groups who support these policy initiatives. They want \nresults--no matter what.\n  These liberal interest groups are not satisfied with constitutional \nseparation of powers. They want the President and his allies in the \nSenate to do whatever it takes to get the same results they would get \nif there were 535 Members of Congress just as liberal as the President.\n  Those interest groups want the President to legislate by executive \norder and by administrative action. They want the President to suspend \nthe law when it suits his purposes, just as the English kings used to \ndo. In fact, the reason our Constitution requires--and let me emphasize \nrequires--the President to ``faithfully'' execute the law is because \nthe English kings would unilaterally--and selectively--suspend laws \npassed by the parliament. But none of this matters to the liberal \ninterest groups. They want results--no matter what.\n  In fact, the President has made such a practice of legislating by \nExecutive Order and administrative action, that he has created the \nexpectation among\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nhis most faithful supporters that there is nothing he cannot do \nunilaterally.\n  Just a week or two ago, the President was delivering a speech in \nCalifornia when one of his own supporters interrupted and heckled him \nfor not issuing an executive order to stop all deportations.\n  The heckler shouted:\n\n       Use your executive order to halt deportations of 11.5 \n     million undocumented immigrants in this country. You have the \n     power to stop deportations right now.\n\n  The President responded:\n\n       Actually, I don't. We are a nation of laws.\n\n  I must say, I understand the confusion. The most extreme elements of \nthe President's supporters have witnessed him pick and choose which \nlaws he will faithfully execute and which he will suspend, or as the \nPresident likes to say, ``waive.'' So, it is no wonder that those \nsupporters would say: Just issue an executive order. We want results.\n  It is just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care that \nthere isn't support in the Congress to pass legislation imposing cap-\nand-trade fee increases. We want results\n  Just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care if \nDemocrats block judges to the DC Circuit based on the standards the \nRepublicans are applying today. That was then, this is now. We want \nresults.\n  Just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care about \ntwo centuries of Senate history and tradition that has been passed down \nfaithfully from one majority leader to the next. We want results.\n  Just like King George III.\n  Climate change regulations are too important. Salvaging ObamaCare is \ntoo important.\n  So as we all know, the majority buckled to the pressure from these \nextreme liberal interest groups and broke the rules of the Senate to \nchange the rules. They tossed aside two centuries of Senate history and \ntradition. This history and tradition--until 2 weeks ago--had been \ncarefully guarded and preserved by each succeeding majority leader.\n  Those leaders remembered the history of King George III.\n  They did all of this just so they could install the President's hand-\npicked judges, so they could hear challenges to his signature health \ncare law and to the rest of his regulatory agenda, such as climate \nchange regulation.\n  But when a President selects a nominee for the specific purpose of \nrubberstamping his agenda--an agenda that has proven too extreme for \neven Members of his own party--he needs a judge who can be counted upon \nto follow through.\n  Given that it is inappropriate to ask prospective nominees how they \nwould rule on particular cases, how would this White House make certain \nthat their nominees would follow through and rubberstamp the \nPresident's agenda?\n  Based upon Professor Pillard's record--and that is the nominee we \nwill be voting on tomorrow--apparently the White House looked out over \nacademia and selected the most liberal nominee they could find.\n  Because Professor Pillard fits that bill to a T.\n  I have heard my colleagues come to the floor and argue that these \nnominees to the DC Circuit are mainstream. Professor Pillard may be a \nfine person, but make no mistake about it, she is not mainstream. She \nis the furthest thing from it.\n  I am sure that the White House is confident she can be counted upon \nto rubberstamp its agenda, but don't confuse her views with the \nmainstream of American legal tradition. I have a sampling of things she \nhas written and said. I will read some of what she has written, and I \nthen ask you to determine if she is mainstream.\n  She has written this about abortion:\n\n       Casting reproductive rights in terms of equality holds \n     promise to recenter the debate towards the real stakes for \n     women (and men) of unwanted pregnancy and away from the \n     deceptive images of fetus-as-autonomous-being that the anti-\n     choice movement has popularized.\n\n  Think of ``deceptive images of fetus-as-autonomous-being.'' Is that \nmainstream?\n  She argued this about motherhood:\n\n       Reproductive rights, including the rights to contraception \n     and abortion, play a central role in freeing women from \n     historically routine conscription into maternity.\n\n  Now, think about that: ``historically routine constriction into \nmaternity.'' Is that mainstream?\n  She has also argued this about motherhood:\n\n       Antiabortion laws and other restraints on reproductive \n     freedom not only enforce women's incubation of unwanted \n     pregnancies, but also prescribe a ``vision of the woman's \n     role'' as mother and caretaker of children in a way that is \n     at odds with equal protection.\n\n  Is that in the mainstream?\n  What about her views on religious freedom? This really ought to shock \nyou. She argued that the Supreme Court case of Hosanna-Tabor \nEvangelical Lutheran Church, which challenged the so-called \n``ministerial exception'' to employment discrimination represented a \n``substantial threat to the American rule of law.''\n  The Supreme Court rejected her view 9 to 0. Nine to zero. And the \nCourt held that ``it is impermissible for the government to contradict \na church's determination of who can act as its ministers.''\n  Do my colleagues honestly believe that it is within the mainstream to \nargue that churches shouldn't be allowed to choose their own ministers? \nI don't think so.\n  I asked Professor Pillard about Hosanna-Tabor and religious freedom \nat her hearing. She testified this way:\n\n       And I have to admit, Senator Grassley . . . I really called \n     it wrong on that case. I did not predict that the Court would \n     rule as it did.\n\n  In other words, she tried to dodge the question by leaving the \ncommittee members with the impression that she had merely taken a stab \nat predicting the case's outcome and that she had gotten it wrong.\n  Of course, I wasn't troubled that Professor Pillard had wrongly \npredicted the outcome. I was troubled because she actually argued that \na ruling in favor of the church would represent a ``substantial threat \nto the American rule of law.''\n  I don't believe that there is a single Member of this body on either \nside of the aisle who would subscribe to that argument anymore than the \nnine justices of the Supreme Court did. If I am wrong about that, then \nI would like to hear the Senator explain how it is mainstream to argue \nthat granting our churches the latitude to choose their own ministers \nrepresents a ``substantial threat to the American rule of law.''\n  These are the so-called ``mainstream views'' the President wants to \ninstall on a court that will hear challenges to his most important \npriorities. Is it any wonder that the President apparently has high \nconfidence will Professor Pillard rubberstamp his agenda?\n  Before I close, let me make one final point.\n  Given the circumstances surrounding how these nominees were selected \nand nominated;\n  Given all three were nominated simultaneously for the purpose of \nchanging judicial outcomes and rubberstamping the President's agenda;\n  Given they were nominated and rammed through the process, without \nregard to the fact that there is not even enough work for them to do;\n  Given the President was originally denied consent under the Rules of \nthe Senate;\n  Given that the President and certain far-left liberal interest groups \nsuccessfully persuaded the majority of the Senate to cast aside two \ncenturies of Senate history and tradition in order to get them \nconfirmed;\n  And given the extremely liberal record I discussed;\n  If you were a litigant challenging the President, or one of his \nadministrative actions and you drew a panel comprised of Professor \nPillard, Millett, and Judge Wilkins, can you honestly say that you \nwould be confident you would get a fair shake?\n\n  Of course not.\n  And that, my colleagues, is a sad commentary on the damage the \nPresident and the Senate majority have inflicted not only on the Senate \nbut also on our judiciary and fundamental notions of the rule of law.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pillard nomination.\n\n\n                 How the Audit Process was Compromised\n\n  For several years, I have been trying to get the Defense Department \ninspector general to do its job, and I have had\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nseveral investigations, a lot of them implemented because of \ninformation that comes to me from whistleblowers. I will speak to that \npoint now and talk about two important audits bungled by the Department \nof Defense inspector general's office.\n  There is something very important I need to say right upfront. A \nbrandnew inspector general, Mr. Jon Rymer, is now in place. The events \nI am about to describe happened a few years ago, but none reflect on \nhis leadership which I hope will bring about a big change in the \ninspector general's office at the Department of Defense.\n  When faced with a frontal assault on its audit authority by the \ntarget of one of its audits, senior IG officials got a bad case of weak \nknees and caved under pressure. They trashed high-quality audit work \nthat was critical of a certified public accounting firm and its \nopinions. In doing this, they covered up reportable deficiencies, they \nallowed the audit target to run roughshod over sacred oversight \nprerogatives, without uttering one word of protest or asking one single \nquestion.\n  I am talking about audits of the financial statements produced by the \nDepartment's Central Accounting Office. This is what I refer to as \nDFAS, which stands for Defense Finance and Accounting Services. The \naudits were conducted by a CPA firm, but supposedly under the watchful \neye of the inspector general, or IG, but not really under his eye.\n  The story of the two bungled audits is told in an oversight report \nwhich I have now posted on my Web site.\n  While I received the first anonymous email on this matter in April of \n2012, my audit oversight work actually began more than 5 years ago. It \nwas triggered by a steady stream of tips from whistleblowers \ncomplaining about the quality of these audits. These reports then \ngrabbed my attention.\n  My colleagues may wonder why the Senator from Iowa is down in the \nweeds in such arcane issues. The reason is simple. It is the importance \nof audits.\n  Audits are probably the primary oversight tool for rooting out fraud \nand waste in the government. To protect the taxpayers, Congress needs \nto ensure that government audits are as good as they can be. They must \nproduce tangible results. They must be able to detect theft, waste, \nmismanagement, and then recommend corrective action.\n  With mounting pressure for serious belt-tightening under \nsequestration, audits have taken on an even greater importance. Audits \nshould help senior management separate the wheat from the chaff and \napply mandated cuts where they belong. Sequestration cuts should be \nguided by hard-hitting, rock-solid audits. Unfortunately, rock-solid \naudits produced by the inspector general's office are hard to come by, \nand that is the problem.\n  After evaluating hundreds of audits, I issued three oversight reports \nin the years 2010 and 2012. With a few notable exceptions, I found that \nthe inspector general's Audits were weak, ineffective, and wasteful--\nwasteful when we consider that we spend $100 million a year to produce \nthem. Poor leadership is part of the problem, but there is still \nanother driver; that is, the Department's broken accounting system. It \nallows fraud and waste to go undetected and unchecked. That is bad \nenough, but the lack of credible financial information makes it very \ndifficult to produce hard-hitting audits. Auditors are forced to do \naudit trail reconstruction work to connect the dots on the money trails \nand, of course, that is very labor intensive, very time-consuming work.\n  Although the Department continues to spend billions to fix the busted \naccounting system, I am sorry to say it is still not working right. The \nDepartment cannot pass the Chief Financial Officers Act audit test. It \nis unable to accurately report on how the taxpayers' money is spent as \nit is required to do each year under that law. By comparison, every \nother Federal agency has passed that test. Why not the Department of \nDefense?\n  So long as the accounting system is dysfunctional, audits will remain \nweak and ineffective and the probability of rooting out much fraud and \nwaste during sequestration is low--and then still continuing to waste \n$100 million that we spend on the inspector general's office.\n  While I am talking about the need for better audits, I would like to \noffer a word of encouragement to the Special Inspector General for \nAfghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko. He is the head of SIGAR, which \nis the name for the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan, or \nSIGAR, for short. SIGAR is cranking out aggressive, hard-hitting \naudits, and I commend SIGAR for doing that--setting a good example. The \naudits I am about to discuss, by contrast, deserve darts, not laurels.\n\n  I first came to the floor to speak on this subject on November 14, \n2012. At that point, I completed a preliminary review of seven red \nflags or potential problem areas that popped up on my radar screen. \nSince then, I have double-checked the facts. I have confirmed my \npreliminary observations. I did this by examining the official audit \nrecords known as work papers. So I will not walk the same ground again \ntonight. Instead, I will briefly summarize what I did, how I did it, \nwhat I found, why it is important, and offer some fixes for \nconsideration.\n  To conduct this investigation, I had to examine literally thousands \nof documents. I could not have done it without the help and guidance of \nCPA-qualified government auditors. Evidence uncovered in the work \npapers were validated with interviews and written inquiries with \nknowledgeable officials. Together, these tell the story of what \nhappened and of course it is not a pretty picture.\n  True, my report is nothing more than a snapshot in time, but if this \nsnapshot accurately reflects the work being produced by the IG audit \noffice, then we have big problems.\n  In a nutshell, this is what I found out: A CPA firm, Urbach Kahn & \nWerlin, which goes by UKW, had awarded an unblemished string of seven \nclean opinions on the central accounting agency's financial statements. \nThen the IG stepped in and took a 2-year snapshot for fiscal years 2008 \nand 2009. It was supposed to report on whether those statements and \nopinions met prescribed audit standards, but due to a series of ethical \nblunders, that job was never finished.\n  A third review was planned for 2010, but after the 2008-2009 fiasco, \nit was canceled, allowing DFAS--the Defense, Finance, and Accounting \nService--it allowed DFAS to rack up another string of clean opinions \nthrough last year. All together, this work probably costs the taxpayers \nin excess of $20 million.\n  The work performed by DFAS in 2008 and 2009 was substandard. The \noutside audit firm rubberstamped DFAS's flawed practices using \ndefective audit methods.\n  For its part, the inspector general was prepared to call foul on the \nCPA firm for substandard work but got sidetracked and then steamrolled \nby DFAS. The contract gave the IG preeminent oversight authority to \naccept or reject the firm's opinions. The whole purpose of the contract \nwas to position the auditors to make that determination. If the firm's \nopinions met prescribed standards, they would be endorsed. If not, the \nIG would issue a nonendorsement report.\n  On both the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 audits, the record clearly \nindicates the IG's audit team determined that the firm's opinions did \nnot meet prescribed standards. They did not merit endorsement. Though I \ncannot cite work papers to prove it, whistleblowers alleged that top \nmanagement ordered them to endorse the 2008 opinion with this caveat: \nIf known deficiencies were not corrected in the 2009 opinion, a \nnonendorsement was guaranteed. When the very same deficiencies popped \nup again--in other words, in 2009 as they did in 2008--the auditors \nprepared a hard-hitting nonendorsement report as promised. It was even \nsigned. The transmittal letter was ready to go out the door.\n  The nonendorsement decision had been communicated to DFAS via email \nin unmistakable terms. In line with that decision and contract \nrequirements, the IG took steps to cut off payment to the CPA firm \nbased on advice of the inspector general's legal counsel.\n  The next step was to issue the nonendorsement report. But this is \nwhere the inspector general chickened out. In a power vacuum, DFAS \nmoved swiftly to block the report with a blatant end-run maneuver to \nbypass independent oversight. So DFAS literally neutered independent \noversight by the inspector general with two bold moves: On the\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nsame day the IG's office notified DFAS in writing that a nonendorsement \nreport would be forthcoming, DFAS unilaterally and proudly declared \nthat it had earned a clean opinion and ordered that all disputed \ninvoices be paid. This was an act of out-and-out defiance.\n  Next, it kicked the IG off the contract. Yes, my colleagues heard me \nright. The agency being audited literally kicked the inspector \ngeneral--the oversight agency--clean off the oversight contract. In \nmaking this end-run maneuver, DFAS broke every rule in the audit book.\n  What happened was a frontal assault on the inspector general's \noversight authority. The frontal assault was mounted by the agency \nbeing subjected to the audit and by an agency whose financial reports \nwere found to be grossly deficient. In the face of such outright \ndefiance, I would like to think that any inspector general would have \nstood up to the offending agency and held its ground and protected and \ndefended its oversight prerogatives. That is the law--but not the \nDepartment of Defense inspector general.\n  Instead, the IG's knees buckled under pressure. The IG retreated \nbefore the onslaught. The IG caved and trashed the report. The IG \nrolled over and played possum, giving DFAS the green light to proceed \nfull speed ahead.\n  The IG accepted these blatant transgressions without expressing one \nword of criticism, without expressing one concern, without raising one \nsingle question.\n  Other than a lone hotline complaint that disappeared down a black \nhole, no protest was ever lodged, no corrective action was ever \nproposed, and obviously no corrective action ever taken.\n  The inspector general's silence appeared to signal total acquiescence \nto a series of actions that undermine the integrity of the audit \nprocess, which is the basis for ferreting out waste, fraud and \nmismanagement and illegal activity.\n  For a Senator who watches the watchdogs, what I see is a disgrace to \nthe entire inspector general community. The IG allowed DFAS to run \nroughshod over the contract, the IG Act, audit standards, and \nindependent oversight. The audit firm probably got paid for the work \nthat was never performed--payments that were alleged to be improper.\n  Instead of exposing poor practices and improper actions by both the \naccounting agency and the CPA firm, the Office of Inspector General \nallowed sacred principles to be trampled. It just kept quiet. It turned \na blind eye to what was going on. It hunkered down. It tried to cover \nits tracks.\n  Two misguided acts set the stage for the collapse of oversight of \nthese audits.\n  The problem began with the contract. At the insistence of the \nDepartment's chief financial officer and accounting agency, the IG \nagreed to a contractual arrangement that put DFAS--the target of the \naudit--in the driver's seat. This contract allegedly violated the IG \nAct and standing audit policy, according to the assistant IG who spoke \nout at that particular time.\n  To address this issue, a fragile waiver arrangement was crafted. It \nwas supposed to address the legal issues and protect the Office of \nInspector General's interests under the DFAS contract. All the parties \ninvolved agreed to abide by this questionable setup.\n  But being nothing more than an informal trust, it came unglued under \nthe pressure and controversy generated by the nonendorsement decision.\n  Even the Office of Inspector General legal counsel voiced grave \nconcerns about the fragile waiver arrangement. In his opinion, the \nterms of the contract ``transferred''--those words come from the Office \nof Legal Counsel--``transferred'' the Office of Inspector General \noversight function to DFAS, the very component whose financial data was \nbeing subjected to the oversight. In his words--meaning the Office of \nLegal Counsel's words--the contract terms will leave the Office of \nInspector General ``open to criticism on the Hill. . . . In two years \nsome Senator will yell at us [about this]. If I had known about the \narrangement,'' he said, ``I would have advised against it.''\n  Counsel's concerns were well-founded, and similar to a modern day \nNostradamus, this prediction has come to pass.\n  The second problem was a failure of leadership at the top. When the \ninspector general's auditors reached the conclusion that the CPA firm's \nopinions did not measure up to prescribed standards, the current deputy \nIG for audit drove the final nail into that coffin.\n  The official audit records make it crystal clear. The deputy IG gave \nthe fateful order: ``There will be no written report.'' This was a \nlethal blow. This is how the report got bottled up. True, it \ndisappeared from public view. It got buried, and DFAS was promised it \nwould never see the light of day; that is, until one of my \ninvestigators came along and dug it out of a pile of work papers. \nHere--for the benefit of my colleagues--here it is in my hand. I hold \nit up. It did not get buried like they thought it would get buried.\n  Once the deputy IG had smothered the report, DFAS knew it had the \ngreen light to bypass oversight with impunity.\n  All of this bungling could have harmful consequences.\n  First, compelling audit evidence, which undermined the credibility of \nthe financial statements prepared by the Department's flagship \naccounting agency, was shielded from public exposure. The suppression \nof that evidence has helped to immortalize the myth of DFAS's clean \nopinions. It is so bad now that the myth is an inside joke. It is \nlaughable, according to a former accountant. Here is what he said on \nthe record to McClatchy News on November 22, 2013:\n\n       When I was there, DFAS would brag about getting a clean \n     opinion. We accountants would just laugh out loud. Their \n     systems were so screwed up.\n\n  If the output of the Defense Department's flagship accounting agency, \nwhich disburses over $600 billion a year is, indeed, laughable, then \nPentagon money managers have another big problem. As that famous \nwhistleblower Ernie Fitzgerald liked to say: ``It's time to lock the \ndoors and call the law.''\n  Since the myth involves the reliability of data reported by the \nDepartment's central accounting agency, it has the potential of putting \nthe Secretary of Defense's audit readiness initiative in jeopardy. \nDFAS's apparent inability to accurately report on its own internal \nhousekeeping accounts for $1.5 billion--it is $1.5 billion that they \nhave--casts doubt on its ability to accurately report on the hundreds \nof billions DOD spends each year. If the Department's central \naccounting agency cannot earn a clean opinion, then who in the \nDepartment can?\n  Second, the integrity and independence of the inspector general's \naudit process may have been compromised. If the independence of the \naudit process was, in fact, compromised, as my report suggests, then \nthe Department's primary tool for rooting out waste and fraud could be \ndisabled--at least it was in these cases.\n  If that did indeed happen, then it probably happened with the \nknowledge and silent acquiesce of senior officials in the IG's office, \nthe institution that exists to root out fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  In simple terms, the watchdog appointed to expose waste--not only \nexpose but stop fraud and waste--may have been doing some of it himself \nor herself. If true, it clearly demonstrates a lack of commitment on \nthe part of senior management to exercise due diligence in performing \nits core mission.\n  Almost all of the key players allegedly responsible for the bungled \naudits still occupy top posts in the IG's audit office today. Surely, \nthese officials did not act alone. This was a concerted effort. \nAccording to recent news reports, other higher-ups were allegedly \ninvolved. Senior IG officials must bear primary responsibility for this \nunacceptable and inexplicable failure of oversight. They could have, in \nfact, stopped it.\n  To address and resolve these issues, I made four recommendations in a \nletter recently sent to Secretary Hagel and the new Inspector General \nRymer.\n  First, the Department of Defense CFO should pull the DFAS financial \nstatements for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and remove those audit \nopinions from official records.\n  Second, the OIG needs to undertake an independent audit of DFAS's \nfinancial statements for fiscal year 2012 and determine whether those \nstatements and the CPA firm's opinion meet prescribed audit standards. \nThe fiscal year\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n2012 beginning account balances must also be verified. In response to \nmy oversight, the inspector general has initiated what he called a \npostaudit review of DFAS's fiscal year 2012 financial statements. This \nis, in fact, a good move. But to ensure that it is done right this \ntime, I asked the U.S. GAO to watchdog the inspector general's work. I \nwant independent verification because last time there was none. This \nprocess will be completed next year.\n  Third, the inspector general should address and resolve any \nallegations of misconduct involving DFAS officials and make appropriate \nrecommendations for corrective action.\n  Fourth, I am referring unresolved concerns regarding the conduct of \nIG officials to the Integrity Committee of the Council of the \nInspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency for further review as \nprovided under the IG Reform Act of 2008.\n  What happened here is almost beyond comprehension.\n  All of it happened under the IG's watchful eye. All of it probably \nhappened with top-level knowledge. Most of it probably happened with \ntop-level approval. Some of it was probably allowed to happen through \ntacit approval or silent acquiescence. All of it was bad for the \nintegrity and independence of the audit process and the accuracy of \nfinancial information in the government's largest agency.\n  As I said a moment ago, the Department has a new IG, Jon Rymer. I \nhope he is a genuine junkyard dog who likes aggressive, hard-hitting \naudits. I hope Mr. Rymer will take a long, hard look at what happened \nand work with Secretary Hagel and others to find a good way to right \nthe wrongs and get audits back on track. I know he can do it, and I \nstand ready to help him in any way I can. I want Mr. Rymer to know my \ndoor is open to him.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about the farm bill, specifically about \nreforming payment limits for farm programs, something this Senate \nagreed to in a bipartisan way.\n  Beyond saving money, these reforms help ensure farm payments go to \nthose for whom they were originally intended, small- and medium-size \nfarms. In addition, the reforms include closing off loopholes so \nnonfarmers cannot game the system.\n  Supporters of the farm bill need to take a hard look at what \nchallenges were presented last year to getting a bill done. We need to \nforge ahead knowing some tough decisions need to be made.\n  There are more reforms we need to make in programs such as food \nstamps, and they are reforms that can cut down on waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the program but also safeguard assistance to the people who \nactually need it.\n  While I support closing loopholes in the food stamp program, I \nbelieve the farm bill should also close loopholes for farm programs \nthat are so absurd they are just so obvious.\n  As we move forward on finalizing a new farm bill, I wish to state \nclearly that sections 1603 and 1604 relating to the farm payments--\nwhich are in both the House farm bill and the Senate farm bill--should \nstay in that bill. There should be a ``do not stamp'' on those \nprovisions under negotiation now between the House and Senate. Most \nimportant, for House conferees, they should remember that these \nprovisions were put on the floor of the House of Representatives in an \namendment sponsored by Congressman Fortenberry of Nebraska, with an \noverwhelming vote in the House of Representatives. So this is a case of \nwhere the majorities of both bodies support these provisions. Yet they \nare under attack by House conferees.\n  These farm payment reforms strike a needed balance of recognizing the \nneed for a farm safety net, while making sure we have a defensible and \nresponsible safety net. In case there is any doubt, we do need a farm \nprogram safety net. For those who argue we do not need a safety net for \nfarmers, I argue they do not understand the dangers to a Nation which \ndoes not produce its own food.\n  For all the advances in modern agriculture, farmers are still subject \nto conditions out of their control. While farmers need a safety net, \nthere does come a point where a farmer gets big enough that he can \nweather tough times without as much assistance from the government. \nSomehow, though, over the years, there has developed this perverse \nscenario where big farmers are receiving the largest share of the farm \nprogram payments.\n  We now have the largest 10 percent of the farmers receiving 70 \npercent of those farm payments coming out of the Federal Treasury. \nThere is nothing wrong with farmers growing an operation bigger. But \nthe taxpayers should not be subsidizing large farming operations to \ngrow even larger, making it very difficult for young farmers to buy \nland or to rent land to get into the operation.\n  By having reasonable caps on the amount of farm program payments any \none farmer can receive, it helps ensure the program meets the intent of \nassisting small- and medium-sized farmers through tough times.\n  My payment reforms essentially say that we will help farmers up to \n250,000 per year, but then the government training wheels come off. \nThose new caps will also help encourage the next generation of rural \nAmericans to take up farming. I am approached time and again about how \nto help young people get into farming.\n  When large farmers are able to use farm program payments to drive up \nthe cost of land and rental rates, our farm programs end up hurting \nthose they are intended to help. It is simply good policy to have a \nhard cap on the amount a farmer or farm entity can receive in farm \nprogram payments.\n  While both bodies of Congress have decided to cap farm payments, crop \ninsurance is still available to large operations, no limits on \nindemnity. Section 1603 and 1604 which I authored and which Congressman \nFortenberry authored, in our current farm bill, set the overall payment \ncaps at $250,000 for a married couple.\n  In my home State of Iowa, many people say that is still too high. On \nthe other hand, other farmers in other parts of the country say it is \nway too low. But I recognize agriculture can look different around the \ncountry. So this is a compromise. Just as important, however, to \nsetting a hard cap on payments is closing loopholes that have allowed \nnonfarmers to game the farm program. The House and Senate farm bills \nalso end the ability of nonfarmers to abuse what is known as the \nactively engaged test. In essence, the law says one has to be actively \nengaged in farming to qualify for farm payments.\n  Is that not common sense? However, this has been exploited by people \nwho have virtually nothing to do with farming or with a farming \noperation and yet receive payments from the farm program. Not citing \nmyself, but the Government Accountability Office issued a report I \nreleased in October outlining how the current actively engaged \nregulations are so broad that they essentially are unenforceable. Those \ncomments came from the USDA employees who administer the program.\n  The report illustrated that one farming entity had 22 total members \nof which 16 were deemed contributing ``active personal management \nonly'' to the farm. What does ``active personal management only'' mean? \nThat means they are becoming eligible for farm programs because of one \nof the eight overly broad and unenforceable eligibility requirements \nthat currently exist. More simply put, they likely are not doing any \nlabor and are nothing more than a participant on paper to allow the \nentity to get more government payment.\n  Our Nation has over a $17 trillion debt. We cannot afford to simply \nlook the other way and let the people abuse the farm safety net. I \nmentioned earlier how we need to assess some of the challenging areas \nof farm policy as we look to pass a 5-year farm bill. Some tough \ndecisions need to be made.\n  However, my reforms to payment limits do not pose a tough decision. \nThey are common sense. They are necessary reforms that are included in \nboth the House and Senate versions of the farm bill. I wish to take \nthis opportunity to thank Senator Stabenow, the chairman of our Senate \ncommittee, for fighting for these Senate provisions. You see, these \nprovisions were part of the Senate bill, representing a majority of the \nSenate.\n  More important, these same provisions were added on the House floor \nby Congressman Fortenberry of Nebraska by an overwhelming majority. So \nSenator Stabenow has the high\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nmoral ground in conference with the House conferees in fighting for \npayment limitation. She represents a majority of the Senate; whereas, \nthe House conferees, in opposing her, represent a minority of the House \nof Representatives.\n\n\n                       Homeland Security Nominee\n\n  The last issue I am going to speak about, then I will yield the \nfloor, deals with the some correspondence I am trying to have with the \nnominee to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  On July 12, Secretary Napolitano announced she would be leaving the \nDepartment of Homeland Security after 4 years heading up one of the \nlargest departments of the Federal Government. On October 17, the Obama \nadministration announced it had finally found a replacement. The \nCommittee on Homeland Security moved quickly on Jeh Johnson's \nnomination, approving him by voice vote on November 20.\n  On November 15, before the committee approved him, I sent a letter to \nMr. Johnson, along with several colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. \nWe on the Judiciary Committee asked for his views on a number of \nimportant matters, including our Nation's immigration policies and the \nfair treatment of whistleblowers.\n  We asked if he would cooperate with us on oversight matters and work \nwith us to improve immigration policies going forward. Because the \nJudiciary Committee has primary responsibility on immigration matters, \nit is necessary for us to know any nominee's position on almost any \nissue. It has been nearly 1 month, and there has been no response to \nour letter and no indication that he might respond.\n  In fact, I would be surprised that any nominee would respond to \nCongress any more given the majority only needs a simple majority to \nvote for confirmation. Thanks to a rule change done unilaterally by the \nmajority, there will no longer be a proper vetting of executive branch \nnominees. The rule change essentially takes away the Senate's \nconstitutional role of advice and consent, thereby allowing nominees to \nignore Congress on issues of extreme importance such as immigration.\n  But I am still going to pursue these questions, even though we do not \nhave the leverage we used to have when a 60-vote majority was \nnecessary, because Congress has a responsibility to know how laws are \ngoing to be enforced by the President's a appointees. President Obama \npromised this would be the most transparent administration in history. \nYet getting answers from this President or his administration on \nlegitimate Congressional oversight has been like pulling teeth.\n  They have stonewalled Congress at every turn. Over the last 5 years, \nthe administration has gone around Congress and pushed the envelope \nwith their authority. He has ignored his constitutional duties to \nfaithfully execute the laws by picking and choosing which laws he wants \nto enforce. Congressional oversight, an important responsibility that \nholds the government accountable for its people has been nearly \nimpossible.\n  In other words, the checks and balances of government do not work the \nway the Constitution writers intended. Now it is going to get worse. \nThere will be more blatant disrespect for checks and balances than we \nhave ever seen. So I would like to take time to read some of the \nquestions--just some of the questions--that we asked Mr. Johnson. I \nthink these would be reasonable questions that any Secretary ought to \ntell us what he is going to do if he gets sworn into that office. I \nthink they underscore how important it is that we have answers before \nwe move forward on the nomination.\n  First and foremost, we asked Mr. Johnson about his commitment to \nuphold the laws on the books. We asked if he would continue the lawless \npolicies created by the former Secretary and her deputy. We asked about \nwhat he would do to improve the morale of immigration officials and \nagents who are concerned about their nonenforcement protocols. We want \nto know how he would strengthen cooperation between Federal and local \nlaw enforcement entities.\n  Secondly, we asked Mr. Johnson what he would do to improve border \nsecurity. We want to know what specific measures he will implement to \nensure that the Department will comply with the Secure Fence Act of \n2006. In 2010, Secretary Napolitano suspended our Nation's only \ncomprehensive border security measurements, known as the operational \ncontrol metric.\n  More than 3 years have passed and the Department of Homeland Security \nhas failed to replace that metric. Will Mr. Johnson then hold the \nDepartment accountable by regularly releasing a comprehensive border \nsecurity metric? Will he commit to achieving operational control of the \nborders as required by our law? We do not know that. We would expect \nhim to answer that he is going to enforce the laws. But will he? Will \nhe answer?\n  Individuals who overstay their visas account for about 40 percent of \nthe undocumented population of this country. This presents a national \nsecurity risk. Without a biometric exit system, this country will have \nno clue who remains on our soil undocumented. Will Mr. Johnson make it \na priority to finally implement the entry-exit system Congress mandated \nin 1996, still not being enforced?\n  Third, we asked about the culture of the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service. In January 2012, a Department of Homeland Security \ninspector general released a report criticizing the USCIS for \npressuring its employees to rubberstamp applications for immigration \nbenefits.\n  In that report, nearly 25 percent of the USCIS officers surveyed said \nsupervisors had pressured them to improve applications that should have \nbeen denied. We want to know if he will take measures to better screen \napplicants and do away with the get-to-yes philosophy. That get-to-yes \nphilosophy is a gigantic risk to our national security.\n  Just look at the EB-5 Program which allows foreign nationals to \nobtain green cards if they invest in the United States. We asked \nwhether he would make it a priority to improve that program. We asked \nMr. Johnson about his position on immigration reform, especially since \nthe bill passed the Senate, and the House could act, sending a bill to \nthe President.\n  We asked if people who are in the country illegally, in removal \nproceedings or subject to an order of removal, should be eligible for \nimmigration benefits, including legal status. We asked whether illegal \nimmigrants convicted of a felony or convicted of multiple misdemeanors \nshould be eligible for benefits, including legal status.\n  We want to know if gang members, drunk drivers, domestic abusers, and \nother criminals should be allowed to stay in the country. It is \nimportant for us to know from Mr. Johnson because the Senate bill \nprovides a way for those law breakers to gain citizenship. Mr. Johnson \nmay be responsible for implementing that.\n  Finally, we asked Mr. Johnson to comment on issues generally \nimpacting the Department. We asked if he would pledge to cooperate with \ncongressional oversight efforts and be responsive to all congressional \nrequests for information and do it in a timely manner. We asked that \nbecause we have received very little cooperation in the last 5 years \nfrom that Department. We asked if he believed whistleblowers who know \nof problems with matters of national security should be prevented from \nbringing that information to Congress. We asked if he would commit to \nensuring that every whistleblower is treated fairly and that those who \nretaliate against whistleblowers would be held accountable.\n  No matter what department one manages, the answers to these questions \nare very important and should be simple to answer. We need a Secretary \nwho is well versed on these issues. We need a Secretary who will \nimplement policies that truly protect the homeland. We need cooperation \nand transparency. We need answers. In other words, what is wrong to \nexpect answers to these questions I just related before we give advice \nand consent to this nomination?\n  Majority Leader Reid has indicated through his cloture motion on Mr. \nJohnson that answers to these critically important issues are not \nwarranted.\n  Senators cannot consent to just anyone to head this department. We \nshould not fail in our constitutional responsibility of advise and \nconsent.\n  This body should not move forward with this nomination, and I \nencourage my colleagues to consider these issues when the cloture vote \nripens.\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m., Thursday, December \n12, all postcloture time on the Pillard nomination be considered \nexpired and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the Pillard \nnomination; that upon disposition of the Pillard nomination, the \nmandatory quorum required under rule XXII be waived with respect to the \ncloture motion on the Feldblum nomination and the Senate proceed to \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Feldblum nomination; that \nif cloture is invoked on the Feldblum nomination, all postcloture time \nbe yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nFeldblum nomination; finally, that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object, and I wish to state the reason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be allowed to \nspeak for whatever time he feels appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The reason I object for the minority to moving these \nvotes is we should follow what regular order we have left on \nnominations, especially after the way the majority changed the rules on \nnominations 2 weeks ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. My friend, the senior distinguished Senator from Iowa, that \nis what we are talking about here, the face of obstruction--not him, \nbut the Republican caucus, stalling for no reason other than to stall \nfor time.\n  No wonder the rules were changed. No wonder the American people look \nat the Senate as a dysfunctional body. A couple of weeks ago we voted \nto make it a functional body so that nominations can be confirmed for \nany President. The President deserves to have his team.\n  We have been wasting days, weeks, and months on nominations. We have \nscores of people and positions that need to be filled. We are only \ndealing with a handful. People understand the rules. We have changed \nthe rules the last couple of Congresses--very little--but we have \nchanged them.\n  If we have a Supreme Court Justice or a Cabinet officer or someone of \nthat level, they get 30 hours of time following the cloture vote. What \nare they supposed to do during that 30 hours? Come and explain their \nposition why they oppose a person.\n  For virtually every one of these nominations there hasn't been a \nsingle, single complaint about any of them. This culminated by virtue \nof the Republicans in the Senate making a decision that people who \nserve in the prestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals were not entitled \nto have a full court. There are eight there now, and they said that is \nenough. That is, some say, the most important court in America; some \nsay more important than the Supreme Court.\n  The Republicans arbitrarily have said we are not going to fill those \nspots, not only because of qualifications, not because of their \neducation, their experience or their integrity, only because they don't \nwant them filled. That is a new low.\n  I am disappointed to have to inform the Presiding Officer and all \nSenators tonight that because Republicans are wasting time, all of this \nstaff, police officers--and some of them are getting paid over time--\nwill have to work. Why? Because the Republicans are wanting to waste \nmore of this body's time and this country's time. No wonder the \nAmerican people feel about the Senate as they do. For 5 years the \nobstruction that has taken place is unprecedented.\n  We are going to continue to work tonight and remain in session as \nlong as we need to. Republicans are forcing us to waste this week on \nnominees they know will be confirmed. Every one of them will be \nconfirmed.\n  There are no objections to the qualifications of these nominees, with \none exception, and there are only little squeaks here and there about \nwhat could be wrong. But the outcome of each vote we will take over the \nnext 4 days is a foregone conclusion. Yet the Republicans insist on \nwasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. There is no reason \nthese votes couldn't take place right now or in the morning, and we \ncould move to some important items.\n  I have Senators come to me all the time--the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee was here a few minutes ago, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Vermont. He has some important work \nhe wants to move on this floor. They have passed some things in the \nHouse--and that doesn't happen very often, but they passed it. They \nsent it over, and it deals with veterans.\n  He wants to bring that to the floor, have a debate, and offer an \namendment. We can't do that because we are wasting time in the Senate \non this senselessness.\n  The junior Senator from the State of Delaware has spent weeks and \nweeks on manufacturing, which has shown some promise in America the \nlast few years. Jobs are being created. Working on a bipartisan basis \nwith other Senators, they have legislation they want to bring to the \nfloor to talk about ways of improving manufacturing, capabilities, and \ncapacity in the United States.\n  We can't do that. We are here postcloture looking at each other and \ndoing basically nothing, as we have done for vast amounts of time \nbecause of Republican obstructionism.\n\n  I had a meeting with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the junior Senator from the State of Rhode Island a few \nminutes ago. In the world today we have something called climate \nchange. It is here. Climate is changing all over the world. We have \nglobal warming.\n  Are we doing anything legislatively to address that? No, nothing. She \nhas a portfolio of legislation that she would like to take care of.\n  There is going to be zero done because we are sitting under these \nlights complaining about the Republicans wasting time. We could finish \nthese votes now, but we are going to work into the weekend.\n  We had a break for Thanksgiving. It was very pleasant for me to be \nhome for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, I had a death in the family that put a \nreal cloud over things, and that is an understatement.\n  Christmas is coming. Everyone should know that we are going to work \nuntil we finish the items we have before us this week. I am going to \nfile on a number of other nominees as soon as I get a chance, and we \nare going to finish those. If we have to work the weekend before \nChristmas, we are going to do that. If we have to work the Monday \nbefore Christmas, we are going to do that. If we have to work through \nChristmas, we are going to do that. I know the game they are playing. \nThey have done it before. A lot of nominations they will ask to be sent \nback to the administration, and they will have to start all over again. \nWe are not going to start all over again.\n  We need a director of the Internal Revenue Service. I think that is a \nvery good idea. We need to fill Chairman Bernanke's spot as chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve. That would be very important for us to do with all \nthe problems we have financially.\n  We are going to do that before we leave. If it means we have to work \nthrough Christmas, we will work through Christmas.\n  Even if we are spending a lot of time--as we have done over the last \n5 years because of their obstructionism--looking at the lights, and \nthat is about all we have to look at because we are not looking at \nsubstantive legislation as we should be, the only impediment to holding \nvotes without delay in reasonable hours is blatant, partisan Republican \nobstructionism.\n  It is pointless spending an entire week wasting time and waiting for \na\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nvote. This is a foregone conclusion that is going to happen to every \none of these votes. This is exactly the kind of blatant obstructionism \nand delay that has ground the Senate to a halt and prevented Congress \nfrom doing the work of the people over the last 5 years.\n  I remind Members that without cooperation there will be rollcall \nvotes, perhaps after midnight tonight, and as early as 5:30 in the \nmorning. With only a little cooperation, Senators can stop wasting time \nand resources.\n  The only way the Senate can stop wasting time is if we get some \nreasonableness and clarity from the Republicans. If there were ever an \nexample why the rules had to be changed and how we tried during two \nsuccessive Congresses to be reasonable--remember the exercise? Judges \nwould only be opposed under extraordinary circumstances. There isn't a \nsingle judge that the President of the United States has nominated who \nhas problems that are extraordinary. I think what is going on is a \nshame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. I came to speak to a bipartisan bill which I hope to take \na few minutes to talk about, but first I wish to comment on what is \nhappening or not happening on the floor and the comments of the \nmajority leader.\n  I have been a Senator for only 3 years, as the Presiding Officer well \nknows. We were sworn in as a group of those elected to the class of \n2010. I just came from an inspiring event where the Vice President, who \npreviously held this seat on behalf of Delaware, gave an award to the \nformer majority leader, a real patriot, a veteran, former Senator Bob \nDole. They talked about how compromise, principled compromise, made it \npossible for Senator McGovern and Senator Dole, folks from opposite \nends of the political spectrum, to work together in the interests of \nhungry children in the United States.\n  Frankly, what I have seen in the 3 years that I have been in the \nSenate, the 3 years that we have served together on the Judiciary \nCommittee, has been a slow walk.\n  There are minority rights in this body, but there are also minority \nresponsibilities. There are majority rights but also majority \nresponsibilities.\n  I wish to add to the comments of the majority leader that the \nnominees to serve on the DC Circuit, the nominees to many district \ncourt seats, whose confirmations I have either presided over or \nattended, were not objected to on substantive grounds. I have trouble \nwith the idea that the three empty seats on the DC Circuit do not need \nto be filled.\n  I have listened at great length to the arguments about caseload and \nabout workload. As the chair of the courts subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, I presided over the presentation of the Judicial \nConference's report on where we need additional judgeships and where we \ndon't.\n  I will note briefly and in passing that Judge Tymkovich, who \npresented this report, did not suggest there was some need to reduce \nthe DC Circuit by eliminating these currently vacant spots.\n  We could go through this chapter and verse. This has been debated to \ndeath on this floor. In my view, we have three excellent, qualified \ncandidates. I regret that we have spent so much time burning the clock \nand that we have had to make changes that ultimately will make it \npossible for qualified nominees to be confirmed. It is, to me, a \nsubject of some deep concern that we cannot work better together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to move work forward.\n\n  If I might, I would like to move for a moment to an example of \nexactly the sort of bipartisan bill that we should be able to move to \nhere, that if there weren't this endless obstruction, if we weren't \nrunning out the clock on nothing, we might be able to get done \ntogether. This is an example of the sort of reaching across the aisle \nthat used to dominate this body when giants such as Dole and McGovern \nserved here but is no longer the case. They are no longer the daily \ndiet of this body. We are no longer reaching across the aisle and \nfinding ways to make our country more competitive, create more \nmanufacturing jobs in partnership with the private sector, and \nresponsibly reduce our deficit.\n  I was encouraged as a member of the budget conference committee that \nwe seemed to be moving toward enacting a significant--small in scale \nbut significant in its precedence--deal for the Budget Committee that \ncould allow us to go back to regular order for appropriations. But \nhere, as we waste hour after hour running out the clock to confirm \nnominees, I wonder. I wonder whether we are going to be able to take \nup, consider, and pass substantive legislation.\n\n\n                      Children's Advocacy Centers\n\n  If I might, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about why I \ninitially came to the floor today; that is, to talk about the power of \nchildren's advocacy centers. Children's advocacy centers exist across \nthe country today in large part because this Congress, on a bipartisan \nbasis, passed back in 1990 the Victims of Child Abuse Act--a bill that \nfor the first time authorized funding for an important nationwide \nnetwork of what are called children's advocacy centers. These centers \nhelp deliver justice, they help heal victims of violence and abuse, and \nwe must act to continue empowering their service to our Nation.\n  Today is a time when we could work together to reauthorize that \ninitial landmark bill from 1990 and rededicate ourselves on a \nbipartisan basis to something that is one of our most sacred \nobligations: protecting our children, protecting the victims of child \nabuse and delivering justice for them. That is what this bipartisan \nbill does that was introduced earlier today along with my colleagues, \nSenators Blunt and Sessions and Hirono--a great example of being able \nto work together across the aisle.\n  As parents, as neighbors, as leaders of our Nation, we have no more \nsacred obligation than protecting our children. In most of our cases, \nwe dedicate everything we have as parents to ensuring our children's \nsafety, to providing for their future, and that is what this bill is \nall about--that responsibility.\n  Tragically, too often, despite our best efforts, too many of our \nchildren fall victim to abuse. We cannot guarantee their safety, but \nwhat we can do is ensure that when children in this country are harmed, \nwe can deliver justice without further harming them. Thankfully, \nchildren's advocacy centers, for which this bill reauthorizes funding, \nare critical and effective resources in our communities that help us \nperform this awesome and terrible responsibility. Through this bill, we \ncan continue to prevent future tragedies and deliver justice in ways \nthat are effective and less costly than communities can deliver alone.\n  This bill helps prevent child abuse proactively. Just last year its \nprograms trained more than 500,000 Americans, mostly in school \nsettings, in how to spot and prevent child sexual abuse.\n  Secondly, and in my view most importantly, this bill delivers \njustice. Children's advocacy centers increase prosecution of the \nmonsters who perpetrate child abuse. One study showed a 94-percent \nconviction rate for center cases that carried forward to trial.\n  Third, and in many ways equally as important, this bill helps to \nheal. Child victims of abuse who receive services at a child advocacy \ncenter are four times more likely to receive the medical exams and \nmental health treatment they desperately need compared to children who \nare served by non-center supported communities. No parent ever wants to \ngo to one of these places or have to bring their child to one of these \nplaces, but those parents who have under these tragic circumstances, \nnearly 100 percent of them say they would recommend seeking this help \nto other parents.\n  How do these advocacy centers achieve all these different results of \nprevention, of justice, and of healing? Well, they are unique because \nthey bring together under one roof everybody who needs to be present to \nhelp deal with the tragedy of child abuse: law enforcement, \nprosecutors, mental health and child service professionals--all focused \non what is in the best interest of the child.\n  Through a trained forensic interviewer, they interview the child to \nfind out exactly what happened. They ask difficult, detailed questions, \nand they structure the conversation in a trained and nonleading way so \nthe testimony can be used later in court, preventing what otherwise is \nretraumatization, making it possible for child victims to testify in a \nway that will lead to justice but without forcing those children\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\nto take the stand and to repeat over and over what they testified to \nonce at a center.\n  Prosecutors take the information obtained in the interview all the \nway through the court system, while doctors and other child service \nprofessionals ensure the child is getting the help he or she badly \nneeds to begin the process of healing.\n  One place, one interview, with all the resources a victim would need \nto move forward to secure justice and to heal.\n  In my home State of Delaware, we have three children's advocacy \ncenters, one in each of our counties. In the last year, I visited the \ncenters in Wilmington and in Dover and saw firsthand the extraordinary \nwork the professionals there do. These are places haunted by the \ntragedies that are described and recorded there, but the staff are \nwelcoming, nurturing professionals, and the law enforcement and mental \nhealth and child service professionals who are there are deeply \ndedicated to making sure that they achieve justice and that they \npromote healing.\n  It was striking on my tours, my visits, to see how strategically and \nthoughtfully each of these centers has been put together, how they have \nworked through every possible detail to enable obtaining the testimony \nneeded to secure justice while enabling healing of child victims. This \nis critical in order to avoid retraumatization--a threat that is real \nfor victims and for their long-term healing process. The centers in \nWilmington and Dover and Georgetown in my home State show over and over \nhow these centers create the sort of nurturing but effective space to \nensure that we both meet the needs of victims and secure justice.\n  As I am sure the Chair knows, in my home State of Delaware just a few \nyears ago we saw exactly the kind of evil we most dread in this world \nwhen a pediatrician, a man named Earl Bradley whom many Delawareans \ntrusted with their children's health and safety, was found to have \nsexually assaulted more than 100 of our children. Delaware is a State \nof neighbors, and his horrific crimes against our children, our \nfamilies, and our communities affected all of us. Attorney general Beau \nBiden and his team effectively led the investigation and prosecution of \nthis monster. Thankfully, children's advocacy centers were able to play \na key role in ensuring that the interviews and the assistance provided \nto the victims and their families were effective and that ultimately \njustice was rendered.\n  Randy Williams, the executive director of Delaware's Children's \nAdvocacy Center in Dover, wrote to me:\n\n       Our multidisciplinary team worked tirelessly and seamlessly \n     in providing forensic interviews, assessments, medical \n     evaluations and mental health services for every child \n     referred to our centers.\n\n  Randy went on to say:\n\n       I feel confident that our team's outstanding collaborative \n     response was a direct result of the financial and technical \n     assistance and training resources made possible over many \n     years through the Federal Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n\n  In the end, Dr. Bradley was convicted on multiple counts. Over 100 \nvictims were involved. He is now serving 14 life sentences plus 164 \nyears in prison.\n  As a nation, we have no greater responsibility than to keep our \nchildren safe. As a father, there is nothing that keeps me up at night \nmore than concerns about the safety and security and health of my own \nchildren. We must do everything we can to prevent sexual abuse of those \nmost vulnerable and those most precious members of our society--our \nchildren. When that tragedy strikes, we need to be prepared with the \nbest services we have to foster healing and deliver justice.\n  This specific bill is about upholding our responsibility to our \nchildren, to our families, and to this Nation's future. It is at the \nvery core of why we serve and of what we believe. I am grateful that \nthis is a bipartisan bill, that this is a bill which can demonstrate \nthe best of what this Senate, this Congress, and this country is \ncapable of. It represents the best of our Federal commitment to \ntargeted, effective, and essential assistance to State and local law \nenforcement, to our communities, and to our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us because in the end, no child \nshould fall prey to physical or sexual abuse. No mother or father \nshould have a haunting experience of finding that an adult they trusted \ntook advantage of that trust and horribly hurt their child. No country \nshould tolerate these crimes when there are things we can do now, \ntoday, on a bipartisan basis, to protect and to heal our children and \nto ensure that justice is secured.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about several \nother things, but after hearing the majority leader and my colleague \nfrom Delaware, I think the revisionist history needs to stop.\n  This place ran from 1917 under a process where any one Senator could \nstop anything. That was changed by a two-thirds majority of those \npresent voting to a number less than that. The point I am getting to is \nthat we are in this process because the rules weren't good enough to \naccomplish what the majority wanted to accomplish and the majority \nleader wanted to accomplish. Majority Leader Byrd didn't have any \ntrouble when he had the same vote number. Majority Leader Daschle \ndidn't have any trouble. Neither did Frist or Dole. None of them had \nany trouble. As a matter of fact, what we have seen and what has \nhappened is a lack of effective leadership in building bipartisanship.\n  The Senate wasn't designed to be the House, as my colleagues have \nrecently made it. The Senate was designed to absolutely protect \nminority rights. And what happened the week before we went on \nThanksgiving break actually hurt the majority more than it hurt the \nminority because now the majority has lost the ability to hold their \nown administration accountable.\n  The majority leader used the words ``reasonableness'' and \n``clarity.'' Reasonableness is compromise. Reasonableness is allowing \namendments on major bills. Clarity is the ability of Senators to offer \ntheir viewpoint on $600 billion bills. Reasonableness would be to say \nthat every Member of this body ought to be able to contribute important \nideas to the Defense authorization bill or to the farm bill or to any \nother major piece of legislation.\n  So we have gone down this road. It can be stopped. All this can be \nstopped, but it cannot be stopped without the recognition of the damage \ndone to this body by a very frivolous act.\n  The revisionist history I am talking about is with the DC court. \nThere is no difference in what the President is doing on the DC court \nthan what Roosevelt decided to do or attempted to do. Everybody knows \nthe workload there is enormously small compared to all the rest of the \ncourts. Everybody knows there are also judicial vacancies that are much \nmore important than those.\n  So what is the reason for this? It is so we can continue to have \nexecutive orders and bureaucratic rules and regs come through that are \ngoing to get challenged because they are not within the consent and the \nvision of the laws that are passed, and, in fact, they can be enforced \nby a stacked court. My colleagues can't claim anything other than that. \nWe know that is what is going on, and they know that is what is going \non. That is going to be there forever. That is a legacy of the Obama \nadministration, and it is a planned legacy.\n  So it is not about what is claimed to be Republican obstructionism. \nIt is about changing the very nature of our country. It is about \nchanging the rule of law. It is about whether the President will be an \nemperor or be the President. And my worry is that we are moving fast \nand quickly toward an executive branch that has decided and has stated \nvery proudly: If the Congress won't do it, we are going to do it \nanyway. Where does that fit in with the rule of law? And we have heard \nthat three times from this President. In fact, they are doing it--\nignoring law.\n  So now the very court where those laws will get challenged is going \nto be stacked with his nominees, and we refuse to admit this very same \npoint was made by senior members of the Judiciary Committee when the \nRepublicans were in charge. No one can deny that history. It is out \nthere. Senator Schumer did it, as well as others, knowing that court \nshould not be filled.\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\n  Now, we know it is going to get filled. We understand what is \nhappening. What is at risk is the future of our country and whether we \nwill really have balance between the powers of the judiciary, the \nexecutive, and the legislative branches in this country. What we are \nseeing is a reshaping of that. It is a dangerous trend. It was \nsomething our Founders worried about, and we have seen executive orders \nand executive privilege taken to new heights that have never been seen \nin this country before by this administration.\n\n  So let's be clear what we are talking about. This isn't about \nobstructionism. This is about you limited our rights. You also very \nwell limited your own rights in the ability to extract information.\n  We just heard Senator Grassley spend 1 hour on the floor talking \nabout the lack of response from this administration. There is no tool \nfor you to get answers anymore, there is no tool for any of us to get \nanswers anymore, because we can no longer hold any nominations because \nthey will go through. So there is no power. We have given up the one \nsignificant power to hold the executive branch accountable.\n  Not only that, but we have diminished the minority rights that are \npart of what the Founders created to force compromise--to force us to \ncompromise, to bring us together. There is not ill will. There are \ndamaged hearts in this institution today.\n  We understand the strong beliefs on the other side, but we don't \nunderstand the lack of moral fiber that is associated with avoiding and \nviolating what has always been the tradition of the Senate--which is, \nyou change rules with two-thirds votes of those duly elected and \npresent. Rule XXII still stands. It just has a precedent in front of \nit.\n  So for the first time in our history in this body, one group--because \nthey couldn't achieve compromise and wouldn't compromise--has forced a \nchanging of the rules, not through two-thirds of duly elected and sworn \nmembers but by fiat and by simple majority. What is next? We are going \nto make it the House. That is what is next. That is coming. I know that \nis coming.\n  So consequently what is going to happen in our country is we are not \ngoing to have significant deliberation. We are going to have laws \nchanged at public whim, rather than the long-term thinking and an \nembracing of what the Constitution says.\n  The whole purpose for this body is to be a counter to the House in \nterms of response to political and public demand; to give reasoned \nthought and forced compromise, so that what comes out of here is a \nblend of what both the public wants, but also what the public might \nhave lost sight of in terms of a short-term view versus a long-term \nview. You are putting that at risk. It is coming at risk. The very the \nsoul of the country can unwind right here in the Senate.\n  So what remaining powers do we have as minority Members--and you may \nget to find that out someday--is to use the rules that are there to our \nbenefit.\n  In the past, nominations were agreed upon between the majority leader \nand the minority leader, and they were ferreted out and moved. We have \nhad 21 nominations come through the homeland security committee. I \nvoted positively for 19 of them, against one, and voted present on one \ntoday. I would say that is about 90 percent that I am in agreement of \nmoving the nominations.\n  We actually force compromise on our committee. We actually work to \ncompromise on our committee. But that is because of the leadership of \nSenator Carper to create an atmosphere where you can have compromise \nand you can have back and forth. We don't have that leadership in the \nSenate as a whole. The Senate has never seen these problems. But it is \nnot about the rules. It is about the leadership and who is running the \nplace.\n  Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle haven't been \nhere for a long time. They have never seen it in the majority work. \nSeventy-seven times the majority leader over the last 7 years has \nfilled the tree and barred amendments. That is more than all the rest \ncombined in the entire history of the Senate. Is that about us or is \nthat about him not wanting to allow the place to work? He is a good \nman. But the problem is that leadership matters, and this place is not \nfunctioning.\n  I will make one other statement I think needs to be made. I believe \nthat climate does change. I believe that climate is changing all the \ntime. Global warming has been disputed now. It is undeniable; it is not \nglobal warming. We are now into a global cooling period, and that is \nOK. You can have cooling. But the fact is the science is still nebulous \non all the claims being made. I have said before on this floor, I am \nnot a climate change denier. But I am a global warming denier, because \nthe facts don't back it up.\n  We heard what the majority leader had to say about the importance of \ngetting things through on climate change. There may be important things \nwe need to do, but we ought to be doing them together rather than in \nopposition. If that were the attitude, that we would work together, if \nwe would have an open amendment process--a truly open amendment process \nwhere the majority leader isn't picking our amendments and deciding \nwhat we can offer--pretty soon you are going tell us what we can say on \nthe floor. You are going to determine what I can say on the floor. This \nis the first step in this process. That is the ultimate conclusion to \nthis process that you have started.\n  So it is about leadership, and it is either there or it isn't. Right \nnow, it is not there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and I would like to use his comments maybe as a \nspringboard for some thoughts I have, not only on this nomination but \non the terrible mess we find ourselves in today here in the Senate.\n  I am a fairly new Member of the Senate. I came here just 5 years ago. \nI thought a lot about reelection, and I announced some months ago that \nI would not seek a second term in the Senate. So you might say I don't \nreally have a fighter in this ring. I am here for a limited period of \ntime. I have already decided that. My interest is seeing the Senate \noperate in a way which will be in the best interests of our country, \nthat will fulfill the vision that our Founders had of a country where \nthere would be freedom and where the minority would be able to voice \ntheir view as well as the majority.\n  The process by which the House of Representatives and the Senate were \nput together was a very thoughtful process. Our Founders looked at our \ncountry and its future, and they decided there needed to be a body \nwhere the population would be represented based upon numbers, based \nupon the population, and that became the House of Representatives.\n  For a State like Nebraska, 200-some years later that doesn't work \nvery well. It is pretty obvious that our three House Members can be \nconsistently, routinely outvoted by a whole bunch of other States: \nCalifornia, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas. I could go on and \non. We have three Members in the House. It is obvious that we are going \nto be on the losing end.\n  The other piece of that is it is a majority-based body. So if you are \nin the majority, with the Rules Committee, you pretty well set the \nrules. It just works that as long as the majority can keep their \nmembers together, they are going to win. That is just the way it works. \nAbout the only way you can change that is to change the majority.\n  When our Founders looked at that, they said: We have to have a \ndifferent approach in the Senate. That led to the great compromise.\n  What we ended up with is just a remarkable system. If you think about \nit, Nebraska in the Senate is as powerful as California. Nebraska is as \npowerful as Pennsylvania because we each get two Members. We are \nequally represented.\n  They also recognize that the pendulum would swing. Sometimes one \nparty would be in control, and sometimes another party would be in \ncontrol. Originally, when the Senate was set up, any one Member of the \nbody could come to the Senate floor and object or just debate something \nto death. That pretty well was how it operated, and it operated for \ndecades and decades that way.\n  Then came World War I and Senators began to recognize that funding \nthe\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nwar was going to be a very serious problem. There was a tremendous \namount of affinity between Senators and people back in the country \nwhere their ancestors came from--Germany--and they had to find a way to \nend debate. So they finally, after discussing this and debating it, \ndecided the best way of doing that was to put something in place where \nyou could literally take a vote. I think back then, if my memory serves \nme correctly, if two-thirds of the Senators voted, they could end \ndebate.\n  That was quite a change for the Senate. The whole idea that a single \nSenator wasn't going to be able to literally force issues in the Senate \nwas a very difficult issue. But that change was made, and it operated \nthat way for many decades following. Then in the 1970s, the decision \nwas made that it would take 60 votes to end debate. It would pull the \nnumber down to 60. But it was always recognized that the rules could \nonly be changed by a two-thirds majority; that is, until just a few \nweeks ago. Then, something happened here in the Senate that literally \nshakes the foundation of this country and it shakes the foundation of \nthis body.\n  I guess if you are in the majority at the moment, you are probably \nsaying: Geez, Mike. It seems to work out pretty well. Well, it won't \nwork out very well for the history of this body, for this institution, \nfor its Members, and, most importantly, for the citizens of the United \nStates, because it was the method chosen to change the rules that is \nthe frightening piece.\n  Think about this. We came down here a few weeks ago. A ruling was \nmade by the Chair, and the majority leader said: I will appeal that \nruling.\n  Now, we all know, if we have read the Senate rules--and I hope to \ngoodness we have all read the Senate rules--that by appealing the \nruling of the Chair, you can overrule the Chair by a majority vote.\n  Let me repeat that. We bypassed the rule that says it takes two-\nthirds to change the rules of the Senate, and the majority said: We \nwill appeal the ruling; and if we get a majority, we will overturn the \nruling. That is what happened, and that is where we find ourselves \ntonight.\n  This isn't inconsequential, and we are not trying to be arbitrary and \ncapricious, but we are trying to make the point that this is a huge \nissue for the future of our country. Let me point out what this now \nmeans for the Senate. What this means is that if the majority leader, \nwhoever that is, Republican or Democrat, does not like the way things \nare going, they can appeal the ruling of the Chair and overturn that \nruling by a majority vote because now the precedent is set. It is in \nour history. It is in our rules.\n\n  Some look at this and say: You need not panic; this only applies to \ncircuit court nominees, district court nominees, and executive \nappointments.\n  Let's think about that for a second. Let's say we have a Supreme \nCourt of the United States where there are four members who are pretty \nconsistent in ruling one way--some might call it the liberal way--and \nwe have four members who are pretty consistent in ruling another way--\nsome might call it the conservative way--and there is one member of the \nSupreme Court who kind of moves back and forth between the four over \nhere and the four over here, between the four liberal members and the \nfour conservative members, whatever you want to call it. That is a \npretty unpredictable vote.\n  Let's say something happens. Maybe there is a health issue. Maybe \nthere is a decision by that member there in the middle to retire. I \ndon't know. It could be a whole host of things. That is the human \ncondition. Things happen to us. Let's say we are in the last 18 months \nof an administration. The President is due to go out. The campaign has \nalready started. People are showing up in Iowa, New Hampshire, South \nCarolina, and everywhere else. They are raising money. They have \nPresidential races they are organizing, and they are doing all the \nthings they need to do. You have Republicans thinking: By golly, it is \nour time. We either keep the White House or win the White House. You \nhave Democrats thinking the same. And you have a President who all of a \nsudden has a Supreme Court appointment smack dab in the middle of four \nmembers on one side and four members on the other side.\n  Let's say the majority has the ability to put somebody of their own \nilk into that position--whether it is Republican or Democrat or liberal \nor conservative. They look at this and they say: You know, we could \nlose the White House or we might not get the White House. These are \nappointments for life. It is not as if we are appointing somebody for 4 \nyears; these are appointments for life. We have kind of come to the \nconclusion, as we talked about it on our side of the aisle, that, by \ngolly, it is in the best interests of this country if we can make this \nappointment. You know what. We do not have 60 votes to get it done. We \nhave counted the votes. It looks as though this is going to come out of \nthe Judiciary Committee on a straight party-line vote. What are we \ngoing to do now?\n  I know what will happen. You know what will happen. Every Member of \nthe Senate knows what will happen. I don't care if you are a Republican \nor a Democrat or a conservative or a liberal or a Socialist or whatever \nyou want to call yourself, we know what will happen. There will be a \nruling by the Chair. There will be an appeal by the majority leader. \nAnd all of a sudden we will have a rule where you can confirm a Supreme \nCourt nomination--a nomination to a job for life--based upon a majority \nvote. Does anybody think for a minute that is not going to happen? Does \nanybody think for a minute that the circumstances surrounding that will \nnot occur?\n  I guess if you are on the Republican side of the aisle and it is a \nvery strong conservative who is going to the Supreme Court, maybe you \nlook at that and say: Thank goodness. We saved the country.\n  Maybe if you are a Democrat and it is a good strong liberal who is \ngoing onto the Supreme Court, you say: Thank goodness. We saved the \ncountry, and it was worth it.\n  But you see, here is the dilemma in which we find ourselves. The \ndilemma in which we find ourselves is that the majority of this body \nhas now set the precedent and you cannot pull it back. There is not any \nway now that you can unwind the clock and turn back the clock.\n  Let me offer another thought. Let's say we are a few years down the \nroad and you have a piece of legislation and your side of the aisle has \ndecided that piece of legislation is absolutely critical for the future \nof this country. Maybe it is cap-and-trade, maybe it is another health \ncare bill--whatever. All of a sudden somebody says: We have to get this \ndone. We are in the last 12 months of this administration. We are \nlooking at the numbers. We are not going to win the White House again, \nthe way it is looking. The precedent is there: Appeal the ruling of the \nchair.\n  The point I am making is this. It is not that the rules were changed. \nThe rules have been changed in the Senate a number of times by the way \nthe Senate rules contemplate--with a supermajority voting to change \nthose rules. Now we have torn that up because now we have established a \nprecedent.\n  I am in the process of reading Senator Byrd's history of the Senate--\na remarkable man. I got to know him a little bit. He was still here \nwhen I came to the Senate, before he passed. He happened to be on the \nother side of the aisle, but I came to respect him so much. He would \nnever have stood for this. He never would have tolerated that this \ninstitution would be so mistreated by anybody, Republican or Democrat. \nBoy, in his heyday he would have been at his seat screaming at the top \nof his lungs about what we were doing to the Senate with this vote, \nwhat the majority was going to do to the future of this great body.\n\n  In his history of the Senate, he talks about how important it is that \nthere is this body where a minority view of the world can be \nrepresented.\n  If I were the majority leader, I guess I would like this to run \nefficiently and well-oiled and smoothly. I was a Governor. I was a \nmayor. The days when I got my way were much better than days when I did \nnot get my way. I did not like being frustrated by the legislature. I \ndidn't like the city council telling me I couldn't get my way. I could \nnot understand, some days, why they could not figure out that I was \nright.\n  One day I was sitting down with a State senator. He had been there a \nlot of years. I was complaining about the way the legislature was \ntreating me. I couldn't understand why the legislature couldn't follow \neverything the\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\nGovernor wanted done. He listened very patiently and he looked at me \nand he said: You know, Mike, nobody elected you king.\n  I think that is what Bob Byrd would have said--nobody elected any of \nus king. You see, our Founders set up this system with the whole idea \nthat we would not have kings anymore, that there would be checks and \nbalances, and that we would be forced to deal with each other, \nsometimes more artfully than at other times but that we would be forced \nto deal with each other.\n  The majority leader came down here and he said: I don't understand \nthis, and he talks about this process. This process got started because \nhe filed cloture on 10 nominations. Why are we not working on this? If \nyou look at the history of the Senate over the last years--I have been \nhere; I watched it; I turn on my TV in the office to see what is going \non on the Senate floor. Do you know what I see? Exactly what you see, \nwhat all of us see. We sit hour after hour, in cloture or in quorum \ncall hour after hour when amendments are pending.\n  I thought--I had this mistaken impression--that every Senator could \nfile an amendment; that if I had a better idea on something, I could \nfile an amendment and I would get a hearing on the amendment. I would \nbe able to come down here and try to argue to my colleagues: Pass my \namendment. We have not seen that kind of process for years under this \nmajority.\n  I didn't think it was possible to mishandle the Senate when I came \nhere. I looked at the books of rules and interpretations and volumes, \nchapter after chapter written about the rules of the Senate, and I said \nto myself: There is no way you could mismanage this body because these \nrules are as intricate as they could be. Boy, was I proven wrong. You \ncan mismanage this body. We have seen it. And that is where we find \nourselves today.\n  At the end of the day, why did it happen? Why did it happen? Why are \nwe putting ourselves in this position? A former U.S. Senator from \nNebraska who had been here--I think he was here three terms. He had a \nwonderful saying. When his party was not in power, he would say at \nspeeches: Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, the worm will turn. \nIt was his way of saying: You know what. I have been in the majority \nand I have been in the minority, and it will change because the people \nwill send a message into this Chamber, just as they did on the health \ncare bill. They will send a message that this is not the kind of \ncountry they want.\n  We somehow have to figure out how to put this back in the box. This \nnuclear option needs to be sealed up, hidden away, and never used \nagain--I don't care if the Republicans are in the majority or the \nDemocrats are in the majority. This basically means, today, that all of \nthose rules, all of those chapters written about those rules have no \nmeaning whatsoever because there are no rules. If I do not like what is \ngoing on here and I am in the majority, all I have to do is appeal the \nruling of the Chair and get my team to stand together and we have \nchanged the way the Senate operates. It is as simple as that.\n  I think at times in our history we would like to think that we are \nthe smartest people in the world, that we thought of something no other \nperson has thought of in the history of this country. Not true. If you \nread what Senator Byrd wrote about the history of the Senate, many \ntimes U.S. Senators, dissatisfied, losing personally because of a \nruling of the Chair, had an opportunity to appeal that ruling and win \nand realized that was the wrong course of action because they would set \na precedent that you could change the rules by breaking the rules. That \nis exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago. It is not the fact that \nthe rule has changed, although I disagree with where we ended up, it is \nthe method by which the majority--Democrats--changed those \nrules, because that method is now precedent and it is now available to \nRepublicans and Democrats and it is wide open. I guarantee that in our \nlifetime we will see a Supreme Court nominee put on the Supreme Court \nby this method. I guarantee that we will see--whether it is in our \nlifetime or at some point after--that there will be a situation where \nlegislation is now done by a majority.\n\n  What does that mean for the country? I will give a good example. The \ngreat compromise protected States such as Nevada, Nebraska, and Iowa. \nWe all get two Senators. We all get to come to the floor and fight for \nwhat we believe in.\n  I imagine that every Senator would say something to the effect of: I \ncome from a beautiful State, the State of Nebraska. We are conservative \npeople by nature. I don't think you live in Nebraska unless you have a \npioneer spirit and you are conservative by nature. That is who we are. \nWe essentially believe that less government is a good idea.\n  When I was Governor, people didn't want me running their schools. \nThey had a school board. They felt they could make thoughtful and \nintelligent decisions about running their schools. I thought they could \ntoo. That is the nature of who we are.\n  Do you realize that on executive appointments--district court and \ncircuit court judges--we basically get dealt out of this. Let's say I \nhave a problem with a nominee, and I want to put a hold on that nominee \nuntil they come to my office and deal with me. Everybody on both sides \nof the aisle gets the opportunity to use that. Well, guess what. That \nwas voted away a few weeks ago.\n  Why would a Republican administration deal with anyone in today's \nmajority? Why would they care? It doesn't make any difference.\n  I went through that process. I was a member of the President's \nCabinet. I hope I would have the decency that if anybody asked me a \nquestion, I would answer the question or try to solve their problem or \ntry to work with them. Quite honestly, why do they need to? How can \nthat issue be forced now? They don't need your vote. They can get \nthrough the process if their party is the majority of the Senate. This \nbody was never intended to operate that way.\n  I want to spend a few minutes of my time talking about what I really \nthink this is about, and this makes it an even more tragic story. The \nmajority leader was here a few minutes ago and said: Well, if you are \ngoing to be like this, then we will work on Christmas. We will work the \nweekend before; we will work the day before.\n  I was sitting there thinking: What is new about that? What's even \nthreatening about that? I mean, that is the way business is done.\n  We sit through hours and hours of quorum calls and then all of a \nsudden they file cloture on 10 nominees 2 weeks before the break? It is \nkind of obvious to me what is going on here. Is it obvious to anyone \nelse what is going on here? They are trying to force the issue.\n  Why didn't we start working on this weeks ago? Why don't you run the \nSenate 24/7 so we can move amendments and give us the opportunity to \nvote on amendments? Why sit hour after hour in a quorum call?\n  I think what this is really all about is this: We had reached an \nagreement. Remember that evening when we all walked down the hall--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents--and went into the Old Senate \nChamber and shut the doors. There was no media or staff. It was just us \ntalking about the Senate.\n  I am not going to share a lot about what was talked about in there, \nbut I thought it was a pretty good meeting. We have done that a couple \nof times. We did that on the START treaty, and we did it that evening a \nfew months ago.\n  It wasn't very pleasant, but over the next day or so we shook hands \nand said to each other: OK, we get it. We don't want to get in the \nbusiness of breaking the rules to change the rules. We understand the \nprecedent that is setting. Once you put that on the books, like I said, \nyou can't unwind the clock.\n  So, OK, this is what we are going to do--and I must admit I didn't \nlike it very much. I thought we were giving up too much. Having said \nthat, the alternative was not very attractive. We shook hands, like \ngentlemen do, and we called a truce and those were the rules we would \noperate under.\n  Everybody said: We dodged a bullet on that one, and the Senate will \ncontinue to function like it has functioned the last 225 years. It will \nfunction as a place where the minority, whoever that might be at any \ngiven time, has a\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nvoice. It is the only body in the world that operates like that.\n  As I said, I must admit I had qualms about it. I talked to some of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle about my qualms, and at the end \nof the day I reached the conclusion that it was better than the nuclear \noption.\n  So why did this come up again? If we had reached a deal--if we shook \nhands like gentlemen and women do, why did this come up again? I \nthought this was behind us. I thought we would make our way through \nnominations and work long hours. Most of these are very \nnoncontroversial, and I thought we had reached an agreement.\n  We had reached an agreement. We all knew we had reached an agreement. \nSo why did Democrats feel that all of a sudden we needed to revisit \nthis?\n  The argument I want to make tonight is this--and I am going to draw \non a little bit of history. When I first came here, I sat in a chair \nover there. I will never forget it. It was Christmas Eve day when we \nwere brought in here to vote on a piece of legislation. Christmas Eve \nvotes are pretty unusual around here. We all sat at our desks. We don't \nusually enforce that rule, but we all sat at our desks.\n  For people like me, I left this Chamber very, very sad and \ndiscouraged. On a pure party-line vote, a monumental piece of \nlegislation that practically no one had read and was poorly \nunderstood--in fact, the Speaker said: We have to pass this to \nunderstand what is in it. No truer words were ever spoken. It passed. \nNot a single Republican in the House or the Senate voted yes on that \nlegislation.\n  When I came here, I kind of had the idea that there would be give and \ntake, that I would get my idea, you would get your idea, and at the end \nof the day the Senate was a body that would force compromise or the \nbill wouldn't pass.\n  Something unusual happened. The President was a Democrat, the Senate \nhad 60 Democrats, so debate could end, and the majority of the House \nwas overwhelmingly Democrat. It became very clear to me that my view of \nthe world didn't matter, and it wasn't going to matter because as long \nas they could sweeten this thing up and do deals, and whatever else, my \nState was impacted by it. We all remember the Cornhusker Kickback. But \nat the end of the day it passed.\n  I could never figure out how that bill would work. It just didn't \nmake any sense to me. I had been a Governor. I had seen how failed \nMedicaid was--40 percent of the doctors would not take Medicaid. I \ncould not imagine how adding millions to that system was going to help \npoor people. To me it looked like it was going to hurt them. It was \nkind of like giving them the bus ticket and then saying: We are only \nrunning one bus in Washington, DC, these days. It is probably not going \nto be very successful.\n  I looked at what was happening in the rest of the bill, and it just \ndidn't make any sense to me. I think I know why we revisited this rule. \nWhen the rollout occurred right about that time, all heck broke loose. \nThe American people finally realized how bad this bill was. In fact, \nthere is one State out there, the State of Oregon, that didn't sign \nanybody up because their system melted down.\n  The exchange was a mess. People found out that all of these \npromises--remember this one: If you like your plan, you can keep it, \nperiod. If you like your plan, you can keep it, period.\n  Not only was that used on the campaign trail--you know, we all get \nout on the campaign trail and hyperventilate here and there. That \nphrase was used by somebody in real authority: The President of the \nUnited States of America. He went to the American people and said: If \nyou like your plan, you can keep it.\n  I said how could that possibly work. The whole idea is you have to \nforce people off their plan and onto a different plan. If you like your \nplan, you get to keep it?\n  In 2010, the administration's own rule on this subject showed that as \nmany as 80 percent of small business plans and 69 percent of all \nbusiness plans would lose their grandfathered status.\n  A very thoughtful Senator, a guy by the name of Mike Enzi, put in a \nresolution of disapproval which would have canceled that regulation. \nBack then he was able to get it to a vote. You would think that if you \nwant to support the President of your party and his pledge to the \nAmerican people--if you like your plan, you get to keep it, period--you \nwould vote with your President. You would think that would be 100 to 0.\n  I don't know how Republicans could be against that. I don't know how \nDemocrats could be against that. After all, that is what this person in \nauthority promised the American people: If you like your plan, you get \nto keep it, period. He said it over and over. It was like a broken \nrecord.\n  You know how that vote went here? Let me remind everybody. It failed \non party-line votes. Democrats voted no on the resolution: If you like \nyour plan, you get to keep it. My goodness. Is that an embarrassment or \nwhat?\n  What was the message that day? Were they trying to say: No, if you \nlike your plan, you don't get to keep it? The President isn't being \ntruthful with you. Was that the message that day? What was going on? I \nmean, I was stunned by that vote.\n  How could you be against the President's own promise? That was back \nin 2010. That information was available to the President and his people \nback in 2010. Yet they kept saying it: If you like your plan, you get \nto keep your plan.\n  One other estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, which I think \ngenerally we all respect--they do good work for us. They do our \nscoring. They said that up to 20 million employees could lose their \nemployer-sponsored insurance. Wait a second. That information was \navailable too. So how has this promise worked out?\n\n  This fall, more than 4.7 million cancellation letters went out in 32 \ndifferent States. I have read the articles. I imagine everybody in the \nChamber has read the articles. They say 4.7 million people got \ncancellation letters in 32 different States. The cancellation letter \nbasically said: Well, sorry. This big law got passed on a party-line \nvote, and you don't get to keep your plan, just as was predicted by the \nCBO and the administration's own people. This should not be stunning to \nanybody in this body, but it was stunning to the American people.\n  The President said: Oh my goodness. I think this is a problem. So he \nsaid to insurance companies: You have to fix this. You have to get \npeople their plan. If they like their plan, they get to keep their \nplan. And it didn't matter whether it was Democrats or Republicans in \ngiven States, they said: Mr. President, you can't unwind that clock.\n  What I would say to that is, wait a second here. I don't like this \nlaw, but it passed. I was sitting there the day it passed. It passed on \na completely party-line vote. And people literally were caught in a \nsituation--millions of them--where they realized they wouldn't get to \nkeep their plan. So could the President solve that problem? No. It \nwasn't a policy fix; it was a political fix. That is what he was doing. \nHe was literally trying to solve a political problem for the majority \nthat passed the darn bill. I mean, it is unbelievable.\n  Many weighed in. The American Academy of Actuaries said this:\n\n       Changing the ACA provisions could alter the dynamics of the \n     insurance market, creating two parallel markets operating \n     under different rules, thereby threatening the viability of \n     insurance markets operating under the new rules.\n\n  Now, I am as competitive as anybody. I have run a lot of elections. I \nunderstand the importance of being in the majority in this body. I \nespecially understand that after what the majority did over the last \nfew weeks. We went 225 years as a country, and it was only in the last \ncouple of weeks that the majority said: Look, we are tired of dealing \nwith you, minority. We are going to get our own way.\n  It reminded me of the day ObamaCare was passed. It was identical. It \nwas like: Johanns, get lost. We don't care what you think about this. \nWe have 60 votes. Sit down and shut up.\n  Is that the way the Senate is supposed to operate? I don't think so. \nI don't think that is what was envisioned when this body was put \ntogether, and it has been forever changed. It happened because \nObamaCare is out of control. It is not the Web site. The Web site was a \nmess. It just proved to us that the White House couldn't manage this. \nThat is what it proved to us. But we can fix a Web site. They can get \nsmart people who go in and figure it out.\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nThat wouldn't be me, but there are many people in the United States who \ncould be brought to bear to solve this problem of dealing with the Web \nsite. It is not the Web site, although it is a huge embarrassment. It \nwas a huge embarrassment for the White House. It was a huge \nembarrassment for the President of the United States. It was a huge \nembarrassment for Kathleen Sebelius. It was a huge embarrassment for \nthe Democrats who voted for this. But at the end of the day it can be \nfixed, and I would guess they would fix it. I kept saying to people \nback home that I think they will get it fixed. How tough is that? How \ntough would it be to do it the right way the first time? But they \ndidn't. It just proves they are not very competitive.\n  What is happening here is the wheels are coming off this policy \nbecause the policy never made any sense. When the President made this \nannouncement: Insurance companies, you fix it, America's health \ninsurance plans said that premiums have already been set for the next \nyear based on the assumption of when consumers will transition into the \nnew marketplace. Who decided when they would transition into the new \nmarketplace? The insurance companies didn't. The majority did. The \nWhite House did. Health and Human Services did.\n  They go on in their statement:\n\n       If now fewer younger and healthier people choose to \n     purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase and \n     there will be fewer choices for consumers.\n\n  Well, let me say something that is obvious to everybody in this \nChamber. Your premiums are going up. Why? Young people are so turned \noff. Young people are so turned off by what is happening. I had a young \nperson show up at a town hall. This was a year and a half ago. They \nsaid: Here is kind of the deal. It is just my wife and I. We don't have \nchildren. We are both working. We are trying to get ahead. We don't \nmake a lot of money, and we decided the best plan for us was kind of a \ncatastrophic plan. We will deal with our day-to-day health care needs, \nwhich, incidentally, aren't much because we are young and fortunately \nwe are healthy. We have a high deductible.\n  I was listening to that, and I said: God bless you. This is America. \nThey can make that choice. That was the best choice for them. They \nthought about it and decided the money they were making might be better \nallocated someplace else. What a great country that people can decide \nthat.\n  Well, what happened with this health care bill? That decision was \ntaken away from that young couple. They were ordered by the Federal \nGovernment, under penalty, to buy a given plan. Now, I have not caught \nup with that young couple, but I bet they are mad as wet hens. I will \nbet they have looked at what has happened to them and they are saying: \nWhy?\n  We all know the little secret here: Young people are paying more for \ncoverage that they don't need to finance me in my sixties. Does that \nmake any sense?\n  I could go on and on about what is happening here with this health \ncare bill, but it is not sheer coincidence that Senators in the Senate \nreached an agreement months ago on the rules. We shook hands on it. We \nput that behind us. Right about the time ObamaCare rolled out, all of a \nsudden that agreement wasn't valid anymore, and we got set up on a \nmanufactured crisis to force a vote, and the method chosen to change \nthe rules forever changes how the Senate operates.\n  In our history, many Senators had the opportunity to change these \nrules and thought better of it because they so respected and admired \nthis institution, that they believed there was a place for a minority \nwhether that Senator was in the minority or the majority at the time. \nThat is what happened.\n  I will take another step. All of us know what this is really about. \nThis is about control of this body. All of a sudden, because of \nObamaCare and the truth coming out about what a terrible piece of \npolicy this is, it became evident that Members over here were in deep \ntrouble and were going to lose their elections if their elections were \nheld now, and the majority had to change the conversation. So the \nagreement we reached after that night we spent in the Old Senate \nChamber hashing through this, debating and discussing it, basically got \ntorn up and tossed out the window, and the majority forever changed how \nthis body will operate and what this body is going to be about in the \nfuture.\n  So what I say to my colleagues tonight is this: I am not planning on \nbeing here much longer. I have made that decision. One could say I \ndon't have a boxer in the ring. A year from now, I will be doing \nsomething else. Some will be here, some won't be here. But at the end \nof the day, what I will remember about this time in the Senate is that \na precedent was set that is vastly different from the way this Senate \noperated for 225 years. A precedent was set that allows the majority to \ntake control of executive branch appointments, district court \nappointments, circuit court appointments. It is a precedent that would \nallow a majority to take control of a Supreme Court appointment. It is \na precedent that will allow a majority, when it chooses to--not if; I \nbelieve it is a question of when--to take control of the policymaking.\n  So it is true when we say that if they were attempting to change the \nconversation, I say to the majority Members of the U.S. Senate, away \nfrom ObamaCare to this, all they have done is reminded the American \npeople that what they are really doing is abusing this institution in a \nway that, quite honestly, is going to be very hard to turn around.\n  My thought is this: I feel very strongly that we can reverse what has \noccurred here, but we can't do it as a minority. We need the majority \nto back off. We need the majority to recognize that this body has \nexisted through difficult times, it has existed through wars, it has \nexisted through attacks on our country, and we have found a way to \noperate. We need the majority to recognize that we reached an agreement \nmany months ago after an evening spent together in the Old Senate \nChamber where we debated these things and, like gentlemen and \ngentlewomen, we shook hands and put this behind us for this session.\n  We can do the work of the Senate. We can do the work for the American \npeople. I have no doubt about that whatsoever.\n\n  I am very concerned, though, that we have put the Senate in a \nposition where it is a very vulnerable body now. Any majority can now \nuse this precedent to turn this into something that is entirely \ndifferent than what anybody who founded this country believed it should \nbe. When the majority decided that it would bypass the requirement that \nrules would be changed by a two-thirds vote and do it by appealing the \nruling of the Chair, they put the Senate in a position where there are \nno rules. There are no rules. All you need is 51 Members--50 if you \nhave the Vice President in the Chair--who decide to stick together and \nmake that Supreme Court appointment. They can get it done. All you need \nis 50 Members, if you have the Vice President in the Chair, who decide \nthey stick together, and they would do a legislative process by a \nmajority vote.\n  Many, many times the nuclear option was discussed, it was debated, \nand Senators much wiser than I looked at the history of this great \ncountry and its future and decided it was a step that should never be \ntaken--that was until a couple of weeks ago, all driven by the fact \nthat this piece of legislation called ObamaCare has turned out to be \nsuch a train wreck and that there was a need to change the discussion \nand change the topic and try to draw the people's attention away from \nthat legislation, and that is how this rule got adopted. It is a sad \ntime in our Nation's history. It is a sad time in terms of what is \ngoing on.\n  What I would offer is my hope is that wise people will realize the \nproblems they have created for this country in the future, realize that \nthe precedent they have set forever changes the way we operate and back \naway from what occurred.\n  Let's start doing the work of the Senate. If that means we work \nthrough Christmas, good. I am here. If that means we work on weekends, \nif that means we work around the clock, fine with me. I am good. I will \ndo it. I will be happy to do it. But to try to streamline this process \nin a way that silences the minority is not right, and it is not what \nthis country should be about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nfinish speaking, Senator Blumenthal be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Sandy Hook\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, this Saturday we are going to mark the 1-\nyear anniversary of the shooting in Sandy Hook, CT, in which 20 little \n6- and 7-year-old boys and girls lost their lives, as well as 6 adults \nwho worked in that school who were charged with protecting them.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I have come down to the floor today to offer \nsome thoughts as we reflect on the 365 days that have passed since the \nmost horrific mass shooting that most of us have ever seen in our \nlifetimes.\n  I think back a lot on that day--being in the Sandy Hook firehouse as \nthe parents realized that their sons and daughters were not coming back \nfrom that school. One of the things I remember about that day is \ngetting an awful lot of phone calls from my colleagues from all around \nthe country, Senators and Congressmen who represented places such as \nColumbine and Aurora and Virginia Tech and Tucson. They all called \nbecause they had been through this before and they just wanted to offer \ntheir condolences and a little bit of advice on how a community can try \nto get through these awful, tragic, shattering incidents.\n  I sort of thought that day how awful it was that there were that many \ncolleagues, that many representatives from across the country who could \ncall and give me advice. What a tragedy it is that we are amassing this \nbank of expertise across the Nation on how to respond to mass \nshootings. It speaks to how far and wide the carnage and the \ndevastation are from these mass shootings that are occurring now it \nseems almost on a weekly or monthly basis somewhere around the country. \nIt is not getting better; it is getting worse.\n  In 1949 a guy by the name of Howard Unruh went through the streets of \nhis town of East Camden, NJ, firing shots indiscriminately such that he \nkilled 13 people. It was the Nation's first mass shooting. Now we have, \nunfortunately, had a lot of mass shootings since that first one in \n1949.\n  But here is what is stunning: Of all of the mass shootings that have \ntaken place since 1949, half of them took place from 1949 to 2007 and \nthe other half have taken place in the last 6 years. Something has gone \nwrong. Something has changed. The problem is that it is not this place. \nWe are approaching the 1-year mark of the school shooting in Sandy \nHook, and it will be a week of mourning, but here in the Senate it \nshould also be a week of embarrassment. It should be a week of shame \nthat after 1 year passing since 20 little boys and girls were gunned \ndown in a 5-minute hail of furious bullets, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have done nothing to try to prevent these kinds of mass \natrocities in the future.\n  I come down here today not just to challenge this place to act but to \ntell you a little bit about what I have learned in the last year. I \nhave learned a lot, but I want to distill it down to two pretty simple \nthings I have learned.\n  I did not work on the issue of gun violence when I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, in part because my corner of Connecticut \ndid not have tremendously high levels of gun deaths. Now it is central \nto my mission as a Senator.\n  What I have learned over the last year is that despite all the \nrhetoric we hear from the gun lobby, when you change gun laws to keep \nguns out of the hands of criminals and to take dangerous military-style \nweapons and ammunition off of the streets, guess what happens. \nCommunities become safer. The data tells us this.\n  Since 1998 the National Instant Criminal Background Check System has \nblocked more than 2 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers. That is \nup to 2 million criminals--people with criminal histories who should \nnot have bought a gun--who were prohibited from buying a gun. The \nbackground check system works but for the fact that only about 60 \npercent of gun purchases actually go through the system because more \nand more guns are being bought in online sales, more and more guns are \nbeing bought online, and more and more guns are being bought at gun \nshows.\n  We know background checks work because we have stopped 2 million \npeople who would be prohibited from owning guns because they have a \nhistory of domestic abuse or serious felonies or mental illness. Two \nmillion times we have stopped those people from getting guns.\n  Second, we can compare what happens in States with near universal \nbackground check systems versus States that have looser laws. I will \ngive you one statistic, for instance. In States that require a \nbackground check for every handgun sale, there is a 38-percent \nreduction in the number of women who are shot to death by intimate \npartners. Deaths from domestic violence are almost 40-percent less in \nStates that have near universal background checks.\n  The same data exists for assault weapons as well. In 1994 we passed \nthe assault weapons ban. Over the next 9 years crimes committed with \nassault weapons declined by two-thirds.\n  There are legitimate arguments that there are other factors that \ncontributed to that decline, but certainly a portion of that decline is \nconnected to the restriction on assault weapons. Thirty-seven percent \nof police departments reported a noticeable increase in criminals' use \nof assault weapons since the 1994 Federal ban expired.\n  When it comes to these high-capacity magazine clips, we do not need \nthe data that is out there because common sense tells us that if \nsomebody decides to do mass damage with a high-powered weapon, they are \ngoing to do less damage if they only have 10 bullets in a clip rather \nthan 30. Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Elementary School got off 154 bullets \nand killed 20 children and 6 adults in less than 5 minutes. In Tucson, \na 74-year-old retired Army colonel and a 61-year-old woman were able to \nsubdue the shooter when he went to change cartridges. In Aurora, the \nrampage essentially stopped when James Holmes went to switch \ncartridges. When you have to reload multiple times, there are multiple \nopportunities for these mass shootings to stop. We should do things to \nmake sure the shootings never begin in the first place, but the carnage \nis much worse when these madmen are walking into shopping plazas, movie \ntheaters, and schools with 30-round clips and 100-round drums.\n  But here is the second thing I have learned. I learned this as well \nover the last year. I have learned about the amazing ability of good to \ntriumph over evil even when this place does not act to change the laws. \nI have learned that despite the evil of those 5 minutes in Sandy Hook, \nthe community of Newtown has amazingly found a way over and over to \nbring so much beauty and goodness to essentially cover up and drown out \nthat horror. I have seen these kids' memories become the inspiration \nfor literally thousands of acts of generosity and kindness.\n  Daniel Barden was a genetically compassionate little kid. He was that \nkid who always sat with the kid in school who did not have anybody \nsitting next to them on the bus or in the classroom. When his parents \nwould take him to the supermarket, they would be all the way to their \ncar with their groceries, and they would look back and Daniel would \nstill be at the door holding open the grocery store door for people who \nwere leaving.\n  His parents started a Facebook page that challenges people to engage \nin little, small acts of kindness in Daniel's memory. It had about \n40,000 likes the last time I had checked, and the stories are endless--\na woman who bought coffee and doughnuts for a firehouse in New York \nState; a Missouri woman who helped restock a food pantry in Daniel's \nhonor; a woman in Illinois who paid for a stranger's meal and just \nwrote ``Love from Daniel Barden'' on the bill.\n  Jack Pinto was a very active 6-year-old boy. He enjoyed playing \nsports of all kinds. He was buried in his New York Giants jersey. His \nparents, Dean and Tricia Pinto, have raised money and put some of their \nown money in to pay for hundreds of children all around the country to \nhave access to the same kind of opportunity to play sports that Jack \nhad, despite the fact that their families might not have the resources \nthe Pintos do.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  Jessica Rekos loved animals. She loved whales and horses most, so her \nparents started a foundation, the Jessica Rekos Foundation, and they \nhave provided yearlong scholarships for horseback riding lessons for \nstudents who would not otherwise have the resources to be able to have \nthe opportunity to enjoy horses in the same way Jessica did.\n  This week an effort is under way in Newtown and across the Nation to \ninspire people to every day do a different act of kindness as a way to \npay tribute to the 1-year anniversary. These charities that have sprung \nup in the wake of Newtown are doing amazing work to change people's \nlives--just the small acts of kindness that maybe we all do in trying \nto pay tribute to the memory of those kids and those adults. That makes \na difference.\n  Charitable acts and changes in behavior--they are necessary although \ninsufficient responses to the scourge of gun violence that plagues our \nNation.\n  This place has to change the laws. Do something because you do not \nwant to be next. You do not want to be sitting on a train station \nplatform, as I was on December 14, when you get a call that 10 or 20 or \n30 or 40 kids or adults have been gunned down in your State. You \ncertainly do not want to get that call when you had a chance, but you \ndid not take it, to do something to prevent it.\n  I got calls that day from my colleagues all across the country \nbecause there are not many corners of the Nation that have not been \ntouched by gun violence. Some 11,000 people have been killed by guns \nsince December 14 of last year. When one person is killed, \npsychologists tell us there are 10 other people who sustain life-\naltering trauma as a result of that shooting. So just imagine when 26 \nkids and adults die in a small community.\n  So I wish to leave you not with my words but with the words of a \nmother from Sandy Hook who represents the scope of the trauma that has \nbeen the reality for Sandy Hook for the last 365 days. Sandy Hook is \nrecovering but very slowly. The charities and the acts of kindness, \nthey make a difference, but there is a lot of head shaking in that \ncommunity as to why this place has not risen to the occasion, shown the \nsame type of courage those families have and done something to change \nthe reality of everyday and exceptional mass violence across this \ncountry.\n  Here is what this mother writes. These are her words in an open \nletter:\n\n       In addition to the tragic loss of her playmates, friends, \n     and teachers, my first grader suffers from PTSD. She was in \n     the first room by the entrance to the school. Her teacher was \n     able to gather the children into the tiny bathroom inside the \n     classroom. There she stood, with 14 of her classmates and her \n     teacher, all of them crying. You see, she heard what was \n     happening on the other side of the wall. She heard \n     everything. She was sure that she was going to die that day \n     and did not want to die before Christmas. Imagine what this \n     must have been like. She struggles nightly with nightmares, \n     difficulty falling asleep, and being afraid to go anywhere in \n     her own home. At school she becomes withdrawn, crying daily, \n     covering her ears when it gets too loud and waiting for this \n     to happen again. She is 6.\n       And we are furious. We are furious that 26 families must \n     suffer with grief so deep and so wide that it is \n     unimaginable. We are furious that the innocence and safety of \n     my children's lives have been taken. Furious that someone had \n     access to the type of weapon used in this massacre. Furious \n     that gun makers make ammunition with such high rounds and our \n     government does nothing to stop them. Furious that the ban on \n     assault weapons was carelessly left to expire. Furious that \n     lawmakers let the gun lobbyists have so much control. Furious \n     that somehow, someone's right to own a gun is more important \n     than my children's right to life. Furious that lawmakers are \n     too scared to take a stand.\n\n  She finishes by writing this:\n\n       I ask you to think about your choices. Look at the pictures \n     of the 26 innocent lives taken so needlessly and wastefully, \n     using a weapon that never should have been in the hands of \n     civilians. Really think. Changing the laws may \n     ``inconvenience'' some gun owners, but it may also save a \n     life, perhaps a life that is dear to me or you. Are you \n     really willing to risk it? There must not be another Sandy \n     Hook. You have a responsibility and an obligation to act now \n     and to change the laws.\n       I hope and pray that you do not fail.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, many words have been spoken since \nNewtown, including the very powerful words of my colleague just now. \nBut the plain, simple fact is no words can capture what I feel about \nthat day. No words ever will capture that day or the days and weeks and \nmonths afterwards, when we have grieved and healed and resolved that we \nwill do everything within our power to make sure that kind of massacre \nnever happens again.\n  But equally important is that the deaths by gunfire are reduced or \nprevented--those 26 senseless, unspeakable deaths of 20 beautiful \nchildren and 6 great educators but also the 194 children who have been \nkilled by gunfire since Newtown, and the 10,000 or more deaths caused \nby gunfire, person by person, a tragic river of senseless deaths that \nwe have the power to prevent, the power in this body and the power in \nthis Nation.\n  As much as we should be shamed and embarrassed by the failure to act, \nwe also must have hope and resolve that we will act. History is on our \nside. The example of courage and strength provided by those families \nought to give us the resolve and the determination to act; likewise, \nthe examples of courage and resolve by Father Bob Weiss, who had a \nservice in St. Rose of Lima on the evening of December 14, one of the \nmost moving public experiences I will ever have. As I said then, the \nworld is watching Newtown. The world has watched Newtown. It has \nwatched First Selectman Pat Llodra, who has led Newtown with her own \ncourage and strength and determination, including coming here as my \nguest on the night of the State of the Union to be an example for all \nof us about what a public official can do by her own example, leading \nby her own example.\n  We will mark, this Saturday morning, at St. Rose of Lima the 1-year \nanniversary at a service Senator Murphy and I will attend. I have worn \nsince virtually that day a bracelet. I wear it now. It says, ``We are \nNewtown. We choose love.'' If there is a message for all of us in this \nChamber, it is that we continue to choose love. We are all Newtown. Our \ntown is Newtown. All of our towns are Newtown. I see this bracelet \nliterally from the time I wake in the morning to when I go to bed. It \nwill always be an inspiration for me, inescapably our hearts and minds \ngo back to that moment when we first learned about this horrific, \nunspeakable tragedy.\n  Of course, I went to the Newtown firehouse that day. The sights and \nsounds of grief and pain are seared in my memory. They will be with me \nforever. So will be the story of the children whom we lost: Grace \nMcDonnell and Allison Wyatt, who loved to draw pictures for their \nfamilies and planned to be artists; Chase Kowalski, a Cub Scout who \nloved playing baseball with his father; Jessica Rekos, who wanted to \nresearch orca whales and become a cowgirl.\n  We will never forget the heroism and the bravery of the educators \nsuch as Vicki Soto and Anne Marie Murphy. Vicki Soto is in this \npicture. Her brother Carlos came to a service today here in Washington. \nHe has continued, and so have his sisters, to come to events that \nprovide impetus and movement and momentum to the effort to stop gun \nviolence.\n  Vicki Soto and Anne Marie Murphy literally shielded their students, \nsought to save them with their own bodies. Dawn Hochsprunk and Mary \nSherlach ran unhesitatingly toward the danger entering their school and \nperished doing so. There are heroes in this story. It is not only about \nbad people who used guns improperly and illegally; it is not only about \nevil; it is also about good. The good includes the first responders and \npolice who stopped the shooting when they came to the school and ran \ntoward danger and toward gunfire and thereby ended it, when the shooter \ntook his own life.\n  It is also about Ana Marquez-Greene, a beautiful girl who loved music \nand flowers, loved to wear flowers in her hair. She was described by \nBishop Leroy Bailey as a beautiful, adoring child. That picture evokes \nthe stories of all of those children: beautiful, adoring, a future and \na life ahead of them.\n  For all of those stories and the tears, and the teddy bears and \ntributes that were outside of the firehouse, Newtown has refused to be \ndefined simply by tragedy; refused to be locked in its past. It has \nmoved forward, because Newtown is not just a moment, it is a movement. \nIt is not just a moment in\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nhistory defined by tragedy, it is a movement to make the world better. \nIt is a movement to make America safer.\n  That is the movement we have articulated and sought to advance. Those \nfamilies, including Neil Heslin, who has come here numerous times for \nhis son Jesse, have been an example of courage. Indeed, they have been \nprofiles in courage. When Neil Heslin dropped Jesse off at school on \nthe morning of December 14, Jesse gave him a hug and said: ``It's going \nto be all right. Everything's going to be OK, Dad,'' because Jesse was \nthat kind of kid, Neil told the Senate Judiciary Committee in his \ntestimony. His pride in Jesse, as well as his grief, brought tears to \nall of our eyes.\n  Jesse was just that kind of kid. He never wanted to leave a baby \ncrying. He never wanted to leave anybody feeling hurt. Jesse and Neil \nused to talk about coming to Washington, about meeting with the \nPresident. Neil met with the President but Jesse was not there, at \nleast physically he was not there. He was with all of us as we worked \nwith Neil to make America safer and make sure Newtown is not a moment \nbut a movement toward a better, safer America.\n  I thank my colleagues for the outpouring of feeling and support on \nthe eve of that tragedy. It was a rare moment of bipartisan unison and \nfeeling as well as words. I wish to thank them as well for meeting with \nmany of those families because they demonstrated a graciousness and \ngenerosity regardless of their views on any of the issues relating to \ngun violence and any of the bills on the floor. That graciousness and \ngenerosity I hope will prevail on this issue and again move us forward.\n  The acts of kindness and generosity that followed have been inspiring \nas well.\n  College students and firefighters have come together to build \nplaygrounds in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. Bill Lavin of New \nJersey, on behalf of the New Jersey firefighter system, has done \nyeoman's work. There are now new playgrounds in their memory in \nNorwalk, New London, Fairfield, Ansonia, Westport, and Stratford.\n  I have visited many of them. They are distinct, reflecting the \ncharacter of those children such as Ana Marquez-Greene.\n  The Newtown High School football team took time away from celebrating \na perfect winning season to devote their efforts to the children and \neducators we have lost.\n  The Sandy Hook Run for the Families not only raised more than \n$450,000 for the Sandy Hook Support Fund, but it also broke the world \nrecord for attendance. In millions of actions, large or small, in \nConnecticut, all around the country, the people of Newtown, the State \nof Connecticut, and the country showed what compassion, giving, and \nkindness truly means in action. They chose to honor them by action.\n  Often the compassion and kindness unleashed by the Newtown tragedy \ntook many other forms that were unheralded, unreported, and unspoken. \nThese were acts of kindness that were not in the newspapers or in the \npublic view but simply acts that meant something to the recipient and \nto the giver.\n  These fundraisers and vigils, emails and postcards, small and large \nsigns of recognition and love from our colleagues, from people across \nthe country, are a form of giving back. They give me hope that \neventually we will prevail in this effort to make a difference.\n  Scarlett Lewis, Jesse's mom, is also a hero. She heard about the Cruz \nfamily who had lost two of their children to a drunk driver. Scarlett \nresponded with that same resilience and strength by offering to give a \nfundraiser for the Cruz family.\n  When she was asked about her family and about what she had done, she \nexplained:\n\n       What brings meaning to the suffering is doing something for \n     someone else. . . . In doing something for them I'm also \n     helping my own healing.\n\n  Nearly 90 percent of Americans support commonsense measures such as \nbackground checks, a number that is virtually unchanged since the issue \nsoared to the forefront of our political discourse in the wake of Sandy \nHook. Even in gun-owning households the support is virtually identical, \n88 percent. That figure hasn't changed. A mountain of public support \nhas failed to produce measures, but our resolve is unchanged because \nthose memories of Sandy Hook, those examples of kindness and \ncompassion, will drive us forward, as will the more than 10,000 other \nvictims including at least 14 children under the age of 12 in 43 \ndifferent States.\n  Congress has shamefully and disgracefully failed to act, but that is \nnot the end of the story. There has been one vote, and we lost, but \nthat vote is not the end of this movement. Newtown is not a moment. It \nis a movement. Surrender is unacceptable; the status quo is \ninexcusable. The families and Newtown community have refused to \nsurrender to personal despair, and we cannot surrender to political \ndismay or difficulty.\n  I was moved the other day when I saw a clip of Ronald Reagan \nendorsing the Brady bill. Ronald Reagan, as President, was a victim of \ngun violence, as was Jim Brady, who was paralyzed by the same hail of \nbullets that struck the President of the United States when they were \nfired by a deranged person, John Hinckley.\n  Twelve years passed before the Brady bill was passed. It was 12 years \nof struggle, work, resolve, and courage by Sarah and Jim Brady, with \neventually an endorsement by Ronald Reagan.\n  The sadness and anger I feel today, prompted by the memory of that \ntragedy and this body's failure to respond, is mitigated by the \nknowledge that history is on our side, that America is better than the \noath we took in April. The people of Newtown have not failed. The \npeople of America have not failed, and this body has not yet failed.\n  We can and we will do better because Newtown and that vote will be \nwith us.\n  Newtown is more than a moment. It is a movement that eventually will \nprevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  Mr. BURR. I rise to address the nomination of Cornelia Pillard to the \nDC Circuit Court. This nomination is a good example of government \noverreach that has led to things such as the ObamaCare debacle.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who have been on the floor speaking about \nNewtown, I had an opportunity to spend an hour with parents of Newtown \nchildren. It is a compelling personal story that they shared.\n  No parent should have to watch a child die. No parent should have to \nlive and a child die. My heart still goes out to those who lost \nchildren at Newtown.\n  Today, with the Affordable Care Act fresh on my mind, I venture back \nto think about when I came to the floor in 2009 and said in front of my \ncolleagues of the Senate and the American people--I wish to spend the \nbalance of this second half of the hour rehashing some of the things I \ncame to the floor to talk about.\n  There were numerous opportunities before the legislation was passed. \nI remember it was very close to Christmas in December of 2009.\n  I said premiums will increase for younger and healthier individuals \nbecause of the new federally mandated rating rules. Over 40 percent of \nthe uninsured are ages 18 to 34, the same group that will be hit with \nthe highest increases if this bill passes.\n  What do we hear Americans are focused on today? Young people. Are \nthey going to join?\n  Today their insurance is three times lower than what it will be in \nJanuary of 2014. Why? Because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  No. 2, premiums will increase because of new federally mandated \ninsurance standards. Experts estimate many of the health plans \npurchased today by individuals and small businesses will not meet the \nminimum requirements mandated by this bill, which means that all \nAmericans will be forced to buy richer plans.\n  Let me remind those who are listening that this was in 2009 on the \nSenate floor. Listening to the comments of those today who say we never \nanticipated some of these things would happen--if they didn't \nanticipate, it is not because people weren't on the Senate floor. It \nwasn't because we made this up. It is because people who were experts, \nCMS actuaries, CBO administrators, were sharing with us what would \nhappen if this legislation became law.\n  Premiums will increase because of new federally mandated benefit \npackages. The bill empowers the Secretary\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nof Health and Human Services to decide which benefits are covered and \nwhich benefits are not.\n  What are Americans learning every single day? When they can get on \nthe exchange, they are finding that they are 65 years old and they have \nto have maternity coverage.\n  I turned 58 and my wife has pretty much informed me we are not going \nto have more children, but I can't buy coverage without maternity \ncoverage. Why? Because they want to charge me more to shift that cost.\n  We didn't have health care reform. We just changed where we are \nshifting the cost from. Now we are embedding the premium versus \ncharging more at the delivery point of health care and shifting it \nwithin the delivery system.\n  We are shifting it within the population by charging those of us who \nare a little bit older more--because we mandate that we have to have \nservices we are never going to use--and younger people who are healthy \nwho probably are never going to need to go to the doctor. I hope they \ndo because prevention is actually one of the most beneficial things we \ncan promote. Now we are going to charge them three times what they were \npaying, and we believe they will take it?\n  Premiums will increase because of the new excise tax on medical \ndevices. Innovation is what saves health care dollars. Yet in the \nAffordable Care Act, or what some call ObamaCare, we actually put new \ntaxes on medical devices.\n  Every time we have a stent that is inserted, every time a medical \ndevice is used on a person, their health care bill goes up because we \nhave now taxed the device they are using. If the device price goes up, \nand the reimbursement goes up, the premium goes up.\n  It is starting to make some sense. Again, this was in 2009 before we \npassed the bill. Premiums will increase because of a new excise tax on \nhealth plans.\n  We actually taxed the same health plans that are in the exchange that \nwe told everybody would save them money. Premiums will increase because \nof the new excise tax on prescription drugs. Wait a minute. I thought \nwe were bringing down the cost of health care.\n  In 2009, again, new taxes on devices, new taxes on health plans, new \ntaxes on prescription drugs, these were all things that we all knew. \nThe President knew it. My colleagues who voted for the plan knew it, \nbut everybody seems to have amnesia today: Oh, my gosh. How could the \ncosts go up? I never knew this was going to require people to buy a \nhealth insurance policy that had benefits they would never use.\n  Premiums will increase because of a new fee to sell plans in the \nmandated exchanges. This phenomenal exchange market that created \ncompetition, we now created a new fee on the part of insurers to enter \nthe exchange. Premiums will increase because of a new tax for \ncomparative effectiveness.\n  Comparative effectiveness means we are trying to bring new generics, \nwhether they are in pharmaceuticals or biologics to the marketplace. We \nhave decided to tax that process. Premiums will increase because the \nbill forces 15 million more Americans to enroll in Medicaid.\n  Why is that happening? It happens because doctors are paid so little \non Medicaid that they have to charge more for everybody else. We are \ncost shifting when we purchase the premium, and all of a sudden we are \nlearning we are cost shifting even when the service is delivered. \nReform? No.\n  In 2009, again I came to the floor and I talked about the Affordable \nCare Act, ObamaCare. Zero times did it mention provisions prohibiting \nthe rationing of health care--zero. Nine times it mentioned new taxes \ncreated in the bill. Thirteen pages are in the table of contents. The \nbill weighed 20.88 pounds and it took 36 pages for the CBO to estimate \nthe pricetag of ObamaCare; 70 government programs authorized by the \nbill, and 1,697 times in the Affordable Care Act the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services was given the authority to create, determine, \nand define things in the bill. This is a bureaucrat whom we allowed \n1,697 times to determine what Congress's intent was in the legislation \nthrough almost 3,000 pages; 3,609 times the word ``shall,'' not \n``may,'' was in the bill. It cost $6.8 million to taxpayers per word.\n  Let me remind you. This is what I came to the floor and talked about \nin 2009 before the Senate passed this legislation in the dark of night.\n  Twenty-four million people left without health care. This is the bill \nthat was supposed to insure everybody. Twenty-four million people \nwithout health insurance; a $1.2 billion cost to the taxpayer per page, \nand $5 billion to $10 billion of additional funding needed for the IRS' \nimplementation of the bill.\n  In other words, we are going to fund $5 billion to $10 billion for \nthe IRS to chase down people who owe a penalty because they made the \ndetermination they couldn't afford or they didn't need health care \ninsurance.\n  There are $8 billion in taxes levied on uninsured individuals. There \nis a way to make health care affordable--tax people who don't have it.\n  So $25 billion of additional Medicaid mandates placed on States; $28 \nbillion in new taxes on employers not providing the government-approved \nplans; $100 billion estimated annually of fraud in Medicare and \nMedicaid; $118 billion in cuts in Medicare Advantage--to seniors all \nacross this country who found this product to be the one that provided \nthe most security and benefits for them; $465 billion in cuts to \nMedicare--cuts to Medicare. This was the health care system that was at \nthat time projected to be insolvent by 2017.\n  There are $494 billion in revenues from new taxes, fees, levied on \nAmerican families and businesses; a $2.5 trillion cost for full \nimplementation of the legislation.\n  At that time we had a $12 trillion debt. Today, we have a $17 \ntrillion debt. Health care was supposed to be more affordable because \nwe reformed it. We didn't reform it. We took it over. The Federal \nGovernment took it over.\n  Let me go to another process I talked about in 2009. This is all \nmarked up. It has been in my desk drawer since then. It is a word \nsearch of the bill. There are 4,677 times where the legislation said \nshall, must or require; 899 times it said tax, fee or revenue; 470 \ntimes it said agency, department, commission, panel or bureau; 196 \ntimes it said regulate or regulation; 134 times it mentioned treatment; \n180 times it mentioned prevention; 40 times it mentioned choice; 25 \ntimes it mentioned innovation; and 13 times it mentioned competition.\n  If we listen to those who are out selling this awful plan today, what \nare the three words we hear? Choice, innovation, competition--those \nthings that are mentioned the least in the almost 3,000 pages of health \ncare legislation in 2009. This bill wasn't reform. This bill spent \ntrillions of dollars at a time of record deficits and debt. When fully \nimplemented, I said then, this bill is projected to cost $2.5 trillion \nover 10 years. CBO said at the time that this bill will increase \nFederal health costs, not lower it.\n  What have we heard from the President? It is going to lower health \ncosts. It is going to bring it down. It is going to be more affordable. \nMiddle class, this is the greatest deal for you.\n  The bill raised taxes by more than $500 billion at a time of record \nunemployment. The bill violated the President's own pledge to protect \nthe middle class. Who gets taxed in this bill? Again, this is from 2009 \non the Senate Floor, right here, before the vote. Uninsured Americans, \ninsured Americans, families with high-value insurance plans, high \nhealth costs, small business, individuals who need medicines or medical \ndevices, and employers that provide retiree drug coverage. Employers \nthat provide retiree drug coverage, we tax them.\n  The bill cut $466 billion in Medicare to fund new government \nprograms. Medicare faced at that time a $38 trillion underfunded \nliability and insolvency that was projected to occur in 2017. Instead \nof fixing those problems, this bill raided Medicare to start a new \ngovernment entitlement. The bill cut Medicare Advantage. It cut \nhospitals, it cut nursing homes, it cut home health, and it cut \nhospice.\n  Nobody in the administration can go out today and say: Oh my gosh, we \ndidn't know this was going to happen. We talked about it right here day \nafter day after day.\n  These are not things we made up. If we did, we would be prophets, \nbecause they are all coming true. Everything is aligning with what we \nsaid.\n  The bill would increase premiums, making care more expensive, not \nless. I mean let's get past what was the easy\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\npart, and that was setting up the exchange, setting up the Web site. Or \nat least it should have been.\n  New taxes in this bill will get passed on to consumers, increasing \nyearly premiums--this is what I said then; listen to this--by $488 a \nyear, according to some estimates. The average premium would increase \nby $2,100 for a family policy in the individual market.\n  There are individuals who are seeing $488 a month in increase, and in \naddition to that a deductible they have never had applied to them \nbefore.\n  This bill imposed costly new burdens on struggling States. The bill \nthreatens health care choices millions now enjoy with a tangled web of \nnew rules, regulations, and government-run plans. The government will \nrequire you to purchase insurance or face a fine and will tell you what \nkind of insurance you have to have, even if you like what you currently \nhave.\n  I am not a prophet. I was going by what the experts said in reading \nthe bill. So for everybody who went out and said: If you like your \ninsurance, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep him; \nif you like your hospital, you can keep it--we were on the Senate Floor \nsaying: That is not what the bill says. It is not going to happen.\n  This bill cut $135 billion from hospitals, $120 billion from 11 \nmillion seniors on Medicare Advantage, nearly $15 billion from nursing \nhomes, nearly $40 billion from home health agencies, nearly $7 billion \nfrom hospice. Cutting Medicare to fund a new government program in my \nbook is not reform. It is ignorance.\n  The CMS Office of the Actuary--let me tell you, the Actuary is like \nthe gold standard. The CMS Actuary is like the guy who puts that stamp \nof approval on it, and there is nobody higher from the standpoint of \nwhat the actuary says. He says the bill increases national health \nexpenditures. National health expenditures under this bill would \nincrease by an estimate of a total of $234 billion, 0.7 percent, during \n2010 and 2019.\n  That is exactly the opposite of what everybody is out saying today. \nDespite promises that reform would reduce health care spending growth, \nthe bill actually bends the health care curve upward. According to the \nanalysis, the national health expenditure as a share of GDP is \nprojected to be 20.9 in 2019, compared to 20.8 percent under current \nlaw.\n  How could you go out and make a claim this was bending the cost curve \ndown? How could you promise the American people it was going to be \ncheaper?\n  The total number of persons with employer coverage in 2019, according \nto the CMS Actuary pre-2009, when the bill was passed, was projected to \nbe 5 million lower under the reform package than under current law. Let \nme say that again. The CMS Actuary told us in 2009, before we passed \nthis bill, that employer-based coverage would drop by 5 million \nindividual covered lives. I might say that some estimates are coming in \nat 100 million employees losing their health care under employer plans \nright now.\n  The new fees for drugs, devices, and insurance plans in the bill will \nincrease prices and health insurance premium costs for consumers, and \nthis will increase the national health expenditure by approximately $11 \nbillion per year.\n  The bill funds $930 billion in new Federal spending by relying on \nMedicare payment cuts which are unlikely to be sustainable or \npermanent. As a result, providers could find it difficult to remain \nprofitable; and absent legislative intervention, they might end their \nparticipation in the Medicare program, possibly jeopardizing the care \nto beneficiaries.\n  See, it wasn't Republicans who talked about rationing, it was the \nActuary at CMS in his analysis of the Affordable Care Act. He said: \nHere is what is going to happen. It is seniors who are going to get \nhosed on it because they are not going to have access to the doctors \nanymore.\n  The bill is especially likely to result in providers being unwilling \nto treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, meaning that a significant \nportion of the increased demand for Medicaid services would be \ndifficult to meet.\n  How could anybody listen or read what the CMS Actuary said and \nremotely go out and tell the American people: Geez, this is going to \nincrease coverage for everybody.\n  The CMS Actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill could \njeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. He also found that \nroughly 20 percent--20 percent--of all Part A providers--hospitals, \nnursing homes, et cetera--would become unprofitable within the next 10 \nyears as a result of these cuts, meaning they are going to go out of \nbusiness.\n  You know, pretty soon it is not going to be the network the insurance \nprovider put together, it is going to be the fact the hospital went out \nof business because they couldn't withstand what this bill has done to \nthem.\n  The CMS Actuary found further that reductions in Medicare growth \nrates through the actions of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board--\nnow, that is going to sound a little odd to some because prior to the \nbill passing it was called the Independent Medicare Advisory Board, but \nit is now called the Independent Payment Advisory Board--IPAB--an \nentity that when set up and it is kicked in--16 members picked by the \nPresident--will determine reimbursements and scope of coverage. It is \nnot the Congress of the United States. If we don't legislatively do \nsomething with their recommendation, it becomes law. It goes into \neffect.\n  The bill would cut payments to Medicare Advantage plans by \napproximately $110 billion over 10 years resulting in less generous \nbenefit packages and decreasing enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans \nby about 33 percent. So 33 percent of seniors would lose their \nAdvantage plan. Again, this is 2009. This is not today.\n  The President, in 3,000 pages said it would reduce costs. The chief \nactuary says that is not the case.\n  Let me read a letter I got in the last couple of weeks from Lori \nPerez from Willow Springs, NC.\n\n       I am a divorced mom of three. I received insurance through \n     my employer. My rate has increased $100 a month. This is a \n     huge difference that will have to be budgeted by reducing \n     groceries and foregoing my son's braces I had planned for \n     2014. I looked into dropping my company provided insurance to \n     join an exchange but I do not qualify to receive a subsidy \n     because my insurance rate is less than 9\\1/2\\ percent of my \n     income. It is 9 percent. My yearly income qualifies. \n     Apparently, Obama thinks I can afford an additional $1,200 a \n     year. I am considering dropping my insurance, paying out of \n     pocket as needed for health care, and paying the fine at the \n     end of the year. It would be less expensive. This is \n     ridiculous. What can we do?\n\n  What do you say to Lori? Oops. That is the law. Here is somebody who \nwas 100 percent satisfied, an employer doing the right thing, and the \nFederal Government has now put her in a situation where she is \nconsidering just giving up her health care, doing away with it. Why? \nBecause she can't afford it. This is a woman with a job. She is \nthinking about giving up her groceries and delaying her son's braces. \nWhy? Because of ObamaCare.\n  Where are we today? Let me speed forward. I said we have the health \ncare exchange, the healthcare.gov Web site. There are companies every \nday that get Web sites set up. This one is complicated. They had 3 \nyears to do it. It still is not right today. But I am convinced they \nwill get it right.\n  For the first time the American people are getting on the Web site \nand they are able to look at the health care options they have. And \nwhat are they finding? They are finding that the premium costs for \nsomething equal to what they had are two times, three times more \nexpensive per month. They are finding this new thing they have never \nhad before called deductibles. And I am not talking about a $100 \ndeductible that you pay before you get participation in a doctor's \nvisit or an emergency room visit; I am talking about $1,000, $3,000, \n$5,000. I have heard from friends who have now signed up for plans and \nhave a $15,000 deductible.\n  I say to my colleagues--especially my colleague from Florida--it \nsounds like a health savings account, doesn't it? You have insurance, \nbut you are responsible for the first $15,000. The guy who shared that \nwith me, his premium is $1,444 a month with a $15,000 deductible. I \ndon't think he is going to drop it, but sticker shock is rampant.\n  Benefit package. How many people have come up to me and said: I am \nnot going to have any more children, but I have to have maternity \ncoverage. Something is wrong.\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\n  They are right--something is wrong.\n  How many kids would like to have a scaled-down version that allows \nthem to have a set of benefits, and they are willing to roll the dice, \nand if something bad happens, they will pay out of pocket? No, they \ndon't get that option. The choice does not exist--unless it is a choice \nof the things created in the Affordable Care Act.\n  Networks. This is one the American people haven't gotten to yet, and \nI can't wait until it happens. I have gone through getting on the DC \nexchange and going through the process of trying to figure out whether \nmy doctor in North Carolina is available in this plan or that plan. \nWait until the American people go onto healthcare.gov and they start \npicking a plan and look to see: Is my primary doctor on there? Is my \nhospital on there? Is the specialist I see on there? Are the drugs that \nI take on this plan?\n  This is incredibly complicated. The American people were used to \ncalling their insurance broker and saying: Here is how much coverage I \nwant, here is how much I have to spend, and here is my health \ncondition. And they designed a program to meet their health condition, \ntheir income, and their age. Now we penalize you for your age--if you \nare old or young--and we force everybody to take the same benefit \npackage regardless of whether they can afford it, and we say: If you \ndon't get it, we are going to charge you this year a 1-percent penalty \non your income, and that goes up to 2\\1/2\\ percent at the end of the \ntransition period.\n  We are going to get past this period which I call the enrollment plan \nperiod. Next, we get to the part the President delayed. We never \nunderstood that something that was in statute, the executive branch \ncould just decide, no, it is not going to go into effect. But for large \nand small employers, they had a 1-year delay. All of a sudden, in 2015, \ntheir employees are going to be in the same marketplace that we are.\n  What makes that particularly difficult is we extended the enrollment \nperiod for individuals in healthcare.gov until March 31, 2014. They can \nstill enroll. Well, April 1, 2014, through April 27, 2014, insurers \nwill have to decide what their premium cost will be in 2015. So given \nthat they have no real experience on what the mix of ages and health \nconditions in their plan is, what are they going to do? They are going \nto err on the side of higher premiums; that is, higher than we will see \nin 2014, which a majority of the American people say are higher than \nthey can afford. Imagine what it is going to be like in 2015. And in \nthat group is the 80 percent of America, not the 5 to 10 percent who \nare provided for by employers today.\n  I see my colleague here, and I am infringing on his hour, but I do \nwant to stress one last thing. I mentioned only once the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board, IPAB. At the end of the day, mark my word, \neverything that I commented on I read from my 2009 notes--notes that I \ncame to the floor then and said: This bill shouldn't become law, and \nhere is why. I spent 5 minutes talking about that today.\n  But I am going to make this statement, and I will come back to the \nfloor 2 years from now when IPAB is up and running and the benefit \npackages have been cut down and the reimbursements have been cut to \ndoctors and hospitals, and I will point to the statement that I made \nhere that picking a 16-member advisory panel that has the authority and \nthe power to set the scope of coverage and, more importantly, the \nreimbursements will have a most devastating effect on health care in \nthis country.\n  It will ration health care because of the doctors who choose not to \nparticipate in plans that participate in the exchange. It will force \nhospitals out of accepting plans that participate in the exchange. And \nfor those of us forced by government to be in the exchange and to \nchoose, our choices will be gone. Our costs will go up. We will get \ncare--when we are queued in line or at the emergency room or from a \ndoctor we don't know or don't trust or from a hospital we have to drive \nto. It is not going to be reassuring to that mother who now has \nmaternity coverage but no obstetrician and no local hospital to deliver \na child because, you see, we didn't reform health care. We didn't do \nanything to liability. We just changed the pocket we pay out of. We \ntaxed everybody we could find to pay for it. And still--as I said in \n2009 and I believe will be true today--at the end of the process, there \nwill be 24 million people without health insurance. Why? Because of \nObamaCare. Because of the choice--or the lack of choice--we gave them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I intend to be here for the next little \nbit--under an hour--sharing this time on the floor with you to discuss \nsome of the issues before us, particularly the pending issue before us \nof nominations and the concern we have about that.\n  People back home and across the country may be watching the news \ntonight or perhaps over the last few weeks they have watched the news \nand wonder what this debate is about. I wish to use this opportunity \ntonight to address the nomination of Cornelia Pillard for the DC \nCircuit because it is a good example of the government overreach that \nhas impacted all sorts of issues in our lives. So on this nomination \nissue, let's lay the groundwork here so people back home understand \nwhat is happening.\n  Last week or the week before last the Senate majority, by a simple \nmajority vote, changed the practice of the Senate that has existed here \nsince the beginning of the Senate, and they did so in an effort to grab \nmore power for themselves and the President.\n  Basically, here is the precedent which has been set here and which is \nexemplified by the nomination before us. The precedent which has been \nestablished from now on is that any Presidential nominee, except for \nthe Supreme Court--at least for now--is only going to need a simple \nmajority vote to confirm them. There are problems with that because in \nthe Constitution it gives the Senate--wisely--the power to advise and \nconsent. The reason that was done, especially for judges, is that these \nare lifetime appointments. When someone is made a Federal judge, it is \nfor the rest of their lives--unless they are impeached, which is a rare \noccurrence, thankfully. So these are people who are going to serve on \nthe bench for the rest of their working lives, making decisions about \nthe application and interpretation of our Federal laws. That is why the \nSenate was given this extraordinary opportunity to vet these people and \nto look for a supermajority of votes in this Chamber before someone is \nput in a position such as that. The other positions, of course, are \nCabinet nominees, and so forth, and those are very important as well.\n  By breaking the rules to change the rules of the Senate--something \nthat, by the way, we were told at least on two occasions this year was \nnot going to happen but ultimately did--what we basically saw was the \nramming through--just as ObamaCare was, on a party-line vote--of the \nPresident's nominees, and tonight's nominee is an example of that. This \nis going to have enormous consequences on this institution for sure. \nYou are seeing it play out tonight.\n  I say to my colleagues in the majority party that the history of this \nbody is that power trades hands. I believe that as early as January \nnext year when a new Congress reconvenes, you won't be in the majority, \nyou will be in the minority. Soon thereafter, there may be a Republican \nPresident appointing judges and appointing Cabinet members and other \nappointees. Now, all of a sudden, a simple majority is going to be \nenough, and you have set that precedent.\n  Beyond the impact that is going to have on this institution, it is \ngoing to have an impact on this country. It is going to have the impact \nof putting these activist judges, such as the nominee before us \ntonight, on the bench. It is going to have an impact on a wide range of \nissues, from ObamaCare, to the sanctity of life, to the Second \nAmendment, just to name a few.\n  Why does the majority want to pack this particulate bench, this \nparticular DC Circuit Court of Appeals with a supermajority? Why? Well, \nit is because it is a court which is often called the second highest \ncourt in the country. It is a court which is key in reviewing all these \nregulations that are being imposed upon us. It is a court which is key \nin reviewing all these assertions of Executive power that this \nPresident and other Presidents have instituted.\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\n  The current DC Circuit as currently made up has proven to be somewhat \nof an obstacle to the big-government agenda the White House and the \nmajority here in the Senate have been pursuing, and they don't like it. \nThat is, by the way, why the majority leader earlier this year said: We \nneed at least one more--meaning one more judge--and that will switch \nthat majority on that court. Well, with that vote, by changing the \nrules, that is what they are setting up for here.\n  Now they seek to expand it tonight or early tomorrow with a nominee \nwho, quite frankly, is completely out of the mainstream. For example, \non the question of abortion, do you know what Professor Pillard calls \npregnancy? ``Conscription into maternity.'' I don't know what that \nmeans, but I bet the vast majority of Americans would see that as \noutside the mainstream.\n  By the way, as you look at the majority pulling out all these stops \nto confirm controversial nominations, such as this one who is someone \ncompletely outside the mainstream, they do so despite the fact that \nthey have spent most of the last 10 years basically filibustering some \nof former President George W. Bush's best nominations to the judiciary, \nespecially to the DC Circuit. Let me give some examples.\n  Senate Democrats, over 2 years, refused to even give Peter Keisler a \nJudiciary Committee vote despite his extraordinary credentials and a \nrecord of public service. At the time, they argued among other things \nthat maybe the DC Circuit wasn't busy enough to warrant filling some of \nthese vacancies. He was just the most recent of several Republican \nnominees to the DC Circuit whom Senate Democrats blocked and \nfilibustered. There were others. For example, they successfully \nfilibustered Miguel Estrada, a Honduran-born legal superstar, a person \nwho some said may one day be the first American of Hispanic descent to \nserve as a Supreme Court Justice. Senate Democrats voted seven times to \nfilibuster this great American success story and this great judge. \nOther nominees to the DC Circuit, including then-California Supreme \nCourt justice Janice Rogers Brown and Brett Kavanaugh, also faced long \ndelays of failed cloture votes and filibuster attempts, as did, by the \nway, President Bush's nominees all across the country.\n  The numbers on this issue do not lie. Numbers are facts, and the \nnumbers don't lie about the double standard that has been applied here \ntoday. For example, tonight's vote on Judge Pillard will come after \njust 190 days after her nomination. For historical context, Senate \nDemocrats obstructed now-Chief Justice John Roberts' DC Circuit \nnomination by 729 days. Another impressive nominee whom I mentioned \nearlier, Mr. Cavanaugh, took 1,036 days. Miguel Estrada was obstructed \nfor 184 days. Janice Brown's nomination took 684 days. Tonight, 190 \ndays. And on that and similar cases, they have completely changed the \nrules of the Senate and how the Senate nominates people to lifetime \nappointments to the second highest court in the land.\n  But despite this record and despite the fact that the DC Circuit is \nstill known to be underworked today, the majority presses ahead on what \nwill be a midnight or 1 a.m. vote to install a controversial law \nprofessor on the Nation's second most important court.\n  So what has changed? What caused the same people who used to \nroutinely filibuster highly qualified judges to now come here and make \nthese changes?\n  What has changed is that now there is a Democrat in the White House. \nWhat has changed is they now want an ideologically compliant court. \nWhat they want is a liberal activist court, one that protects all the \nthings they have rammed through Congress over the years and imposed \nthrough regulations and pushed through Executive order.\n  Now we know why Senate Democrats were less interested in the workload \nof the DC Circuit or the objective qualifications of the nominees over \nthe past decade, why they were less concerned about that than they are \ntoday. It is because their dreams came true of having a Democrat in the \nWhite House and a majority in the Senate so their efforts to keep \nvacancies open, that is what has brought us here today, in order to \nfill them in order to radically change the Federal judiciary into their \nown image.\n  But I think what is important to understand is that this whole effort \nto start this debate about judges and all that is an effort to distract \nfrom another big government intrusion that everyone knows too well; \nthat is, ObamaCare. Interestingly enough, this Sunday I was at a \nwedding. I was approached by someone who had a story similar to what my \ncolleague from North Carolina just outlined. This is outside of \nObamaCare. This is someone who has employer-provided care, but that is \ngoing to be impacted by these changes that are happening in the law. \nShe had just gotten notice that her premiums had gone up, but here is \nwhat is worse. Her deductible had gone up to about $5,000 or $6,000. \nShe doesn't have $5,000 or $6,000. The way she quickly figured it out \nis she is going to have to spend $6,000 she doesn't even have before \nshe can even begin to use the health insurance plan that she can barely \nafford. She is basically uninsured.\n  I wish I could tell you that is a rare story and we are not getting a \nlot of input about that, but we are. This ObamaCare disaster is \nstarting to take its toll. I think it is unconscionable, by the way, \nthat the majority seeks to distract focus of this body on these \nimportant issues such as ObamaCare by pulling this stunt on the judges. \nBut what it doesn't stop is the wave of letters we are getting from \npeople all across the country. These letters are not talking points. \nThese are not complex policy analysis. These are not op-eds in \nnewspapers. These are the letters from real people who are being \nimpacted in real ways by this law.\n  I wish to share with you some of their stories. I am going to leave \ntheir last names out to protect their privacy, but I wish no share with \nyou some of these examples because these are very typical of the kinds \nof things we are hearing about all across the country.\n  Philip in Winter Springs. Philip is retired. He is living on a fixed \nincome with insurance from United Health Care that he has for himself \nand for his wife. His monthly premium increased from $530 to $867. That \nis over a 60-percent increase in his monthly premium and his $15 copay \nhas doubled now to $30.\n  How about Charles in Winter Garden? Charles had employer-provided \nhealth care which ObamaCare caused to spike in price nearly 80 percent \nmore for his plan and his deductible is $12,000. He cannot afford $156 \na week for health insurance if he wants to be able to provide for his \ntwo children and pay his bills.\n  Here is one from Janet in Titusville. Janet is a single mom who is \nlosing insurance for herself and her children in January. This is not \nJanet's first challenge with the economy, by the way. She has been \nunemployed for 3 years. She took an underemployed job to provide \ninsurance for her kids but only to lose it 1 year later. She just wants \ninsurance that doesn't cost nearly 10 percent of her income so she can \nprovide for her kids.\n  David in Lakewood Ranch has an insurance plan that will be canceled \nas of April 1, 2014. His current policy costs him about $291 a month \nwith a $6,000 deductible. The new policy his insurance company \nsuggested raises his monthly premium over 60 percent to $466 with a \n$12,000 deductible as well. David also looked at the silver plan for \nthe exchanges but the monthly costs would be $525, with a $7,500 \ndeductible. David's other problem is if he waits until his current plan \nis canceled on April 1, 2014, any other costs he has leading up to his \ndeductible did not count on the new policy so he will be spending even \nmore trying to reach a deductible that will increase along with his \nmuch higher monthly premiums. As he wrote to our office: I just want my \nold plan back.\n  Colleen in Winter Park is self-employed. She chose to have a plan \nthat costs her $60 a month because that is all she can afford. She says \nthat while she knows if she had to use her policy there would be \nhospital costs, she is more than willing to accept the risks.\n  Guess what. Her policy has been canceled. The new option is a $600-a-\nmonth plan and there is no way she can afford that plan. There is no \nway she can afford it.\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n  How about Sarah in Live Oak. Sarah had an individual policy for \nherself with a $2,000 deductible that ran $68 per month. Her plan has \nbeen canceled. Now she is looking at a $288-a-month plan with a $5,000 \ndeductible. She feels she has been lied to by the President and by \nCongress and who can blame her for feeling that way.\n  How about Warren in Sanford. Warren in Sanford had health insurance \nfor his family, four members of his family, with a monthly premium of \n$533 and a $10,000 deductible. While he would have preferred a lower \ndeductible because his family is healthy and he was willing to take \nthat risk, now that plan is gone. So Warren went on the exchanges to \nlook for a new policy. His new monthly price was $1,300, more than \ndouble his old plan, with a $13,000 deductible. As Warren noted: \n``Bottom line is I will be paying more and I will be getting less.'' He \nwill be forced to do things like skip vacations or miss out on his \nchildren's activities.\n  Then there is Joe in Melbourne Beach. Joe had a health care plan that \nwas canceled because of ObamaCare. He liked his plan. He told our \noffice that he ``took great care in selecting my plan that I felt was \nright for me and for my needs.'' Now he has to shop for a new plan and \nall he sees are more expensive options. He tried the ObamaCare Web \nsite, but it did not work for him, and on top of the Web site not \nworking he is nervous about security risks when it comes to submitting \nhis information to these Web sites.\n  There is Kenneth in Land O Lakes. He and his wife had a private \ninsurance plan for over 11 years, but they do not anymore. They \nreceived a letter in the mail canceling their plan, telling them that \n``due to the recent ACA legislation this policy is no longer \navailable.'' The new option that is available to him, by the way, is \nfrom an insurance company that had a premium that was double the price \nof his current plan: $2,400 more a year. He doesn't know how he is \ngoing to cover this additional expense.\n  I don't think anyone disputes that we have a health insurance problem \nin America. But this is a disaster. Of course they want to do this \njudge thing. Of course they want to trigger some sort of fight about \njudges, Republicans objecting to judges and nominees. If you supported \nthis, if you had voted for the law that does this to people, you don't \nwant to talk about this. If you are responsible for the passage of this \nlaw, if you have gone around the last 2 years bragging about this law, \nif you are the one who went around telling me if you have a policy you \nlike you can keep it, why would you ever want the world focused on \nthis?\n  The problem is people are going to be focused on this because this is \nno longer a theory. ObamaCare is no longer some theoretical thing that \nis going to happen at some point in the future to someone else. \nObamaCare is happening to real people right now. Right now, all over \nthis country, people are feeling these impacts. These are real people. \nThis is not some outside third-party group running a commercial. This \nis not someone here giving a speech about what they think is going to \nhappen. This is what is happening now and there are going to be more of \nthese and it is going to impact Republicans and Democrats and \nconservatives and liberals, red States and blue States. Everyone is \ngoing to be impacted by this. They already are being impacted by this. \nThis is going to have a dramatically negative impact on our economy, on \nour people, and our country as a whole.\n  That does not mean we do not have a health insurance issue that \nshould not be addressed. We could have addressed it and we still can \nby, for example, giving people more options in a truly vibrant, \nprivate, personal marketplace. Allow people to buy insurance from any \ncompany in America that will sell it to you. Allow people to buy it \nwith money that is not taxed, just like when your employer buys it for \nyou. Incentivize, encourage people, make it easier for people, make it \nmore rewarding and more flexible to put money in a health savings \naccount so you can have tax-free money you can use to pay your \ndeductible, to pay your copayments, to pay out of pocket, to pay for \nyour kid's braces. These are real options that are available to us, \nnone of which were pursued.\n  Instead, what was pursued is this big government solution, one-size-\nfits-all plan rammed down the throats of the American people just like \nthe judges, just like the nominee tonight. She is being rammed down our \nthroat. Because when what you stand for cannot withstand scrutiny, when \nyou have a judge such as the one before us tonight who is so outside \nthe mainstream, you don't want a process that examines their record and \nrequires consensus. You have to ram it through. When you have a law \nthat so fundamentally alters the makeup of American health care, you \ndon't want this thing being analyzed. You have to ram it through. They \ndid it on ObamaCare and they did it on judges.\n  There is a reason our Republic was set up this way. There is a reason \nthe system of checks and balances was set up this way. There is a \nreason the Senate was built this way, with people who serve 6-year \nterms, two per State. Because they wanted a Chamber that would slow \nthings down and look at them carefully and weigh them.\n  But you cannot do that when you are changing the rules to ram things \nthrough. What you are going to get are radical lifetime appointments to \nthe bench such as what we are on the verge of doing tonight in the \nSenate and what you get are these damaging changes to the law on health \ncare which leave people with fewer choices, with more expenses and, \nhere is the kicker, with less access to the quality health care that is \nsecond to none in the United States.\n  We have the best health care providers in the world. When rich and \npowerful people around this planet get sick, do you know where they \ncome? They come to the United States. They come to our centers of \nexcellence. Other places around the world have quality places similar \nto that too, but they are only available to people who have money to \npay out of pocket. Their government-run insurance plans don't allow you \nto do that. They socialize you. They force you to wait in line behind \nother people until your turn is up. The only people who can go to the \nfront and get the highest quality health care in many places on Earth \nare the richest people in the world who can afford to pay for that out \nof their pocket. This law brings us a little closer to that because \nmany of these quality providers, the Sloan-Ketterings, the Mayo \nClinics, the MD Andersons, these extraordinarily high-quality health \ncare centers, many of these are not on the health care plans at all. In \norder to fit under ObamaCare, you have to cut people out of the plan so \nwe get closer to the day when the only people who can afford to go to \nthese centers are people who can afford to pay for it out of their \npocket and everybody else, people on ObamaCare, they are just going to \nget whatever the plan covers. That is what you are stuck with. That is \nwhat we are headed toward.\n  We are going to deny the American people access to the highest \nquality health care system in the history of the world, not the best \nhealth insurance marketplace--there are reforms that need to happen \nthere--but qualitywise, second to none. We are going to deny people \naccess to that.\n  The other reason, by the way, this whole debate on judges is very bad \nfor the country is it distracts us from the fundamental issue of our \ntime, the central issue that faces our people and our country. It is \none that I wish we spent more time focused on around here. I think both \nparties are a little guilty of not focusing on it enough.\n  When I was a child, when I was younger, I had all kinds of ideas \nabout what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was blessed with parents \nwho taught me that every single one of these dreams are within my \nreach. From my earliest memories, my parents instilled in me the belief \nthat even though my family was not rich or powerful or connected, I \ncould grow up to be anything I set my mind to because I was in \nAmerica. Because I am an American. My parents knew America was special \nbecause they knew what life was like outside of it.\n\n  My parents were born into a society that most people are born into--\nwhere the success you have in life is predetermined by the family you \nwere born into. By the grace of God, my parents were able to come \nhere--the one place on Earth where that isn't true--and the promise of \nAmerica changed their lives.\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\n  My parents never made it big. My mother worked as a cashier, a hotel \nmaid, and even a stock clerk at Kmart. My dad was a bartender who \nprimarily worked at banquets. Through hard work and determination, my \nparents made it to the middle class, and they gave us, their children, \nthe opportunity to do all the things they were never able to do--to be \nanything we wanted to be. As I said, they were never rich, but my \nparents achieved the American dream.\n  That phrase, the ``American dream,'' is a phrase we use all the time, \nbut it is a phrase that is often misunderstood. The American dream has \nnever been about becoming wealthy or famous. Instead, it is about \npeople, like me, who were born and raised here. It is about things I \nsometimes think we take for granted.\n  The American dream, what is it about? It is about a happy and stable \nhome life where you can live without fear for your safety or the safety \nof your family. It is about the freedom to worship any way you want. It \nis about having the chance to get a good education and find a job that \nrewards hard work with financial security. The American dream is about \nbeing able to send your kids to college and being able to retire \ncomfortably. It is about the opportunity to pursue happiness without \nbeing limited by your social status or your background. Perhaps most of \nall, the American dream is about being able to give your kids the \nchance and the opportunities you never had. This is the true American \ndream. It is not just a phrase. It is our identity as a nation. It is \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  We are still a country where the American dream is possible. We are \nstill a place where, if you work hard and are determined, you can earn \na better life. But we have to be honest. Over the last 10 years it has \ngotten harder to achieve this. It has gotten harder to find a good job \nand get ahead financially. It has gotten harder to save for retirement \nand send your kids to college. It has gotten harder to pay for health \ncare, childcare, and the monthly payments on your student loan.\n  For the last 5 years we have been told that a bigger government that \ndoes more and spends more is the answer to this problem. Do you know \nwhat that has left us instead? It has left us with about $17 trillion \nin debt and millions of Americans chronically out of work. The result \nis that despite all of this news we get from time to time about how the \neconomy is getting better or the stock market is climbing, for many \npeople across this country there is a sense that recovery is not \nreaching them. That is creating true uncertainty and even fear about \nthe future. There is the constant worry that you could lose everything \nyou worked so hard for. There are doubts about whether you will ever \nmake enough and have a few extra dollars after payday or be able to \nsave for the future. Even for those who are enjoying the life they \nalways wanted, you find a growing sense that their children may not get \nthat same chance.\n  It is not surprising that some are starting to wonder whether the \ntime has come for us to lower our expectations. Maybe the time has come \nto downgrade the American dream. This doesn't have to be the new \nnormal. We have a choice. If we go in a new direction that gives us a \ngovernment that creates less debt, an economy that creates more stable \nmiddle-class jobs, an education system that trains our people for the \njobs available now and in the future, strong families who teach the \nvalues of success, and a financially healthy Social Security and \nMedicare system for retirees--if we are responsible enough to \ncourageously and boldly fight to do these things, we can save the \nAmerican dream. We can restore it. Actually, we can expand it to reach \nmore people than it has ever reached before.\n  Our first priority here should not be ramming through rules changes \nto get liberal judges appointed. Our first priority should be more \nstable middle-class jobs. That should be our first priority. Stable \nmiddle-class jobs are the cornerstone of the American dream.\n  Let me break it to everybody here in Washington: Politicians don't \ncreate jobs. Politicians don't create these stable middle-class jobs. \nThese stable middle-class jobs are created by everyday people when they \nstart a business or grow an existing one. That, my friends, is the \nreason the American free enterprise system is the single greatest \nengine of prosperity the world has ever known. The key to our success \nas a country has always been a thriving free enterprise system, not a \nthriving bigger government.\n  What we need from our government are policies that foster a free \nenterprise system, that provide opportunities for everyone who is \nwilling to work hard, and a government that stops spending money it \ndoesn't have. We have to bring our $17 trillion debt under control.\n  We need to address our broken Tax Code. We need one that creates more \ntaxpayers, not more taxes. The current one we have is a major obstacle \nto the American dream. Why? Because our current Tax Code is expensive \nand complicated. Our current Tax Code is rigged. It is rigged to help \nthose who are politically connected. It is rigged to help them at the \nexpense of everybody else.\n  We need to reform the runaway regulations we have. They are \ndestroying job creation. By the way, they too favor the well connected. \nThey too favor the people who can afford to hire lobbyists to help \nwrite these rules and lawyers to help write the loopholes.\n  We need government policies that remove unreasonable restrictions on \nenergy exploration here in this country so we can be freed from our \ndependence on foreign oil and create more jobs in the energy sector but \nalso in manufacturing.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we need to get the cost of health care under \ncontrol but not through the big-government solutions, such as \nObamaCare, that were rammed down the throat of the American people but \nby encouraging the development of an individual health insurance market \nthat gives people more choices, not more mandates.\n\n  The middle-class jobs of today and in the future will require more \neducation and skills than ever before. That is why one of the most \nimportant investments of our time and our resources that we can make--\ninstead of wasting time on all of these distractions on changing the \nSenate rules to force through radical judges like the one being \nproposed here tonight--is in a quality and affordable education system \nthat gives our people the unique skills they will need to succeed in a \nnew global economy. To do that we need to take the power out of the \nhands of Washington, DC, and give it to the State and local school \nboards so they can undertake innovative reforms.\n  We need to pursue policies that expand access and interest in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math because that is what the \njobs of the future are going to be based on.\n  As mentioned a moment ago, we need to get the cost of college under \ncontrol. I know. I graduated with over $100,000 in student loans. We \nneed to give working Americans trapped in low-paying jobs access to \ncollege or a career education that is affordable and flexible so it \nmeets within their busy lives. If you are a working parent--\nparticularly a single parent who is working--you can't just quit your \njob and move to the nearest college town to go to school for 4 years. \nWe have to create programs. We have to reform our existing programs so \nthey are accessible and affordable for people who are in this position. \nIt will give a receptionist at a law firm the ability to become a \nparalegal. It will give a mail clerk at a medical office the ability to \nbecome an ultrasound technician. We have to meet this issue. There is \nan extraordinary need.\n  By the way, we have to give all of our students more access to career \nand vocational education. You can still make a good middle-class living \nas an airplane mechanic or as an electrician. Why have we stigmatized \nthese? Why have we told children in this country that if they go into \nthese fields, they are not successful? These are good, stable, and \nnecessary middle-class jobs. You know what happens when a kid wants to \nwork with their hands but they are not learning it in high school. They \ndrop out. We have to address that--not just at the Federal level but \nacross the country.\n  In addition to a good education, the American dream was built on a \nset of\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nfundamental values such as hard work, discipline, honesty, and self-\ncontrol. Teaching these values is the responsibility of our families. \nGovernment can't impose these values, and, quite frankly, it can't \nteach them. Government policies should encourage and reward them.\n  I think we should empower parents by giving them the ability to send \ntheir kids to any school they choose. There is no reason why a parent \nshould not be able to put their kids in the best possible educational \nsetting just because they are poor. There is no reason why we should \nforce people to send their kids to failing schools just because that \nhappens to be the school right down the street. That is not fair. If \nyou are rich, you can send your kids to any school you want. You know \nwhat. They do. Do you know who can't do that? The people who can't \nafford to pay for that. That is wrong, and we should change it.\n  We should strengthen our charities and our churches, which make an \nextraordinary contribution in helping the less fortunate and \nreinforcing values that are so important to success. We should \nreinforce them by making important changes to our Tax Code that will \nencourage and reward Americans for donating more.\n  We need to have safety net programs. The free enterprise system \ndoesn't work without a solid safety net. It needs to be a safety net \nthat helps people who cannot help themselves or to help people who have \nfallen to get back up and try again. We don't need a safety net that is \na way of life.\n  We need to reform our existing safety net programs--welfare, \nunemployment insurance, disability, and Medicaid. They should all be \nreformed so that in addition to providing for those who are in need, \nthese programs should also be promoting work and education and self-\nreliance.\n  Last but not least, I think the American dream means the ability to \nretire with stability and security. That is why having a financially \nhealthy Social Security and Medicare system is so important. We can \nbicker around here all we want about how many votes it takes to get a \njudge in or who is obstructing what. Here is a fundamental fact: Social \nSecurity is going to run out of money in 20 years, which happens to be \nright around the time I will be getting close to being eligible for it. \nMedicare is going to run out of money in as few as 8 years.\n  The good news is that if we act and start to take steps to address \nthat now, we can fix these programs, and we can fix them without \ndisrupting the lives of people who are on those programs now--like my \nmother. I would never support any changes to these programs that would \nhurt people like my mother, who is on Social Security and Medicare. We \ncan fix it, but to fix it, people like me--decades from retirement--are \ngoing to have to accept that while our Medicare and Social Security \nwill be the best in the world, it is going to be different than it was \nfor our parents, but it is going to exist.\n  By the way, beyond this, we should do some other things. We should \nmake it easier, through changes in our taxes, for people to work beyond \ntheir retirement years. We should expand access to tax-advantage \nsavings accounts for those who don't have access to a 401(k). We should \nincentivize people to save for their retirement.\n  I think what has bothered me the most in the 3 years I have been here \nis the lack of urgency about any of this. People talk about it. They \npropose laws called good things that maybe they polled and it sounded \ngood. But in terms of moving on any of these things I just talked \nabout, there is not a lot of urgency about it. We need to have more \nurgency about it. We need to stop wasting time around here changing the \nrules of the Senate to get a couple more of the President's radical \nappointments to the bench confirmed and spend a little bit more time \nfiguring this out.\n  For most of the history of the world, almost everyone who was born \nwas poor, without power, and without wealth. That only belonged to a \nselect few. For most of the history of the world, your future was \ndetermined by your past. If your parents were poor, you would be poor \ntoo. If a person was born without opportunities, so were their \nchildren. What makes our country special is that hasn't been true here. \nWhat makes America special is we are a people not united by a common \nrace or a common ethnicity; we are a people united by a common value: \nThe idea that everyone has the God-given right to achieve a better life \nwithout being held back by the government or by one's social standing.\n\n  Right now, I work here. Washington is broken. It was broken when I \ngot here and it still is. It is a process that is unable to function. \nWith all due respect, it is a process that is plagued with people--in \nboth parties, by the way--who are more interested in being someone than \nin doing something. I am telling my colleagues that if we continue on \nthis road we are on right now, if we continue on the road we have \nplaced this country on, we are going to lose the things that make \nAmerica special. That is what we should be focused on, because there is \nanother direction we can take. If we can find the political courage to \nboldly and responsibly confront and solve the challenges before us, we \ncan restore the American dream. Actually, we can expand it to reach \nmore people than it ever has before.\n  Every generation of Americans before us has had to do this. Every \ngeneration before us has been asked to do something to keep America \nspecial. Each has been asked to make sacrifices and take bold steps to \npreserve what makes us exceptional, and now it is our turn.\n  I remember a few years ago, there was a moment that reminded me of \nwhat is truly at stake here. I have shared this story many times. I was \nabout to give a speech in a hotel ballroom. I think it was in New York \nCity. There was a bartender there who had heard me speak before about \nmy father, who was also a bartender, and he approached me with a gift. \nThe gift he gave me was a name tag that said ``Rubio, banquet \nbartender,'' a name tag the same as they give in hotels. At that \nmoment, I was reminded of how this country literally changed my \nfamily's very life. Not so long ago, it was my father who stood behind \na bar, just like the one that gentleman stood behind, in order to give \nme the chance to earn a better life, and America made that possible. It \nwas never easy. Both of my parents worked well into their retirement \nyears.\n  I remember when I was in high school, well past midnight, on many \nnights, I would hear my father's keys jingling at the door as he came \nhome from another long day of work. When we are young, the meaning of \nmoments such as that escapes us. But now, as I get older and my \nchildren get older, I think I understand that moment a little bit \nbetter. Like the man who gave me that name tag that night in New York, \nmy father was coming back from more than just another day at work; he \nwas coming back from a day of fighting, so that the doors that had \nclosed for him would be open for me.\n  This is still one of the few places on Earth where a person can do \nthat. That is what makes us special.\n  Before us is the question of whether this generation of leadership is \nup to the task of keeping this country that way. I don't personally \nhave any doubt that we are up to the task. Despite our many \ndifferences, I believe our people are much more united than our \npolitics would lead one to believe.\n  Every single one of us, every single American is the descendant of a \ngo-getter, of an immigrant or of a slave or of someone who overcame \nextraordinary odds to stake their claim in this American dream. Every \nsingle one of us comes from someone who refused to accept the life they \nlived and always desired to have something better for themselves and \nfor their families. Every single one of us is a descendant of someone \nwho insisted that their future must always be better than their past.\n  This is who we are as a people. This is who we come from. I believe \nthat is still who we are. All we need now are leaders that reflect that \nin their policies and in their priorities.\n  So I still have more faith in this country than perhaps the political \ncoverage might lead us to have because we are free people, and we are \nalways going to vigorously debate the best way forward. Sometimes, \nbecause of the nature of our Republic, it takes us a little longer to \nget it right, but we always have. I believe we will again. In the end, \nthere is no such thing as the Republican dream or the Democrat\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\ndream, there is only an American dream. Despite all the challenges this \ncountry faces and despite some of the skirmishes on the floor of the \nSenate--at times unnecessary, such as this debate with the judges and \nthe rule change--despite all of that, I know for a fundamental fact \nthat the American people are not willing or prepared to give up on this \nAmerican dream.\n  That requires us to act. That requires us to stop wasting time around \nhere and to focus on the issues. We have this golden opportunity to \nrestore this American dream and to bring it within reach of more people \nthan ever before. We have an opportunity before us to claim our \nheritage as a people who always leave behind a Nation better than the \none that was left for them. We have a chance to usher in a new American \ncentury and to write the latest chapter in the story of the single \ngreatest Nation that man has ever known. So I hope as we conclude these \ndebates on issues such as this, we will somehow find a way to begin to \nwork together on what really matters, on matters of importance, on what \nimpacts Americans now and those yet to come.\n  That leads me to one final point. I see my colleague from Wisconsin \nis on the floor, as well as others who wish to speak. I will close with \none more point, one more issue I think we are being distracted from \nbecause of the silliness of breaking the rules to change the rules so \nwe can impose on the American people out-of-the-mainstream judges and \ncabinet appointments that are less than qualified, and that is the \nissue of American leadership in the world. Look around the world today. \nLook at the impact of uncertainty about our foreign policy and what \neffect it is having across the planet.\n  I am going to be honest and straightforward about this issue \nespecially: This is an issue for both parties to reflect on for a \nmoment. We all understand why we are wary--and we should be--of \ninternational engagement. We have gone through a decade of two \nconflicts in the Middle East. We turn on the television and we see \npeople we have spent money and sacrificed lives on behalf of burning \nour flag and celebrating our tragedies, and we wonder, Why are we \ninvolved in the world. Why are we engaged in these places? But I hope \neverybody understands that in the absence of American leadership a \nvacuum is created, and that vacuum leads to chaos, and chaos ultimately \nimpacts our national security and our economic well-being.\n\n  Take a brief tour around the world with me for a moment and my \ncolleagues will see what I am talking about. Turn on the news and see \nwhat is happening in Ukraine where a country is being increasingly \nintimidated into going back into basically what looks like an effort to \nreconstitute the former Soviet Union, being torn between that and \nchoosing modernization in the West with the European Union. There are \npeople in the streets protesting against that and riot police going in \nthere to force them out.\n  Look at the Middle East, where Iran proceeds full speed ahead with \nweaponizing, towards creating a nuclear weapon and the impact that \nwould have--and not just on arming the one country in the world that \nmost uses terrorism as a tool of statecraft. We had testimony today \nfrom the administration. No country in the world uses terrorism more \nthan Iran does, and they are going to get a nuclear weapon. It won't \njust be Iran getting a nuclear weapon. If Iran gets a weapon, so will \nSaudi Arabia and potentially Turkey. Look at what is happening in Asia. \nThe Chinese have announced that a certain area belongs to them and \ntheir airspace, that others have to get permission from them and notify \nthem before anyone flies through there. South Korea and Japan and \nothers, they are starting to wonder whether America will live up to its \ncommitments to provide for their defense and to assist them or maybe \nthey need to strike out on their own and provide their own defense \ncapabilities.\n  Look at the opportunities in the Western Hemisphere we have abandoned \nbecause we have taken our focus elsewhere. I could go on and on.\n  Are we a strong enough voice on behalf of religious liberties? \nMeanwhile, religious minorities around the world are being oppressed in \nunprecedented ways. In particular, Christians in the Middle East are \nfacing persecution that is reminiscent of the early days of the church.\n  How about human rights? How about human trafficking and modern day \nslavery? All of these things require American leadership.\n  We can't solve every problem. Foreign aid isn't charity. It needs to \nfurther our national interests and the funds need to be accountably \nspent. But this is something we should be more focused on and we are \nnot. Why? Because we continue to get involved in these sorts of \nskirmishes here and, in particular, undermining the ability of this \nbody to function by changing the rules by breaking them.\n  So I hope this will serve as an opportunity to reevaluate all of \nthis, because the challenges before our country are real and the \nconsequences of not acting appropriately are dramatic. I hope we will \ntake this seriously, because we still have time to get this right, but \nwe do not have forever.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is the 52nd consecutive week we \nare in session that I have come to the floor to ask us to please, for \nLord's sake, wake up to the damage carbon pollution is already doing to \nour atmosphere, oceans, and climate, and to look ahead, to use our God-\ngiven sense, and to plan for what is so obviously coming.\n  In those weeks, I have spoken about all different aspects of carbon \npollution, its effect on sports and our economy; its effect on oceans \nand coasts; its effect on agriculture and wildfires; its effect on \nstorms and insurance costs. I have spoken about the measurements we can \nalready make of the harm already happening: Sea level rise, which we \nmeasure with a yardstick, basically; ocean temperature, which we \nmeasure with a thermometer; and ocean acidification--the fastest in 50 \nmillion years, according to research published in ``Nature \nGeoscience''--which we can measure with litmus tests.\n  I have, I hope, to anyone listening with their logic turned on, \nthoroughly rebutted the deniers' phony arguments against solving carbon \npollution, whether those arguments purport to be based in science or \nreligion or economics or our competitiveness.\n  I have listed the thoughtful and responsible groups--from the Joint \nChiefs of Staff to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, from \nWalmart to NASA, from Ford and GM to Coke and Pepsi, from America's \ngarden clubs to just last month our major sports leagues--who \nunderstand the truth about climate change and are saying so.\n  I have done my best to expose the calculated campaign of lies that we \nare up against and the vast scandalous apparatus of phony organizations \nand engineered messages that are designed to propagate those lies. I \nhave traced the connections back to, of course, the big carbon \npolluters and their billionaire owners. I have been obliged to point \nout that the money of those big polluters and billionaires floods this \nChamber, that their lobbyists prowl the outer halls, and that to a sad \nand disappointing degree this Congress is bought and paid for by that \npolluter influence.\n  One factor we have yet to consider is whether as an institution \nCongress has just become completely irresponsible. Maybe this Congress \njust cannot operate as an institution at an intelligent level. Some \nCongresses are going to be smarter and more responsible than others. \nThat is just the natural order of variation. Some Congress is going to \nbe the sorriest Congress ever. Maybe we are it.\n  Some organizations, like NASA, for instance, are very smart. That is \nwhy NASA is driving a rover around on the surface of Mars right now. \nThat is a seriously smart organization.\n  Some organizations take ordinary people and call them to be their \nvery best, to play at a level above their natural talents, to heed a \nhigher calling than their selfish inclinations. At their best, our \nmilitary and our churches tend to achieve that.\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n  Some organizations, however, take even the most talented people and \ndrag them down to the lowest common denominator, and stifle the best \nand bring out the worst in even those very talented people.\n  I ask people watching, which type of organization do you think \nCongress is right now? Which type do you think we are? As an \norganization, it is hard to say anything kinder of Congress than that \nit is now a really irresponsible organization. We could not even keep \nthe U.S. Government running. Standard & Poor's estimated that our tea \nparty shutdown foolishness cost Americans tens of billions of dollars \nfor no gain--none. We cannot sort out the basics of building and \nmaintaining our American infrastructure. Our own American Society of \nCivil Engineers gives our country a D-plus for infrastructure.\n  That is not complicated stuff. Yet we flub it like a football team \nthat fumbles the ball at the snap.\n  Get a little more complicated and Congress seems to get even worse.\n  Let me show you just one health care chart. This chart I have in the \nChamber shows the average life expectancy--in years--in a country \ncompared to the cost per capita of health care in that country. \nTogether, they make a pretty good proxy for how a country's health care \nsystem is doing. This group shown here on the chart represents most of \nthe OECD member and partner countries--our industrialized international \ncompetitors.\n  This, shown here on the chart, is us--way out here, all alone, \nspending the most by far for results that are mediocre at best. We \nwould save nearly $1 trillion a year if we could just get our per \ncapita cost down to what Norway and Switzerland spend. They are the \nnext two most expensive countries on the planet, and we are $1 trillion \na year more laid out per capita. Think of what we could do as a nation, \nwhat we could build and invent with $1 trillion a year if we were not \nwasting it on bad health care. And bad it is. We get worse results in \nlongevity than virtually any modern economy.\n  Look who beats us: Japan, Great Britain, Switzerland, Netherlands, \nNorway. Germany does, Italy does, Greece does, Luxembourg does. They \nall beat us. Chile and the Czech Republic are the two countries we beat \nfor longevity.\n  Look at the size of that problem--those lives lost, those trillions \nof dollars wasted--and then look at the quality of the health care \ndiscussion we are having in Congress, and tell me this is not a \ncompletely irresponsible organization.\n  That brings us to climate change. Yes, it is complicated, when you \nare trying to predict and model something as complex as what our \nclimate is going to do in the years ahead. But it is also simple, when \nyou look at the stuff that everyone agrees on, the stuff that you can \nmeasure, the stuff that you would have to be a nut or a crank or an \neccentric to dispute.\n  Nobody responsible--nobody responsible--disputes the principle that \nadding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere raises the temperature of the \nEarth, and that it does so through the so-called greenhouse effect. A \nscientist named John Tyndall figured that out at the time of the \nAmerican Civil War. I brought his musty old paper in here several \nspeeches ago. Its old leather binding was flaking and peeling. When \nthat report was first published, Abraham Lincoln had just been elected \nPresident. In all the years since then, this principle of science has \nalways been confirmed and validated. It is not some questionable \ntheory. The greenhouse effect is real. It would not just be wrong, it \nwould be irresponsible to deny that.\n  Nobody responsible disputes that for over a century our modern \neconomy has run on fossil fuels and that burning those fossil fuels has \nreleased gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The Global \nCarbon Project estimates that mankind has pumped about 2,000 gigatons \nof carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since 1870. That is a pretty \nsolid estimate, and I have never even heard anyone dispute it.\n  So we know those two things: adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere \ntraps more heat; and we have released an estimated 2,000 gigatons--\n2,000 billion tons--of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n  Let's go on from there. It is a known principle of science that a \nsignificant portion of that multigigaton carbon load is absorbed by the \noceans, and that the chemical reaction when that absorption happens \ninto the oceans makes the oceans more acidic. No responsible person \ndisputes either proposition. It is not some theory. It is something \nthat you can actually do and measure in a lab. Again, it would not just \nbe wrong, it would be really irresponsible to deny that.\n  We also know that the oceans do more than absorb carbon. They absorb \nheat. Indeed, they have absorbed most of the excess heat trapped by \ngreenhouse gases--over 90 percent of the heat between 1971 and 2010, \naccording to the recent IPCC report. What happens when the oceans \nabsorb heat? They expand. Thermal expansion is a basic \nphysical property of liquids. It can also be shown in a very simple \nlab. It is not a theory. Again, it would be not just wrong but \nirresponsible to deny that too.\n\n  It would not just be wrong, it would be irresponsible to deny what \nthose simple measurements and clear principles tell us. But we do. We \ndo. We deny it. Congress will not wake up and address this problem. \nLike those monkeys: See no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon.\n  Because we are so irresponsible, because we deny this reality, we are \nfailing to take precautions and, as a result, many people will suffer.\n  For those of us who love this country and are proud of it, and are \nproud of our government, and want this country and its government to be \na beacon of hope and promise and rectitude, it hurts a little extra for \nthe Congress to be such a failure. It hurts a little extra that we in \nour generation have driven Congress--the hub of our noble American \nexperiment in democracy, the beating heart of this great Republic--down \nto that low level.\n  It is a harsh judgment that this body is an irresponsible failure. \nBut on climate this Congress got it the old-fashioned way; it earned \nit.\n  I will close with a final observation. Compare the irresponsibility \nof this ``see no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon'' Congress \nwith the recent exhortation from Pope Francis. Here is what the Pope \nsaid. I will quote him at some length.\n\n       There are other weak and defenceless beings who are \n     frequently at the mercy of economic interests or \n     indiscriminate exploitation. I am speaking of creation as a \n     whole. We human beings are not only the beneficiaries but \n     also the stewards of other creatures. Thanks to our bodies, \n     God has joined us so closely to the world around us that we \n     can feel the desertification of the soil almost as a physical \n     ailment, and the extinction of a species as a painful \n     disfigurement. Let us not leave in our wake a swath of \n     destruction and death which will affect our own lives and \n     those of future generations.\n\n  The Pope continued:\n\n       Here I would make my own the touching and prophetic lament \n     voiced some years ago by the bishops of the Philippines:\n\n  And he quotes them:\n\n       ``An incredible variety of insects lived in the forest and \n     were busy with all kinds of tasks. . . . Birds flew through \n     the air, their bright plumes and varying calls adding color \n     and song to the green of the forests. . . . God intended this \n     land for us, his special creatures, but not so that we might \n     destroy it and turn it into a wasteland. . . . After a single \n     night's rain, look at the chocolate brown rivers in your \n     locality and remember that they are carrying the life blood \n     of the land into the sea. . . . How can fish swim in sewers \n     like the . . . rivers which we have polluted? Who has turned \n     the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft \n     of color and life?''\n       Small yet strong in the love of God, like Saint Francis of \n     Assisi, all of us, as Christians, are called to watch over \n     and protect the fragile world in which we live, and all its \n     peoples.\n\n  What is our answer to the Pope, to this great Christian leader? In \nCongress, it is the monkey answer: Hear no carbon, see no carbon, speak \nno carbon.\n  We still have time to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.\n  We can actually do it in painless ways. We can even do it in \nadvantageous ways, in ways that will boost our economy, but we have to \ndo it. We have to wake up. We simply have to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I rise to address the \nnomination of Cornelia Pillard to the DC Circuit. This nomination is a \ngood example of the government overreach that has led to the ObamaCare \ndebacle.\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\n  The good Senator from Rhode Island was talking about how much we \nspend on health care in this Nation. The very unfortunate fact is the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not address that cost.\n  Let's face it. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is \nabout as Orwellian a name as you could possibly come up with for a \npiece of legislation. We are watching millions of Americans lose their \nhealth care coverage. Those patients are not being protected by the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We certainly are not \nwatching the cost of health care decline.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not bend the cost \ncurve down. It has dramatically increased or bent the cost curve up. Of \ncourse, anybody who even has the slightest knowledge of basic economics \nrealizes that if you mandate expensive coverages on any insurance \npolicy, the price is not going to go down, the price is going to go up. \nWe are witnessing that.\n  We are certainly witnessing that in my home State of Wisconsin, where \na young man aged 27, on average, is seeing his premium increase by 124 \npercent, going from a little over $1,100 per year, to closer to $2,500 \nper year. A young woman of that same age, 27, is seeing her premium \nincrease by 78 percent, going from about $1,400 per year to about \n$2,500 per year. That is not bending the cost curve down.\n  That is not even talking about the added or the increased cost of \ntheir deductibles, the increases in their maximum out-of-pocket amounts \nthey are going to be spending every year. So again the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act does nothing that it promises. It is \na disaster for our health care system. It is a disaster for our Federal \nbudget. It is a disaster for people and their health and their lives.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate tonight, normally not down here at \nthis time. Normally, I would be sitting at home doing a little bit of \nhomework. So I guess what I would like to do is spend a few minutes \ndoing what I would be doing at home, reading letters from constituents \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  When I introduced my piece of legislation, trying to protect as many \nAmericans as possible from the damage of the health care law, trying to \nhonor the promise President Obama and Members of this Chamber made \nrepeatedly to the American public that if you liked your health care \nplan, you could keep it, I told a story about a couple in Wisconsin who \ncontacted our office. Initially, this couple wanted to be identified. \nThey wanted their story told. By the time I had gotten ahold of them on \nthe phone, to make sure they were actually getting some help in \nsecuring some health care, the husband had second thoughts. He watched \nhis government. He watched the Internal Revenue Service being used as a \npolitical weapon. So he feared for his privacy. He feared for his \neconomic security. So he asked me: Please do not use my name. Tell my \nstory, just don't use my name.\n  That is a pretty sad fact. That is something we need to ponder. It is \nsomething we need to address. But that couple, their story is pretty \nsimple and pretty sad. His wife was suffering from stage IV lung \ncancer. He was recovering from prostate cancer. They were participating \nin the high-risk pool in the State of Wisconsin, a risk-sharing pool \nthat worked.\n  It was expensive for them, but it was something they could afford. I \nknew it worked because in my 31 years of business, as I provided health \ncare for the people who worked with me, every now and again, \nunfortunately, one of the people who worked for me would have a serious \nhealth condition. When we would go to renew our policy, frequently \nthose individuals, if the condition was bad enough, would be lasered \nout. They would lose coverage under our plan. But that was OK because \nthe State of Wisconsin, very responsibly, made a provision for those \nindividuals, the high-risk sharing pool.\n  So what would end up happening is because they were denied coverage, \nthey automatically qualified for the high-risk pool. I, of course, \nwould pay for that coverage in the same way we would pay for coverage \nthrough our own health plan. What I found over the years, because this \nhappened a number of times, is the coverage was very comparable. It was \nnot a Cadillac plan but solid insurance coverage. So similar coverage \nand very comparable price.\n  It was a plan that worked. It was a plan that covered those \nindividuals with high risks. It was a plan that covered 22,000 \nWisconsinites until this body, this Congress, passed the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, which I describe here as neither of \nthose two things.\n  As a result of the passage of that bill, those high-risk pools are \nnow obsolete. So this couple got the letter saying they would lose \ncoverage as of January 1. Put yourself in the position of people \nsuffering from cancer or recovering from it. You have a lot of worries \nin life. You do not need the additional worry of losing your health \ncare plan. But that is what this couple faced, as millions of Americans \nare facing the exact same worry, the exact same harm, the exact same \ndamage. It is unconscionable.\n\n  They obviously went onto healthcare.gov, almost 40 times when I \ntalked to them. They were never able to successfully log onto it at \nthat point in time. So we helped this couple get in touch with the \ninsurance carriers that would be operating within the exchange. They \nstarted getting quotes. They quickly learned their premiums were going \nto double. Their out-of-pocket maximums were also going to come close \nto doubling as well. So the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \ndid not protect these two individuals, and it certainly did not offer \nthem affordable care.\n  As I went through letters from our constituents, we did make a few \nphone calls, knowing I was going to come down here, and asked if \nanybody would want to be identified. A few brave souls agreed to be \nidentified. I will read their names as I read their letters. The first \nWisconsinite, Michael Wagner, writes:\n\n       I am self-employed and have a family of four. The President \n     said we could keep our plan if we liked it and our doctors. \n     Not true. We are being pushed off our plan for the exchange. \n     He said the average family of four would save an average of \n     $2,500. Not true. I think he just makes numbers up. My \n     equivalent policy on the exchange will cost $7,500 more per \n     year. That is almost a 100 percent increase.\n       He said we can keep our doctors. Not true. Our current \n     company and PPO network is not offered on the exchange. The \n     list goes on and on. The bottom line is that this needs to be \n     stopped. If it is not, the American people will stand up and \n     the landscape of Senators will be unrecognizable after the \n     next midterm election. Thank you for your time, and I hope \n     you have the gall to stand up for your constituents.\n\n  Mr. Wagner, I definitely have the gall to stand up for my \nconstituents. The reason I ran for the Senate was not because I wanted \nto be a Senator. The primary reason I ran for the Senate was to be the \nvote to repeal this monstrosity, to be the vote to protect Americans \nfrom the damage I full well knew this law would inflict on millions of \nour fellow citizens.\n  The next constituent who wrote to me, Darren Schauf, wrote:\n\n       We are a small manufacturer in Sparta, Wisconsin, who has \n     been in operation since the mid 1960s. We currently employ 24 \n     people and are a family-owned business, fabricating large \n     fiberglass statues and water slides that are shipped all over \n     the U.S. and Canada. We have been providing our employees \n     health insurance for 15 years, paying for 100 percent of the \n     premium.\n\n  Pretty responsible employer. Those are the types of businesspeople I \nknow. Those are the types of businesspeople who are very concerned \nabout the people who work with them. Those are the types of \nbusinesspeople who this President demonizes in his class warfare. Let \nme go on:\n\n       We have experienced the increases in health care cost over \n     the years and weathered them fine. I received our renewal \n     this week for next year. Because of the Affordable Care Act, \n     our premium went from $3,887.77 per month to $7,103 per \n     month. How does this happen? What definition of \n     ``affordable'' is being used to describe this effect? We will \n     not be able to pay 100 percent of our employee's premium at \n     this rate. How can we get a plan that is at least close to \n     the cost that we were paying last year?\n\n  Mr. Schauf, I know how you can get a plan close to what you were \nbuying last year. If this body would take up my bill, If You Like Your \nHealth Plan, You Can Keep It Act, that is a true grandfather clause \nthat actually would honor that promise for millions of Americans. We \ncannot save the policies that have already been lost. We cannot repair \nall the damage already done by this health care law. But we can still \nhelp millions of Americans if we act, if we are responsible, if we \ncare.\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\n  The next two constituents to write me are Brad and Dawn Nielsen. They \nwrite:\n\n       My wife and I just received a notice that our monthly \n     health care insurance cost will increase by 184 percent, \n     increase by $1,330 per month starting in January 2015, and \n     you need to understand how cheated we feel with this and what \n     you have done.\n\n  I am assuming he is referring to President Obama and Democratic \nSenators and Democratic Members of the House who voted for this \nmonstrosity. Again, I ran to be the vote to repeal this law.\n\n       We are both retired and have been paying our health care \n     insurance for the past 3 years. We have what would be \n     considered a good policy that falls in line with what would \n     be considered a gold package as it relates to the ACA \n     guidelines. We will be able to keep this policy with our \n     insurance carrier through 2014 with a 7\\1/2\\ percent increase \n     in the monthly premium that is to cover the new--\n\n  He puts in quotes--\n\n     ``the Affordable Care Act'' cost. Although we were not happy \n     about the increase, we were told by our carrier that the \n     monthly premiums will increase to $2,054.51 per month \n     starting January 2015. This is not right. You as our \n     representative need to understand what you have allowed to \n     happen to us as well as others.\n\n  Again, Mr. and Mrs. Nielsen, I wish--I wish we would have prevented \nthis.\n  I wish the Members of this body would hear your plea and do something \nto protect you, as the bill claims to do, to repair the damage.\n\n       We have worked hard, made sacrifices to be able to retire, \n     saved through our company's retirement plan, invested when we \n     could and even put both our kids through college. Now to be \n     forced to pay an outrageous amount for something we have had \n     for the last 3 years isn't right. This increase is a game \n     changer for us and will dramatically affect our standard of \n     living moving forward.\n       It is important that you understand what is happening and \n     the need to change this unfair law.\n\n  I hope the President, I hope Members are listening.\n  The next constituent, Jeff Cubinski, writes:\n\n       I am sending you this email about the 2014 ACA. I just \n     received my letter from Humana stating my insurance is going \n     to increase nearly 300% from $550/month to $1559/month. I \n     cannot afford this--how is this Affordable Care? I have \n     carried insurance all my life being self-employed--what is \n     this plan trying to put the self-employed out of business???? \n     I want to keep my plan the way it is--why are we being forced \n     to change to a plan that has benefits we DON'T need?? Please \n     help us citizens that have been carrying health care. Please \n     make Government for the people by the people again!\n\n  I wish to quickly answer that question. Why is this individual being \nforced to change to a plan that has benefits that he doesn't need? It \nis because there are people in Washington, in this alternate universe, \nwho believe they are so smart, so clever, they know what is best for \nevery American. They are so compassionate. They are trying to help.\n  They are not helping much. This law is not helping much. It is doing \nreal harm.\n  President Obama and Senate, Members of the House, please listen to \nthese constituent letters. Have a change of heart. Work with us to \nlimit the damage before it gets greater.\n  Those were the individuals we contacted who were willing to be \nidentified. The rest of the individuals were either not contacted in \ntime or decided, as the couple, that they had seen their government be \nused as a weapon against other citizens and decided to remain \nanonymous.\n  The next Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I am writing you to inform you that as of January 1st 2014 \n     my family of six and I will no longer have health care. This \n     will be the first time in my life or the life of my children \n     that we will be in this position. The reason for this is the \n     Affordable Health Care Act, laughable name. On that day my \n     premiums through work will go from $250/month to well over \n     $1000/month. In looking through the Market place, my family's \n     premium would also be well in excess of $1000/month.\n       We are a typical middle class family, my wife and I both \n     work full time, our combined income is in the $75,000 range. \n     We are home owners with a mortgage, we drive 8 to 9 year old \n     cars, our children go to public schools, we do not live an \n     extravagant life style.\n       I have been struggling to figure what to cut to be able to \n     afford this new health care system the government stuck us \n     in. No matter what we cut it will not add up to $1000. The \n     other option is to put our house on the market and try to \n     find something else outside of Madison. That is not what we \n     want to do. Our kids are in high school, one with special \n     needs and we feel that would be unfair to them.\n\n  So do I.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Mr Johnson please explain to me how on earth is this \n     affordable and fair.\n\n  I can't. It is not affordable; it is not fair; it is utterly unfair. \nIt is utterly unnecessary, but it is a fact. It is one I hope everyone \nwho supported this bill can live with. I hope it is a fact that \neveryone who voted in support for this bill thinks about and is held \nfully accountable.\n  Continuing:\n\n       I find this Affordable Care Act to be divisive, unfair and \n     an unjust tax on the middle class.\n       I will not vote for anyone that supported this Act or \n     continues to support this Act given the effect that it is \n     having on my family. Sir, I am begging for your help. Please \n     find a way to help my family and the rest of the Americans \n     like us.\n\n  Did we hear that, an American citizen begging for help from the harm \nthat the Affordable Care Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, inflicted on his family. He is begging this Congress, this \nchamber, this President, for help. Please hear him.\n  Another constituent writes:\n\n       I'm feeling very upset and stressed over the new health \n     care laws. I feel they are unfair and hurting working \n     families. Our household income has shrunk and our health care \n     cost is going up over $300 a month. According to \n     healthcare.gov if insurance costs more than 9.5% of gross \n     income it is considered unaffordable. When a single person \n     applies only his/her income is taken into consideration. When \n     a family applies total household income is used to figure \n     out affordability of single-only coverage. Single only \n     coverage for myself is about 8% of our family income; \n     single only coverage for my husband is about the same. \n     That means 16% of our income would be used for insurance \n     (throughout employers) just for us. 16% of our income \n     would be gone and our 4 children would be uninsured. \n     Family coverage costs 12% of our family income still \n     higher than 9.5%. Where is our tax credit? We don't \n     qualify for tax credits because we have ``affordable \n     insurance through our employers.'' If total household \n     income is used why isn't family coverage affordability \n     taken into consideration. Last year my family made about \n     $55,000 (174% of the poverty level.) Next year we will \n     make less due to reduced hours. Money is already tight, \n     this new law will make things very uncomfortable for my \n     family. I am turning to my representatives for help. \n     Please help families in the same situation to the best of \n     your ability; we need your help! This law is hurting us; \n     be our voice.\n\n  Another Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I just called Physician's Plus to find out about the status \n     of our Health Insurance policy. Our policy will not be \n     renewed due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  It seems these constituents decided to drop the patient protection \nbecause he obviously wasn't feeling particularly protected.\n  Continuing:\n\n       My husband and I are freelancers in the video production \n     field. My husband works so hard to support and take care of \n     me and our two children. We are not rich, by any means, just \n     taking care of business. We have paid 100% of our premiums \n     for 15 years. We have bought coverage that makes sense for \n     our family at different times. Currently, we pay $513.60/\n     month with a $3000 deductible. When I called Physician's Plus \n     yesterday, the person there said that my plan cannot be \n     renewed. He said the new premium for a comparable plan will \n     be $1743.00!!!\n\n  Again, that compares to $513 and it will be $1,743.\n  Continuing:\n\n       We cannot afford this in any way. I guess we are the \n     collateral damage?\n       I have tried to get on the ACA to find out our options. I \n     refuse to give them personal information so I can only go by \n     the Kaiser Foundation estimate. There is only one plan that \n     will keep our Pediatrician and it looks like we will be \n     looking at a $12,000 deductible with close to a $1000/month \n     premium. We are on the high end, so get a very minimal \n     subsidy. We do not want to get any help from the government, \n     we want to be independent, but the government is forcing \n     their hand on us!\n\n  Again, we live in the land of the free, the home of the brave, and \nyet these brave Wisconsinites are being forced. They are being coerced. \nThis is the antithesis of freedom of choice.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Please understand we want people to have health care, but \n     why are they destroying us in the process? I am in the \n     process of scrambling to find a job that provides insurance. \n     I was offered a Educational Assistant job that has been \n     changed to 29 hours, no health insurance.\n\n  I wonder what caused that change in employment.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Most opportunities I am finding have recently dropped \n     insurance coverage has a benefit.\n       We are scared about the future.\n\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\n\n  This is what the Affordable Care Act has done. That is what the \npatient protection and Affordable Care Act has done to Americans, to \nWisconsinites. It has made them fearful. They are afraid, they are \nscared for their futures. Good job, Congress. Good job, President \nObama. My, aren't we a compassionate lot. Didn't we do a fine job. \nAren't we smart.\n  The next Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I'm extremely unhappy with the so called ``Affordable Care \n     Act.'' Unfortunately, for my middle class family, the new law \n     is creating un-affordable health insurance. I am a 35 year \n     old project management consultant and my wife and I have 2 \n     children. We currently purchase health insurance on the \n     individual market and are very happy with our coverage. We \n     currently pay $352 per month to cover our family of 4. The \n     plan offers a copay of $35 when going to the doctor, and has \n     a $7,500 deductible for our family.\n       I have begun researching what our health insurance premiums \n     will cost going forward under ObamaCare and I am outraged \n     with what I've found. The cheapest policy I can find is \n     $761.71--\n\n  Let me refer back to the fact that they are paying $352, so that is \nmore than a 100-percent increase.\n  Continuing:\n\n     --$761.71 per month for a Bronze plan and a $12,600 \n     deductible!\n\n  Again, that compares to the $7,500 deductible under the plan that \nthey are ``happy with.''\n\n       This is 116 percent more than what we currently pay, with a \n     higher deductible. If I look at a comparable plan to what we \n     have now, the new cost will be around $900 per month, which \n     is a 156 percent increase. Also, our income is slightly above \n     the threshold to get any subsidies.\n       The new regulations in ObamaCare will not benefit our \n     family, but they will more than double our cost. We need to \n     repeal this terrible law and replace it with simple, market \n     based incentives. Health insurance should be more like car \n     insurance. You don't submit a claim to get your oil changed \n     in your car. Same goes for health care. We should pay out of \n     pocket for routine health care using a transparent price \n     structure that allows consumers to shop for the care they \n     want. Then have a cheap insurance policy for major illness \n     coverage. Republicans need to communicate this alternative, \n     and make it simple for people to understand.\n\n  I could not agree with this individual more. He continues:\n\n       I realize repeal and replace is not possible until after \n     the 2016 elections, but I appreciate and support \n     wholeheartedly your new ``If You Like Your Health Plan, You \n     Can Keep It Act.'' For the millions of people out there like \n     me, we should be able to keep our current plan indefinitely. \n     Hold the President to his promise and pass this law to \n     grandfather in all existing policies.\n\n  Let me just stop a minute and talk a little about the bill I did \nintroduce--If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep It Act. It is a \npretty simple act. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor it and pass \nit as soon as possible. I wrote it a certain way. I wrote it using the \nexact same grandfather language that was in ObamaCare. The problem with \nthe grandfather language within the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act is that, yes, it grandfathered plans, as long as you totally \nchanged them. We took the grandfather language and we just pulled out \nthe you just have to totally change your plan. We made it a true \ngrandfather provision: the same language, the true intent, the honest \nintent.\n  So I urge my Democratic colleagues to support that bill. Again, let \nme emphasize we cannot at this late hour, unfortunately, salvage most \nof these plans that have already been lost to the individuals whose \nemails I am reading from tonight. But there are millions of Americans \nwho will lose their coverage in the future.\n  Let me tell you how it is going to happen. I bought health care for \nthe people who worked for me for 31 years in my business. I always was \ngoing to do that. There was no way I was ever going to subject the \npeople who worked with me to the financial ruin of not having a health \ncare plan.\n  That being said, as the previous writer was saying, I didn't pay for \ntheir auto insurance, I didn't pay for their homeowners or property \ninsurance. I always kind of wondered: Why am I having to make these \nvery personal decisions for the people who work with me? Why am I \nhaving to decide on their levels of deductible and having to decide is \nit a PPO or an HMO? I know the reason why. It was government \ninterference in the marketplace back in the 1940s, with wage price \ncontrols.\n  Unions very naturally said: You can't raise our wages, give us some \nother benefit tax free, and that began the destruction of our health \ncare system in terms of patient involvement, in terms of a competitive \nmarketplace. Back then, 68 cents of every health care dollar was \nactually paid by the patient. There was free-market competition to \nensure cost restraint, to ensure high-quality and high levels of \ncustomer service. That is what the free market does. Today, only 12 \ncents of every $1 is paid by the patient.\n  But getting back to the millions who are going to be losing their \nemployer-sponsored care, most employers care deeply about the people \nwho work with them. They also would not expose the people who work with \nthem to financial risk. But under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, the decision is totally different now. Now an employer is \ngoing to be facing double-digit premium increases when these plans they \nwere able to quickly renew before January 1 come due in 2014.\n  If the exchanges, as they should have been from day one, start \noperating properly, employers are going to be faced with a decision: \nShould I pay $15,000 per family for family coverage? By the way, that \nis up $2,500 per year, not down $2,500 per year as President Obama \npromised us. Do I pay $15,000 per family coverage and try to comply \nwith the 20,000-plus pages of law and rules and regulation or do I pay \nthe $2,000 or $3,000 fine, and I am not putting my employees at \nfinancial risk? I am potentially making them eligible for subsidies in \nthe exchange.\n  That is the decision employers are going to be facing. Here is the \nkicker. Even those who are saying: I am not going to do that; I am \ngoing to keep providing that coverage, just wait until the first \ncompetitor drops coverage and pays the $2,000 fine rather than a \n$15,000 fine. Marketplace competition is brutal. It is not fun. It is \nwhy businesses that succeed should be celebrated, not demonized. But \nthat is a decision to be made by millions of employers. As a result, \ntens of millions of additional Americans will lose the health care \ncoverage they get through their employers using pretax dollars and get \nforced into the exchanges.\n  Maybe some will get subsidies paid for by the American taxpayer--\nactually, paid for by a debt burden placed on the backs of our children \nand grandchildren because we can't afford the Affordable Care Act. That \nis what is going to happen. That is what this Chamber, this Congress, \nthis President needs to consider.\n  That is why I am asking my colleagues in the Senate to join with me \nto pass the If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep It Act--so we \ncan protect millions of Americans, so we can honor that promise that \nwas made repeatedly by this President and Members of this Chamber who \nvoted for and supported this bill. Accept responsibility, be held \naccountable, act responsibly, and join me in that effort to protect \nAmericans.\n  Another Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       Please allow me to introduce myself and my family. We are \n     an average, middle class Wisconsin family that is having a \n     really bad year. My husband was diagnosed with cancer in May, \n     I lost my job and our family health insurance in June. \n     Because of preexisting conditions, our only insurance option \n     was the high insurance risk sharing pool.\n\n  Again, that is the plan in Wisconsin I certainly found worked for \nreal Americans. It worked. It will now be obsolete because of the \nhealth care law.\n  This individual continues:\n\n       For our family of three (myself, husband and college \n     student daughter) our monthly premiums are $783 per month, \n     with a $7,500 individual deductible. With the high insurance \n     risk sharing pool ending December 31, 2013, I am searching \n     for insurance, as I have yet to find employment. I have tried \n     over 20 times to get on the affordable health care Web site \n     with no luck. I have been able to set up a log in and user \n     name, and have entered some information, which is never saved \n     when I have to log out due to a ``please wait'' message that \n     never goes away. I am working with an insurance agent to \n     secure quotes outside of the government Web site, as I am \n     sure we are way too middle class to be afforded any type of \n     subsidy. Although I am unable to determine this through the \n     defective Web site. Our cheapest quote is $1,580 per month--\n\n  Again, that compares to $783 per month. Again, basically a 100-\npercent increase.\n\n     --with a $12,500 deductible.\n\n  Her previous deductible was $7,500.\n\n       Therefore, the Affordable Care Act would cost my family \n     over $9,500 more per year in premiums and our total \n     deductibles to meet\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n     will increase to $37,500 from $22,500 for the family. The \n     total effect is $24,500 additionally in 2014. Are we \n     seriously supposed to be able to absorb this into our budget? \n     What does our family do in this situation? We simply cannot \n     afford $1,580 per month for insurance or $24,500 per year. \n     What are our options? My husband will undergo chemotherapy \n     and has a surgery scheduled for 2014. I am feverishly--\n\n  Do you hear that word--``feverishly''\n\n     --looking for employment with health insurance coverage. I am \n     sure we are not the only family adversely affected by the \n     law. Please provide answers for all of us. I look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n\n  Again, my plea is to please provide true protection. Please provide \nsecurity. Please accept the responsibility of what this law, what your \nsupport for this law did and is doing to millions of Wisconsinites, to \nmillions of Americans. It is simply immoral what this law is doing to \npeople, to their lives.\n  It is not going to be pretty what this law is going to do to our \nhealth care system. It will lower quality and it will produce rationing \nbecause the only way the government can afford to provide all of this \naccess is actually by limiting access. Of course, we are already seeing \na very limited number of doctors who are actually accepting these \ncontracts from the networks that are provided in the exchange, \nprimarily because of all of the mandated coverages that are \ndramatically increasing the price of health care, as I have \ndemonstrated this evening in these emails and these letters we are \nreceiving from real people, from people who are suffering because of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the topic of the \nnomination of Cornelia Pillard to the DC Circuit.\n  Before I go to that specific topic, I wish to address a broader \ntopic, which is how we got in these circumstances in the first place \nand why we are here tonight, why we are having this discussion, and how \nthis nuclear option, as it has been described, has come about.\n  Most immediately was November 21, 2013, just a few weeks ago, when \nthe majority party in the Senate unilaterally decided to break the \nrules of the Senate, violate the rules and rewrite the rules \nthemselves. Despite the fact the rules clearly say it takes a two-\nthirds majority of the Senate to do that, they decided to disregard \nthat and change the rules themselves. So they did that on November 21, \n2013.\n  What they specifically did, the specific rule change they imposed \nunilaterally on the Senate, was to completely eliminate the opportunity \nfor the minority party to have any ability to be a check or a balance \nto the process of selecting and confirming the nominees of a given \nPresident to the judiciary of the United States of America, the Federal \njudiciary, or to the executive branch.\n  It is a little bit sweeping, but that is exactly what has been done. \nThis is contrary to the entire history of the Republic, where this has \nnever been done before, and it applies to lifetime appointees. Of \ncourse, Federal judges, as we all know, once they are confirmed, they \nhold that office until they decide they are done--at whatever age that \nmight be. It is a lifetime appointment. Unless they commit an \nimpeachable offense, there is nothing anybody can do about it.\n\n  One of the things that is interesting about this decision by our \nDemocratic colleagues is they decided to eliminate the rights the \nminority party has had in the Senate for centuries. They decided to do \nthat despite the fact that 20 of them warned vehemently against \nengaging in this very activity just a few years ago. As a matter of \nfact, none other than the Senate majority leader who personally led \nthis effort, Senator Reid, said in 2009:\n\n       The right to extend the debate is never more important than \n     when one party controls the Congress and the White House. In \n     these cases, a filibuster serves as a check on power and \n     preserves our limited government.\n\n  In 2009 the senior Senator from New York said:\n\n       The checks and balances which have been at the core of this \n     Republic will be evaporated by the nuclear option. The checks \n     and balances say that if you get 51 percent of the vote, you \n     don't get your way 100 percent of the time.\n\n  That is what our friends, the leadership of the majority party, the \nDemocratic party, said very recently.\n  So you have to ask yourself, why would they do a complete reversal? \nWhy would they do a 180-degree switch? Why would they go from a \nposition of absolute vehement opposition to the nuclear option that \ndenies the minority party any say whatsoever in the confirmation of \nFederal nominees--why would they go from that to where they were just a \ncouple weeks ago when they executed their plan and unilaterally broke \nthe rules so they could change the rules to inflict that very policy on \nthe current minority party, the Republican Party?\n  We can look at what the majority leader said at the time. One of the \nthings he said on November 21, 2013, the day on which the majority \nleader made this change:\n\n       There has been unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction. For \n     the first time in the history of our Republic, Republicans \n     have routinely used the filibuster to prevent President Obama \n     from appointing his executive team or confirming judges.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid has asserted as his justification for this \nunilateral, unprecedented deprivation of minority party rights. In \nfact, just this evening Senator Reid was back on the Senate floor, and \nhe used the word ``obstructionism'' about a dozen times. So I think it \nis worth considering what has actually happened. What does the record \nshow? Let's go back to March 2011 because that is an interesting moment \nin this discussion about how and whether and when and under what \ncircumstances to confirm nominees.\n  In March 2011, Republicans decided that, you know what, it probably \nwould be a good idea for the President--President Obama at this time, \nobviously--to be able to get a very large number of nominees appointed \nand confirmed without even having to go through the Senate process. The \nlegislation is called the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011. Under this act, thousands of appointees from \nthe executive branch were simply no longer subject to Senate \nconfirmation.\n  So what Republicans did in March 2011--far from obstructing \nanything--was to say: Mr. President, here is a huge category of Federal \nnominees, and we won't even require a vote. We won't even require \nSenate consideration. You get these, all of them. You nominate them, \nthey are done, period.\n  Does that sound like obstruction? Not to me. It was passed by a \nRepublican-controlled House, supported by Republicans in the Senate, \nand signed into law.\n  So today the law of the land, as a result of Republican cooperation, \nis that this President enjoys a luxury no previous President has had--\nthis huge category of nominees who are solely, exclusively at his \ndiscretion. It doesn't matter if a single Senator or every Senator \nstrongly objects. It doesn't matter. It is totally irrelevant.\n  So I think we ought to consider that legislation in the context of \nthis discussion. But let's take a look at those nominees who remain \nsubject to and who prior to this legislation have been subject to \nSenate confirmation.\n  One category is Federal judges. We have many district courts around \nthe country. So far, the President has nominated 174 candidates to \nFederal district courts around the country. Of the 174 the President \nhas nominated, I wonder if you could guess how many have been \nconfirmed. I will tell you how many have been confirmed--174. There \nhave been 174 confirmed and zero rejected. At the circuit court level, \nprior to the recent episode, the President had nominated 41 candidates \nto the circuit court. Of the 41, 39 had been confirmed. So the total of \njudicial nominees President Obama has sent to us in the Senate is 217, \nand 215 have been confirmed and 2 have been objected to. By my math, \nthat is something like 1 percent objected to, 99 percent confirmed. \nThis doesn't strike me as unreasonable obstruction.\n  But judges aren't the whole story. There are also the nonjudicial \nnominees, and we ought to consider those as well. So far, at least as \nof when we compiled this data, the President has nominated 1,488 \nindividuals to various Federal spots throughout the executive branch--\nthe agencies, his departments, and so on. Of the 1,488, 1,486 have been \nconfirmed and 2 have been blocked by Republicans. That would include \n100 percent of the President's Cabinet\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nnominees and 100 percent of virtually every other category but not \nevery last one. If we add those together, the total of the President's \nnominees, both judicial and nonjudicial, 1,707 confirmed, 4 rejected. \nSo that works out to something like the Senate has confirmed with \nRepublican support--because prior to the rule change, it couldn't \nhappen without Republican support--the Senate has confirmed 99.9 \npercent of President Obama's nominees to judgeships and to \nnonjudgeships. You have to ask yourself, could that possibly constitute \noutrageous obstruction, unprecedented obstruction, as Senator Reid has \nsaid, preventing President Obama from appointing his executive team or \nconfirming judges? How can this possibly be?\n  The majority leader came down to the Senate floor on the date on \nwhich he decided to unilaterally change the rules by breaking the rules \nand he cited as an example the outrageous case of Chuck Hagel, who had \nserved in this body. Chuck Hagel. Whatever became of Chuck Hagel? Oh, \nthat is right, he was confirmed to be Secretary of Defense, as has \nvirtually every single other nominee the President has proposed.\n  The leader seemed to think it was completely unreasonable that \nRepublican Senators would demand some information from former-Senator \nHagel along the way. It seems to me the fact that he is a former \nSenator should not change his obligation to provide the information the \nSenate requests, and when he provided that information, he was \nconfirmed easily.\n  So it seems pretty clear to me, it seems pretty indisputable that \nthis really never was about obstructionism. A 99.9-percent confirmation \nrate? It just can't be about obstruction. It is clearly not.\n  So we have to ask ourselves, if it is not the case that Republicans \nhave been obstructing the President's team--and it is clearly not--then \nwhy did the majority in this body decide to unilaterally change the \nrules and deny the minority the opportunity to have any say whatsoever \non the confirmation process? Fortunately, some of our colleagues on the \nother side have explained this for us. They have told us why they made \nthis change. But let me put it in a little bit of context.\n  We are in a situation here where we have a divided government. It is \ntrue that the American people elected President Obama to a second term, \nand elections have consequences. But on the very same day, the American \npeople reelected Republicans to be the majority party in the House. And \nall elections have consequences, not just Presidential elections.\n  So the reality is that the very liberal agenda President Obama would \nlike to pursue is very difficult. He can't get most of the liberal \nthings he wants to do, whether it is some kind of cap and trade or card \ncheck or his war on coal. This is well outside of the mainstream of \nwhere the American public is, and it is not where the consensus is in \nthe House of Representatives. So his legislative agenda isn't going \nanywhere in the House. The administration understands that very well, \nthe President understands that very well, and so do the members of the \nmajority party here in the Senate.\n  What do you do if you have an agenda that is out of step with the \nAmerican people and can't pass in a duly-elected House of \nRepresentatives? Well, some people think the thing to do is do an end \nrun around the legislative body, bypass the legislation, and use an \nundemocratic--I would argue unconstitutional--process and have \nunelected, unaccountable bureaucrats impose by fiat and through \nregulation that which you cannot achieve through legislation.\n  Of course, that is completely inconsistent with our Constitution, \nwith the way our Federal Government is intended to operate, and with \nthe principle of the separation of powers. It would require pursuing an \nagenda that is out of step with the American people and without the \nconsent of Congress, which, of course, is supposed to be a partner with \nany executive branch, with any President in pursuing any agenda.\n  Of course, our Founders foresaw the danger of an Executive who would \ntry this sort of thing and would do an end run around the legislature \nand try to use the enormous power at the disposal of the Executive, who \nhas massive staff and huge agencies and all kinds of resources, and \nunderstood that it is quite possible that you could have an Executive \nwho would try, for instance, selective enforcement of laws, maybe \nunilateral suspension of laws, as we have seen this administration do, \nwriting rules and regulations that are inconsistent with the laws. \nThese are all behaviors we could anticipate.\n  Our Founders did. They did. They anticipated this could happen. So \nwhat they did is they built a system that would have some checks and \nbalances, that would provide some limitations. Among the other ways \nthey did it--there were many ways this was done, but one of them was \nthe separation of powers and specifically the creation of a judiciary \nwhich would be a referee on whether, for instance, a given agency, a \ngiven regulator, was in fact complying with the laws or whether they \nhad gone rogue, whether they had gone overboard, whether they were \noverreaching, whether they were pursuing some agenda for which they did \nnot have authority.\n  These courts play an absolutely vital and I would say completely \nindispensable role in giving individual Americans their last hope in \nseeking to preserve their liberty against an unfair, arbitrary, and \neven unconstitutional executive overreach. That is what the courts do.\n  As it happens, there is one particular court that plays a \ndisproportionate role in this process of adjudicating and officiating \nover Federal regulations. It just so happens that by virtue of its \nlocation, a big majority of cases in which an American citizen \nchallenges a regulation because that citizen believes this is a \nregulation that is unfair, unconstitutional, illegal or otherwise not \nconsistent with our laws--the venue where this ends up finally getting \nadjudicated is very often the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This has become a bit of a problem for the administration and some of \nour friends in the Senate because the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has \nbecome a bit of an obstacle to some of the ambitions they would like to \nimpose. One example, for instance, is last year the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals struck down for the second time in 4 years the EPA's \nregulations on cross-State air pollution. This is a complicated story. \nWe do not have to get into all the details but, bottom line, these are \nregulations that would among other things have a devastating impact on \nStates such as Pennsylvania that have a big coal industry and that have \na big utility industry that uses coal to fire generators. The court \nfound that the EPA had gone beyond its legal authority. The statute \nclearly says what the EPA may do and may not do. They were going beyond \nwhat they are permitted to do and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said \nso.\n  That is not the only case in which the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nhas ruled in ways that are problematic to some of our friends here. \nAnother was a decision they made regarding recess appointments. You may \nremember this. A while back, the President made a very extraordinary \ndecision. The President decided for the first time in the history of \nthe Republic that it was up to him to determine when the Senate was in \nrecess and when it was not; that was his unilateral decision to make. \nNo other President ever took it upon himself to decide it was his power \nto determine when a different branch of government was in recess, but \nthis President did. He said that is his decision. So I guess by his \nlogic he could decide when we are out on lunch, that is a recess; out \non the weekend, that is a recess; that is up to him by his standard. So \nhe created an opportunity for himself to make appointments that he knew \nwould not be confirmed in the Senate or were unlikely to be confirmed.\n  There was bipartisan, in some cases, concern about some of these \nfolks. He went ahead and made the appointments. The DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals said actually, no, the Constitution is pretty clear. You do not \nhave that authority.\n  These are just a couple of examples where a nonpartisan, completely \ncompetent, and very highly respected appellate court made decisions \nabout Executive behavior. This has not sat so well with some of our \ncolleagues.\n  Why do I bring this all up? Because this is what this is truly all \nabout. This\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\nis not about Republican obstructionism. What this is about is our \nDemocratic friends want to pursue a very liberal agenda. They cannot do \nit through legislation so they intend to do it through regulation. As \nthey overreach and go beyond the legal authority, which they have \nalready done and intend to continue to do, the victims, American \ncitizens who are victims of this overreach, are going to challenge \nthese rules and regulations in court. When they do, they are going to \nend up in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Some of our friends want to do whatever it takes to make sure they \ncan win those decisions. Those are not just my words. The senior \nSenator from New York complained about the DC Circuit. He was on record \nclaiming the DC Circuit ``overturned the EPA's ability to regulate \nexisting coal plants.''\n  OK. He further went on to say, ``The SEC cannot pass rulings unless \nthey do what is called a cost-benefit analysis.'' That was another \ncomplaint the senior Senator from New York made about the DC Circuit.\n  So he told a group of supporters that in order to reverse this, \nDemocrats will ``fill up the DC Circuit one way or another.''\n  I think this is about as clear as it could be. There are people who \ndo not like the decisions coming out of the court and so their \nintention is to pack the court with people who share their political \nviews and will therefore sustain decisions about the advancement of \ntheir liberal agenda.\n  But it was not only the senior Senator from New York who made these \ncomments. The majority leader himself explained this as well. Referring \nto the DC Circuit Court he said:\n\n       They're the ones that said . . . the president can't have \n     recess appointments. . . . They've done a lot of bad things, \n     so we're focusing a very intently on the D.C. Circuit. We \n     need at least one more. There's three vacancies, we need at \n     least one more and that will switch the majority.\n\n  Could there be a more direct, straightforward statement about what \ntheir real intent is? Their intent is to pack the court with partisan \npeople who will give them the decisions they need so they can advance \nthe agenda they want when it is blocked through the ordinary legal and \nconstitutional legislative process. That is what is going on here. That \nis why we are here tonight. That is what is taking place.\n  When Republicans decided that we do not think it is a good idea to \nmanipulate courts this way, to populate them with partisans, to try \ncourt stacking for the purpose of advancing an agenda, that is when our \nDemocratic friends decided to go nuclear. The pity of this is our \nFounders had enormous foresight. They were absolutely brilliant. They \nconstructed an incredible document, a series of documents that have \nguided this Republic for centuries now. They anticipated a lot. I do \nnot think they anticipated that the leader of the majority party in the \nSenate would just turn it over to the control of the executive branch \nand make this institution just a rubberstamp for what the President \nwants to do. But that is where we are.\n\n  What is the practical consequence of all this? Why is it that this is \nsuch a terrible idea? Let me touch on a few of the reasons. There are a \nlot of reasons I think this is a disastrous policy, but let me touch on \na few of them. One result of this is undoubtedly a further \npolarization, in fact a radicalization of the Federal Government.\n  The second is that as a direct result of this unilateral decision and \nthe ability now of our Democratic friends to simply steamroll nominees \nthrough without any consideration by the minority party, we will have \nto expect fluctuations, volatility in administrative and regulatory \nrulings.\n  Then last and probably most disturbingly, I think there is a real \ndanger that a justice system that has been the envy of the world and is \nrecognized for its impartial and nonpartisan integrity may very well be \nincreasingly viewed as a partisan and biased one.\n  Let me explain this a little bit, the idea that we have a more \nradicalized Federal Government. For 200 years, a President has always \nknown that in order to nominate and to get confirmed one of his \nnominees he would need broad support in the Senate. It would not fly if \nhe selected someone who was only appealing to a few or even a very \nsmall majority. So what does this do? That forces any President, \nwhether it is a Republican or a Democrat, to nominate people who would \nhave that broader bipartisan appeal. Frankly, Presidents of both \nparties are always under pressure from their respective bases to pick \nthe most extreme people. That is what pleases the base of either party. \nIt has always served the Republic well that a President can say I have \nto get that person confirmed through the Senate and if I pick the most \nextreme people that is going to be a problem. The fact that a President \nhas needed that bipartisan support has essentially required that a \nPresident look for people who represent a broad consensus across \nAmerica.\n  In this postnuclear Senate, that moderating influence is gone. There \nis no such influence anymore, and I think it is a safe bet that we can \nexpect more extreme nominees. We have already seen some evidence of it. \nThe Hill ran a story recently. It reported that now that the nuclear \noption has been detonated, far left interest groups are ``pressing \nPresident Obama to select left-wing nominees for key regulatory and \njudicial posts, nominees who could never have been confirmable \nbefore.'' That is no surprise. That is exactly the kind of consequence \nwe should expect.\n  The second consideration is stability in rules and regulations that \nare promulgated by the various regulators and agencies. I hear every \nday across Pennsylvania one of the grave concerns of business that is \nhampering our ability to have a stronger economy, to have the kind of \ngrowth we would like to have, is uncertainty about regulations.\n  It is true and it is important. Guess what. It is likely to get worse \nbecause, first of all, this huge administrative, bureaucratic State \nthat we have devolved into recently touches on virtually every aspect \nof our life and there are hundreds of agencies, boards, and commissions \nthat the administration controls. What is likely to happen now is that \nif the White House and control of the Senate changes parties, we are \nlikely to see big swings in the ideology and the partisanship of these \nfolks because they were not consensus candidates in the first place, \nright. Given that now we have a situation where a majority party just \nsteamrolls their way through whomever they want and has every incentive \nto go to the extremes, when they lose an election what are we going to \nhave? We are going to have the exact opposite swing. So for businesses \ntrying to make a decision about whether to invest in America to grow \ntheir company, to hire more workers, they are going to worry and \nwonder: What will the regulatory regime look like in just a few years, \ndepending on how the election goes? It is much less predictability, \nless stability, and the direct result of that is going to be less \ninvestment and fewer jobs. This is not good news for our economy at \nall.\n  Finally, my concern is that for similar reasons we are going to see a \ndiminishing of the judiciary, of the status of the judiciary among the \nAmerican people, of the credibility, of the respect the American people \nhave had.\n  A moment ago I said I think one of the great strengths of the \nAmerican Federal Government throughout our history has been, generally \nspeaking, that--and there have been exceptions, and there will always \nbe some exceptions--by and large at all levels the American people have \nhad a pretty high respect for the judiciary. They respect the fact that \nour judges are capable and competent and tend not to be partisan hacks. \nThey tend not to be polarizing political figures who are trying to \nadvance an agenda. They have tended to be men and women of ability and \nintegrity who were calling balls and strikes the way they see fit. They \nrealize they are the umps and referees; they are not the players on the \nfield. They are not there to advance an agenda; they are there to \nofficiate based on the law and the Constitution. That has been the \ncase.\n  The reason our judiciary has been so respected is because it is \nnonpartisan. It is independent of the other branches of government, and \nit has behaved that way. The American people have the confidence that \nthey can go before a Federal judge and receive a fair and unbiased \nhearing whether the judge is a Democrat, Republican, liberal, or \nconservative. The fact is that most Americans don't worry and say: Wait \na minute. Is that judge a Republican? It\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\ndoesn't occur to most people to ask that question, nor should it \nbecause it doesn't matter in most cases.\n  This respect for the judiciary that the American people have is \nextremely important. In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton talked about \nthe importance of this deep respect for the judiciary. He said:\n\n       The judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three \n     departments of power.\n\n  Whereas the executive branch has the military and Congress has the \npower of the purse, the judiciary cannot enforce its own decisions. It \nrelies on Americans' respect for it and willingness to enforce its \nrulings as essential.\n  The fact is that the deep respect the American people have had for \nthe judiciary has allowed our courts, including the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, to issue decisions that have profoundly affected our \nlives, profoundly changed our society, and so many times so much for \nthe better. A famous example would be Brown v. the Board of Education, \nwhich reversed the separate-but-equal doctrine. It ended the southern \ngovernment laws that banned White and Black persons from associating \nwith each other. This created a certain upheaval at the time, but it \nstuck, and part of the reason it stuck was because the public saw that \nthis was a decision by a nonpartisan court that was acting as an \narbiter of our Constitution. The respect the American people had for \nour courts was a big part of why a contentious decision quickly became \naccepted and became part of our fabric.\n  Alexander Hamilton explained that the judiciary's integrity and \nindependence are absolutely critical; otherwise, Americans' \n``confidence'' in the courts will be replaced by what he described as \n``universal distrust and distress.'' He said:\n\n       The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the \n     judiciary . . . must have commanded the esteem and applause \n     of all the virtuous and disinterested.\n       Considerate men of every description ought to prize \n     whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the \n     courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow \n     the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a \n     gainer to-day.\n       The inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the \n     foundations of public and private confidence, and to \n     introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress.\n\n  When a President, with the cooperation of a legislature, rubberstamps \njudicial nominees for the purpose of ratifying a political agenda--when \nthis happens, the American people's trust in the judiciary will be \nbadly damaged, and we are at the threshold of that moment now. Of \ncourse, it also completely undermines our whole system of separation of \npowers. The fact is that when judges are seen as being at the beck and \ncall of a legislature, a President, or a party, our individual liberty \nis simply not secure.\n  Again, to quote Hamilton:\n\n       The general liberty of the people can never be endangered \n     from [the courts] . . . so long as the judiciary remains \n     truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, \n     but would have everything to fear from its union with either \n     of the other departments.\n\n  When you have one party ruling and completely controlling this \nprocess--and controlling it for the purpose of advancing a partisan \nagenda--that strikes me as exactly the danger Hamilton warned us of.\n  So where does that leave us in this regard? I don't think we are \ndoomed, but I do think it is very important that the American people \nrise and make their objection to this clearly heard. It is important \nthat the American people contact their Members of Congress. They need \nto exercise their ultimate control of this process at the ballot box \nand urge the Senate majority to give up its plan to use the courts to \nachieve a legislative agenda that they cannot get through a duly-\nelected Congress that represents the American people.\n  By the way, there is another big incentive for our friends to want to \npack this DC Circuit Court, and that is because the front-burner and \nmost prominent policy and political issue of the day is largely going \nto be litigated right there very soon. The DC Circuit is going to hear \na very important case that goes to heart of ObamaCare. The DC Circuit \nis hearing a case about how the IRS has chosen to implement some rules. \nThe law is very clear. The law unambiguously states that the subsidies \nObamaCare has designed for many people who buy health insurance through \ntheir exchange--those subsidies will only be available through the \nState exchanges.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, ObamaCare contemplates two different \ncategories of exchanges through which people are forced to buy the \nmandated insurance. There are State exchanges, and in those States that \ndon't operate an exchange, there are Federal exchanges. Well, the law \nsays that the subsidies are available only for the people who purchase \ntheir health insurance through the State exchanges. What the \nadministration is attempting to do is to completely disregard the law \nand make the subsidies available to people who buy through either the \nState exchange or the Federal exchange. That is not what the law says. \nI understand that this administration routinely disregards the law, but \nthat is why we have an independent judiciary--to impose a check when \nthey do this.\n\n  There is a legal scholar by the name of Mike Garvin who is following \nthis case closely. He has explained what is going on. He said:\n\n       Congress knew that the federal government cannot require \n     the states to establish or operate Exchanges, so it offered \n     subsidized insurance premiums for residents of states with \n     State-operated exchanges to entice states to undertake this \n     responsibility. Instead, fully 33 states--from Texas to Ohio \n     to President Obama's and Vice President Biden's home states \n     of Illinois and Delaware--have said ``thanks, but no \n     thanks.'' Instead, these states have chosen to shield their \n     businesses and residents from the worst of the potential \n     ``train wreck.''\n\n  That creates a bit of a problem for the administration because with \nso many States choosing not to participate in this disaster and having \nonly a Federal exchange, if they actually comply with the law they \nsigned, then there would be a lot of people who would not be eligible \nfor the subsidy. If the DC Circuit Court of Appeals were to simply \nfollow and impose the law, then that would create a huge problem, which \nstrikes me as yet another incentive for why perhaps we have gone \nthrough what we have gone through over the last couple of weeks--\nbecause it is so important for our friends on the other side to get the \ndecisions they want out of this court.\n  All of this brings me to what we really ought to be working on. By \nthe way, all of these nominees who are before us and tying us up this \nweek are all entirely at the choosing of the majority leader. None of \nthese are essential, none of these are urgent, and none of these are \nemergencies. We could be passing legislation, such as our Defense \nauthorization legislation. We have a budget deal that could be on the \nfloor. We have a farm bill that is overdue. We have a lot of things we \ncould be doing. We could be trying to deal with the enormous problems \ncaused by ObamaCare, but we are not. We are dealing with nominees \ninstead.\n  I think we ought to focus on the problems that ObamaCare is causing, \nand I will admit that sometimes it is hard to know where to begin \nbecause these problems are so huge. I will start with the taxes \nObamaCare has been imposing on us and continues to impose on us. It is \na pretty extraordinary list. As best we could tabulate, there are \nsomething like 20 different taxes that were created as part of \nObamaCare. There is over $1 trillion worth of taxes to burden this \neconomy and diminish our opportunities to grow and invest and create \nthe jobs we need at a time when our economy is weak and needs an \nopportunity to recover. Instead, we saddle it with all of these taxes.\n  For instance, we have an excise tax on charitable hospitals.\n  We have a tax in the form of the codification of the economic \nsubstance doctrine. It is a tax hike of $4.5 billion that allows the \nIRS to completely disallow legal tax deductions.\n  We have the black liquor tax hike, which is a tax increase on a type \nof biofuel.\n  We have a tax on innovator drug companies.\n  We have a $2.3 billion annual tax on the industry. We have a Blue \nCross Blue Shield tax hike, which is a special tax deduction in current \nlaw that would only be allowed if 85 percent or more of the premiums \nare spent on clinical services. That is a tax increase which went into \neffect in 2010.\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n  We have a tax on indoor tanning services.\n  We have taxes that took effect in 2011. There is the medicine cabinet \ntax. Americans are no longer able to use health savings accounts or \nflexible savings accounts or health reimbursement pretax dollars to \npurchase nonprescription over-the-counter medicine. So the inability to \nuse these taxpayer accounts for legitimate medical needs is a tax \nincrease.\n  We have the HSA withdrawal tax hike.\n  Going into effect in 2012, we have the employer reporting of \ninsurance on W-2.\n  In 2013 we have a surtax on investment income. We have a whole new \n3.8-percent surtax on investment incomes, and this can only have the \neffect of diminishing investment in our economy. It diminishes the \nreturn on investment, diminishes the incentive to take a risk and start \na new business, provide capital to a new business, grow a business, \nwhich is all due to ObamaCare.\n  We have the hike in the Medicare payroll tax.\n  One of the most egregious of them all--we have the tax on medical \ndevice manufacturers. This one is particularly egregious because it is \nso badly designed on top of being ill-conceived. This is a 2.3-percent \ntax on the sale of medical devices. Irrespective of whether a company \nhas any income whatsoever or makes any money from this, we are imposing \na tax on the sale of these products. The average medical device company \nhas a profit margin of less than 5 percent. A 2.3-percent tax is about \nhalf of all their income that now goes to a new sales tax. By the way, \nthey still have to pay income taxes, all the ordinary income taxes.\n\n  This is absolutely devastating, because what these companies are then \nforced to do is, if virtually the entire bottom line goes for taxes, \nthey don't have the money to reinvest in their business. The medical \ndevice industry is one of the best industries we have in this country. \nIt is so dynamic. It is so creative.\n  I wish my colleagues would come with me to parts of Pennsylvania \nwhere this industry is just thriving--or was thriving but not so much \nanymore. It was thriving because of the creativity, the innovation, the \ndevices, and inventions that people are making, improving the quality \nof life and extending life. It is amazing, the marriage of technology \nand creative minds and experts in health care, what they are creating.\n  But, unfortunately, for a lot of these products, it takes a long time \nbefore they are actually profitable for the company that sells them, \nlong after they have begun sales. This tax imposes the burden before \nthey have ever become profitable. What is the effect of that? It is \nthat it makes this whole industry less appealing to invest in, less \nattractive to entrepreneurs, to investors. Whether it is venture \ncapital or private equity or wherever the source might be, less is \ngoing to medical devices, an industry that is saving lives and \nimproving the quality of lives. It is a big manufacturing industry. \nMost of these companies manufacture their products in the United States \nand many in Pennsylvania. We sell a lot of them overseas. We have a big \ntrade surplus in medical devices because we lead the world.\n  What does ObamaCare do? It slaps a new tax on the sales. It is a \nterrible policy.\n  We have a high medical bills tax. Currently, those people who face \nhigh medical bills are allowed a deduction for medical expenses to the \nextent that those expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. \nThe new provision, which took effect just earlier this year, raises \nthat threshold before a person can take that deduction. That is just a \ncomplicated, convoluted tax increase on people who have high medical \nbills.\n  There is the flexible spending account cap. There is the elimination \nof the tax deduction for employer-provided retirement drug coverage in \ncoordination with Medicare Part D. There is the individual mandate \nexcise tax. There is the employer mandate tax. There is the tax on \nhealth insurers. There is an excise tax on comprehensive health \ninsurance plans.\n  There are 20 different taxes, the combined effect of which is, \nwithout a doubt, to significantly weaken our economy.\n  But that is not the only way ObamaCare weakens our economy. The \nmandate ObamaCare imposes on employers kicks in on employers who have \n50 or more employees. I have spoken with a number of Pennsylvania \nemployers who have 45 or 47 or 48 employees. They are not subject to \nthe hugely expensive mandates of ObamaCare, and do my colleagues know \nwhat they tell me? They are not going to be subject to it. They will go \nto great lengths to avoid hiring the fiftieth employee. They will hire \ntemps. They will pursue automation. They will do all kinds of things \nthey wouldn't otherwise do because this government makes it too \nexpensive for them to hire a fiftieth employee. At a time when our \nworkforce participation rate is at a record low because so many people \nhave given up even trying to find work, ObamaCare makes it too \nexpensive for employers to hire new workers.\n  It has a similar effect on hours worked, because this 50-employee \ncount applies to anybody who works 30 hours or more, so one of the ways \na business can avoid these crippling costs is to cut back on the number \nof hours for their workers. That doesn't work out so well for somebody \nwho needs those hours to pay their bills to support their family. It is \nhappening all across the country.\n  Another aspect that is really outrageous is this mandate in ObamaCare \nthat employers must--regardless of whether the employees want it or \nnot--provide contraceptive and abortifacient coverage. One of the \nproblems with this is that these services run completely contrary to \ndeeply held religious views for a lot of people, faith-based \ninstitutions, and others. So the administration decided they will offer \nan accommodation for faith-based institutions. The accommodation they \noffer is pure sophistry. What they offered was to say you won't have \nto--you, the faith-based institution--you won't have to actually pay \nfor those services which you find objectionable based on your faith. \nYou won't have to pay for them, but you have to buy an insurance plan \nthat has them and the insurance company will just have to give you that \nfor free.\n  This is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Private companies \naren't in the business of offering their services for free. If there is \nan aspect of it that they supposedly have to give away, then they will \npass on the costs for the services they provide. Nobody is fooled by \nthis. This is yet another of the details of ObamaCare.\n  But, really, some of the biggest problems I have saved for the end, \nand that is the series of broken promises that ObamaCare constitutes. \nOne of the most glaring is this promise we have all heard. I don't know \nhow many times we have heard it, but we all have. We heard the \nPresident and so many of our Democratic colleagues who support this \nbill say: If you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan. \nLet's be very clear. Everybody who supported this bill who is familiar \nwith it--and that would certainly include the President of the United \nStates and my friends here--they knew from the beginning that was not \npossible. They knew that because the legislation was designed to \nprevent many people from keeping their health insurance. It was written \nfor that purpose, in part, because they had to. The whole point, or a \nbig part of the point of ObamaCare was to establish standards that the \ngovernment determined were appropriate, regardless of whether an \nindividual American thinks that a given plan is adequate or not or \nsuitable for herself or her family. It was up to the government to make \nthis decision, not the individual, and they would establish criteria, \nand if your plan didn't meet the criteria, your plan was going to be \ncanceled. That is in the legislation. That is codified. It always was. \nIt is at the heart of this legislation.\n  So for anybody to go around the country saying, If you like your \nhealth plan, you can keep your health plan, they were knowingly stating \nsomething that was completely untrue, was always untrue, and was \nnecessarily untrue. The examples abound.\n  I have emails from constituents. I have too many. I won't have a \nchance to run through them all this evening. I may have to come back on \nanother occasion. But I will share a few with my\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\ncolleagues. This is from a small business owner from Lancaster County, \nPA. I got this just--I think I got this earlier today. I will just \nquote from this email from my constituent, addressed to me. It says:\n\n       As my Congressional representative, you need to know how \n     ObamaCare is harming my life and health care.\n       I work for a small construction company. My cost for family \n     health care was already over $11,000 per year. We received \n     notification that our policy was being canceled since it did \n     not comply with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n       Our company looked for the best rates they could find for \n     comparable coverage which did comply. They chose a new \n     insurance company. We just recently were given the costs for \n     next year. My costs to cover myself and my family will be \n     over $17,500, a 59-percent increase. Even with that, the \n     deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums are higher. This is \n     not ``Affordable Care''. This would eat up a major part of my \n     income.\n       I attempted to log onto the healthcare.gov website several \n     times, but always get kicked out. I do not hold much hope \n     that I will get any better rates, because I don't qualify for \n     a credit.\n       We were already struggling to live on my take home pay. We \n     cannot afford to have it reduced by over $6,500.00. We may \n     have to drop coverage for my wife or kids, and pay the \n     penalty.\n       I suspect that this law will result in many more people \n     losing more health care, at the expense of a few getting free \n     or reduced cost healthcare.\n\n  I got this just a week ago from a man from Cumberland County, PA. He \nsaid:\n\n       My wife Barb and I have been trying for almost three weeks \n     now to get signed up. . . . all income and health info and \n     private information is on the unsecured web site and the \n     application is accepted . . . but we have not been able to \n     get on to pick the plan or get our price . . . so nobody has \n     been paid. Thus our canceled insurance ends on Dec. 31st and \n     we look to be out.\n       A BIG mistake by the folks who voted for this . . . I've \n     had cancer a couple times, my wife has had cancer and we both \n     see our doctors when needed. This ACA will ruin many families \n     if we can't get onto an insurance plan.\n\n  A woman from Lebanon County, PA, sent me this email a week ago. She \nsaid:\n\n       We had our healthcare discontinued, and after an appeal we \n     were able to get it reinstated, but only for this year. \n     Currently we have a health care savings plan with a \n     deductible of $3,000 a year. . . . In the new plan, our \n     deductible would increase to $12,000 . . . and our premiums \n     would increase to $9,000 a year. How is a middle class \n     married family supposed to pay for that?\n       This is absolutely ridiculous, and this is our situation. I \n     hope every government worker has to purchase their plan \n     through this plan.\n\n  Here is another. A man from Delaware County in southeastern \nPennsylvania:\n\n       I am 66 and I am on Medicare. My wife is 63. Her insurance \n     company canceled her ``longstanding'' policy due to the \n     requirements of the ACA. Her ``new'' policy costs $350 more \n     per month. We are on a strict budget. . . . We are the hard \n     working middle class. Who stands for us?\n\n  There was another promise we frequently heard, and that promise we \nfrequently heard was that if you like your doctor, you will be able to \nkeep your doctor. This too was known to be impossible. Since the law \nwas designed to discontinue health insurance plans and force people on \nto alternative plans, not all plans cover the same doctors. Certainly, \nsome were going to lose their coverage. Let me give an example of an \nemail I got from Westmoreland County just last week. She writes:\n\n       I have been self-employed for 13 years and have never been \n     without health insurance. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis. Having an expensive preexisting condition \n     was not a problem for me as I had never let my insurance \n     lapse. My medications cost (without insurance) $4,000+ per \n     month. I received notice several weeks ago that they would \n     now cancel my plan and would do so as of Jan 1, and I had to \n     sign up for new coverage through the health insurance \n     exchange.\n\n  My staff reached out to this woman and tried to help and, after \nseveral attempts, she was able to access the exchange. Do my colleagues \nknow what she learned? She learned that in her region there were two \noptions available to her. One covers her doctors who have been treating \nher for her MS for years. The other covers her prescription drugs. \nNeither one covers both.\n  These are the kinds of decisions people are being forced to make all \nover America. They are the kinds of decisions people are being forced \nto make every day. It is the direct result of the loss of personal \nfreedom that this legislation imposes on people, and this is the topic \nthat we ought to be addressing in this body so we can pursue the only \nsolution, which is to repeal this bill and move health care in a \ncompletely different direction.\n  I believe my time has expired, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n          Fallen Firefighters Assistance Tax Clarification Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a particular \nincident that occurred in Webster, NY, a beautiful town near the City \nof Rochester.\n  On Christmas Eve, 2012, nearly 1 year ago today, the 125-member West \nWebster Volunteer Firemen's Association--a volunteer fire department \neast of Rochester, NY--faced an unimaginable tragedy when four of their \nbrave members were wounded, two fatally, when they responded to a fire \nbut instead faced an ambush of unspeakable proportions.\n  While many families across our Nation were waking up last Christmas \nEve morning to finish preparing Christmas dinner, shopping, wrapping \npresents, picking up the family from the airport, four Webster families \nwere instead confronting a heart-wrenching tragedy.\n  The call of a house on fire came into the West Webster Fire \nDepartment at 5:30 a.m. on December 24, and although it was a cold \nsnowy morning, still dark before the Sun rose, everyday heroes from the \nWest Webster Fire Department courageously did what they volunteered to \ndo on behalf of their neighbors and on behalf of their hometowns. They, \nsimilar to millions of brave volunteer firefighters throughout our \ncountry and throughout its history, left their homes and their families \nin safety to put out a fire that always creates danger.\n  This routine call turned into a tragedy which shocked the community, \npeople throughout the country, and even people throughout the world.\n  Firefighter Joseph Hofstetter, a 14-year volunteer for West Webster \nFire Department, arrived first on the scene. Firefighter Theodore \nScardino arrived soon after with LT Mike Chiapperini in a pumper truck, \nfollowed by 19-year-old firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka driving the \ndepartment's SUV.\n  What they did not know was that the fire was intentionally set by the \nhome's owner in order to lure these innocent firefighters into a \nsenseless sniper ambush. The sniper was hiding behind a berm amid the \nchaos of the fire and began shooting at the responding firefighters.\n  The firefighters were confused at first to hear popping sounds and \nthought it might be from the fire but LT Mike Chiapperini, who was also \na Webster police officer, knew better and shouted to his fellow \nvolunteers to take cover, but unfortunately it was too late.\n  Firefighter Hofstetter was shot in the pelvis while trying to alert \ndispatchers on the radio to the situation.\n  Ted Scardino was shot in the shoulder, and 5 minutes later he was \nshot again in the leg. The 16-year volunteer lay there while bleeding \nfor over an hour, enduring the December cold while sustaining second-\ndegree burns on his head as the fire now spread to consume six other \nneighboring homes.\n  Lieutenant Chiapperini and Firefighter Kaczowka both died in the \nambush.\n  As news of this horrific, senseless Christmas Eve tragedy spread, \nwell-meaning people from across the Rochester and Finger Lakes area, \nacross New York State, across the Nation and the world reached out to \nthe West Webster Volunteer Firemen's Association to offer support and \nprayers.\n  Thousands of incredibly generous people flooded the department with \ncountless financial contributions to support the volunteer department, \nto support the four firefighters--and in the case of Lieutenant \nChiapperini and Firefighter Kaczowka, to support the families they had \nleft behind.\n  Not realizing that collecting and distributing the funds to the \nfamilies would jeopardize the association's tax-exempt status with the \nIRS, the association accepted donations from generous people all around \nthe Nation wanting to help the four families who suffered the most on \nthat day.\n  They collected these donations for the victims, for their families, \nand they want to give these donations to\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nthe victims and their families. It defies reason that they would be \nunable to do so now because of a technicality in the Tax Code.\n  Just as we did after 9/11, and again after a similar fire department \ntragedy in California in 2006, it is our obligation to make sure the \nWest Webster Volunteer Firemen's Association can now disburse to these \nfamilies the contributions that their neighbors and unknown, countless, \ngenerous others wanted them to have.\n  As it is, the disbursement of these funds has been delayed for months \nand now almost 1 year. That is why I am asking the Senate to proceed \nwith consideration of the Fallen Firefighters Assistance Tax \nClarification Act.\n  This proposal merely clarifies--as we did after 9/11 and again after \nthe California tragedy in 2006--that the West Webster Volunteer Fire \nDepartment will not lose its status as a nonprofit association by \ndistributing the donations to these firefighters and their families.\n  As we again enter the Christmas season and approach the 1-year \nanniversary of this tragedy, now is the time to make this right.\n  We need to do it on behalf of the families of the fallen and the \ninjured. The family of 43-year-old LT Mike Chiapperini includes his \nwife Kim, his 19-year-old son Nick, and his daughters, 4-year-old Kacie \nand 3-year-old Kylie.\n  Known to many as Chip, Lieutenant Chiapperini was a West Webster Fire \nDepartment volunteer firefighter for 25 years. He was past chief of the \nWest Webster Fire Department and adviser for its Fire Explorer Post. He \nalso served with distinction for 19 years as a police officer with the \nWebster Police Department and rose through the ranks as a dispatcher, \npolice officer, investigator, sergeant, and lieutenant. In short, he \ncommitted his entire life to public service for the town of Webster.\n  Likewise, 19-year-old firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka left behind his \nparents Janina and Marian Kaczowka, along with his older twin brothers \nand a large extended family. Firefighter Kaczowka was selflessly \ndevoted to his family and his community. In fact, he was not even \nsupposed to be on duty that Christmas Eve but elected to make the shift \nso that older department members could be home with their families that \nday.\n  The surviving firefighters, Ted Scardino and Joseph Hofstetter, have \nhad to endure long rehabilitations for their injuries and their \nfamilies have had to deal with life's ordinary challenges and day-to-\nday expenses as Ted and Joseph recover and move forward with their \nlives.\n  The fact is, ordinary Americans, moved by the heroic sacrifice of \nthese volunteer firefighters, have offered their generous support. They \nhave intended their contributions to help these families in the wake of \nthe tragedy and in recognition of the service of these brave \nfirefighters.\n  These were volunteer firefighters--volunteers. I know many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are well acquainted with the \nvolunteer fire service. Many may even have a membership in a volunteer \nfire company themselves.\n  You all know men and women just like the members of West Webster. \nThey are the epitome of the American spirit.\n  The French observer de Tocqueville was taken by that spirit when he \nvisited America and the Rochester area in 1831 and thought voluntarism \nwas one of the things that set America apart from the rest of the \nworld. That was true then. It is still true today.\n  These heroes do not ask for anything. They just want to protect their \nneighbors and their community. It is just plain wrong that they would \nlose their not-for-profit status simply for being a passthrough to \nconvey donations to these families after an unspeakable tragedy.\n  In that same spirit, I had hoped to request unanimous consent this \nevening to move forward with the consideration of this legislation. Who \ncould object? Who could object? However, I understand that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle object to me making the \nrequest at this time. Therefore, I will withhold that request this \nevening and sincerely hope my colleagues will think about this \novernight and allow us to proceed with consideration tomorrow. It is, \nindeed, the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom New York. He has been a tireless champion for the terrific, \ndedicated, self-sacrificing firefighters of New York City.\n  Tonight we are on the floor addressing the question of whether we \nshould confirm Cornelia Pillard as a candidate for the DC Circuit \nCourt. She is a law scholar with a long track record of public service. \nShe served twice in the Justice Department and successfully defended \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, a crucial piece of legislation for \nworking families. She now teaches law at Georgetown University, one of \nthe top law schools in the Nation.\n  The truth is, she is an extremely well-qualified nominee who will be \nan excellent addition to the DC Circuit Court. She has personally \nargued and briefed Supreme Court cases brought or defended by \ngovernment lawyers from Republican administrations, and Republican-\nappointed Justices have often authored majority opinions in her favor.\n  She is currently the codirector of the Supreme Court Institute at \nGeorgetown Law, where she personally assists lawyers preparing for the \nSupreme Court on a pro bono, first-come basis, without regard to which \nside they represent.\n  In fact, Professor Pillard chaired the American Bar Association \nReading Committee that reviewed Samuel Alito's writings during his \nnomination process for the Supreme Court. Her committee's assessment \nled the ABA to give Justice Alito their highest rating of ``well-\nqualified.''\n  Professor Pillard's unbiased approach to the law has won the respect \nof her colleagues in law and in government, including former Department \nof Justice officials in Republican administrations who have endorsed \nher nomination to the DC Circuit.\n  In short, Professor Pillard is a fairminded, highly accomplished \nlitigator, with an outstanding reputation for public service.\n  Then why are we here now, after midnight, carrying on this debate? To \nget to the root of that question, we have to examine the dysfunction \nthat is present in the Senate.\n  Virtually all Americans know Congress is not working well. Virtually \nall Americans know the Senate is broken. I saw a poll that said 92 \npercent of Americans believe Congress is dysfunctional, and I wondered: \nWhat is wrong with the other 8 percent? They must not be paying \nattention. Because what we have experienced in the Senate is a \ncontinuous campaign of obstruction and paralysis of the normal \nproceedings.\n  There was a time when we had a Senate that had a core principle, \nwhich was up-or-down votes, with rare exception--up-or-down votes, with \nrare exception. That was the tradition of the Senate. That tradition \nwas rooted in the courtesy--the courtesy--of hearing out every Senator \nwho wished to share their opinion on a topic before the Senate would \nmake a decision.\n  Maybe that was something easier to do when there were only 26 Members \nof the Senate. We now have 100 Members of the Senate. So maybe it takes \na while to hear the opinions of every Member, but still that courtesy \nhas been honored through the years. But the counterpart to that is that \nfolks knew in the end the Senate, with very rare exception, would get \nto a simple majority vote. The entire structure of our Constitution and \nthe vision of our Founders was that this body would make decisions with \na simple majority vote.\n  Recall, if you will, that the Founders put into the Constitution \nspecial occasions for a supermajority. Those special occasions were \nthings such as overriding a Presidential veto. Those special occasions \nwere things such as reviewing a treaty. But they envisioned a simple \nmajority vote for the legislature because they felt the majority \ndecision most of the time would be a better direction to go than the \nminority opinion. That is the principle of democracy. The direction \nthat most Senators believe is the correct direction is the basis for \ngoing forward.\n  This principle has been completely lost in the last few years. A \nsmall\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\ngroup of Senators decided they should replace the constitutional \nprinciple of a simple majority with a supermajority, that virtually \nevery action would be subject to a requirement to have 60 votes to \nclose debate rather than the constitutional 51.\n  This has been applied in ways American citizens cannot even imagine. \nLet's take motions to proceed. A motion to proceed simply says it is \ntime to take up this bill. Let's vote yes or no on taking up this bill. \nThat is the motion to proceed.\n  But in recent times the minority has said: You know what. We can use \nthis motion to proceed as an opportunity to paralyze the Senate. We can \nobject to having that simple majority vote, and then we can deny--there \nbeing this supermajority to close debate--even if we have nothing to \nsay, and we can simply waste the Senate's time on debating whether to \ndebate.\n  I have argued for a long time that this abuse must end. It is time to \nget rid of the filibuster on this motion to proceed. But nonetheless we \nhave it and my colleagues in this permanent campaign to paralyze the \nSenate have chosen to exercise this filibuster, if you will, this \nsupermajority requirement, simply on a motion to debate an issue as \nopposed to actually being in debate.\n  Let's take conference committees. It was extraordinarily rare for \nconference committees--the formation of them--to be subject to a \nsupermajority in the history of the Senate. Conference committees were \nvery common in the seventies and eighties. I was first here as an \nintern in 1976 with Senator Hatfield, here on Capitol Hill working for \nCongress in the 1980s.\n  If one Chamber of Congress and the other Chamber had both passed a \nbill, well then automatically you had a conference committee meet and \nresolve the differences. That is just common sense. Why would you delay \nthat for a second? But when I came to the Senate in 2009 as a Senator, \nI was mystified to discover that conference committees were not being \nheld. So I inquired why that was. The answer was that the minority had \ndecided to use the filibuster, the supermajority, on establishing a \nconference committee; in other words, block the House and Senate from \neven talking to each other to resolve differences between two houses.\n  That drove the debate out of the public realm, in a public room with \na TV camera, into private discussions as negotiators tried to resolve \nand develop a common version of the bill. There too I proposed that we \nneed to get rid of this filibuster on conference committees. It is \ndisrespectful of the most valuable commodity of this body; that is, \ntime; that is, time is wasted on filibusters on whether to start a \ndiscussion with the House when both the House and Senate have passed a \nversion of the bill.\n  Then, of course, we have the ongoing campaign of subjecting virtually \nevery nomination to a supermajority. In fact, in the history of \nAmerica, in the entire history, before President Obama, only three \ntimes was there a filibuster of a district court nominee. But in the \ntime President Obama has been in office, we have had 20 filibusters of \ndistrict court nominees. Only 3 in our history until President Obama is \nPresident and then 20 filibusters when he became President until now--\n20 out of 23.\n  That is just a pure deliberate campaign of paralysis and obstruction, \nundermining the contribution of this body, its responsibility as a \nlegislative body. It is not only judicial nominees, it is executive \nnominees as well. In our entire history as a nation, 168 nominations \nhave been filibustered--168 in our entire history--82 of them have been \nnominations by President Obama; 82 nominees just in the 5 years \nPresident Obama has been in office out of the 168 in our entire \nhistory. So we see, whether we are looking at motions to proceed or \nconference committees or judicial nominees or executive nominees, a \ncampaign of deliberate paralysis and obstruction rather than a \ndedication to serving our Nation as the Constitution requires.\n  Indeed, some have justified this ongoing paralysis. Some of my \ncolleagues have said: But remember, President Washington said the \nSenate should be a cooling saucer. That concept is that you have a cup \nof hot tea, and it is too hot to drink, you pour it into a saucer, it \ncools and then it is just right.\n  President Washington would never recognize this strategy of \nobstruction and paralysis as legitimate under the U.S. Constitution. \nIndeed, there were elements designed to make this body deliberative. \nBut there is a difference between deliberation and the destruction of \nthe legislative process. There is a difference between a cooling \nsaucer, thoughtful deliberation, and a deep freeze.\n  But certain Members of this body have decided they did not come here \nto fulfill the constitutional vision of the Senate as a deliberative \nbody, they instead have come to paralyze the function of this body, to \nobstruct this body.\n  So there we see it in the filibuster of the conference committees, in \nthe filibuster of the motions to proceed, in the filibuster of the \nexecutive branch nominees, filibuster of the judicial nominees, and, of \ncourse, the filibuster of legislation that has reached extraordinary \nlevels never seen in the history of our Nation.\n  Just a little while ago one of my colleagues chose to quote Alexander \nHamilton in defense of this strategy of paralysis. I would encourage my \ncolleague to actually read more of Alexander Hamilton because he \nactually directly addressed this question of filibusters and the \npotential to obstruct the will of the majority.\n  What did Alexander Hamilton say? He said: The real operation of the \nfilibuster ``is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy \nof government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of \na significant, insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junta, to the \nregular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.\n  He went on to say: When the majority must conform to the views of the \nminority, the consequence is ``tedious delays, continual negotiation \nand intrigue, contemptible compromises of the public good.''\n  That is a pretty good description of what Americans see happening in \nthis Chamber as a result of the deliberate campaign of paralysis and \nobstruction: tedious delays, continual intrigue, contemptible \ncompromises of the public good.\n  Many in this Chamber have tried to reason and convey to Members that \nwe should return to the tradition of the Senate, up-or-down votes with \nrare exception. In 2005 it was the Democrats in the minority and it was \nthe Republicans who were in the majority. At that time the Democrats \ndecided to filibuster a series of judicial nominees. So this was \ncertainly a tactic employed by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  Our Republican friends who were in the majority said: That is not \nacceptable. They said: That is not consistent with the philosophy of \nup-or-down votes with rare exception. They said that is not consistent \nwith the power vested in the Constitution and the President to be able \nto place forward his nominees for consideration under the advice and \nconsent clause of the Constitution.\n  Our Republican colleagues were persuasive. The Democrats in the \nminority agreed not to filibuster judges except under rare exceptions, \nexceptions of extraordinary flaws of character and experience. Then the \nclock turned. We came to 2009. Now we have a Democratic President and \nDemocratic majority. The deal that was cut in 2005, agreed to by both \nsides, that there would be only rare filibusters based on exceptional \nflaws of character or experience disappeared. It disappeared \ncompletely. The new minority did not honor the deal that had been \nnegotiated in 2005.\n  So come January 2011, there was a debate on this floor about trying \nto again restore the traditional understanding, up-or-down votes with \nrare exception. There was a deal made. It did not last but a few weeks. \nThen there was another attempt in January 2013. On this occasion, there \nwas a promise made on the floor of the Senate. The minority leader came \nto the floor and said: The Republicans will return to the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate regarding nominations.\n  What are those norms and traditions? Those norms and traditions are a \nsimple majority vote with rare exception. Within weeks, that promise \nwas completely shattered. The first ever filibuster in U.S. history of \na Defense nominee, ironically a former colleague from the Republican \nside of the aisle.\n  Then we had 43 Senators write a letter and say they would not allow \nanyone to be confirmed for the position as\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nDirector of the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau, certainly \ninconsistent with up-or-down votes with rare exception for issues of \ncharacter.\n  Then there was another big effort in July of 2013, just earlier this \nyear. We all got together in the Old Senate Chamber and we shared our \nfrustrations and our views. Again, the promise was put forward: We will \nstop filibustering except under rare circumstances related to character \nor qualifications.\n  Well, that was terrific.\n  We had confirmation of the person who was awaiting to be Director of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy. We had confirmation \nof the person who had been waiting for a very long time as the nominee \nof the Labor Department, Tom Perez. We had the confirmation of the \nfolks who had been waiting to be confirmed to the National Labor \nRelations Board. In fact, I think that was the first time we had all \nfive members Senate confirmed in 10 years.\n  We had the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nRichard Cordray was finally confirmed. Shortly thereafter, we had \nSamantha Powers confirmed to the United Nations, and so forth. The norm \nwas restored but only for a couple of weeks.\n  Then came the nomination of Mel Watt to head the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency. Suddenly the commitment for up-or-down votes \ndisappeared. Then we had a whole new strategy on the judiciary. This \nstrategy had never been experienced in U.S. history. It was: No matter \nwhom President Obama nominates for the DC Circuit Court, we are going \nto block that nominee because we only want to leave in place the \nnominees that were put in place by President Bush.\n  That is in direct contravention of the vision of the Constitution \nwhere each President as elected has the power to nominate. This Chamber \nis a check. It gets to vote up or down and decide whether they should \nbe in office. But this was a deliberate strategy to pack the Court, to \nsay that when a President of my party is in power, there will be up-or-\ndown votes, as was insisted in 2005 when the tables were turned, but \nwhen the President is of the other party, we are going to have a \nperpetual campaign and we are going to block up-or-down votes.\n  Let's picture down the road and the new President is a Republican \nPresident. Is there truly any Member here who would say, from the \nRepublican side, that when the Republican President is in place, they \nwere still going to believe they should not fill vacancies on key \ncourts around this country?\n  It is too bad this campaign of paralysis has been allowed to go on so \nlong. We should have acted long before to fulfil our responsibility to \nhave a deliberative body because that is what legislation is. It is \ndoing enormous damage to the United States of America. First, because \nof the paralysis, we are not doing the work we should be on \nlegislation. We are not addressing the big issues facing America. There \nare all kinds of job creation bills that have not been able to get to \nthis floor because they have not been able to get through the gauntlet \nof paralyzing filibusters that have been laid down.\n  Americans actually want to work. Americans want to have living-wage \njobs. They expect us to act, to make that happen, not to paralyze this \ninstitution so it is unable to do so. Indeed, in addition, we are \ndamaging the view of the United States around the world because it used \nto be the world looked to the United States and said: Look how well \ntheir Congress works. They had this Great Depression. They took on and \nfixed all kinds of flaws in their financial system. They established \ninsurance for bank accounts so there would not be runs on the banks. \nThey replaced a flawed mortgage strategy, which involved callable \nballoon mortgages, with noncallable fully amortizing mortgages so we \ndid not create a series of dominoes.\n  They took and created organizations, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, to oversee stock markets so folks could have faith, invest \nin stocks, and put their capital in knowing there was a very good \nchance that capital would be well utilized because there were \naccounting standards and qualifications that block predatory practices \non Wall Street.\n  The world saw the U.S. respond to World War II and convert our \neconomy through enormous amounts of legislation in a single year to \napply it to the war effort and take on the big challenge of defeating \nthe Nazis.\n  Then the world saw America use its legislative power to build the \nlargest middle class the world has ever seen. Those living wage jobs, \nevery one of them means a foundation for a family. If we want to talk \nfamily values, then fight to have this body, this Senate, work on \nlegislation that creates living-wage jobs. Quit paralyzing the Senate.\n  Then we have, of course, the fact of this new strategy in these \nrecent months, a deliberate attack on the balance of powers. The \nConstitution envisioned three branches in balance. It has no hint of \nany kind that a minority of one branch should be able to undermine the \noperation of the other two branches. Some colleagues have seized upon a \nstrategy of trying to undermine the integrity of our judiciary. Some \ncolleagues have seized on a strategy of trying to undermine the \ncapability of the elected executive branch, the President and his \nexecutive branch.\n  Read your history--balance of powers, not the ability of the minority \nor one branch to undermine the success of the other two branches. We \nneed these three branches each doing their assigned roles.\n  We are at this point after this long set of strategies of paralysis, \non motions to proceed, on legislation, on conference committees, on \nexecutive branch nominees, on judicial nominees. We have taken the \nfirst step toward restoring the function of the Senate, and we have \nsaid we should return to the notion of up-and-down votes as envisioned \nunder advise and consent. This is as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton \nand the other Founders who railed against the notion that a minority \nwould be able to block the will of a majority in the Chamber.\n  We have done that with nominations. In a continuation of a strategy \nof paralysis, we are here tonight rather than having voted much earlier \nin the day. Instead of working on legislation that would create jobs, \nwe are standing here through a series of nominations as the minority \ninsists on wasting the valuable commodity of time in this Chamber.\n  I hope my colleagues who are intent upon creating this huge imbalance \nbetween the branches will reconsider, that they will decide they want \nto see this Chamber become what it was when I was first here in the \n1970s and when I worked for Congress in the 1980s, a great deliberative \nbody. What it was when we took on the Great Depression, what it was \nwhen we took on World War II, what it was when we built the great \nmiddle class, this is what the United States wants to see. May we make \nit so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight we will vote on the nomination of \nNina Pillard to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. On \nTuesday, we were finally able to invoke cloture on her nomination, \nafter it had been unjustifiably filibustered by Senate Republicans for \nnearly 3 months after being favorably voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. The DC Circuit is often considered to be the second most \nimportant court in the Nation and should be operating at full strength. \nWe are finally taking another step towards making this Court operate at \nfull strength for the American people.\n  Nina Pillard is an accomplished litigator whose work includes 9 \nSupreme Court oral arguments, and briefs in more than 25 Supreme Court \ncases. She drafted the Federal Government's brief in United States v. \nVirginia, which after a 7 to 1 decision by the Supreme Court made \nhistory by opening the Virginia Military Institute's doors to female \nstudents and expanded educational opportunity for women across the \ncountry. Since then, hundreds of women have had the opportunity to \nattend VMI and go on to serve our country.\n  She has not only stood up for equal opportunities for women, but for \nmen as well. In Nevada v. Hibbs, Ms. Pillard successfully represented a \nmale employee of the State of Nevada who was fired when he tried to \ntake unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act to care for his \nsick wife. In a 6 to 3 opinion authored by then-Chief Justice William \nRehnquist, the Supreme Court ruled for her client, recognizing\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nthat the law protects both men and women in their caregiving roles \nwithin the family.\n  She has also worked at the Department of Justice as the Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, an office \nthat advises on the most complex constitutional issues facing the \nexecutive branch. And prior to that, Ms. Pillard litigated numerous \ncivil rights cases as an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense & \nEducational Fund. At Georgetown Law, Ms. Pillard teaches advanced \ncourses on constitutional law and civil procedure, and co-directs the \nlaw school's Supreme Court Institute. She has earned the American Bar \nAssociation's highest possible ranking--Unanimously Well Qualified--to \nserve as a Federal appellate judge on the DC Circuit.\n  Today, however, I have heard some unfortunate and unfair attacks on \nthis fine woman. I have heard comments that she would be ``the most \nleft wing judge'' in U.S. history; that she has extreme views on \nabortion and religious liberty; and that she would ``rubber stamp'' the \nmost radical legislative and regulatory proposals. One might expect \nthese outrageous accusations to come from right wing fringe groups, but \nto hear some of these outlandish accusations on the Senate floor is \nunfortunate.\n  So let me clear the record. Nina Pillard is one of the finest \nnominees we have had before this body. On the issue of abortion, \nRepublicans have cherry picked quotes and taken them out of context to \ntry to paint her as someone she is not. The truth is that taken as a \nwhole, her writings have focused on bridging the gap between pro-life \nand pro-choice advocates by ``finding common ground for ways to reduce \nreliance on abortion.''\n  More importantly, I cannot ignore the double standard of certain \nSenators on the issue of abortion. In 2002, the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed President Bush's nomination of Michael McConnell to the Tenth \nCircuit by voice vote. Professor McConnell argued that Roe v. Wade was \nwrongly decided and urged the Supreme Court to overturn it. He \napplauded a Federal judge for refusing to convict anti-abortion \nprotestors, even though they had clearly violated the law, because of \nhis sympathetic reading of the defendants' motives.\n  Similarly, in 2002, the Senate confirmed William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit, even though he called Roe v. Wade the ``worst \nabomination in the history of constitutional law.'' Another President \nBush nominee, J. Leon Holmes, was confirmed to the Federal district \ncourt in Arkansas, even though he had argued that abortion should be \nbanned even in case of rape because pregnancy from rape is as uncommon \nas ``snowfall in Miami.'' He had also written that wives should be \nsubmissive to their husbands. He was not filibustered. He was \nconfirmed.\n  Each of these judicial nominees stated under oath in testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that they could set aside their personal \nbeliefs and would interpret the law consistent with the Constitution \nand Supreme Court precedent. They were confirmed. Nina Pillard \ntestified under the same oath that, ``A judge's opinions and views \nshould have no role in interpreting the Constitution.'' Are we to \nbelieve that only judicial nominees who do not support a woman's access \nto abortion services are able to set aside their personal views to be \nfair and impartial judges? I cannot help but notice the glaring double \nstandard that is imposed on Nina Pillard.\n  On the issue of religious liberty, Senate Republicans continue to \nmisrepresent comments Ms. Pillard made about the possible outcome of a \nSupreme Court case to suggest she is hostile to religious freedom. In a \n2011 briefing to educate the press on legal issues in Hosanna Tabor v. \nEEOC, she described the issue in the case, identified what was \ndifficult about it, and offered a prediction of how the Court might \nresolve it. Her prediction turned out to be wrong.\n  If Senators, who have also sworn to uphold the Constitution, were \nheld accountable every time they incorrectly predicted the outcome of a \nSupreme Court case, I am not sure how many of us would be left. \nUltimately, she has testified that if confirmed she would uphold the \nSupreme Court's precedent on the issue.\n  The suggestion that Ms. Pillard will be ``the most left-wing judge in \nthe history'' is simply outlandish hyperbole, as demonstrated by the \nbipartisan support she has received. Viet Dinh, the former Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Policy under President George \nW. Bush, wrote in a letter of support for her nomination that ``Based \non our long and varied professional experience together, I know that \nProfessor Pillard is exceptionally bright, a patient and unbiased \nlistener, and a lawyer of great judgment and unquestioned integrity. . \n. Nina has always been fair, reasonable, and sensible in her judgments. \n. . She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for the law and \nfor the limited, and essential, role of the federal appellate judge--\nqualities that make her well prepared to take on the work of a D.C. \nFederal Judge.''\n  Former FBI Director and Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas \nWilliam Sessions has written that her ``rare combination of experience, \nboth defending and advising government officials, and representing \nindividuals seeking to vindicate their rights, would be especially \nvaluable in informing her responsibilities as a judge.''\n  Nina Pillard has also received letters of support from 30 former \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces, including 8 retired generals; 25 \nformer Federal prosecutors and other law enforcement officials; 40 \nSupreme Court practitioners, including Laurence Tribe and Carter \nPhillips, among many others.\n  Despite having filled nearly half of law school classrooms for the \nlast 20 years, women are grossly underrepresented on our Federal \ncourts. We need women on the Federal bench. A vote to end this \nfilibuster is a vote to break yet another barrier and move in the \nhistoric direction of having our Federal appellate courts more \naccurately reflect the gender balance of the country.\n  I commend President Obama on his nominations of highly qualified \nwomen like Nina Pillard, Patricia Millett, Elena Kagan and Sonia \nSotomayor. In each of these women, the Senate has had the opportunity \nto vote to confirm women practicing at the pinnacle of the legal \nprofession. Once the Senate confirmed Justice Kagan, the highest court \nin the land had more women than ever before serving on its bench. With \nthe confirmation and appointment of Nina Pillard, the same will be true \nfor what many consider to be the second highest court in the land, the \nDC Circuit because she will be the fifth active female judge on the \ncourt. Never before have five women jurists actively served on that \ncourt at one time. I look forward to that moment and to further \nincreasing the diversity of our Federal bench.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this outstanding nominee. \nThis Nation would be better off for Nina Pillard serving as a judge on \nthe DC Circuit.\n  Today, the Senate will also vote on the nominations of Elizabeth A. \nWolford, of New York, to be U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York; Landya B. McCafferty, of New Hampshire, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the District of New Hampshire; Brian Morris, of \nMontana, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Montana; and \nSusan P. Watters, of Montana, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Montana.\n  Senate Republicans have continued to abuse the filibuster and \nrequired cloture to confirm all four of these noncontroversial district \ncourt nominees. All four of these nominees were reported unanimously by \nvoice vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee. They all have the \nsupport of their home State senators. With the filibuster of these four \ndistrict court nominees, Senate Republicans have now filibustered 24 of \nPresident Obama's district court nominees. Not a single district court \nnominee was filibustered under President Bush's 8 years in office. I \nhope Senate Republicans come around so that we can work together to \nmeet the needs of our Federal judiciary so that the American people can \nhave the justice system they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. To change the rules our friends on the left had to break \nthe rules. We are here tonight because the Obama administration and our \nfriends on the left needed a distraction by invoking the nuclear option \nleading up to the vote on Nina Pillard of the DC Circuit. They are \nattempting to quiet a disaster of their own making.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n  Please note that this is a court that will hear the ACA disputes. It \nwas easy enough for them to paint a rosy picture of life after \nObamaCare. For 3 years they did it, and they did their best to do so, \nbut words could only go so far and no speech will help the failed \nimplementation of the monster they have created.\n  Health care premiums for the average American family have already \ngone up by $2,500 since ObamaCare has become law. I wish to say that \none more time. The average premium that an American family will have to \nface and then pay is $2,500.\n  As costs continue to rise for middle-class Americans, the median \nhousehold income has dropped by more than $3,600 under President Obama. \nIf we take $2,500 and add in the drop of income of $3,600, the \ndifference for the average American household under President Obama's \nwatch is significant. That doesn't even take into consideration the \nskyrocketing costs and the increasing deductibles under ObamaCare.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the average individual \ndeductible for what is called a Bronze plan on the exchange, the \nlowest-priced coverage is a $5,000 average deductible. This is 42 \npercent higher than the average deductible today of $3,589 one would \ncurrently purchase in 2013.\n  Tell me how this helps those in need. How does this help the most \nvulnerable in our society? The answer is simple. It doesn't.\n  We are here because Democrats need a break from having this pointed \nout to them again and again as newspapers, magazines, and TV stations \nhave been doing for the last several weeks.\n  In South Carolina we have about 4.7 million people and 600,000 or \n700,000 folks do not have health insurance coverage. Think about that. \nThere are 4.7 million South Carolinians, of which about 700,000 today \ndo not have health insurance.\n  Under ObamaCare, we would hope that the number would go down, not up, \nthat it would go down from 700,000 to 600,000 or 500,000 or 400,000. \nOver 430,000 of the 700,000 people are eligible for ObamaCare. The \nnumber is not going down. The number is going up because 150,000 South \nCarolinians have received cancellation notices.\n  Let us frame that a little bit. We have 700,000 uninsured, of which \n430,000 are eligible for ObamaCare. Instead of seeing the number of \nuninsured go from 700,000 down to 600,000 or 500,000 or 400,000, we \nhave seen the number go up because 150,000 people have received \ncancellation notices--150,000 South Carolinians have received \ncancellation notices.\n  Someone would obviously ask the question: How many folks have signed \nup for ObamaCare in South Carolina?\n  If 430,000 South Carolinians are eligible to sign up, we ought to \nanswer the question of how many have signed up.\n  As of late November, only 600 South Carolinians have successfully \nsigned up for ObamaCare. This means that under the implementation \nprocess of what some consider the solution to America's woes on health \ninsurance, only 600 South Carolinians have been able to successfully \nsign up for ObamaCare, even though 430,000 are eligible and 700,00 do \nnot have insurance. Only 600 of them have been able to sign up for \nObamaCare.\n  When we think about those numbers, it reminds me of the challenges we \nface with going through the process of seeing the DC Circuit Court \nstacked to hear the disputes.\n  Part of the challenge we see is that ObamaCare hasn't worked, so \nstacking the court seems that it is the most likely option for our \nfriends on the left.\n  When we started out having these conversations about ObamaCare, we \nstarted a conversation about those who are uninsured. I think every \nAmerican in our country wants to see greater access to health \ninsurance.\n  The vast majority of Americans do not want to see the government take \nit over, and now we understand why. In 2009--not 1999, but 2009--we had \nestimated for the unaffordable care act around $900 billion. In 2011 \nthey came back and said: Wait, wait, I need to take another look at \nthis.\n  The estimate came back at $1.8 trillion. In 2009, it was $900 billion \nand in 2011 the number had already increased to $1.8 trillion or a 100-\npercent increase in the estimated cost of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Only 2 more years later we could see that the number could perhaps \neclipse $3 trillion. All we are talking about is the up-front pricetag, \nthe price of ObamaCare on the front. We haven't delved into the actual \ncost of ObamaCare because those estimates say that on the back end of \nthe Affordable Care Act we are going to see a $7 trillion increase or \naddition to our debt.\n  We started in 2009 with $900 billion; in 2011, $1.8 trillion; in \n2013, perhaps over $3 trillion, adding $7 trillion to the deficit. That \nis not the whole picture.\n  Families in South Carolina still have to struggle with finding access \nto affordable health care, and ObamaCare is not simply providing the \naccess. We see families such as the Hucks, the everyday American \nfamily. Mr. Hucks loves his family. He is in Greenville, SC. He loves \nhis family. He spends 12 to 14 hours a day working as a financial \nadviser in South Carolina.\n  Mr. Hucks, unfortunately, faces the challenge of buying health \ninsurance through ObamaCare. As he went through the process of trying \nto figure out what would happen--certainly he liked his coverage, but, \nof course, he can't keep it, period. He can't keep it. He cannot keep \nhis coverage.\n  As I was talking to Jason Hucks in Greenville 2 weeks ago, Jason \ncurrently has a Blue Cross Blue Shield high-deductible plan. Remember \nthe word ``deductible'' because we will come back and have a \nconversation about deductibles. He has a high-deductible plan that \ncovers him, his wife, and their two cute little boys.\n  Instead of having a conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Hucks about \nplanning for the college education of those two fine young men, they \nare having instead a conversation about whether they can afford the \nhealth care coverage.\n  What has happened? Let us take a look. Their current plan was a \n$10,000 deductible that cost them over $415 a month.\n  To stay on the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan under ObamaCare, Mr. Hucks \nand his family would have to pay nearly $1,000 a month--$895--almost \n$1,000 a month, more than doubling the premium. They will see their \ndeductible increase by 150 percent.\n  A deductible that was $10,000 is pretty high, significantly high. It \nwill go to $25,000 for this young family of four. That doesn't seem \nright to me; it doesn't seem fair.\n  We believe in fairness. For those who are most vulnerable, having \naccess to $25,000 before their health insurance company is able to \nstart paying is quite a high price to pay. Digging into your savings \naccount for $25,000--because ObamaCare takes their $10,000 deductible, \nand not the $15,000, not the $20,000, but the $25,000--is simply not \nfair. This is not how we treat the most vulnerable in our society, by \nseeing their deductible go up by 150 percent. I simply don't \nunderstand. It is just wrong. It is not right.\n\n  Even if they were willing to switch companies, he would still see his \nrates rise almost 75 percent and his deductible would still rise from \n$10,000 to $12,000. No wonder they are trying to stack the DC courts. \nWe see here a young family not planning for a 529 plan, not planning to \nsend their kids to Clinton University or the University of South \nCarolina, but instead they are planning on tightening their belts \nbecause they have to have a budget that plans for not a $10,000 \ndeductible but a $12,000 deductible, with a 20-percent increase in the \ndeductible and a 75-percent increase in the cost. This is the effect of \nthe Affordable Care Act. It becomes unaffordable for the average \nAmerican family.\n  As for a plan with copays, Mr. Hucks says flatly that he can't afford \nto have a conversation about copays because a plan with a copay would \nskyrocket his premiums from $415 or so to as high as $1,200 or $1,500 a \nmonth. So instead of being able to go see a doctor and have a \nconversation and pay a 20-percent copay, instead of having the \nopportunity to do what many of us have been doing for the last decade-\nplus--pay a $15 or $20 or $25 or $30 copay when you go see your \ndoctor--he has to first satisfy a deductible of not $15,000 but now a \n$25,000 deductible. This is higher than $15,000. This is wrong. It is \nnot right.\n  Mr. Hucks' family is an example of how it is not just premiums that \nare\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\nrising but deductibles are going through the roof. This is painful for \na family who should be planning for college but instead is planning to \nspend more money on their health care because the Affordable Care Act \nis so unaffordable.\n  The New York Times recently quoted someone faced with this problem as \nsaying the deductibles were so high--$4,000 to $6,000 a year--that it \nvery much defeats the purpose of having insurance. I wonder why we say \nthat. Well, think about it for a minute or two. Think about a family \nwho has a $4,000 deductible. What does that mean to the average family, \nwhere Americans are spending over 100 percent of their income? What \nthat means to the average family is they have to figure out how to pay \n$4,000 for visiting their doctors, getting their x rays, and having \neverything done at the doctor's office, getting their blood work done, \nbefore they can satisfy that $4,000 deductible and their health \ninsurance plan starts paying. Under ObamaCare, one would think that \nnumber would go down, but it doesn't. It goes up. As a matter of fact, \nit goes up quickly in the first year of ObamaCare. It goes from an \naverage out-of-pocket expense of $63.50 to over $12,000--not $4,000, \nnot $5,000, not $6,000 but over $12,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.\n  So I am looking forward to the day we have a serious conversation \nabout a free market solution that would reduce the cost of health \ninsurance and at the exact same time create greater access for the \naverage person in America to afford a free market health insurance \npolicy. That is where we need to go. That is where the conversation \nshould be. Instead of having that conversation, we are having a \nconversation about deductibles jumping $5,000, out-of-pocket expenses \ngoing up significantly. And I should have said that when you combine \nthe out-of-pocket expenses and the deductibles, the out-of-pocket total \nfor a year is the $12,000. The average deductible is a little over \n$5,000.\n  We are talking about a significant taking from the average American \nfamily--taking their money out of their pockets in the form of \ndeductibles, taking money out of their pockets in the form of copays. \nAnd God forbid they actually go outside of the network. In many of \nthese plans, we are talking about zero coverage out of network for \nambulatory care. A family would bear 100 percent of the cost. So don't \ntravel to the wrong place with the wrong plan at the wrong time. You \nwill find yourself stuck without benefits because, unfortunately, the \nACA isn't affordable for most Americans. I find that sad.\n  We think we are having a conversation about nominees here today, and \nwe think we are having a conversation about nominees because President \nObama has somehow, some way been treated differently than President \nBush and other folks. But the facts are simply inconsistent with the \nreality of the alternate universe that has been created by the left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have a confirmation vote on \nCornelia Pillard. That will be the first vote. Then we are going to \nhave--I don't believe there will be a need for a rollcall vote on the \nquorum. I think there will be enough Senators here that the Chair will \nbe able to see clearly there are 51 Senators here. Then we will have a \ncloture on Executive Calendar No. 378, Chai Rachel Feldblum of the \nDistrict of Columbia to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission. Then, Mr. President, the next vote will be tomorrow morning \nat 9 a.m. This morning, yes; I am sorry.\n  We are going to do everything we can to finish our schedule before \nChristmas, but it is going to be pushing it. We will do our best. But \nthis session doesn't end until the end of the year, so we are going to \ncontinue working until we get our work done. I am not going to yield \nback all of our time on all of our nominations. We are going to do \nthose piece by piece.\n  I hope the body has been able to understand what a waste of time this \nhas been, but we are going to confirm these nominations, and that is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Cornelia T.L. Pillard, of the District of \nColumbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).
