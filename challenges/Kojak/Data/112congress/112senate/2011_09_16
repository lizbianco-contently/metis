Mr. President, today we pay tribute to the American men and \nwomen who traveled abroad to defend this great Nation but never \nreturned home to our shores. We also honor those who have suffered as \nprisoners of war. We are grateful to them every day. Today, which is \nNational POW/MIA Recognition Day, we dedicate our remembrance to their \nsacrifice.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n  I had the good fortune to be appointed in 1992 by Majority Leader \nMitchell to be a member of the Select Committee on MIA/POW. The \ncommittee was chaired by John Kerry, and it was a wonderful experience \nfor a number of reasons, not the least of which was to watch Senator \nKerry because I really, frankly, didn't know him very well. I had been \nin the Senate for a few years, but when you work here, sometimes you \ndon't really understand how good people are until you work with them on \na really close-knit basis, as I did with him because of that \nappointment.\n  He did a magnificent job of chairing that committee. Of course, he \nhad some standing to look at what went on in Vietnam since he was \nwounded three times and had a number of Silver Stars for his heroism in \nVietnam. But legislatively that was a great experience for that year, \nto look to see what had happened in Southeast Asia all over, not only \nVietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, but people who had been taken prisoner of \nwar and certainly, if not, were missing in action. It was a good \nexperience for me, and I will always remember that. So this day, \nNational POW/MIA Recognition Day, recalls those memories of many years \nago of the hearings we held and the evidence we gathered to make a \ndecision as to what really took place there.\n  More than 83,000 Americans are missing from World War II, Korea, the \nCold War, Vietnam, and, of course, the gulf war. There are also \nsoldiers, sailors, and marines reported missing from our wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq that are going on right now. We should not and we \nwill not rest until we have accounted for every missing American \nserviceperson who has fought to protect the freedoms we enjoy as \nAmericans. Although they are missing, they are not forgotten.\n  It is difficult to comprehend the suffering of families who have lost \nloved ones. I am hopeful and somewhat confident that it is a comfort to \nthem today to know we give thanks and praise for their dedication to \nthe ideals upon which this Nation was founded. That is why today we \ncommemorate the sacrifices made by those families as well as the \nsoldiers they loved.\n  I also give thanks for the brave men and women who wear the uniforms \nof the U.S. armed services today, including more than 2,000 Nevadans \ncurrently deployed around the world--not in the service but Nevadans \ndeployed around the world. Anything worth having, of course, is worth \ndefending, and our freedom is one of the most precious.\n  So today we thank those volunteers who have placed themselves in \nharm's way to protect this great country. Many of them have paid the \nultimate price for our liberty. So today and every day they have the \nthanks of a grateful Nation, but especially today, for their faithful \nand selfless service to their country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor about the \nneed to restore revenue as part of our deficit reduction efforts. I \nexplained that I have sent a letter to the members of the Joint Select \nCommittee, now crafting a deficit reduction plan, with seven ideas on \nhow to address our revenue shortfall in ways that reduce the deficit, \nprotect economic growth, and ensure that the sacrifices which are \nnecessary to achieve our budget goals are shared broadly among the \nAmerican people. Together, these proposals would reduce deficits on the \norder of $1 trillion over 10 years.\n  Today I want to go into greater detail on two of those ideas to \naddress loopholes and tax breaks that are as damaging to our budget as \nthey are unfair to working families. One proposal would stop \ncorporations and individuals from using offshore tax gimmicks to dodge \nthe taxes they owe. The other proposal would close a loophole that \ngives corporations a huge tax break when they award stock options to \ntheir executives, effectively using the hard-earned tax dollars of \nAmerican families to subsidize the paychecks of CEOs and other top \nexecutives.\n  Let's begin with the goal here, deficit reduction. Budget experts \ntell us we cannot close our budget gap with spending cuts alone. \nRevenue must play a role. These two proposals can help. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has estimated that the \nuse of offshore tax havens by wealthy U.S. taxpayers costs our Treasury \naround $100 billion a year. I believe the legislation to address that \nissue can recover a significant portion of that loss. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimated that a previous version of the \nlegislation would recover nearly $30 billion over 10 years, but new \nprovisions that we have included should raise that figure \nsignificantly. Closing the stock option loophole would save $25 billion \nover 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. This \nrevenue would help the Joint Committee in its difficult task of \nachieving at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction and it would help \nrestore fairness to the Tax Code without penalizing activities that \ncontribute to economic growth or raising taxes on middle-income \nAmericans.\n  Our work on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has, for \nmore than a decade, exposed the ugly truths of tax haven abuse. A \nsingle building in the Cayman Islands called the Ugland House serves as \nthe mail drop for nearly 19,000 companies incorporated there for tax-\ndodging purposes. Of the 100 largest publicly traded corporations in \nAmerica, 83 have subsidiaries in tax havens. Hedge funds, whose \nemployees live right here in the United States, pretend to be based in \ntax havens to dodge U.S. taxes. An army of lawyers, bankers, and \naccountants helps U.S. taxpayers use offshore abuses to avoid taxes. \nAll of this shifts the tax burden of these tax dodgers onto the backs \nof honest taxpayers.\n  Yesterday, the Internal Revenue Service announced that they have \nrecently completed an offshore program where they give a degree of \namnesty to people who are willing to come in and pay their taxes. \nThirty thousand such people have come in since 2009, and that is the \ntip of the iceberg, as our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \ndisclosed.\n  How do we combat this? Several colleagues and I have introduced \nlegislation called the ``Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act,'' S. 1346. Our bill \nwill authorize the Treasury Secretary to take special measures against \nforeign jurisdictions or foreign financial institutions that impede \nU.S. tax enforcement by prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from \ndoing business with those foreign financial institutions in \nuncooperative jurisdictions. It will help the IRS identify ownership \nand control of offshore entities. It would stop corporations whose \nmanagement and control are located primarily in the United States from \nclaiming foreign status to dodge taxes. It would prevent businesses \nfrom dodging taxes by claiming that assets physically held in the \nUnited States should be treated as offshore assets for tax purposes. \nAnd it would treat derivatives payments sent from the United States to \noffshore entities as taxable income. Enacting this legislation and \nending these offshore abuses would penalize tax dodging, not legitimate \neconomic activity, and it will help to bring down the deficit.\n  Similarly, closing the stock option loophole would not penalize \nproductive economic activity. It would, instead, end an unaffordable \nFederal subsidy for corporate executive pay. Today, under tax rules for \nreporting stock options, corporations report stock option expenses on \ntheir books when those stock options are granted, but they use another \nmethod to claim a different--and\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nusually a much higher--expense on their tax returns when the stock \noptions are exercised. The result is that corporations can usually \nclaim far larger tax deductions for stock options pay on their tax \nreturns than the actual expense they show on their books for those same \noptions. They get a much bigger tax deduction for exactly the same tax \noption expense as they show on their books. Stock options are the only \ntype of compensation for which the Tax Code allows a corporation to \ndeduct as an expense for tax purposes more than what they show on their \nbooks for that same expense. IRS data shows that from 2005 to 2009, \nthis loophole allowed companies to claim between $11 billion and $52 \nbillion each year in excess tax deductions.\n  Legislation I have introduced with Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator \nMcCaskill would end these excess deductions by requiring corporate \nstock option tax deductions to equal the stock option expense shown on \nthe corporate books for those same options. It would not affect the \ntaxes paid by individuals who receive the stock options--their taxes \nwould not be affected, as now they pay for the actual sales price minus \ntheir cost. It would not affect so-called incentive stock options, \noften used by startup companies. It would make stock option pay subject \nto the same $1 million cap on corporate tax deductions that applies to \nother forms of executive pay. These proposals alone will put a major \ndent in the deficit. They would ensure that multinational corporations \nand wealthy individuals pay the taxes they owe, just like working \nAmericans. If we are to seriously reduce the deficit, these kinds of \ntax reforms and the resulting added tax revenues must be part of the \ndiscussion. I urge my colleagues, especially those on the Joint Select \nCommittee, to embrace these ideas.\n  Again, I sent a letter yesterday to the members of the joint \ncommittee, all the members, laying out these seven ideas which together \nwill raise over $1 trillion in 10 years.\n  I am going to return to the floor in the days ahead to discuss \nadditional reforms, with the resulting revenues, that were set out in \nmy letter to the Joint Select Committee. These changes, these reforms, \nthis loophole closing, will help to close the gap between spending and \nrevenues that all of us I know want to close.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to take just a little time this \nmorning to make some remarks with respect to the issue of tax reform \nand particularly try to lay out why the naysayers, those who say tax \nreform is not going to make any difference anytime soon or there has \nnot been a lot of groundwork laid--those are the two major arguments \nthey are making--I am going to try to lay out why those arguments are \nwrong.\n  To start with, they reflect a misunderstanding about markets, about \nfree enterprise and about what drives the American economy. One of the \nmajor reasons consumers are not spending and businesses are not hiring \nworkers is uncertainty about taxes. Enacting fundamental tax reform \nthat encourages the use of free enterprise and markets would start \nchanging consumers' behavior very quickly and business would be in a \nposition in West Virginia and Oregon and everywhere else to start \nmaking judgments with respect to investment.\n  They cannot make judgments right now when we have these piecemeal tax \nchanges that might last 1 year or even less. That is not the way the \nAmerican economy works. Businesses in West Virginia and Oregon are \nthinking about investments that can last 5, 10 years and even longer \nand they need some certainty. I am going to spend some time talking \nabout permanent tax reform, enacted early next year, and making a start \nat it with our supercommittee. We have the good fortune of having \nChairman Baucus on it. I serve on the Finance Committee with him. \nChairman Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways, and Means Committee is \nalso on it. What I feel very strongly about--as does the cosponsor of \nthe tax reform legislation I have offered, Senator Coats--is they can \nmake a good start on tax reform in the supercommittee and I am going to \noutline how that could take place and then Congress could finish it up \nearly next year.\n  Let's start by talking about how we might see people's behavior start \nchanging and getting consumers back into the marketplace and businesses \nstart making investment decisions. My own view is, if working families \nknew at the end of the year or early next year they would get real tax \nrelief as we get underway with the tax legislation I have been part of \nwith Senator Coats and Senator Begich and former Senator Gregg and if \nmiddle-class folks knew reduced tax rates were going to be in place not \njust for 1 year but for the long term, they would start making the \nkinds of decisions they are putting off now because they are uncertain \ntoday and they are going to be uncertain next year and the year after \nif we continue to make these changes in tax law by piecemeal.\n  My view is, if we saw permanent tax reform enacted early next year, \nwe would see consumers making the kind of purchases they have been \npostponing in major appliances, new cars, and the other investments \nthey make when they know the economy is going to start picking up \nbecause millions of others are going to go back into the marketplace, \njust like themselves. When businesses see additional demand for their \nproducts, they will go out and start hiring more workers.\n  Let's talk for just a minute about how fundamental tax reform puts \nmore money into the pockets of the middle class. Under the legislation \nI have been a part of, with two Republicans and Senator Begich, a \ntypical couple making $90,000 would pay close to $5,000 less in taxes, \naccording to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The reason that is the case is our bipartisan tax reform triples the \nstandard deduction for that middle-class couple. It triples the \nstandard deduction. Let me emphasize it is permanent. I wish to say \nthat again--permanent. It is not something that is going to be jerked \naway in 1 year. It is something that would be locked into the Tax Code \non a permanent basis. Economists and others have repeatedly said, when \nwe make those kinds of changes and typical families know on a permanent \nbasis they will have more money in their pockets, they will go out and \nmake the major purchases they have put off in West Virginia and Oregon \nover the last few years.\n  I have talked to folks at coffee shops and know the Presiding Officer \nspends a lot of time getting out and talking with folks in his state. \nWhen I go into coffee shops and I ask people, in particular, about why \nthey are putting off major purchases--they talk about appliances and \ncars--they say: I don't know what is going to happen. I heard there was \nthis tax break I was going to get for 1 year, and I don't know what is \ngoing to happen after that.\n  We need to make permanent changes in the tax law, give permanent tax \nrelief to middle-class people, and then, based on everything we know \nabout economics, people start changing their behavior. They are not \ngoing to do it in a big way without permanent and predictable changes, \nchanges they can count on that will not be jerked away from them in \nanother year or so.\n  The same principle goes for business. Once they know there is going \nto be a new tax system in place with reforms. By the way, virtually all \nthe reform plans take the corporate rate today, which is now the second \nhighest in the world, down to somewhere in the mid-twenties as a \npercentage. Senator Coats and I, with Senator Begich, are at 24 \npercent. The Bowles-Simpson proposal is a little bit higher, but \neverybody is pretty much in the same place. If we do that on a \npermanent basis, businesses will be able to start planning, and they \nwill start planning immediately for the beneficial effects of consumers \ngoing back into the marketplace because of permanent changes in the \nindividual Tax Code and because\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nthey know that the tax rates are going to be lower. Once a reform tax \nsystem is signed into law, we have more certainty and we would begin to \nsee the spending, hiring, and investment decisions that are not being \nmade today in the American marketplace by the consumer and by business.\n\n  It would also be possible to further jump-start the process and \ngenerate economic growth even more quickly. For example, as part of \npermanent tax reform we could allow the consumer an advanced refund of \nthe reduced taxes they will be getting under tax reform. The Congress \ndid that a few years back. It helped a bit in terms of consumer demand \nbut, again, it was short term. Since it was not combined with permanent \nreform of the Tax Code to provide future certainty, it didn't stimulate \nas much demand either in the short term or the long term as it might \nhave if it were coupled with permanent reform. But it did help.\n  The bottom line is that enacting fundamental tax reform now would \nprovide immediate benefits to the economy by ending the uncertainty \nthat I happen to believe is strangling our prospects for real, \nsignificant, long-term economic growth. We all understand the American \ntax system is an anti-growth mess. It is riddled with loopholes and tax \ndodges. I sit on the Senate Finance Committee, and for a big part of \nthe tax system today the language is pretty much incomprehensible \ngibberish. So we do need to make these changes.\n  Now I wish to get into this issue of whether it is not going to be \npossible to do tax reform now because the groundwork hasn't been laid. \nI am sure the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has heard this \nargument: Gosh, we could do it in 2013; we ought to spend more time \nstudying it--and all of that. I will tell my colleagues that the \nuncertainty of putting it off again going to continue to harm the \neconomy--in fact, I predicted after the lameduck session of the \nCongress in 2010 that unless we get people moving in a bipartisan way \non tax reform, we would have the same debate in the lameduck session of \nthe 2012 Congress--exactly the same debate--about whether we are going \nto extend the Bush tax cuts on a temporary basis.\n  So if we aren't successful in pushing permanent tax reform onto the \nagenda, that is what will happen. We will have the same debate in the \nlameduck session in the 2012 Congress that we had during the lameduck \nsession in the 2010 Congress, which will be about, once again, trying \nto patch up this dysfunctional anti-growth tax system we have in our \ncountry.\n  So I wish to spend a few minutes addressing the claim that it is not \npossible to do tax reform now because the groundwork hasn't been done. \nThat is awfully puzzling to me, given all of the tax reform proposals \nthat are out there now and how similar they are. For example, when \nErskine Bowles and Alan Simpson came to the Senate Budget Committee, \nthey said point-blank that they modeled their tax reform \nrecommendations after the bill that Senator Gregg and I had spent week \nafter week for 2 years working on. That was, of course, flattering. We \nwere happy about that. But the fact is, going all the way back to some \nof the studies done by the Commission appointed by President George W. \nBush and then highlighted by the work done for President Obama, the \nVolcker Commission, there has been an awful lot of common ground.\n  For example, the tax rates under all of these major proposals \ninvolve, on the individual side of the Tax Code, taking the country \nfrom six major brackets to three major brackets. The Bowles-Simpson \nproposal comes in around 12 percent for the lowest rate, 22 percent for \nthe rate in the middle, and 29 percent for the rate at the top.\n  The proposal I have been part of with former Senator Gregg and \nSenator Coats and our colleague and friend, Mark Begich, we are a bit \nhigher than that. That is because under our proposal we didn't make \nchanges with respect to the mortgage interest deduction and the \ncharitable deduction or the changes with respect to middle-class folks \nwho depend on their employer for their health care and their \nretirement. So the point is, we have something we can have a real \ndebate on right now.\n  Let me highlight one other point. We touched on it yesterday when our \ngroup of more than 30 senators got together. The Wyden-Coats-Begich \nproposal has been scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \ncommittee that specifically looks at the impacts of changes in tax law. \nSo if the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate, wants to come in and make a modification in tax \nlaw--for example, adjust the rates, say, in these three brackets one \nway or another, because we have the numbers now from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, and it is the only proposal--our bill, the only \nproposal--they have scored, we can give to the Senator from West \nVirginia and any other Member of the Senate--the other 98 Senators not \nhere--we can give them the actual numbers that have been furnished by \nthe official scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, so we can be \nin a position to have a real debate.\n  There has been an enormous amount of groundwork done on this issue. I \nhave already mentioned the similarity and reforms on the individual \nrates. The corporate rate reform proposals are similar. Repealing the \nalternative minimum tax is in our bill. It is in all of the bills. We \nunderstand what a crushing burden this alternative minimum tax is.\n  We have middle-class folks all over America, and the Presiding \nOfficer probably has somebody who, say, is on the police force in a \ntown in West Virginia, and perhaps that police officer's spouse is a \nteacher, and they can be filling out their taxes twice with this \nbureaucratic nightmare called the alternative minimum tax. It wasn't \nintended for those kinds of people. It was intended for wealthier \npeople who had managed to get out of paying taxes altogether.\n  So we are in a position to move forward. What I and others have said \nis that if we started in the supercommittee by laying a baseline, a \nfoundation--they already have an opportunity for simplicity by moving \nfrom those six brackets to three; they already have an opportunity on \nthe corporate rate where essentially all of the reforms are in the \nvicinity of going from 35 percent to the mid-twenties, all of the \nreforms talking about abolishing the alternative minimum taxes, all of \nthe reforms talking about getting taxpayers, individuals, and \nbusinesses off the roller coaster of constant tax changes--the \nsupercommittee could make a very significant start on major tax reform \nby the end of the year, and then early next year we could have a \nguaranteed legislative process.\n  Let me use those words specifically. We could have a guaranteed \nlegislative process where the Finance Committee, under the leadership \nof Chairman Baucus, and the Ways and Means Committee, under the \nleadership of Chairman Camp, could enact permanent tax reform by early \nnext year.\n  I have already talked about how markets work. I think if this holiday \nseason the American consumer can have a sense that we are going to make \na break with tax policy as we know it today--we are going to stop all \nof these piecemeal, temporary changes, and we are going to make \npermanent changes that are going to be built around reform principles \nwhich are widely accepted--ever since the 1980s when Democrats and \nRonald Reagan worked together on tax reform, the fundamentals of tax \nreform have been very clear. They are all about eliminating \npreferences--all of these special interest tax breaks and dodges and \nloopholes and preferences, eliminating them--and using those dollars to \nhold down the marginal rate, the rate we pay on the last dollar we earn \nwhile keeping progressivity, while keeping a sense of fairness.\n  Those principles are very clear. All the reform proposals are based \non them. It sure seems to me if middle-class people can have the \ncertainty of knowing that tax policy is going to change so they can \nstart making decisions about their economic future and have a real \nsense that it isn't going to just change in a year, that it isn't just \ntemporary, I think we will start seeing beneficial changes in the \nAmerican marketplace very quickly. That, of course, is what tax reform \nis all about. It is about getting consumers back into the marketplace \nand about businesses growing again because they know they are going to \nhave more consumers and\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nthey know they are going to be in a better position to compete in tough \nglobal markets. That means jobs.\n  I wish to wrap up by talking about tax reform and jobs--and, \nremember, we have not had fundamental tax reform for a quarter century. \nFor a quarter century, this country has been making almost one tax \nchange a day--almost one tax change a day--thousands and thousands of \ntax changes cumulatively. Talk about what that means for uncertainty \nfor a business and a consumer. We can make a break with that and do \nwhat was done in 1986, which translated into a big boost for our \neconomy.\n  I wish to give the numbers specifically so folks will see what this \ntax reform issue is all about. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, in the 2 years after the 1986 tax reform bill our country \ncreated 6.3 million new jobs. I said 6.3 million new jobs. That sounds \npretty good. I think that would go over pretty well at a coffee shop in \nWest Virginia, and it certainly does in Oregon.\n  I am not going to come to the floor and say every one of those jobs \nis due to tax reform. There are a host of issues that go into judgments \nwith respect to why consumers buy those appliances and those basic \nnecessities and why businesses invest and hire. But I will tell my \ncolleagues one thing: We couldn't have generated 6.3 million new jobs \nin the 2 years after the 1986 tax reform bill if we had seen a tax \nreform proposal enacted that didn't make sense for the American \neconomy. It wouldn't have happened.\n  Clearly, consumers and businesses believed this was a proposal moved \nby a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, and a host of very \nprogressive Democrats--folks such as Congressman Dick Gephardt who \nlater ran for President with strong backing of American labor. They \ncame together and created 6.3 million new jobs in 2 years with the \nkinds of reforms that Senator Coats and former Senator Gregg and \nSenator Begich and I advocate now, that are in line with the \nfundamental thinking of the Bowles-Simpson proposal, the reforms \nproposal by former President George Bush, and President Obama's own \ncommission directed by Paul Volcker.\n  We have a chance now to make fundamental changes--fundamental \nchanges--that will change the direction of our economy and the \npsychology of the American marketplace. In this debate, we can talk, \nfor example, about the issues that are front and center with American \nworkers. I am certain that in those coffee shops in West Virginia, one \nof the things that is said again and again is: Senator, make sure you \nkeep the jobs here. Keep them at home. We are tired of all those jobs \ngoing offshore.\n  Senator Coats and I have a proposal that takes away the tax breaks \nfor shipping jobs overseas and uses those dollars to create jobs here \nat home--red, white, and blue jobs, jobs that pay good wages here in \nthe United States because we change tax policy and make it more \nattractive to do business in the United States.\n  We can talk about the various ways to do it. There is discussion \nabout a territorial system, there is discussion about a worldwide \ntaxation system for the multinational corporations. The bottom line--\nagain, reflected in all of the reform proposals--is that competitive \nrates, which means lowering rates for small business and businesses of \nall sizes doing business in the United States, will help us create more \njobs, and they will be red, white, and blue jobs. They will be jobs \nhere in the United States.\n  So I assume this weekend--whether it is in coffee shops or on talk \nshows or wherever--people are going to be talking about this discussion \nabout taxes, and they will say: Oh, I don't know if those folks in \nWashington are going to get anything done. And if they do anything, it \nwill probably be a temporary thing, and they will all talk about why, \nif you had real tax reform, it might not do anything soon. And, well, \nit will take a lot more study, and that sort of thing.\n  I have been convincing this morning about why I believe permanent tax \nreform--permanent tax reform--will start changing the behavior of \nconsumers in the marketplace, get them back into the marketplace, \nbuying those products that fuel a consumer-driven economy. They will \nstart doing it quickly if they see permanent tax reform enacted. I hope \nI have been able to clearly outline why a great deal of groundwork has \nbeen done already to allow us to move forward--not do the entire tax \nreform effort in the 6 or 8 weeks that the supercommittee has, but to \nget a foundation, a baseline in place, a baseline that is built around \nthese areas of consensus, changes that are advocated, essentially, by \nall the reform proposals, and then allow the Senate Finance Committee, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Baucus, and the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, under the leadership of Chairman Dave Camp, to use the first \nfew months of next year with their committees--the committees of \njurisdiction; the Finance Committee here in the Senate, and the Ways \nand Means Committee in the other body--that they take the first 90 or \n120 days to enact permanent tax reforms.\n  I think that will be a huge boost for the American economy. I think \nit will change the behavior of American consumers and American business \nbecause that is what markets do. They react when positive and permanent \nchanges are put in place.\n  This can be thoroughly bipartisan. It was in 1986 when a whole host \nof quite progressive Democrats got together with Ronald Reagan. I have \nhad the pleasure, over the last few years, to work with two outstanding \nMembers on the other side of the aisle, former Senator Gregg and \nSenator Coats, and Senator Begich of Alaska, a former small \nbusinessperson.\n  This is not like health care; we have done it before. The reform \nproposals are very much built around the same sort of principles which \nwere the fundamentals of tax reform in 1986. While I know there is \ngoing to be considerable debate this weekend about whether tax reform \ncan be done, whether it is going to change anybody's behavior or change \nanybody's behavior soon, I wanted to weigh in and outline why looking \nat the principles of the market, I believe, is going to change consumer \nbehavior, change consumer and business behavior for the better, and \nthat there has been a lot of groundwork laid that we can build on.\n  There is an opportunity, an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans \nin this Chamber to come together and take steps, steps that will end \nthis anti-growth mess of a tax system, and give our consumers and \nbusinesses the certainty and predictability they need to grow, to come \nback into the American economy.\n  We will talk some more about this on the floor of this great body in \nthe days ahead. I just want the American people to know this is an \nopportunity where, if there is a will to do permanent tax reform, there \nis a way to get it done.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first of all, I want everyone within the \nsound of my voice to understand that I do not like the Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement, the Korea Free Trade Agreement, or the Panama Free \nTrade Agreement. I will vote against them. But I have been asked on \nnumerous occasions to move these trade matters to the floor.\n  That is what I have agreed to do, and I am going to do that. But it \nis very difficult for me to understand, when my Republican colleagues, \nthe Chamber of Commerce, and others support these trade agreements, and \nthey want them done, and now when I want to move to them, I cannot do \nit. It is hard to comprehend that we have to file cloture on a motion \nto proceed to an agreement we have. The agreement we have is that we \nare going to do trade adjustment assistance, and a few other stops in \nthe middle, and then we are going to do the free trade agreements. \nAgain, this is the pattern we have experienced for the last 8 months. \nIt doesn't matter what it is.\n  This is something they agreed with. We are attempting to move to the \nfree trade agreements and they are stopping us from doing that.\n  I hope the American people get the picture, and I am confident they \nare getting the picture more clearly every day. There isn't a thing we \ncan bring up here that they don't stall to the very limit of the \nprocedures here. Again, we are going to move to the free trade \nagreements. The first part of the deal is trade adjustment assistance. \nWe have to invoke cloture to do this. I think that is a travesty and it \nis too bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/16/senate-section/article/S5704-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5704-S5705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         BUDGETARY ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last week, pursuant to section 106 of the \nBudget Control Act of 2011, I filed new committee allocations, new \nbudgetary and Social Security aggregates, and a revised pay-as-you-go \nscorecard. Today, I am adjusting some of those levels, specifically the \nallocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2012 and \nthe budgetary aggregates for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.\n  First, as specified under section 106(b)(1), I filed new allocations \nto the Committee on Appropriations. For 2012, that allocation was set \nconsistent with the sum of the two limits on discretionary spending set \nforth in the Budget Control Act. Section 101 of the Budget Control Act \nestablishes a limit of $684 billion in new budget authority for the \nsecurity category and $359 billion in new budget authority for the \nnonsecurity category, for a total of $1,043 billion. To match the \ndivisions provided by the Budget Control Act, I am subdividing the \ninitial allocation of $1,043 billion in budget authority provided to \nthe Committee on Appropriations into two separate amounts, $684 billion \nfor security funding and $359 billion for nonsecurity funding.\n  Second, section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various \nadjustments to the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while \nsection 106(d) allows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make \nrevisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those \nadjustments. The Committee on Appropriations reported three bills last \nweek that are eligible for adjustments under the Budget Control Act. In \ntotal, I am making adjustments to the 2012 allocation to the Committee \non Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates of $5.769 billion in \nbudget authority and $1.157 billion in outlays. Those adjustments \nreflect the sum of $5.511 billion in budget authority and $0.958 \nbillion in outlays for funding designated for disaster relief, $0 in \nbudget authority and -$0.007 billion in outlays for funding designated \nas an emergency, and $0.258 billion in budget authority and $0.206 \nbillion in outlays for funding designated as being for overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  Finally, I am making technical adjustments to the 2011 and 2012 \nbudgetary aggregates. These adjustments are being made to remove \namounts that the Senate allocates to the Appropriations Committee each \nyear but does not count as part of the spending aggregates. A similar \nadjustment will be made at the time the Congress clears the relevant \nappropriations bills, such that the adjustments do not change the total \namount of room that is available to the Senate under the aggregates in \neither year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  BUDGETARY AGGREGATES.--PURSUANT TO SECTION 106(b)(1)(C) OF
