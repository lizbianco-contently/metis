Madam President, later this morning Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu will address a joint meeting of Congress.\n  His remarks come at a time of great unrest and instability in the \nMiddle East. So we are all eager to hear his\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nperspective on how our two countries can work together to further our \nshared interests. Israel is, of course, a great friend and an ally to \nthe United States, and the Prime Minister should be reassured that \nIsrael will not be alone during this time of uncertainty. He should \nreturn home knowing that at a time when the Middle East is awash in \ninstability, his relationship with the Congress is strong. We always \nwelcome the Prime Minister to Washington. We are happy to be able to \nhost him today.\n\n\n                            lack of a budget\n\n  Sometime before the end of this week, Democrats in the Senate will \nhave wrapped up their efforts for the current work period and flown \nhome for the Memorial Day recess. So it is not too early to ask what \nthey have accomplished over the past several weeks. More specifically, \nwhat have they done about a looming fiscal crisis in the 6 weeks since \none of the cochairs of the President's debt commission called it the \nmost predictable crisis in history?\n  Well, the short answer is not much. Six weeks after the Democratic \ncochairman of the President's own debt commission told us that our \nNation's deficits and debt are like a cancer that threatens to destroy \nAmerica from within, and nearly a year after the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff declared our debt to be the single biggest threat to \nour national security, Democrats are ready to call it a work period--\nafter producing no budget, after offering no plan, and with no plan in \nsight.\n  Why?\n  Well, evidently Democrats have decided that avoiding this crisis \nhelps them in the next election. That is why they plan to vote against \nevery budget plan that comes to the floor this week, including the \nPresident's.\n  Democrats are apparently operating under the assumption that if they \nare on the record opposing everything, it helps them politically. So, \nin other words, we might not leave here this week with a solution to \nour nation's looming debt crisis, but Democrats are pretty confident \nthey will leave with some good material for campaign ads.\n  Here is how the senior Senator from New York put it yesterday in a \nmoment of candor:\n  ``To put other budgets out there is not the point,'' he said, ``This \nissue will have staying power and be a defining issue for 2012.''\n  They are not even pretending to put principle over politics here. \nAccording to Senator Schumer, their focus is on an election that is \nstill almost 2 years away.\n  Well, my suggestion is that Democrats start thinking about putting \ntheir names on something other than an attack ad. They could start with \na budget. How about that?\n  Right now, America is on pace to spend about $1.6 trillion more than \nit takes in this year. That is three times the biggest deficit we ever \nhad before President Obama took office.\n  The President's plan is to keep deficits like this in place for years \nto come.\n  That is the scenario Admiral Mullen and Erskine Bowles are worried \nabout.\n  Meanwhile, entitlement spending is growing faster than inflation, \nmeaning sooner or later these programs will either consume all the \nmoney we have or these programs are forced to change.\n  Members of the President's own Cabinet admitted this last week when \nthey signed a report showing that Medicare is running out of money and \nurging prompt reform of the program.\n  So the question is not whether these programs need reform, the \nquestion is how it is done.\n  Do we do it now, together, or do we wait until we are absolutely \nforced to do it? There is no other choice.\n  Congressman Ryan has shown a lot of courage by proposing a budget \nthat would tackle a big part of the problem. Democrats are showing none \nby ignoring our problems altogether. This is the contrast Americans \nwill see in the Senate this week.\n  Republicans will vote on several possible approaches to our fiscal \ncrisis this week, including the Ryan plan.\n  Democrats will vote against every one.\n  We will also have a vote on the President's budget, which Democrats \nalso plan to oppose.\n  They say they prefer the ideas the President outlined in a speech he \ngave last month. Well, unfortunately, we can't vote on a speech. But if \nthat is what it takes to get Democrats engaged in this debate, maybe we \nshould revisit the rules.\n  More than 2 years have passed since Democrats have produced a budget \nof their own. This is a complete and total abdication of their \nresponsibilities as a majority party. And there is no excuse for it.\n  Every year, Congress appropriates nearly $100 million to support the \nOffice of Management and Budget. This money supports a staff of 529 \npeople. OMB's job is to put together a budget. Why exactly haven't they \nbeen able to turn the President's speech into a budget we can vote on? \nThey have had 6 weeks to do it. What is the problem?\n  If Democrats can't get 529 people to put some numbers together based \non the budget plan the President outlined in his speech, then they have \nproblems over there. Either that or Democrats are just looking for \nexcuses so they don't have to vote for anything of their own. And they \nhad rather put together political ads than a solution to this crisis. \nAnd this is inexcusable.\n  We have an obligation to our country to come up with a plan. \nDemocrats are officially abdicating that responsibility this week. But \nAmericans will remember. As the crisis approached, Democrats did \nnothing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 10 years after the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, every one of us in the Senate knows America \ncontinues to face threats of terrorism. Our allies know this, as well. \nThe President's dogged pursuit and success earlier this month against \nOsama bin Laden does not mean we can become complacent or less \nvigilant. We must remain vigilant and ensure the men and women of our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies have all the appropriate \ntools necessary to protect our Nation and the American people. But as \nevery Vermonter knows, tools are only useful if they are regularly \nchecked and maintained. Otherwise they become blunt instruments that \ncan do harm, rather than accomplish the job.\n  Congress recognized this basic notion in 2001, when we first wrote \nthe USA PATRIOT Act. I worked with the then-Republican House majority \nleader, Dick Armey to include sunsets on certain surveillance \nauthorities in the bill. Even though we had vastly different political \nphilosophies, we both agreed we had to have sunset provisions. In 2006, \nwhen Congress reauthorized the USA PATRIOT Act, I worked to ensure that \ncertain sunsets were renewed, and added audits on the use of powers \nwith the potential to unnecessarily intrude on the privacy of \nAmericans. We should not give a blank check to anybody--whether it is a \nRepublican or Democratic administration. We are, after all, Americans \nwho believe in our individual liberties.\n  Having granted the Government broad authority to gather vast amounts \nof information about the daily lives of Americans, I wanted to do what \nwe could to ensure that unfettered information gathering did not occur \nat the expense of Americans' basic constitutional rights and civil \nliberties. The sunsets and audits provide Congress an opportunity to \nexamine whether the PATRIOT Act tools are being used appropriately, and \nif not, to sharpen, refine, or restrain those tools accordingly.\n  The audits we added in 2005 or 2006 proved to be very helpful because \nthey identified that there were abuses in the way the PATRIOT Act was \nbeing used, specifically with respect to national security letters and \nthe use of ``exigent letters.'' Without this oversight, we probably \nnever would have found out about those abuses. But we found out about \nthem and we worked with the FBI to correct those matters.\n  That brings us to today. The Senate has the opportunity to reexamine \nand redefine key PATRIOT Act provisions, and I think we should take \nthat opportunity to make improvements to our\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\ncurrent law. That is why I have led the Senate Judiciary Committee to \ndiligently consider these matters through a series of hearings and \nmeetings. The committee responded by reporting improvements, both last \nyear and again this year, through bipartisan legislation. They are good \nmeasures, and we have worked to ensure that they would not compromise \nthe effectiveness of our law enforcement and intelligence capabilities. \nIn fact, much of the language was derived after consultation with the \nadministration, including the intelligence community.\n  The Attorney General and others have repeatedly assured us that the \nmeasures to enhance oversight and accountability--such as audits and \npublic reporting--would not sacrifice ``the operational effectiveness \nand flexibility needed to protect our citizens from terrorism'' or \nundermine ``the collection of vital foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information.''\n  In fact, the Attorney General has consistently said the bill passed \nout by the Senate Judiciary Committee struck ``a good balance'' by \nextending the PATRIOT Act authorities while adding accountability and \ncivil liberties protections. For additional detail and legislative \nhistory, I refer Senators to the Senate report on the bill reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee this year, Senate Report No. 112-13.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a December 9, 2010, letter from the \nAttorney General to me making these points be printed in the Record, \nalong with a February 19, 2010, letter from the Director of National \nIntelligence to House leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Unfortunately, the bill now before the Senate merely \nextends the expiring authorities to June 1, 2015. Regrettably, these \nauthorities have not been refined since 2006. If that remains the case \nthrough the extensions that are contemplated by this bill, it will \namount to 9 years of this law without any legislative improvement. I \nthink most of us understand that we can do better. The amendment I have \nfiled seeks to change that by improving the PATRIOT Act.\n  I appreciate the efforts made by the majority leader to craft a \ncompromise. I am sorry that the Republican leadership in Congress has \ninsisted on an extension of authorities without any improvements. The \namendment I have filed and wish to offer along with Senators Paul, \nCardin, Bingaman, Coons, Shaheen, Wyden, Franken, Gillibrand, Harkin, \nDurbin, Merkley, Boxer, and Akaka, makes significant improvements to \ncurrent law, promotes transparency, and expands privacy and civil \nliberties safeguards.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a sectional analysis of the amendment \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. One of the improvements Congress should make is to repair \na constitutional infirmity in the current law. Three years ago, in Doe \nv. Mukasey, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that \nthe nondisclosure provision of the statute authorizing issuance of \nnational security letters was constitutionally defective. If we do not \nmake a change, that constitutionally defective part of the national \nsecurity letter provision would remain. As part of the comprehensive \nset of reforms in the bill reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee, I proposed a simple statutory fix that would enable the FBI \nto obtain the information it needs, while addressing the constitutional \nconcerns. In fact, this proposal has never been controversial. In fact, \nduring the last Congress, Senator Sessions and Senator Bond, the \nranking Republicans on the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees, cosponsored a bill incorporating the very legislative \nremedy I proposed.\n  This is a straightforward matter that needs to be fixed. The \nunderlying bill does not fix the problem; our amendment would. I trust \nSenators would not want to proceed to vote on an unconstitutional law, \none that violates our fundamental charter as a nation and, of course, \nthe liberty of all Americans. No one who claims to honor the \nConstitution should proceed in so cavalier a manner. If we are to \nrestore the constitutional underpinning of the NSL authority, the \nSenate should adopt this needed improvement.\n  I am also troubled by the refusal of the Republican leadership to \nagree on periodic audits on the use by the government of PATRIOT Act \nsurveillance authorities. When I speak of the Republican position, I \nwant to mention that this is not uniform within the Republican Party, \nas there are many Republicans who believe we should have these audits. \nBasic transparency and accountability are vital to ensuring that the \ngovernment does not overstep its legal authority. We grant many \nauthorities to our government, but we should do so with the confidence \nthat if the Government oversteps its authority, Congress has the power \nto bring it back in line. In fact, it is only because of the audits \nthat were mandated by the 2006 PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that \nthe American public became aware of some of the abuses and misuses of \nthe national security letters, which were significant.\n  Without that public accountability and congressional oversight, the \nFBI would not have made improvements to its system of tracking NSL \nissuance. Because of those audits, we are more confident today that FBI \nagents are following proper procedures for obtaining private \ninformation about Americans--rather than improperly using ``exigent \nletters'' to circumvent the rules, or using Post-it Notes to keep track \nof records. Yet the underlying bill omits audits and public reporting; \nour amendment includes important audit requirements and public \nreporting to provide accountability and protect Americans' rights.\n  No one can seriously contend that audits by the inspector general of \npast operations present any operational concerns to law enforcement or \nintelligence gathering. Audits do not interfere; they provide \naccountability and ensure that government follows the rules.\n  Mr. President, you and I and 98 other Members of this body have to \nfollow the rules. Certainly, those in law enforcement should have to \nfollow the rules, as well. These audits have been demonstrated to be \nvital oversight tools, and they should be incorporated into the law. \nThe language in our amendment is the product of more than a year and a \nhalf of extensive negotiations with Republicans and Democrats, the \nintelligence community, the Department of Justice. This year, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee bill won the support of Senator Lee. Last \nCongress, a virtually identical bill received the votes of Senators Kyl \nand Cornyn and was reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nto the Senate. The bipartisan amendment we seek to offer is a \nreasonable package of reforms that preserves the ability of the \ngovernment to use the PATRIOT Act surveillance tools, while promoting \ntransparency, accountability, and oversight.\n  I have often said that the Senate should not shirk its duty to \nreexamine carefully and critically the provisions of the PATRIOT Act. \nWe should consider ways to improve the law consistent with our core \nconstitutional principles. That is what I have tried to do. That is \nwhat Vermonters expect. I intend to vigilantly guard Americans' privacy \nand civil liberties, while doing all I can to keep all Americans \nsecure. That is what we expect in Vermont, and I must assume that is \nwhat we expect in the other 49 States. Without a single improvement or \nreform, without even a word that recognizes the importance of \nprotecting the civil liberties and constitutional privacy rights of \nAmericans, the underlying bill represents a missed opportunity. Let us \nprovide our law enforcement and intelligence professionals with the \ntools they need and give these professionals the security and certainty \nthey need to protect our Nation. But let us also at the same time \nfaithfully perform our duty to protect the constitutional principles \nand civil liberties upon which this Nation was founded and on which the \nAmerican people depend.\n  The vast majority of the 300 million Americans in this great country \nare law-abiding, honest men and women. We should protect against \narbitrarily lumping them all into the category of potential \nlawbreakers, or enabling the government to search homes or businesses \nwithout proper reason. We fought a revolution in this country to stop \nthat from happening, and it is no different today.\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\n  One of the things that has kept us so strong as a nation is our \nability to protect the individual rights of all Americans. We can go \nafter the lawbreakers, just as we got Osama bin Laden, while at the \nsame time protecting the principles of our country. We must not let the \nterrorists win by compromising our own rights and liberties in this \ncountry. The terrorists who seek to harm us would certainly take away \nfrom all of us--women and men alike--the constitutional rights we hold \ndear. We must not allow that.\n  The American people expect us both to protect our rights and to keep \nus safe, and I believe our amendment does just that. That is why I hope \nall Senators will support the Leahy-Paul amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: This responds to your letter of March \n     17, 2010, which asked the Department of Justice to consider \n     implementing administratively certain enhanced civil \n     liberties protections that were included in S. 1692, the USA \n     PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act, as reported by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       In my letter of November 9, 2009, I expressed strong \n     support on behalf of the Department for the bill as reported, \n     which would reauthorize several important Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorities while \n     enhancing protections for civil liberties and privacy in the \n     exercise of these essential national security tools.\n       The bill would reauthorize section 206 of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act, which provides authority for roving surveillance of \n     targets who take steps that thwart FISA surveillance; section \n     215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to \n     compel production of business records and other tangible \n     things with the approval of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court (the FISA Court); and section 6001 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which \n     provides authority to target with FISA searches or \n     surveillance non-United States persons who engage in \n     international terrorist activities but are not necessarily \n     associated with an identified terrorist group. Earlier this \n     year, Congress acted to extend the expiring authorities until \n     February 28, 2011. As that date approaches, I strongly urge \n     that Congress again take action to ensure that these \n     provisions remain in force.\n       Assuming these authorities are reauthorized, the Department \n     has determined that many of the privacy and civil liberties \n     provisions of S. 1692 can be implemented without legislation. \n     Indeed, in a number of instances, we have already taken steps \n     to do so. I am confident that these measures will enhance \n     standards, oversight, and accountability, especially with \n     respect to how information about U.S. persons is retained and \n     disseminated, without sacrificing the operational \n     effectiveness and flexibility needed to protect our citizens \n     from terrorism and facilitate the collection of vital foreign \n     intelligence and counterintelligence information.\n\n\n                       National Security Letters\n\n       Your letter seeks our response regarding several matters \n     related to National Security Letters (NSLs): notification to \n     recipients of NSLs of their opportunity to contest the \n     nondisclosure requirement; issuance of procedures related to \n     the collection, use and storage of information obtained in \n     response to NSLs; retention of a statement of specific facts \n     that the information sought is relevant to an authorized \n     investigation; and increased public reporting on the use of \n     NSLs.\n       You will be pleased to know that as of February 2009, all \n     NSLs are required to include a notice that informs recipients \n     of the opportunity to contest the nondisclosure requirement \n     through the government initiated judicial review. In most \n     cases, this notice is automatically generated by the NSL \n     subsystem. Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide \n     (DIOG) 11.9.3.E. The FBI also will ensure that in any case in \n     which a recipient challenges a nondisclosure order, the \n     recipient is notified when compliance with the order is no \n     longer required. Thus far, there have been only four \n     challenges to the non-disclosure requirement, and in two of \n     the challenges, the FBI permitted the recipient to disclose \n     the fact that an NSL was received. If and when the volume of \n     such requests becomes sufficiently large that solutions \n     beyond ``one-off' notifications are required, the FBI will \n     develop appropriate policies and procedures to notify the \n     recipient when non-disclosure is no longer required.\n       I also am pleased to report that I approved Procedures for \n     the Collection, Use and Storage of Information Derived from. \n     National Security Letters on October 1, 2010, and these \n     procedures have been provided to the Judiciary and \n     Intelligence Committees. The FBI's current practice is \n     consistent with the procedures and the FBI is working on \n     formal policy to implement them. In addition, DOJ and ODNI \n     will shortly complete work on a joint report to Congress on \n     NSL ``minimization'' as required by the PATRIOT \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005.\n       As to the information retained internally in connection \n     with the issuance of NSLs, it is current policy for the FBI \n     to retain a statement of specific facts showing that the \n     information sought through NSLs is relevant to an authorized \n     investigation. DIOG Sec. 11.9.3.C.\n       The Department appreciates the desire of the Committee for \n     enhanced public reporting on the use of NSLs. Accordingly, \n     although the FBI cannot provide information regarding \n     subcategories of NSLs in a public setting, it will continue \n     to report publicly the aggregate numbers of NSLs on an annual \n     basis and will evaluate whether any additional information \n     can be publicly reported.\n\n\n                           Section 215 Orders\n\n       Your letter also raises a number of matters related to \n     section 215 orders. You seek assurances that the government \n     will not rely on the conclusive presumption in section 215 \n     and will present the FISA Court with a complete statement of \n     facts sufficient to show relevance of the tangible things \n     requested to an authorized investigation. It is current FBI \n     practice to provide the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court with a complete statement of facts to support issuance \n     of an order. The FBI is reviewing the DIOG to determine \n     whether changes need to be made to reflect this practice. \n     With respect to section 215 records that contain bookseller \n     records, or are from a library and contain personally \n     identifiable information about a patron of the library, we \n     are prepared to require a statement of specific and \n     articulable facts as would have been required under S. 1692, \n     and to notify Congress should it become necessary to change \n     that practice.\n       You ask the Department to issue policy guidance providing \n     that certifications accompanying applications for section 215 \n     nondisclosure orders must include an appropriately thorough \n     statement of facts that sets forth the need for \n     nondisclosure. I am pleased to report that this is current \n     FBI practice, and the FBI is reviewing the DIOG to determine \n     whether revisions should be made to reflect this practice.\n       You also ask the Department to institute guidelines to \n     require court-approved minimization procedures for section \n     215 orders and pen register and trap and trace (PR/TT) \n     devices. Minimization procedures are already required by \n     statute in relation to section 215 orders. 50 USC \n     1861(b)(2)(B). The proposal to extend this requirement to PR/\n     TT orders is intended to apply only to certain intelligence \n     collection activities. Procedures governing these operations \n     are currently in effect, having been proposed by the \n     government and approved by the FISA Court.\n       Finally, you ask the Department to consider providing an \n     annual unclassified report on the use of FISA authorities and \n     the impact on privacy of United States persons. I believe \n     that providing greater transparency regarding the U.S. \n     government's exercise of FISA authorities is an important \n     objective, and will show the care taken by officials to \n     implement and comply with constitutional and statutory \n     requirements to protect the privacy of United States persons. \n     Although the Department has concerns that there may be little \n     additional information that can be provided in an \n     unclassified format and that such unclassified information \n     could be unintentionally misleading, we are prepared to work \n     with the committee and our partners in the Intelligence \n     Community to determine whether there is a way to overcome \n     these difficulties and make additional information publicly \n     available regarding the use of these authorities.\n       Taken together, I believe these measures will advance the \n     goals of S. 1692 by enhancing the privacy and civil liberties \n     our citizens enjoy without compromising our ability to keep \n     our nation safe and secure.\n       I hope this information is helpful. The Department stands \n     ready to work with Congress to ensure that the expiring FISA \n     authorities are reauthorized in a timely way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 19, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi: Over the past \n     several months, Congress has been considering the \n     reauthorization of three important provisions of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which are scheduled to \n     expire on February 28, 2010: section 206 of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act, which provides authority for roving surveillance of \n     targets who take steps to thwart FISA surveillance; section \n     215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to \n     compel production of business records and other tangible \n     things with the approval of the FISA court; and section 6001 \n     of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, \n     which provides authority to target with FISA surveillance \n     non-United States persons who engage in international \n     terrorist activities but are not necessarily associated with \n     an identified terrorist group. National security requires \n     that these provisions reauthorized before they expire.\n       As discussed in the Attorney General's November 9, 2009 \n     letter, we believe that S. 1692. the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset \n     Extension Act, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     strikes the right balance by both reauthorizing these \n     essential national security tools and enhancing statutory \n     protections for civil liberties and privacy in the exercise \n     of these and related authorities. We\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n     were very pleased that the bill received bipartisan support \n     in the Committee.\n       Since the bill was reported, we have negotiated a number of \n     specific changes with the sponsors of the bill which we \n     support including in the final version of this legislation. \n     Among these are several provisions derived from the bills \n     reported by the House Judiciary Committee and introduced by \n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman \n     Silvestre Reyes in November.\n       We strongly support the prompt consideration of USA PATRIOT \n     Act reauthorization legislation based on S. 1692, together \n     with the changes to which our staffs have informally agreed. \n     However, if Congress is unable to complete work on this \n     measure before these authorities expire, it is imperative \n     that Congress pass a temporary extension of sufficient length \n     to ensure that there is no disruption to the availability of \n     these vital tools in the fight against terrorists.\n       As was previously noted in a September 14 letter from the \n     Department of Justice to Senator Patrick Leahy, the business \n     records authority has been used to support important and \n     highly sensitive intelligence collection operations, of which \n     both Senate and House leadership, as well as Members of the \n     Intelligence and Judiciary Committees and their staffs are \n     aware. We can provide additional information to Members \n     concerning these and related operations in a classified \n     setting.\n       Finally, we remain committed to working with Congress to \n     examine additional ways to enhance protection for civil \n     liberties and privacy consistent with effective use of these \n     important authorities.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that \n     there is no objection to this letter from the perspective of \n     the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n     Dennis C. Blair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n  Section-By-Section Summary of SA334 to S.1038 the Leahy-Paul-Cardin-\n Bingaman-Coons-Shaheen-Wyden-Franken-Gillibrand-Harkin-Durbin-Merkley-\n                    Boxer-Akaka Amendment (HEN11338)\n\n       This amendment adds the following sections at the end of \n     S.1038:\n     Section 3. Additional Sunsets.\n       This section establishes a new sunset of December 31, 2013, \n     on the use of NSLs. This section also changes the sunset \n     dates for provisions under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     (Pub. L. No. 110-261) from December 31, 2012 to December 31, \n     2013. This section also makes conforming amendments to FISA \n     and other applicable laws consistent with the sunsets.\n     Section 4. Orders for Access to Certain Business Records and \n         Tangible Things.\n       This section modifies the standard for obtaining a court \n     order for tangible things under FISA. Current law requires \n     the Government to submit a statement of facts showing \n     reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought \n     are relevant to an authorized investigation. However, current \n     law states that the tangible things sought are presumptively \n     relevant if the Government shows that they pertain to (a) a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, (b) the \n     activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the \n     subject of such an authorized investigation, or (c) an \n     individual in contact with, or known to, an agent of a \n     foreign power who is the subject of such authorized \n     investigation. This section removes the presumption of \n     relevance described above. It requires the Government to \n     provide a statement of the facts and circumstances relied \n     upon by the applicant to justify the applicant's belief that \n     the tangible things sought are relevant. This ensures that \n     the Government is presenting a thorough statement of facts to \n     the court and strengthens judicial oversight. The Department \n     of Justice has indicated that it does not rely on this \n     presumption, and that its current practice is to provide the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court with a complete \n     statement of facts to support issuance of an order.\n       Section 3(a)(2)(A) alters certain requirements with respect \n     to applications made pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1861. These \n     changes are not intended to affect or restrict any activities \n     approved by the FISA court under existing statutory \n     authorities. Rather, this provision is intended to ensure \n     that in applications made pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1861, the \n     Government must submit a statement of the facts it relies on \n     to support its belief that the items or information sought \n     are relevant to an authorized investigation and that such \n     relevance is not to be presumed based on the presence of \n     certain factors.\n       To obtain bookseller records or library records that \n     contain personally identifiable information, the Government \n     must provide a statement of facts showing reasonable grounds \n     to believe the tangible things are relevant to an authorized \n     investigation and pertain to (a) an agent of a foreign power, \n     (b) the activities of a suspected agent, or (c) an individual \n     in contact with or known to a suspected agent of foreign \n     power subject to the investigation. ``Bookseller records'' \n     are defined as meaning any transactional records reflecting \n     the purchase or rental of books, journals, or magazines, \n     whether in digital or print form. The Department of Justice \n     has already agreed to implement this requirement \n     administratively.\n       This section also requires court review of minimization \n     procedures. Finally, this section includes transition \n     procedures to ensure that any order in effect at the time of \n     enactment remains in effect until the expiration of the \n     order.\n     Section 5. Orders for Pen Registers and Trap and Trace \n         Devices for Foreign Intelligence Purposes.\n       Under current law, in order to obtain a FISA pen/trap, the \n     Government must certify that the information sought is merely \n     foreign intelligence information or is relevant to an \n     investigation to protect against terrorism. The bill modifies \n     the standard for obtaining a pen/trap to require the \n     Government to provide a statement of the facts and \n     circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify the \n     applicant's belief that the information likely to be obtained \n     is relevant. This ensures that the Government is presenting a \n     thorough statement of facts to the court and strengthens \n     judicial oversight.\n       Section 4(a)(2)(A) alters certain requirements with respect \n     to applications made pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1842. These \n     changes are not intended to affect or restrict any activities \n     approved by the FISA court under existing statutory \n     authorities. Rather, this provision is intended to ensure \n     that in applications made pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1842, the \n     Government must submit a statement of the facts it relies on \n     to support its belief that the items or information sought \n     are relevant to an authorized investigation.\n       This section also requires minimization procedures, which \n     are not required under current law, and makes those \n     procedures subject to court review. Section 4(b) governs \n     procedures for minimization of the retention and \n     dissemination of information obtained pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \n     1842 where appropriate in exceptional circumstances. This \n     provision is intended to provide a statutory footing for the \n     existing practice whereby specialized minimization procedures \n     are implemented in certain limited circumstances under FISA \n     court authorization and oversight.\n       Finally, this section includes transition procedures to \n     ensure that any order in effect at the time of enactment \n     remains in effect until the expiration of the order.\n     Section 6. Limitations on Disclosure of National Security \n         Letters.\n       This section authorizes the Government to prohibit \n     disclosure of the receipt of an NSL (there are four different \n     statutes that authorize NSLs) where a high level official \n     certifies that disclosure may result in danger to the \n     national security, interference with an investigation, or \n     danger to the life or safety of a person. The FBI has stated \n     that its current practice is to require such a certification \n     to include an appropriately thorough statement of facts \n     setting forth the need for nondisclosure.\n       The recipient of an NSL nondisclosure order may challenge \n     the nondisclosure at any time by notifying the Government of \n     a desire to not comply. Section 7 (below) details the process \n     for doing so.\n     Section 7. Judicial Review of FISA Orders and NSL \n         Nondisclosure Orders.\n       This section allows the recipient of a section 215 order \n     for tangible things to challenge the order itself and any \n     nondisclosure order associated with it. Current law requires \n     a recipient to wait a year before challenging a nondisclosure \n     order. This section repeals that one-year mandated delay \n     before a recipient of an order for tangible things can \n     challenge such a nondisclosure order in court. It also \n     repeals a provision added to the law in 2006 stating that a \n     conclusive presumption in favor of the Government shall apply \n     where a high level official certifies that disclosure of the \n     order for tangible things would endanger national security or \n     interfere with diplomatic relations.\n       This section also corrects the constitutional defects in \n     the issuance of nondisclosure orders on NSLs as found by the \n     Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Doe v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d \n     861 (2d Cir. 2008), and adopts the concepts suggested by that \n     court for a constitutionally sound process. Id. at 883-84. \n     The bill allows the recipient of an NSL with a nondisclosure \n     order to notify the Government at any time that it wishes to \n     challenge the nondisclosure order. The Government then has 30 \n     days to seek a court order in Federal district court to \n     compel compliance with the nondisclosure order. The court has \n     authority to set the terms of a nondisclosure order as \n     appropriate to the circumstances, but must afford substantial \n     weight to the Government's argument in favor of \n     nondisclosure.\n       According to current Department of Justice policy, all NSLs \n     must include a notice that informs recipients of the \n     opportunity to contest the nondisclosure requirement through \n     the Government-initiated judicial review. This section states \n     that the government's application for an NSL nondisclosure \n     order may be filed either in the district within which the \n     authorized investigation is conducted or in the jurisdiction \n     where the recipient's business is located. This option will \n     ease the burden on the recipient in challenging the \n     nondisclosure order.\n       This section requires the Government to notify any entity \n     that challenges a nondisclosure order when the need for \n     nondisclosure is terminated. The Department of Justice agreed \n     to implement this measure administratively in December 2010; \n     therefore, this section will codify current practice.\n       The bill also requires FISA court approval of minimization \n     procedures in relation to the issuance of a section 215 order \n     for production of tangible things, similar to the\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n     court approval required for other FISA authorities such as \n     wiretaps, physical searches, and pen register and trap and \n     trace devices.\n     Section 8. Certification for Access to Telephone Toll and \n         Transactional Records.\n       This section codifies current FBI practice in issuing an \n     NSL, and augments oversight and transparency. Current law \n     requires only that an official certify that the information \n     requested in the NSL is relevant to, or sought for, an \n     authorized investigation to protect against international \n     terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, or for a \n     law enforcement investigation, counterintelligence inquiry, \n     or security determination. This section adds a requirement \n     that the FBI retain a written statement of specific facts \n     showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \n     information sought is relevant to such an authorized \n     investigation. This statement of specific facts will not be \n     included in the NSL itself, but will be available for \n     internal review and Office of Inspector General audits. The \n     Department of Justice has stated that it is current policy \n     for the FBI to retain a statement of specific facts showing \n     the information sought through NSLs is relevant to an \n     authorized investigation.\n     Section 9. Public Reporting on National Security Letters.\n       This section requires reporting of aggregate numbers based \n     upon the total number of all NSLs issued each year, as \n     opposed to by individual NSL. This section ensures that the \n     FBI can keep an accurate record of the information it must \n     disclose by allowing it to report both on persons who are the \n     subject of an authorized national security investigation, and \n     on individuals who have been in contact with or otherwise \n     directly linked to the subject of an authorized national \n     security investigation.\n     Section 10. Public Reporting on the Foreign Intelligence \n         Surveillance Act.\n       This section requires that the Government produce an annual \n     unclassified report on how the authorities under FISA are \n     used, including their impact on the privacy of United States \n     persons. This report shall be easily accessible on the \n     Internet.\n     Section 11. Audits.\n       This section requires the DOJ Office of Inspector General \n     to conduct audits of the use of three surveillance tools: 1) \n     orders for tangible things under section 215 of the 2001 \n     Patriot Act, or section 501 of FISA; 2) pen registers and \n     trap and trace devices under section 402 of FISA; and 3) the \n     use of NSLs. The audits will cover the years 2007 through \n     2013. The scope of such audits includes a comprehensive \n     analysis of the effectiveness and use of the investigative \n     authorities provided to the Government, including any \n     improper or illegal use of such authorities. This section \n     also requires the Inspectors General of the Intelligence \n     Community to submit separate reports that also review these \n     three provisions. The audits covering the years 2007-2009 \n     must be completed by March 31, 2012. The audits for the years \n     2010-2011 must be completed by March, 31, 2013. The audits \n     for the years 2012-2013 must be completed by March, 31, 2015. \n     These due dates ensure that Congress will have time to fully \n     consider the findings of the audits prior to the June 1, 2015 \n     sunsets in the underlying bill.\n     Section 12. Delayed Notice Search Warrants.\n       Current law requires notification of a delayed notice \n     search warrant within 30 days. This section requires \n     notification of a delayed notice search warrant within seven \n     days, or a longer period if justified.\n     Section 13. NSL Procedures.\n       Current law does not require minimization procedures be \n     established, but on October 1, 2010, the Attorney General \n     adopted procedures concerning the collection, use, and \n     storage of information obtained in response to NSLs. This \n     section requires that the Attorney General periodically \n     review, and revise as necessary, those procedures, and to \n     give due consideration to the privacy interests of \n     individuals and the need to protect national security. If the \n     Attorney General makes any significant changes to these NSL \n     procedures, the Attorney General is required under this \n     section to notify Congress, and to submit a copy of the \n     changes.\n     Section 14. Severability.\n       This section includes a severability clause that will \n     ensure that in the event any part of the bill or any \n     amendment to the bill is found to be unconstitutional the \n     remainder of the bill will not be affected.\n     Section 15. Offset.\n       This section includes a $9,000,000 offset from the \n     Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund for any direct \n     spending that could be incurred by the provisions of the \n     bill.\n     Section 16. Electronic Surveillance.\n       This section is intended to amend the FISA wiretap statute \n     (50 U.S.C. 1805(c)(1)(A)) so as to require law enforcement to \n     identify ``with particularity'' the target of a wiretap \n     request under FISA. The Department of Justice has testified \n     that, in applications to the FISA court for ``roving'' \n     wiretaps, it must provide the court sufficient detail to \n     identify the target with particularity.\n     Section 17. Effective Date.\n       This section includes an effective date of 120 days from \n     the date of enactment for the statutory revisions made by \n     this legislation to take effect. This period of time will \n     provide the Government an appropriate amount of time to \n     implement the new procedures required by the legislation.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to speak a little bit about the \nPATRIOT Act, and then do I have to have consent to do anything else \nother than that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak about \ntwo issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to acknowledge the hard work of the chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee on the PATRIOT Act and to state I am on an amendment Senator \nLeahy has authored which has bipartisan support. I think Senator \nLeahy's amendment puts a couple of checks and balances in this bill \nthat I think are essential. But I hope we do not have delays because \ndelays would cause trouble for law enforcement people and for the work \nwe are doing to make sure we continue making progress against those who \nwould harm this country.\n  I fully agree with the statements we have the balance of security and \nliberty, and I think the Leahy amendment goes a long way toward that. \nBut, again, we need to give law enforcement the tools they need.\n\n\n                              House Budget\n\n  Mr. President, as we look at what is ahead for us this week, it is \nnot only the PATRIOT Act, but we also are going to be looking for votes \non a couple of different budget proposals, and I want to spend some \ntime talking about the Republican budget that passed the House that was \noriginally authored by Representative Paul Ryan. It sort of got to be \nknown as the Ryan budget, but let's be very clear about this: It is no \nlonger the Ryan budget. It is the Republican budget.\n  This is why I say this. Out of all the Republicans in the House--and \nthere are a lot of them over there; they run the place; well over 100--\nevery one of them voted for this budget except for, and on our side, \nnot one Democrat.\n  So let's be clear what a budget is. I served on the Budget Committee \nin the House and in the Senate. A budget is a very important document, \nwhether you write it in your own home for your own family or you write \nit in the Senate of the United States. Why? Because in a budget you are \nlooking at all your resources and what your priorities are.\n  If you have an issue with spending--which a lot of us have in our \nhomes, as well as having it right here; we know that; and certainly in \nmy State--this is when the rubber meets the road and you have to say: \nWhat is important to us and what is less important?\n  The questions you ask when you write a budget around here are: Are \nour children important? The answer is, yes. Is it important we have \nclean air to breathe? For me, absolutely. Should the water be pure? \nShould we make sure the environment is protected? Yes. Should we have a \ntransportation system so we can move people and goods in this century \nand be the economic world leader? Yes. That is an investment. We go \nthrough the budget piece by piece and we decide what is crucial.\n  Of course, we need a strong military. Having said that, some of us \nbelieve it is time to wind down the two wars we are in in Afghanistan \nand Iraq that is costing us $12 billion a month. We can use those funds \nback home and still keep the kind of counterterrorism forces we must \nkeep, I believe, in the region and bring that money home.\n  There is a lot of talk, a lot of words are thrown around about how to \nbalance a budget. I have to say, I was fortunate enough to be here, \nthanks to the good people of my State, during the Clinton years, and we \nhad similar issues. What were the issues? We were running in the red. \nWe had a deficit, we had a debt, and we had to make sure the economy \nkept growing in a robust fashion. Do you know what we did? We sat \naround and said: These are the investments that are important to us.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n  Today I would argue it is still education, it is infrastructure, it \nis the environment, it is clean energy. Those are what will move us \nforward. Over here are the issues where we look out and say: How can we \nget some revenue? One of the ways is what the Democrats said the other \nday. We said it is time to end corporate welfare for the biggest oil \ncompanies in the world that are--listen to this--two, three, and four \non the Fortune 500 and are paying a lower tax rate than a nurse. Can I \nsay that one more time? These big multinational oil companies that are \ncharging us an arm and a leg are paying a lower tax rate than a nurse \nor a truckdriver or a firefighter in an effective tax rate. That is the \ntruth. But yet and still, the power of those special interests looms \nover this Chamber, and we were not able to end that corporate welfare \nand start to reduce this deficit.\n  So there are places to go to reduce the deficit. I say, start by \neliminating corporate welfare for the people who do not need it. Start \nby asking billionaires and multimillionaires to pay their fair share. \nThen we do not have to hurt the people of this country, the great \nmiddle class of this country, the children. But every day in every way, \nthat is what these battles are about.\n  So today I want to talk about the Republican budget and just look at \nit from the standpoint of Medicare and look at it from the standpoint \nof seniors and, more specifically, look at it from the standpoint of \nwomen on Medicare who make up 56 percent of those on Medicare.\n  Thank goodness the people in this country are tuning in to this \ndebate. They are tuning in. A lot of what we say here just flies over \nthe country and no one pays attention. It is complex, it is wonky, and \nthe rest. This is an easy one. The Republican budget kills Medicare as \nwe know it. Pretty simple. People are asking themselves across this \nNation: Do they want to kill Medicare as I know it?\n  Senator Mikulski, who has just arrived on the Senate floor, has \norganized the women. In the next 5 minutes I will summarize what I said \nand turn to her.\n  The Republican budget is a disaster for seniors and for those on \nMedicare. It is worse than a disaster. Newt Gingrich said, 15 years \nago: Let Medicare wither on the vine. That means starving it. The \nRepublican budget just kills it outright. They lost patience with that \nidea. The Republican House-passed budget brings a devastating cost to \nseniors for Medicare.\n  Let me show you the cost. Listen to this: The average income of \nsenior women in this country in a year is $14,430. The health care cost \nthey will have to pay under the Ryan budget is almost all that money, \n$12,500. So the Ryan Republican budget devastates Medicare and says to \na senior woman, who makes $14,000 a year, that her health care costs \nare going to cost her $12,000.\n  What is she going to do with the other $2,000? Well, that would be \nprobably, if she is fortunate, maybe 3 months' rent; in California, 1 \nmonth's rent. Then what does she do? Starve? I will tell you what she \nwill do. She will not have health coverage.\n  This is America under the Republican vision? Going back to the days \nwhere our senior citizens had no dignity? I just cannot imagine it. I \ncannot imagine it.\n  The woman earns $14,000. She is supposed to spend $12,000 on health \ncare. Forget it. She is not going to do it. Who in their right mind \nwould ask a woman--a senior woman, who worked and played by the rules, \nwho more than likely is a widow, who is living off Social Security--who \nin their right mind would ask her to face double--double--the cost of \nhealth care she now pays? I will give you the answer. House \nRepublicans. That is what they voted for. I am not making it up. This \nis what they voted for.\n  Now you have people running away from it, running toward it. They do \nnot know which way to go on it. But do you know what. When we vote, I \nhope they run far away from this because this is a disaster.\n  Let me show you another chart. This Republican budget ends Medicare \nas we know it, and it takes the benefit away from the senior and gives \nit straight to this guy. Who is this guy? He is very happy. Behind him \nis a chart that says: ``Health Care Profits.'' On the other side it \ntalks about the CEO of the company and his income. The House Republican \nbudget takes the benefit away from the senior and gives it straight to \nthe insurance company. Imagine. Do you know what this guy makes, the \naverage CEO of a health insurance company? Mr. President, remember, I \ntold you the average senior woman makes $14,000 a year. He makes $12.2 \nmillion a year. Oh, hooray for the Republicans. They are taking a \nbenefit away from a woman who has lived by the rules, who has raised a \nfamily and stood by that family, and in her golden years they take away \nher money and they give it to this fat cat over here. It makes me ill. \nBut I better watch out because the next thing you know, they will take \naway my health care, and where will I go?\n\n  Profits in these companies are up 41 percent from the previous year. \nEvery once in a while a political party stands for something that shows \nwho they are, and I think we are seeing it here. They voted to continue \ncorporate welfare for the biggest multinational oil companies that are \njust running to the bank, and their CEOs make more than this guy by a \nfew million. Now, this week, we are voting on their budget, which gives \nmore to the CEO of an insurance company and steals it away from the \naverage senior woman.\n  The last chart I am going to show is this one: There is a health care \nbenefit in place for senior citizens who are on Medicare. By the way, I \nwas very disturbed when we voted for it because in that bill, at the \ninsistence of the Republicans, we told Medicare they cannot negotiate \nfor reasonable drug prices, and that is the way it went down. It was \nvery sad.\n  Having said that, we have a benefit for senior citizens now. One of \nthe leaders in trying to make sure they get their full benefit has been \nSenator Stabenow, who is joining us now in the Chamber.\n  So I will close with this: What we did in our health care reform \nbudget is to say that seniors will now be covered for basically all of \ntheir health care costs. The Republican budget cancels that out, and \nthey now say seniors have to pay for all of their prescription drugs. \nEven with their insurance, there will be this period of time: the \nuncovered benefit called the doughnut hole. People call it different \nthings. That means immediately--if the Republican budget passed now--my \nseniors in California, who are in that category getting help on their \nprescription drugs, 400,000 of them, would have to pay $9,000 more over \nthe next decade--$9,000 more--for their prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I have given you just a bit of the picture of what the \nRyan budget does. I have just focused on the Medicare piece. That whole \nbudget--the Republican budget, started by Ryan, embraced by the \nRepublicans--is a disaster for seniors, for women, for children, and it \nis a hot time in the old town tonight for big CEOs of health insurance \ncompanies. That is what it is, and we should bring it down.\n  I am happy to now yield for Senator Mikulski, who will have the time \nin her own right.\n  I say to Senator Mikulski, thank you very much for your leadership on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Boxer very much for her steadfast \nstance for American women.\n  Today, the Democratic women have come to the floor to talk about the \nterrible impact the Republican budget coming from the House and getting \nstarted in the Senate has on women.\n  After I speak, I will be followed by Senators Stabenow and Shaheen \nand then Senator Blumenthal. Other colleagues want to join us. Senator \nMcCaskill is in Missouri, as she should be, with her constituents. \nSenators Feinstein and Klobuchar are chairing hearings.\n  But let me get right to my position. You know, the Republicans--we \nare not going to call this the Ryan budget because whether it is the \nRyan budget, the Toomey budget, whatever, it is the wrong budget for \nAmerica, and it continues the radical Republican attack on women they \nbegan in H.R. 1. They started to attack us by taking away our health \ncare, our family planning. Now they are back at it again.\n  The Republican budget takes away our health care, and there are no \nifs,\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\nands, or buts about it. We are not going to put up with it. No matter \nwhat they try to take away from us, we are not going to let it happen.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, let's start with Medicare. Medicare is \nthe single most important health care program in America for seniors. \nWomen are the majority users of Medicare because we live longer.\n  When the Republicans want to talk about taking away or changing \nMedicare as we know it, what is it that they mean? They are going to \ntake away a guaranteed benefit and convert it into guaranteed profits \nfor insurance companies. They talk about a voucher program. It is a \npayment for care that does not go to a senior but goes to an insurance \ncompany. People believe Medicare should be that they go to the doctors \nthey need, get the prescriptions their doctors say they need, and they \nhave follow-up and consistent care. No matter what, when the \nRepublicans say this is going to give grandma more choice, more choice \nto do what? Be at the mercy of insurance company executives who ever-\nshrink benefits package and ever-expand premiums, all of which--\ngovernment subsidizes their profits instead of providing a safety net \nso that if you are old and sick in America, you get the care you need, \nchoose the doctor you want, and get the prescription drugs necessary. \nUnder the Republican budget, Federal dollars turned over to the \ninsurance companies will force people to pay more. In my own home \nState, it will mean $6,000 more in health care.\n  But they don't stop just at Medicare; they go on to Medicaid. Now, \n``Medicaid'' sounds like a bad word or they have made it sound like a \nbad word, that it is a budget-buster. But, make no mistake, Medicaid \nprimarily pays for nursing home bills, nursing home bills for middle-\nclass Americans who need it to turn to nursing home care for a loved \none who may have Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's disease. \nYou don't go into a nursing home because it is a lifestyle choice; it \nis usually a lifesaving mandate. In order to do that, there is no \ngovernment program to help you, so you have to spend down your life \nsavings to qualify for Medicaid, and then Medicaid will help you pay \nfor those bills. But under the Republican budget, they are going to \npull the rug out from anyone who has a loved one in a nursing home.\n  Go out and talk to young families who are part of the sandwich \ngeneration, those who are caring for their aging parents and know they \nhave to make sure they can help pay these long-term care costs while \nthey are worrying about how to send their kids to college. Once more, \nthey are trying to undermine the safety-net protections for middle-\nclass Americans.\n  One thing the Republican plan does--it is a guaranteed bailout for \ninsurance companies. Then they even go a step further. And I know my \ncolleagues will talk about what the defunding of health care will do. I \nwant to talk about the defunding of NIH, the cuts to NIH.\n  The National Institutes of Health will also be cut under the \nRepublican assault on women. What are they talking about by shrinking \nNIH? When you shrink the National Institutes of Health, that means \nthere will be setbacks and delays to find that cure for Alzheimer's, \nthat cure for Lou Gehrig's disease, that cure for Parkinson's disease. \nRight now, there are 5.5 million people living with Alzheimer's. It is \npredicted that by the year 2050, 50 million Americans will have \nAlzheimer's. And 1.5 million have Parkinson's disease.\n  These are not numbers and statistics; these are families who need \nhelp. They certainly need Medicare. They might need long-term care. But \nthey also need to know their government is on their side. We can have \nraces for cures, and we can have walks for the memory programs with the \nAlzheimer's Association. We can't find cures for diseases on private \nphilanthropy, and the drug companies aren't investing the way they \nshould in finding these new cures. We can't undermine this, whether you \nare cutting Medicare, which women need; Medicaid, which is the safety \nnet for nursing home care; and even the research to find the cure for \nthese diseases.\n  Now, whom does this affect? It affects people at all ages. It affects \nconstituents of mine who have worked very hard building automobiles and \nworking in steel mills, working in offices, working hard to be good \npatriotic people. It goes to even a former member of our Supreme Court, \nSandra Day O'Connor, whose husband was gripped by Alzheimer's, and that \nis one of the reasons she stepped down when she did, because she was \ngoing to take care of him. Alzheimer's is an equal-opportunity disease. \nIt hits all incomes and all ZIP Codes. But they are going to take a hit \nbecause of the Republican budget.\n  We are just going to shine a light on this. This is not about a more \nfrugal government. This is not about limited government. This is about \ngovernment abandoning its responsibility to the American people. And \nwhile we are busy promoting democracy over there, let's make sure we \ncontinue to provide health care right back here in America.\n  I now yield the floor for a real champion to women and seniors, my \ncolleague, Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal.) The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you so much to our \ndean of the delegation, our dean of the women Senators, who has not \nonly been here the longest but has been the strongest advocate, the \nstrongest consistent voice for women, for seniors, and for children \nthat we have had in our country. We thank you for that and for bringing \nus together and your leadership in giving us the opportunity to come \nand talk about what are very serious ramifications of the budget passed \nby the House of Representatives.\n  Let me first start--I want to talk about Medicare because that has \nthe biggest impact, but let me say that as we look at the budgets that \nhave been proposed by the House, by House Republicans this year, the \ncurrent budget as well as next year's budget that was passed, we are \nseeing attacks on women and children, from prenatal care forward to \nnursing homes at the end of life.\n  With my hat on as chair of the Agriculture Committee, we oversee the \nnutrition programs for the country, and I was absolutely appalled that \nthe largest cuts that were proposed as we were negotiating the budget \nfor this year in the Department of Agriculture was the WIC Program--\nWomen, Infants and Children--prenatal nutrition for moms who are \npregnant and healthy foods for moms and babies as they move forward \nthrough their first year of life and beyond. It is hard to believe that \nwould be the No. 1 cut, the largest cut in the Department of \nAgriculture budget, but that was the original proposal from this year. \nNow we go forward and we look at the budget that was actually passed \nfor the coming year by the Republican House, and it is really \nastounding when we look at the priorities.\n  The Republican budget essentially ends Medicare. It eliminates \nMedicare as we know it. Folks have said to me: Oh, they really do not \nmean that; they really are not going to do that. Yes. They passed that. \nIt is not just a proposal someone had; they actually passed it as an \nintact insurance plan.\n  Medicare has been a wonderful success story for our country. Social \nSecurity and Medicare together have been great American success \nstories, lifting a generation of older Americans, the majority of them \nwomen, out of poverty and allowing them to be healthy longer in life, a \ngeneration of people, a generation of women, because the majority of \nwomen--particularly as we look at people of older age, the majority of \npeople on Medicare are women.\n  I think about my own mom at 85 going strong and the blessing to watch \nher on Mother's Day be able to play with my two grandchildren--they are \nthe most beautiful grandchildren in the world--3-year-old Lily and 1-\nyear-old Walter, and to have my mother still be healthy because of \naccess to health care at age 85, that is a success story. That is a \ngift we have all joined together as a country to give to our families, \nto older Americans, to our parents and grandparents and to future \ngenerations. That gift would be eliminated, that ability to have \nMedicare, and most of that elimination would be, unfortunately, an \nattack on women.\n  Seniors will pay double. The amount they will pay under the plan \npassed by\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\nthe House is $6,359 more than they currently pay now. Really, what does \nthat mean? Well, right now under Medicare, the current system in copays \nand deductibles and so on for the average senior is about $6,000, \n$6,154. Under the Republican plan passed by the House, that would \ndouble--more than double.\n  What does that mean to the average women who is retired? Well, the \naverage woman senior has an income of $14,430--$14,430--and under the \nRepublican plan her health care costs would be $12,500. I don't know \nabout you, Mr. President, but the idea of living on roughly $2,000 for \nthe year, for your rent or mortgage or food or clothing or gasoline--\ncertainly not gasoline, given that the price of gas is impossible. It \nis absolutely impossible. And this is what is coming for the average \nwoman who is retired, over age 65, under the plan passed by the House \nof Representatives.\n  Now, why would they be doing this? Why would they be doing this? \nWell, unfortunately, it is to continue to allow them to provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest Americans, those earning over $1 million a \nyear, and they add more tax breaks in their budget while they are \ncutting Medicare, and it also protects the special perks for special \ninterests such as the oil companies.\n  The reality is this: We know there is a huge budget deficit we have \nto tackle. We also understand that people are living longer and there \nis work we need to do around both Medicare and Social Security. We have \nalready begun that process in health reform--lengthening the solvency \nof Medicare for a number of years, taking away overpayments for for-\nprofit insurance companies to save dollars, and focusing on prevention, \nwhich saves $500 billion over the next 10 years in Medicare, lengthens \nthe trust fund, and does not cut benefits to seniors. It does not \neliminate Medicare. It does not eliminate other insurance plans. It \nstrengthens it for the future. That is one way to go.\n  But our colleagues in the other House, the Republicans, said: We need \nto balance the budget, so let's start by eliminating Medicare as we \nknow it. Let's start there, doubling the cost for the average senior, \nmost of whom are women.\n  We said: Well, there are a lot of choices about where to start to \nbalance the budget. Let's start with the top five oil companies that \nright now are earning the largest corporate profits in history and \nstill get taxpayer subsidies, some of which started almost 100 years \nago when it probably made sense--over 100 years ago--when oil prices \nwere $17 a barrel. Now they are over $100 a barrel--the largest \ncorporate profits ever. They still get taxpayer subsidies.\n  People in my State are scratching their heads as they are paying \nhigher prices out of one pocket and, as taxpayers, are subsidizing the \nprices out of the other pocket. Let's start with the billions of \ndollars that are certainly no longer needed by an industry that is \ndoing extremely well. Let's take away those taxpayer subsidies as a \nplace to start to balance the budget. Let's not start with the tens of \nmillions of people who currently get health care through Medicare, most \nof whom are women.\n  The Republican plan goes even further because it also attacks and \ndramatically cuts and weakens Medicaid, most of which is for low-income \nseniors in nursing homes, and 77 percent of the people in nursing homes \nor long-term care facilities are women. Again, 77 percent of those in \nnursing homes or long-term care facilities who are using Medicaid to \nhelp them are women. Again, from prenatal care in the beginning of life \nto what happens to seniors at the end of life, women in nursing homes \nacross the board are being attacked on women's health care. That makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  Certainly those are not the values I believe in--the values we \nbelieve in as a country. Certainly those are not the values the people \nin Michigan have. Starting to balance the budget by going back to \nseniors, women, and middle-class families who are already taking hit \nafter hit in this economy is not fair. It is certainly not the place I \nam going to vote to start or I know our Democratic majority will start.\n  We are going to have an opportunity very soon--in the next day or \ntwo--to say yes or no about this plan that was passed by the House, the \nplan that eliminates Medicare as we know it and puts an insurance \ncompany bureaucrat between you and your doctor. Every woman on Medicare \nwould be put into a situation where an insurance company bureaucrat \nwould, once again, be back between her and her doctor as she tries to \nget the care she needs.\n  In my judgment, the Republicans' plan has its priorities upside down. \nTheir plan to eliminate Medicare as we know it is good for insurance \ncompanies, no question about it. Every single woman would have to go \nback to a private insurance company, and then the insurance company \nwould get a subsidy at that point. It may be good for insurance \ncompanies, but it is bad for seniors, for taxpayers, and certainly bad \nfor American women.\n  I encourage and implore our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto join with us in saying no and supporting Medicare--the great \nAmerican success story that it is--and saying no to the efforts to \neliminate Medicare as we know it, saying no to the Republican budget, \nwhich puts insurance company bureaucrats between you and your doctor. \nLet's say yes to other areas where we can reduce the deficit, without \nhurting middle-class families and seniors in this country.\n  It is my great pleasure to yield for a champion for women's health \ncare and for the State of New Hampshire, Senator Jeanne Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator \nStabenow, for the great work she has done over a long period of time \nfor women and families in her State of Michigan and throughout the \ncountry. I remember her telling me she got involved in politics in \norder to address a nursing home issue, which disproportionately affects \nwomen--just as this budget that passed the House disproportionately \naffects women and children. I am pleased to be able to join her on the \nfloor, along with my other colleagues.\n  I also appreciate Senator Mikulski's leadership in bringing us \ntogether today.\n  There is no doubt that everybody in the Senate--and those who spoke \ntoday--understands we need to deal with this country's debt and \ndeficit. There is no question about that. But the question is, Are we \ngoing to do that in a way that is fair to everyone? Unfortunately, the \nHouse Republican plan would disproportionately impact women and, in \nparticular, older women.\n  Make no mistake about it, the Republican budget that passed the House \nwill end Medicare as we know it today. Since women are a majority of \nall Medicare beneficiaries, any radical change to the Medicare system \nwill disproportionately affect women, and it will, in the long term, \nhurt so many women in this country. For example, if we take a typical \nsenior on Medicare in my home State of New Hampshire, under the House \nRepublican plan that senior's out-of-pocket health care costs are going \nto double to $12,000 a year.\n  As time goes on, those out-of-pocket costs are going to continue to \nincrease. This health care impact on senior women is especially hard \nbecause, during most women's working years, they earn less than men. \nThat is still true today--women earn less than men. Women often work \npart time or leave the workforce while raising families. As a result, \nthey have less retirement savings, on average, and lower Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  So for women who already have earned less, Medicare is a critical \nsource of financial security. It keeps many women out of poverty. The \nHouse-passed Republican budget will end that security for seniors who \nrely on prescription drugs--a real improvement we made when we passed \nthe affordable health care plan because we made great progress toward \nclosing that doughnut hole and helping seniors with the cost of \nprescription drugs. But what the House Republican plan will do is \ndramatically increase those costs. Again, in New Hampshire, we have \n15,200 seniors who will pay $8.5 million more in just 1 year for their \nmedication. Of course, we all know women tend to live longer than men. \nAs a result, women represent three-quarters of our most vulnerable \nMedicare beneficiaries--those who are living in nursing homes and \nassisted living or other long-term care facilities.\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n  When their savings run out--which happens often, given the costs of \nlong-term care--seniors must turn to Medicaid to pay their bills. \nHowever, the House Republican budget would also make radical changes to \nthe Medicaid system. So their proposal not only threatens Medicare but \nit threatens long-term care for millions of women who rely on Medicaid.\n  The House Republican proposal eliminates the current Medicare system \nand puts private insurance companies in charge of the health benefits \nseniors receive. The Republican plan does nothing to reduce the cost of \nhealth care. It just shifts that cost of health care onto seniors. What \nis going to happen when we shift the cost to seniors who can no longer \nafford to pay for their health care is that they are going to go to \nemergency rooms, and emergency rooms are not only the most expensive \ncare because we would have eliminated the preventive care that is part \nof the new Medicare proposal we passed for health care, but everybody \nwho has health insurance winds up paying for those emergency room costs \nthat seniors would not be able to afford to pay. So it is a double cost \nshifting--a shifting to seniors for the cost of their health care and a \nshifting of those health care costs to everybody who has insurance.\n  The House Republican budget will hurt all seniors, but it will \nespecially hurt women because they are the most vulnerable. I hope all \nour colleagues will join us in voting against the House Republican \nbudget that is on our desk that we expect to take up this week.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am very pleased and honored to \njoin my distinguished colleagues--most recently the occupant of the \nchair--as we pledge to continue to fight to stand for women's health \ncare and to fight the devastating cuts that are incorporated in the \nHouse Republican budget.\n  This fight against these cuts is essential not only for the health of \nmillions of women across the United States but also for our health care \nsystem and even for the effort to cut the debt and deficit, which has \nto be one of our most important goals.\n  In the end, these cuts are as far from cost-effective as any could \npossibly be. In the end, they will actually raise the cost of health \ncare in this country because they will deny millions of women and girls \npreventive health care, which saves money in the long run. Preventive \nhealth care enables everyone to avoid the most costly consequences--\ncostly in terms of the pain and suffering and worry and concern that \ncomes from failure to diagnose and treat problems earlier rather than \nlater.\n  Indisputably, preventive and coordinated health care saves money. \nThis Republican budget will cost more money. It also will have an \nimpact on States, unquestionably. In Connecticut, 114,000 people will \nlose Medicaid if this program is changed into a block grant program, \nand Connecticut will lose $16.1 billion in health care benefits if our \ngovernment in the State of Connecticut will have to shoulder this \ngreater financial burden. The same will be true of other States across \nthe country that will have to bear more of the costs. Taxpayers at the \nState level will pay those costs.\n  Again, that is as far from cost-effective as any program could be. \nThe real consequences--the most dramatic and most immediate effect of \nthis very misguided and cruel House Republican budget will be on women \nand children predominantly because Medicaid and Medicare serve them \nmore than any other part of our population. Medicaid provides, in \nConnecticut, for example, 77 percent of the public funding for family \nplanning. Medicaid pays for 35 percent of all the births in the State \nof Connecticut. The burden will fall on them disproportionately, and it \nwill have real human consequences for women and children.\n  In a very pernicious way, it will also enable and encourage States to \nwage, at their level, the kind of ideological war on women's health we \nhave seen, unfortunately and unconscionably, at the Federal level. We \ncan already see the beginnings of it. In the State of Indiana, for \nexample, they enacted legislation to prohibit Planned Parenthood from \nreceiving Medicaid funds to be used for women's health care.\n  Think of it--Medicaid money cut completely for family planning, for \ncancer screening, for all kinds of preventive services that constitute \nthe bulk of what Planned Parenthood does in Indiana and across the \ncountry under a law that is not only bad public policy but also \nillegal.\n  I thank the administration for recognizing the illegality of this \nlaw. It has done so in a statement recently issued by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. It has said unequivocally that this Indiana \nlaw that prohibits Planned Parenthood health centers from receiving \nFederal funds for family planning services under Medicaid and title X \ncontravenes Federal law. Now we will ask--and I am circulating a letter \nto my colleagues to this effect--the Federal Government to take action \nthat will provide real teeth for this statement and show that similar \nlaws now pending in other legislatures, such as Kansas, Oklahoma, and \nelsewhere, will also bring compliance action from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The fact of the matter is family planning services provided by \nMedicaid are a mandatory benefit under Federal law. Congress created \nthis legal program for beneficiaries in 1972, and it was so concerned \nabout the availability of family planning services that the Federal \nGovernment and this Congress required that they cover 90 percent of all \nof the cost of services in this area--an unprecedented incentive and a \nclear signal as to the importance of these services.\n  The Indiana law threatens access to vital preventive health care for \nmillions of women in that State. Its precedent threatens the same kind \nof family planning and preventive care for millions more women across \nthe country. And this body has, in effect, rejected that kind of \nrestriction by a vote of 58 to 42 when we had to consider the \ncontinuing resolution just weeks ago.\n  Finally, this ideological war in Indiana is misguided, it is costly \nin dollars and in lives, and it should not be tolerated. Certainly it \nshould not be permitted by the kind of approach that is embodied in the \nHouse Republican budget. I believe the Members of this body will take a \nstand against it and fight the kind of war on women's health care the \nHouse Republican budget so dramatically reflects.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to discuss the devastating \nimpact that the House Republican budget would have on seniors, women, \nchildren, and families nationwide.\n  On April 15, 2011, House Republicans passed H. Con. Res. 34, Chairman \nRyan's budget. Under the guise of entitlement reform and deficit \nreduction, House Republicans would instead ensure that the elderly, the \npoor, pregnant women, and children will be unable to afford health \ncare.\n  The House Republican budget essentially ends the important \nentitlement programs Medicare and Medicaid as we know them, all while \n72 percent of the budget cuts go to fund tax cuts for the rich. The \nbudget claims $1.5 trillion in savings from winding down the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, which are already savings that will happen. If \nyou discount those savings, the House Republican budget cuts $4.3 \ntrillion over 10 years, while spending $4.2 trillion on tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, resulting in only $100 billion in deficit reduction. To be \nblunt, House Republicans are trying to balance the budget on the backs \nof the poor, the elderly, and our children while rewarding the wealthy.\n  This budget changes Medicaid from a State-Federal matching program \nthat can adjust to changes in unemployment, poverty, or aging of the \npopulation, to a capped amount of Federal funds per State--a block \ngrant. The budget also repeals the health reform law.\n  Medicaid is the health insurance program for low-income or disabled \nindividuals and families, many of whom are parents in working families. \nThis is not a population who can easily access health insurance \nelsewhere if their benefits are cut.\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\n  If Medicaid was converted to a block grant and the health reform law \nrepealed, California stands to lose an estimated $147.8 billion over \nthe next decade--$87.7 billion through Federal investments in Medi-Cal \nand $60.1 billion from the Medicaid expansion in health reform. Under \nthe House Republican budget, California would see a 31-percent \nreduction in Federal dollars over the first 10 years, and by 2021 there \nwould likely be a 41-percent cut in Medicaid enrollment. Mr. President, \n7.2 million Medicaid beneficiaries in California could see either \nreduced benefits or increased out-of-pocket costs, and at least 2 \nmillion poor Californians could be kicked off the program.\n  Low-income pregnant women who depend on Medicaid as a key source of \nhealth coverage could be dropped from the program. By converting \nMedicaid into a block grant, House Republicans would inevitably force \nStates to drop coverage or change eligibility levels, and many more \nbabies could be at risk. Without Medicaid, pregnant women who rely on \nthe program would likely be uninsured and forgo critical prenatal care. \nThis is a serious concern for the health of both the mother and the \nbaby. Babies born to mothers who do not receive prenatal care are three \ntimes as likely to be born at a low birth weight and five times more \nlikely to die. A block grant could also result in States dropping \ncoverage for children who need it the most, such as those receiving \nspecial needs care.\n  In California alone, Medicaid care for seniors and the disabled, \nincluding nursing home care, would be slashed by almost $54 billion \nover 10 years.\n  This budget hurts women, it hurts children, and it hurts the elderly.\n  The House Republican budget also eliminates Medicare as we know it. \nInstead of a guaranteed set of health benefits, seniors would receive \nroughly $8,000 to purchase insurance on the private market. This sounds \ngood, but the bottom line is that it won't cover the costs. Our current \nMedicare Program has been more effective than the private insurance \nmarket at keeping costs down. This means that for an equivalent package \nof benefits in 2022, under this budget, health care costs for an \naverage 65-year-old will be 40 percent higher. Because the $8,000 will \nbe insufficient to cover the increased cost of care, annual costs the \nseniors pay out of their own pocket for health care will more than \ndouble in 2022, from an estimated $6,150 to $12,500. Essentially, \nseniors would be getting less money to purchase more expensive care. In \n2010, half of all Medicare beneficiaries had incomes less than $21,000. \nYou can see the problem.\n  Furthermore, the House GOP budget would repeal the health reform law. \nRepealing the health reform law would reopen the drug-coverage Medicare \ndrug-coverage gap or doughnut hole, that is closed in health reform. \nThis gap forced beneficiaries to pay 100 percent of their drug costs \nafter they exceeded an initial coverage limit. Over 381,000 California \nseniors are in this coverage gap. House Republicans want these seniors \nto have to pay $214 million more for prescriptions next year and $4.3 \nbillion more in 2030.\n  Furthermore, there would no longer be free annual wellness exams \nunder Medicare, meaning over 106,000 Californians could pay over $11.1 \nmillion more for annual wellness visits in 2012.\n  Repealing the health reform law also hurts women. Women in Medicare \nwould no longer receive free mammograms--an important measure to find \nbreast cancer early.\n  Because of the new health care reform law, in 2014, insurance \ncompanies will no longer be able to discriminate based on preexisting \nhealth conditions and will no longer be able to charge different \npremiums for women and men. House Republicans want insurance companies \nto get back in the driver's seat and be able to charge higher rates \nbased on gender and deny coverage to people with preexisting \nconditions. About 80 percent of Americans age 65 and older have at \nleast one chronic health condition, meaning it would be more difficult \nfor them to find insurance coverage. Under this budget, pregnancy would \nonce again be considered a preexisting condition. We all know how \ndifficult it is to get coverage. It is a travesty to deny health \ninsurance to women for this reason.\n  With these and other benefits in the law, women make great strides \ntoward equality in the insurance market. But House Republicans want to \neliminate these strides.\n  The House Republican budget also targets a critical nutrition program \nfor low-income families. It would cut $127 billion, or 20 percent, to \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, in the next 10 \nyears alone. In my State alone, 3.7 million individuals are expected to \nreceive food stamps in 2012. Under the House Republican budget, \nCalifornia would lose over $10 billion in food stamp benefits over the \nnext 10 years. As a result, families would see their benefits cut. Low-\nincome families, with average salaries of $28,000 a year, would see \ntheir benefits cut by $147 a month.\n  The continued assault on health care for the poor, the elderly, \nwomen, and children is astounding to me. We need to look carefully at \nour spending and we need to make cuts, and I believe we need to include \nentitlement programs in the discussion. But changes to these programs \nand any cuts we make have to be carefully crafted to ensure that the \nmost vulnerable populations receive the least amount of harm. The House \nRepublican budget does not follow this philosophy; instead, it attacks \nthe poor and elderly in the guise of deficit reduction.\n  I will be voting against this budget when it comes before the full \nSenate for a vote.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in \nopposition to the proposed reauthorization of the expiring provisions \nof the PATRIOT Act incorporated in S. 1038. I have to tell you, I find \nreauthorization especially troubling since we have waited until the \nlast minute and are now being told we must rush this bill through the \nSenate of the United States.\n  There are a number of PATRIOT Act provisions that are permanent, and \nthey remain in place to give our intelligence community important tools \nto fight terrorism. But there are three controversial provisions we are \ndebating, commonly known as roving wiretap, lone wolf, and business \nrecords. I have to tell you, at least from my point of view--and I \nthink there are other Senators here who agree with me--they are ripe \nfor abuse, and they threaten Americans' constitutional freedoms.\n  As I start my remarks at the onset, I want to state that I firmly \nbelieve, as we all do, that terrorism is a serious threat to our great \ncountry, the United States, and we have to be focused like no other \ntime in our history in seeking to protect our people, the American \npeople.\n  I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. On those two committees, much of my attention \nis centered on keeping Americans safe, both here and abroad. I \nrecognize that despite bin Laden's death--which we all celebrate \nbecause justice was delivered--we still live in a world where terrorism \nis a serious threat to our country, our economy, and to American lives.\n  Our government does need the appropriate surveillance and \nantiterrorism tools to achieve these important goals--indeed, many of \nthe PATRIOT Act's provisions which I support and have made our Nation \nsafer since those devastating attacks on that day we will always \nremember, on 9/11, we know that for a fact. But the problem we confront \ntoday is there are three provisions we are debating that fail to strike \nthe right balance between keeping us safe, while protecting the privacy \nrights of Coloradans and all Americans.\n  Instead, these three provisions are far too susceptible to abuse by \nthe Federal Government, even in the name of keeping us safe from \nterrorism. I do not say this lightly, but my concerns about some of \nthese provisions have only grown since I have been briefed on their \ninterpretation and their implementation as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n  Let me share some examples. Currently, the intelligence community can \nplace wide-ranging wiretaps on Americans without even identifying the \ntarget or the location of such surveillance. That is one concern. \nSecond concern. The intelligence community can target individuals who \nhave no connection to terrorist organizations. A third concern I have \nis they can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have \nno connection to terrorism. We ought to be able to at least agree that \nthe source of an investigation under the PATRIOT Act should have a \nterrorist-related focus. If we cannot limit investigations to \nterrorism, my concern is, where do they end? Is there no amount of \ninformation our government can collect that should be off-limits? I \nknow Coloradans are demanding that we at least place commonsense limits \non government investigations and link data collection to terrorist-\nrelated activities.\n  If we pass this bill to extend the PATRIOT Act until 2015, it would \nmean that for 4 more years the Federal Government will continue to have \nunrestrained access to private information about Americans who have no \nconnection to terrorism, with little to no accountability as to how \nthese powers are used.\n  Again, I wish to go back because we all agree the intelligence \ncommunity needs effective tools to combat terrorism. But we must \nprovide those tools in a way that protects the constitutional freedoms \nof our people and lives up to the standard of transparency democracy \ndemands.\n  The three controversial provisions I have mentioned can be much \nbetter balanced to protect our people. Yet it seems to me that many of \nmy colleagues, many of our colleagues, oppose any changes. By making \nthe PATRIOT Act provisions I have outlined permanent, we would be, in \neffect, preventing debate on them ever again.\n  To travel that path would be to threaten constitutional and civil \nliberties we hold dear in this country. That is not the right path. Let \nme be clear. I do not oppose the reauthorization of these three \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act, but I do aim to bring forward some \ncommonsense reforms that will allow us to strike an important balance \nbetween keeping our Nation safe, on the one hand, while also protecting \nprivacy and civil liberties.\n  Toward that goal, I have worked side by side with my colleagues in \ncoming up with commonsense fixes that could receive bipartisan support. \nSenator Wyden from Oregon has filed an amendment, which I have \ncosponsored, that would require the Department of Justice disclose to \nCongress the official legal interpretation of the provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. While I believe our intelligence practices should be kept \nsecret, I do not believe the government's official interpretation of \nthese laws should be kept secret.\n  I have also filed my own amendments to address some of the problems I \nsee with the three expiring provisions. The first amendment I have \nfiled is bipartisan with Senator Paul of Kentucky, who is on the floor, \nand Senator Wyden, who has joined as well. Our amendment would modify \nthe roving wiretap authority under section 206 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Specifically, our bipartisan amendment would require intelligence \nagencies to identify either the target or the place to be wiretapped. \nThey currently do not have to do so. I believe that when seeking to \ncollect intelligence, law enforcement should at least have to identify \nwho is being targeted.\n  I have also filed an amendment to address the so-called ``lone wolf'' \nprovision which currently allows the government to conduct wiretap \nsurveillance on individuals, even when that person has no connection to \na government or a terrorist organization.\n  This amendment would simply require that should the intelligence \ncommunity use the ``lone wolf'' provision, that Congress simply be \nnotified--again, a safeguard that is not in place as we stand here \ntoday. Without safeguards like that, how do we in this body conduct our \nconstitutional duties of oversight?\n  Finally, I was joined by Senator Wyden in filing an amendment \ndesigned to narrow the scope of business record materials that can be \ncollected under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. This amendment would \nstill allow law enforcement to use the PATRIOT Act to obtain such \nrecords but would require these entities to demonstrate that the \nrecords are in some way connected to terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  Right now, law enforcement can currently obtain any kind of records. \nIn fact, the PATRIOT Act's only limitation states that such information \nhas to be related to any tangible thing. That is right. As long as \nthese business records are related to any tangible thing, the U.S. \nGovernment can require businesses to turn over information on all their \ncustomers, whether or not there is any link to terrorism.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It seems to me the Senator has laid out the case for why \nthere needs to be a thoughtful debate about the PATRIOT Act and what is \nnecessary to strike the key balance between fighting terrorism \nferociously and protecting our liberties.\n  I am interested in what my colleague thinks about the proposition of \nhow you have a thoughtful debate on these issues, when there is secret \nlaw where, in effect, the interpretation of the law, as it stands \ntoday, is kept secret. So here we are, Senators on the floor, and we \nhave colleagues of both political parties wanting to participate. \nCertainly, if you are an American, you are in Oregon or Colorado, you \nare listening in, you want to be part of this discussion. But yet the \nexecutive branch keeps secret how they are interpreting the law.\n  What is the Senator's sense about how we have a thoughtful debate if \nthat continues?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The Senator from Oregon has put his finger on \nwhy it is so important to have a debate on the floor and not rush these \nprovisions to the House because of a deadline that I think we can push \nback. We can, as you know, extend the PATRIOT Act in its present form a \nnumber of other days or a number of weeks in order to get this right.\n  But the Senator from Oregon makes the powerful point that the law \nshould not be classified--as far as its interpretation goes. Of course, \nwe can protect sources and methods and operations, as we well should. \nBoth of us serve on the Intelligence Committee. We are privy to some \ninformation that should be classified. But we have come to the floor to \nmake this case because of what we have learned on the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Well said.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator for his question. I look \nforward to his comments in a few minutes. The Senator from Oregon, in \neffect, points out that these are just a few of the reform ideas we \ncould debate. But without further debate on any of these issues, this \nor any other administration can abuse the PATRIOT Act and could \nactually deny us, as Members of Congress, whether in this Congress or \nfuture Congresses, the opportunity to fulfill our oversight \nresponsibilities on behalf of the American people.\n\n  I voted against the original passage of the PATRIOT Act in 2001, and \nI plan to vote against the reauthorization of the expiring provisions \nthis week, unless we implement some reforms that will sensibly restrain \nthese overly broad provisions. Simply put--again, to make the point \nthat the Senator from Oregon made so importantly--I believe Congress is \ngranting powers to the executive branch that lead to abuse and, \nfrankly, shield the executive branch from accountability.\n  It has been 10 years since we first passed this law, and there has \nbeen very little opportunity to improve the law. I resist this rush to \nagain rubberstamp policies that threaten the very liberty we hold dear. \nI recently supported a short-term extensions of the expiring provisions \nbefore us as a bridge to take time and debate and amend the PATRIOT Act \nand its controversial provisions.\n  But we were notified--unfortunately, a few days ago--that we would be \nvoting on a 4-year extension of these expiring provisions. That is not \nthe way to assure Americans that we are diligently considering these \nimportant public decisions.\n  In Federalist 51, James Madison, whom we venerate, who was the author \nof many of the documents that structure the way in which we organize \nand operate our democracy, wrote: ``In\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nframing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the \ngreat difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to \ncontrol the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control \nitself.''\n  The bill before us does not live up to that standard. I believe it \nseriously risks the constitutional freedoms of our people. We need to \nstrike a better balance between giving our national security and law \nenforcement officials the tools necessary to keep us safe, while not \ndamaging the very Constitution we have sworn to support and defend.\n  By passing an unamended reauthorization, we are assuring that \nAmericans will live with the status quo for 4 more long years. I \nbelieve this bill may well be a lost opportunity to improve the balance \nbetween our security and our civil liberties. That is not the result \nthat our Founding Fathers envisioned, and it is not a result that our \nconstituents want.\n  For these reasons, if the PATRIOT Act provisions are not amended, I \nplan to vote no on the motion to invoke cloture and on passage of S. \n1038. Before I yield the floor, I wish to make one last historical \nreference.\n  Ben Franklin, one of our Founding Fathers, said, compellingly and \npresciently: ``A society that would sacrifice essential liberties for \nshort-term security deserves neither.''\n  I think that is the question before us. There is a way forward. There \nis a way to keep the PATRIOT Act in place to protect our national \nsecurity but also to protect our essential liberties. But in order to \ndo that, we have to have a chance to debate and pass these important \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the Chamber, I \nwished to tell him what a welcome addition he has been to the \nIntelligence Committee. I have served on that committee for 10 years. \nWe have had excellent chairs--first, Senator Roberts, then Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Feinstein.\n  So we continue to try to look for bipartisan support for trying to \nstrike that balance between collective security and individual liberty. \nI am struck both by the clarity of your statement and the fact that \nthose who are going to vote on these amendments and the American people \nwho are listening in tonight ought to be able to get, in a \nstraightforward, easy-to-access fashion, how the executive branch is \ncurrently interpreting the PATRIOT Act.\n  The fact is, law professors give assignments to their students to \nwrite analyses of the PATRIOT Act. The Congressional Research Service \nactually has an analysis out. But it is not possible to get the \nofficial interpretation of how the U.S. Government frames this law as \nfar as the operations are so essential for our country. The Senator has \nlaid it out very well. It is a pleasure to serve with him on the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up with what this issue has come down to, \nto me.\n  These are dangerous times. If you go into the Intelligence Committee \nseveral times a week, as Senator Udall and I do, you come away with the \nindisputable judgment that there are threats to the well-being of this \ncountry, that there are people who do not wish our citizens well. In \nthese dangerous times, the sources and methods of our antiterror \noperations absolutely must be kept secret. That is fundamental to the \nwork of the intelligence community--keeping the sources and methods of \nthose who serve us so gallantly secret and ensuring that they are as \nsafe as possible.\n  But while we protect those sources and methods, the laws that \nauthorize them should not be kept secret from the American people. That \nis what this is all about--whether the laws that authorize the \noperations that are so essential, which have been passed by the \nCongress--that their interpretation should be kept secret from the \nAmerican people. I call it ``secret law.'' I want to say to this body, \nyes, we need secret operations, but secret law is bad for our \ndemocracy. It will undermine the confidence the American people have in \nour intelligence operations.\n  You might recall that it was only a few years ago, during the Bush \nadministration, that they secretly reinterpreted the warrantless \nwiretapping statutes to say that it was possible to wiretap our people \nwithout a warrant. When it came out, it took years to sort that out, \nwith the executive branch and the Congress working together. I don't \nwant to see that happen again. So that is why I have joined Senator \nUdall in these amendments, and we hope we can get bipartisan support \nfor what we are trying to do and especially ensure that the official \ninterpretation of the PATRIOT Act, an important intelligent statute, is \nmade public to the American people, and I think it can be done in a way \nwithout jeopardizing our sources and methods.\n  One of the reasons Senator Udall, I, and others feel so strongly \nabout this is--and Senator Udall touched on this--that this is a time \nwhen Congress should finally say we are not just going to keep kicking \nthe can down the road. That is what has been done again and again over \nthe last decade. The PATRIOT Act was passed a decade ago, during a \nperiod of understandable fear, having suffered in our Nation the \ngreatest terrorist attack in our history. So the PATRIOT Act was born \nout of those great fears.\n  It seems to me that now is the time to revisit that and ensure that a \nbetter job is done of striking the balance between fighting terror and \nprotecting individual liberty. Unfortunately, every time over the last \ndecade there has been an effort to do just that--revisit this and \nstrike a better balance--we have had the same pattern; we have said we \njust have to get it done quickly and we really don't have any time to \nconsider, for example, the thoughtful ideas Senator Udall has \nmentioned. I just don't think it is time now to once again put off a \nreal debate on the PATRIOT Act for yet another always-distant day.\n  There is an irony about what this is all about, and that is that \nSenators are going to want to consider the amendments of Senator \nUdall--and I believe Senator Paul is here, and others who care strongly \nabout this. It is awfully hard to have a thoughtful debate on these \nspecific amendments, whether it is the Leahy amendment, the Paul \namendment, the Udall amendment, or the ones we have together, if, in \nfact, you cannot figure out how the executive branch is interpreting \nthe law.\n  An open and informed debate on the PATRIOT Act requires that we get \nbeyond the fact that the executive branch relies on the secret legal \ninterpretations to support their work, and Members of the Senate try to \nfigure out what those interpretations are.\n  Here are the rules. If a U.S. Senator wants to go to the Intelligence \nCommittee--and I think Senator Udall touched on this--the Senator can \ngo there and get a briefing. Many Members of Congress, however, don't \nhave staff members who are cleared for those kinds of briefings. Under \nSenate rules, it is not possible for Senators to come down here and \ndiscuss what they may have picked up in one of those classified \nbriefings.\n  I just don't think, with respect to the legal interpretation, that is \nwhat the American people believe we ought to be doing. The American \npeople want secret operations protected. They understand what sources \nand methods are all about and that we have to have secrecy, for \nexample, for those in the intelligence community to get the information \nwe need about sleeper cells and terrorist groups and threats we learn \nabout in the Intelligence Committee. But that is very different from \nkeeping these legal interpretations secret.\n  In my view, the current situation is simply unacceptable. The \nAmerican people recognize that their government can better protect \nnational security if it sometimes is allowed to operate in secrecy. \nThey certainly don't expect the executive branch to publish every \ndetail about how intelligence is collected. Certainly, Americans never \nexpected George Washington to tell them about his plans for observing \ntroop movement at Yorktown. But Americans have always expected their \ngovernment to operate within the boundaries of publicly understood law. \nAs voters, they certainly have a right to know how the law is being \ninterpreted so that the American people can ratify or reject decisions \nmade on their behalf. To put it another way, Americans know their \ngovernment will sometimes conduct secret operations, but they\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\ndon't believe the government ought to be writing secret law.\n  The reason we have felt so strongly about this issue of secret law is \nthat it violates the trust Americans place in their government and it \nundermines public confidence in government agencies and institutions, \nmaking it harder to operate effectively. I was on the Intelligence \nCommittee, before Senator Udall joined us, when Americans were pretty \nmuch stunned to learn the Bush administration had been secretly \nclaiming for years that warrantless wiretapping was legal. My own view \nwas that disclosure significantly undermined the public trust in the \nDepartment of Justice and our national intelligence agencies. Our \nphones were ringing off the hook for days when the American people \nlearned about it. The Congress and executive branch had to retrench and \nfigure out how to sort it out.\n  I certainly believe the public will be surprised again when they \nlearn about some of the interpretations of the PATRIOT Act. Government \nofficials cannot hope to indefinitely prevent the American people from \nlearning the truth. This is going to come out, colleagues. It is going \nto come out at some point, just as it came out during the Bush \nadministration about warrantless wiretapping. It is going to come out. \nIt is not going to be helpful to the kind of dialog we want to have \nwith the American people, an open and honest dialog, to just continue \nthis practice of secret law.\n  The reason I am offering or seeking to offer this amendment with \nSenator Udall, Senator Merkley, and other colleagues with respect to \nchanging the practice of secret law is that we have raised this issue \nnumerous times--on the Senate floor, in correspondence, in meetings \nwith senior administration officials--and I have been joined in the \npast by other Senators, and we talked about it with respect to the \nproblem in the news media. But the problem persists and the gap between \nthe public's understanding of the PATRIOT Act and the government's \nsecret interpretation of it remains today. Once information has been \nlabeled ``secret,'' there is a strong bureaucratic tendency--it almost \ngets in the bureaucratic chromosomes to keep it secret and not revisit \nthe original decision.\n  So what Senator Udall and I and colleagues seek to do is correct this \nproblem. We seek to offer an amendment that states that it is entirely \nappropriate for particular intelligence collection techniques to be \nkept secret but that the laws that authorize these techniques should \nnot be kept secret and should instead be transparent to the public. We \nseek to offer an amendment that states that U.S. Government officials \nshould not secretly reinterpret public laws and statutes in a manner \nthat is inconsistent with the public's understanding of these laws or \ndescribe the execution of these laws in a way that misinforms or \nmisleads the public.\n  So under this proposal, the Attorney General and Director of National \nIntelligence would--and we note this--provide a classified report to \nthe congressional intelligence committees. It makes it clear that \nintelligence collection continues to go forward, and our amendment \nwould simply require the Attorney General to publicly lay out the legal \nbasis for the intelligence activities described in the report. The \namendment specifically directs the Attorney General not to describe \nspecific collection, programs, or activities, but simply to fully \ndescribe the legal interpretations and analyses necessary to understand \nthe government's official interpretation of the law.\n  Let me close--I see colleagues waiting to speak--and say that we can \nhave honest and legitimate disagreements about exactly how broad \nintelligence collection authorities ought to be, and members of the \npublic do not expect to know all of the details about how those \nauthorities are used, but I hope each Senator would agree that the law \nitself should not be kept secret and that the government should always \nbe open and honest with the American people about what the law means. \nAll that Senator Udall and I seek to do, along with other colleagues, \nis to restore some of that openness and honesty in an area where it is \nnow needed. I hope colleagues on the floor of the Senate and in the \nObama administration will join in that effort.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to briefly comment on yesterday's \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to S.1038, the extension of the \namendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday I was attending the funeral of a very close \nfamily friend who passed away on Friday. However, I wish to express my \nsupport for the motion to proceed and the extensions themselves. I \nbelieve these extensions, section 6001 (a) of the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act, and sections 206 and 215 of the USA \nPATRIOT Act, continue to provide the right balance between safety and \nindividual rights.\n  I understand those with concerns about the breadth and scope of this \nlaw and believe it is important to continue to ask these questions and \nexamine the limits and extent of these amendments as well as other \naspects of the law.\n  In the wake of bin Laden's recent killing, the importance and \nsignificance of our intelligence resources are without question. Our \nintelligence community must have the necessary tools at its disposal to \nprotect us from the threat of terrorism. This legislation helps clarify \nwhat is legal and proper, and I believe strikes a balance between \nprioritizing our safety without trampling individual rights.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate conducted a \nprocedural vote on whether it would begin deliberation on S. 1038, the \nPATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011.\n  Due to inclement weather, my flight from Cleveland returned to \nCleveland, and I was unable to make this vote. However, if I had been \nin attendance, I would have voted ``yea.''\n  I have long expressed concerns about the PATRIOT Act, specifically \nabout its scope and effectiveness. For too long, Americans have been \nasked to cede their constitutional rights in the name of national \nsecurity. There is no question that our law enforcement authorities \nneed the tools to fight terrorism and keep Americans safe, but security \nis not a zero sum game. Indeed, it is certainly possible to extend the \nPATRIOT Act while building in some additional checks and balances. But \nthis extension does not include them.\n  Despite my misgivings about this extension, I believe that it is \nimportant that the Senate directly address this legislation that is \nimportant to both our Nation's security and well as our civil \nliberties.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on May 23, 2011, due to my daughter's \ncollege graduation, I was absent for vote No. 75, a motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1038, the USA PATRIOT Sunset \nExtension Act of 2011. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, on May 23 the Senate voted \non a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA \nPATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2011, S. 193. I was necessarily \nabsent for this vote. Had I been able to vote, I would have voted \n``aye.'' The act will extend sections 206 and 215 of the Patriot Act \nand section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct, IRTPA, for 4 more years before they expire on May 27. The PATRIOT \nAct, with these provisions, has provided vital tools and resources to \nour counterterrorism professionals that have enabled them to disrupt \ndozens of active terrorist plots. By empowering our counterterrorism \nprofessionals to do their jobs, we can continue to disrupt and prevent \nterrorist attacks in the homeland and abroad. I voted for the 90-day \nextension of these three provisions in February and I look forward to \nvoting on final passage of the long-term extension this week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Israel and Palestine\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, on Thursday, in a speech on the Middle \nEast, President Obama said:\n\n       We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be \n     based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps so that \n     secure and\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\n     recognized borders are established for both states.\n\n  While the President has since sought to revise or clarify his \nremarks, it is valuable to remind ourselves what a retreat to the pre-\n1967 boundaries would mean for the security of Israel.\n  After Israel declared independence in 1948, it was invaded by five \nneighboring armies, and an armistice line was subsequently established \nin 1949. This line is known as the Green Line. While some refer to it \nas a border, it was never officially recognized as an international \nborder.\n  If Israel were forced to retreat to the Green Line--its pre-1967 \nboundary--Israel would be only 9 miles wide at its narrowest point. \nSuch close borders are untenable today and would subject Israel's \npopulation to great and grave danger.\n  Following the Six Day War, U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 \naffirmed Israel's right to secure and recognized borders. As Robert \nSatloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy points out, \ncalls for Israel to withdraw to those ``secure and recognized'' borders \nhave never been interpreted as being synonymous with the pre-1967 \nboundaries. A quick look at a map of Israel will explain why these \nboundaries cannot be secure.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu today, in a joint meeting of Congress, \nreminded us that ``Israel needs unique security arrangements because of \nits unique size.'' Two-thirds of Israel's population and infrastructure \nlies within a 60-mile strip along the Mediterranean coastline. Tel Aviv \nwould only be 11 miles away from a Palestinian state with its border as \nthe Green Line, and Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's largest and busiest, \nwould be a mere 4 miles away. It would only take one rocket fired at \nBen Gurion for the entire airport to shut down, isolating Israel from \nthe rest of the world.\n  With the Green Line as its border, the dangers to Israel come not \nonly because of the short distances between major Israeli cities and a \nPalestinian state, but also from the geography of the land. The 60-mile \nstrip along Israel's coastline lies below the hilly heights of the West \nBank. With control of the high terrain, terrorists could easily target \nand terrorize much of Israel's population just as they have from Gaza \nbut with even more deadly accuracy.\n  When Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Israel's leaders \nhad hoped the Palestinians would demonstrate they could live peacefully \nwith Israel. Instead, Hamas assumed power and Israelis living in the \nsouthern part of Israel have had thousands of rockets and mortar \nattacks directed at them. So far this year, more than 300 rockets and \nmortars have been fired from Gaza, terrorizing countless families in \nIsrael.\n  The threats to Israel from a Palestinian state with its border as the \nGreen Line are clearly understood in this context--especially since \nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party inked an \naccord with Hamas to form a unity government earlier this month. \nAlthough welcomed by President Abbas, Hamas still calls for the \ndestruction of the State of Israel. The United States designated Hamas \na terrorist organization in 1997. It has killed more than 500 innocent \ncivilians, including dozens of Americans.\n  The United States does not negotiate with terrorists, and we should \nnot expect or ask Israel to do so either. Instead of calling for \nnegotiations based on boundaries that leave Israel vulnerable to \nattack, the President should have insisted the Palestinians prove they \nare ready to be responsible and peaceful neighbors. As Prime Minister \nNetanyahu said:\n\n       The Palestinian Authority must choose either peace with \n     Israel or peace with Hamas. There is no possibility for peace \n     with both.\n\n  Israel's security must come first. Any efforts to force Israel to \nwithdraw to its pre-1967 boundaries--the 1949 armistice line--would \nundermine Israel's security and threaten the future of any peace talk.\n  In 2004, the Senate overwhelmingly passed S. Res. 393, which endorsed \nU.S. policy for a Middle East peace process. In particular, the Senate \nsupported a statement that said:\n\n       In light of realities on the ground, including already \n     existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic \n     to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will \n     be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.\n\n  I believe it is important for the United States to again oppose any \nplan to force Israel to withdraw to those 1949 boundaries. Borders \nbetween Israel and a Palestinian state should be decided only by Israel \nand Palestinian leaders through direct negotiations. Borders should not \nbe a precondition set for negotiations by the President of the United \nStates or anyone else. As Prime Minister Netanyahu said today: ``Peace \ncannot be imposed.''\n  Since recognizing Israel 11 minutes after its founding in 1948, our \ntwo countries have worked side by side to advance democracy and peace \nand stability. Israel is our staunchest ally in a volatile part of the \nworld. We cannot now turn our backs on Israel by forcing it to take a \nposition in negotiations that would endanger its very existence.\n  I oppose any plan or effort to force Israel back to those 1949 \narmistice lines and encourage my colleagues to work to see that is not \nthe case. I ask my colleagues to support that position as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working for several days--I \nhave been working on it for a lot longer than several days--but for \nseveral days publicly on a process to move forward with the PATRIOT \nAct. We have worked over the last several days to work something out \nthat is an excellent compromise. Is this bill something everybody in \nthe Senate likes or everybody in the House likes? The answer is no. But \nwe all know how important it is that we continue this legislation. So \nSenator McConnell and I and Speaker Boehner have agreed on a way to \nmove forward.\n  The alternative is to have a long long-term extension that the House \nwould send us and I don't think that would be to anyone's benefit, so \nwe are moving forward. I have tried to do it with the bill that we \ninvoked cloture on yesterday. I have had many conversations with \nSenator Paul and others, but principally him, and tried to come up with \na process to allow Senator Paul to offer amendments--and others to \noffer amendments; it is not just him. I have been unsuccessful.\n  I understand Senator Paul's exasperation because this is something \nthat is extremely important to him and there was every desire, from my \nperspective and I think that of this body, to have a full and complete \ndebate on the PATRIOT Act. But the Senate does not always work that \nway.\n  There have been a lot of things that have gotten in the way and the \ntime is suddenly upon us. We have to complete this legislation by \nmidnight on Thursday. We cannot let the PATRIOT Act expire. I have a \nresponsibility to try to get this bill done as soon as possible, in \nspite of the fact that some of my Senators and some Republican Senators \nwould rather I did it some other way at some other time. But I can't do \nthat. I have to get this done.\n  We know, since bin Laden was killed, that there has been a lot of \ninformation discovered from him about what he did. One thing that is \nvery clear is that he had instructed all of his lieutenants to focus \nall of their attention on the United States and its assets. So we \ncannot let this expire and I am going to do everything I can to make \nsure this does not happen.\n  Senator Paul and I have tried to work out something. He feels \nstrongly about at least three of his amendments. I say, even though he \nand I disagree on a number of things politically, I have found in his \ntime here in the Senate, as it relates to me, he is a very pleasant man \nwith strong feelings. I have only the highest regard for him and I am \nsorry I cannot make this system we have in the Senate more in keeping \nwith his desires to get things done. But as he will learn over the \nyears, it is always difficult to get what you want in the Senate. It \ndoesn't mean you won't get it, but sometimes you have to wait and get \nit done at some subsequent time.\n  Senator Paul has been very upfront with me. He has never hidden a \npunch.\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nHe said: I feel strongly about a number of these amendments and I am \nnot going to agree to let this go forward unless I have these \namendments, and he has been very reasonable. He has brought his number \ndown from 11 to 3 or 4 and I appreciate that. But the time has come for \nme to take some action.\n  Again, I repeat, I do not have the luxury of waiting for a better \ntime. However, I would like to be able to allow the Senator from \nKentucky to give a few of his stem-winding speeches. He does a very \ngood job presenting himself. But in order to expedite what I think is \nso important to continue the country's intelligence operations, I am \ngoing to move to table the pending motion to proceed to S. 1038. \nFollowing that vote, I am going to ask the Senate to proceed to a \nmessage received from the House earlier today. I will then move to \nconcur with the amendment which will be the extension of the PATRIOT \nAct and I will file cloture on that motion.\n  Mr. President, I move to table and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL (when his name was called).

Mr. President, I rise to address the 4-year extension of \nthe PATRIOT Act and to oppose that extension if the bill is not \nmodified.\n  I want to take us back to the principles on which our Nation was \nfounded and, indeed, before our Declaration of Independence and before \nour Constitution when there was a deep tradition of the right of \nprivacy. Let's take William Pitt's declaration in 1763. He said:\n\n       The poorest may, in his cottage, bid his defiance to all \n     the forces of the Crown . . . the storm may enter; the rain \n     may enter. . . . But the King of England may not enter.\n\n  It is the philosophy embedded in William Pitt's declaration of the \nsanctity of a man's home that underwrote the principle of the fourth \namendment. That reads as follows:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  The fourth amendment is powerful protection of personal privacy from \nthe overreach of government. How does that compare in contrast to the \nPATRIOT Act that is before us?\n  Let me tell you the standard that is in the PATRIOT Act for the \ngovernment to seize your papers, to search your papers, and that \nstandard is simply ``relevant'' to an ``investigation.'' Relevant to an \ninvestigation? That is the legal standard set out in the PATRIOT Act. \nThat is a standard that was written to be as broad and low as possible. \nWhat does it mean to be ``relevant'' to an investigation? It certainly \nisn't something as strong as probable cause, which is in the fourth \namendment. It certainly isn't describing the place to be searched, the \npersons and things to be seized. Indeed, the word ``relevant'' doesn't \nhave a foundation of legal tradition that provides any boundaries at \nall.\n  Let's take the term ``investigation.'' ``Investigation'' is in the \neye of the beholder. I want to look into something, so that is an \ninvestigation. What happens to these words in the PATRIOT Act, in the \nsection of the PATRIOT Act that addresses the sweeping powers to \ninvestigate Americans down to the books they check out, their medical \nrecords, and their private communications? Quite simply, there is a \nprocess in theory in which a court, known as the FISA Court, makes a \ndetermination, but they make the determination upon this standard--that \nthis standard is ``relevant to an investigation.''\n  Now, the interpretation of that clause is done in secret. I would \ndefy you to show me a circumstance where a secret interpretation of a \nvery minimal standard is tightened in that secret process. But we don't \nknow because we are not being told.\n  This is why I support Senator Wyden's amendment. Senator Wyden has \nsaid we should not have secret law--secret interpretation of clauses \nthat may result in the opposite of what we believe is being done. That \nis a very important amendment. But that amendment will not be debated \non the floor of the Senate. It won't be debated because a very clever \nmechanism has just been put into play to prevent amendments from being \noffered and debated on the floor of the Senate on the 4-year extension \nof the PATRIOT Act. Quite frankly, I am very disturbed by that \nmechanism--a parliamentary move in which a House message is brought \nover and the regular bill is tabled, and that message will then have \nthe regular PATRIOT Act put into it as a privileged motion, and it will \nbe returned to the House. The effect therein is, because the tree has \nbeen filled, which is parliamentary-speak for ``no amendments will be \nallowed,'' we won't get to debate Senator Wyden's amendment.\n  There are a number of Senators who have proposed to change this \nstandard--the standard ``relevant to an investigation''--to make it a \nlegally significant standard and make sure it is not being secretly \ninterpreted to mean almost nothing. But we won't have a\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\ndebate in this Senate over changing that low and insignificant standard \ninto a meaningful legal standard with teeth in it, that has court cases \nbehind what it means and interpretations that will protect us.\n  There is no question that every Member of this Chamber has an \nenormous sense of responsibility in the security of our Nation. In that \nsense, there is significant feeling on every person's part that we need \nto enable our intelligence services, our military, to do the necessary \nwork to protect our Nation. But that does not mean we should avoid \nhaving a debate about whether the PATRIOT Act, as written today, \nwithout an amendment, rolls over the top of the fourth amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n\n  We can have both personal privacy and a high standard, as set out in \nthe fourth amendment, for the seizure of papers and security. Those two \nthings are not at war with each other. We have had two centuries in \nthis Nation of embracing the twins of personal privacy and security. We \nhave made that work. We can continue to make it work.\n  I rise in protest about the process unfolding in the Senate in which \namendments will not be presented and will not be debated. I rise to say \nthe fourth amendment matters; that it sets a significant standard \nagainst unreasonable seizures and searches, and that the PATRIOT Act, \nas written, does not provide a clear implementation of the fourth \namendment, a clear protection of the fourth amendment.\n  I will close by noting it has been nearly 250 years since William \nPitt declared:\n\n       The poorest may, in his cottage, bid his defiance to all \n     the forces of the Crown . . . the storm may enter; the rain \n     may enter . . . but the King of England may not enter.\n\n  Let us have a debate in this Chamber about modifications that protect \nour security but that hold faith with the principle William Pitt \nenunciated and with the principles we have adopted in the fourth \namendment to the Constitution; that the right of the people against \nunreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, the chairman of the House \nBudget Committee, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, came to Chicago to speak to \nthe Economic Club and to articulate his vision--the Republican vision--\non how to reduce our Nation's debt. It was an interesting speech \nbecause Congressman Ryan's budget--the Republican budget, which passed \nthe House of Representatives--has become an object of debate and \ncontroversy.\n  I know Congressman Ryan. We served together on the President's \ndeficit commission. I know he is a very thoughtful and learned and \nsincere individual, but I certainly have to say his approach to dealing \nwith our budget deficit is one I believe falls short of the mark. It \nwould seem to me, if we are serious about our deficit--and we should \nbe--we should acknowledge the fact that for every $1 we spend in \nWashington, we borrow 40 cents. That is unsustainable, and we have to \naddress it.\n  We should also look at the grim, recent reality of our budget. When \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton left office a little over 10 years \nago and handed the keys to the White House over to President George W. \nBush, the accumulated net debt of America was $5 trillion--$5 trillion. \nEight years later, in the next transfer of power, when President George \nW. Bush transferred power to President Obama, America's accumulated net \ndebt had reached a new level of $11 trillion, more than doubled in an \n8-year period of time.\n  Ask yourself: How could that occur? Well, the answers are fairly \nobvious. When you wage two wars and don't pay for them, when you cut \ntaxes in the midst of a war--the first time that has ever happened in \nour history--and when you pass programs that are not paid for, it adds \nto our debt. That is what happened.\n  President Obama inherited a dramatic increase in the national debt \nand a very weak economy, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. \nNow we find we are even deeper in debt--closer to $14 trillion because \nof this recession, despite the best efforts of Congress and the \nPresident to turn it around. We know that has to change.\n  The major creditor of the United States is China, and it is also our \nmajor competitor. Those two realities force us to look honestly at this \ndeficit. I take exception to the approach the Republicans use in their \ndeficit reduction plan, because when I took a look at Congressman \nRyan's budget--the Republican budget--I find, at the end of the day, it \nnominally cuts spending by $4 trillion over a 10-year period of time. \nYet it only cuts $8 billion a year out of the Defense budget. The \nDefense budget of the United States is over $500 billion every year, \nand they could only find $8 billion a year to cut? Not a very serious \nundertaking.\n  They raise no new revenues to help pay down the debt, while they \ndramatically cut taxes for the wealthiest people and companies in \nAmerica. In the name of deficit reduction, the Republican budget would \ncut the top tax rate of the wealthiest individuals and corporations to \n25 percent. The Tax Policy Center estimates this would reduce tax \nrevenues by $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, and virtually all the \ntax savings from that change would go to households making an annual \nincome of over $200,000 a year.\n  What does a multitrillion dollar tax cut have to do with deficit \nreduction? Congressman Ryan, in his speech in Chicago, criticized the \nDemocrats for engaging in class warfare, as if it is somehow \ninappropriate to point out that the Republican budget proposes a \nmassive shift in wealth from the poor and middle class to those who are \nbetter off. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway--seer of Omaha--\nanswered that criticism best a few years ago when he said:\n\n       There is class warfare, all right. But it is my class, the \n     rich class, that is making war and winning.\n\n  That is what happens with the Republican budget.\n  Then there is the issue of health care--an issue near and dear to \nevery single American. A serious budget plan would address the largest \ncause of the projected long-term debt for the Federal Government--\nhealth care--by allowing dozens of cost-containment provisions in the \naffordable care act to take effect and then by finding even more to \nreduce the cost to the system. But the House Republican budget plan \ndoes the opposite. It repeals all the cost-containment mechanisms, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office says in so doing will raise the \ndebt of America.\n  Then the Republican budget goes a step further. It ends Medicare and \nMedicaid, as we know them--programs that have served America. Their \nbudget would transform programs that seniors and the poor count on \ntoday to provide adequate health insurance and to programs that help to \ncover just some of the costs, leaving the rest of the bills to the \nfamilies, individuals, and State governments. All that the Republican \nbudget plan does under the banner of health care reform is to shift the \ncost of health care from American families who are paying taxes to \nother American families who are paying taxes in the private market. It \nwould do nothing to reduce health care costs as a whole.\n  It is fair to ask me at this point: Well, if you are going to \ncriticize the Republican budget, what do you suggest? I will tell you \nwhat I suggest. I have sat around for 4-plus months now, with five of \nmy Senate colleagues in both political parties, working on these ideas. \nWhat I think is the path to a reasonable deficit reduction is one that \nliterally involves shared sacrifice, where every American has to be \nprepared to step up and accept the reality that things will change.\n  There is one demographic reality that overshadows this conversation. \nSince January 1 of this year, every day 9,000 Americans reach the age \nof 65. That trend will continue for 19 more years. That is the baby \nboom generation. If you will do the math, you will see a dramatic \nincrease in people under\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nSocial Security and Medicare, as those children born immediately after \nWorld War II reach retirement age. That is a reality.\n  What do we do about it? First, we make sure Social Security can be \ncounted on. Social Security does not add one penny to our Nation's \ndebt. It is a separate fund. It will make every promised payment for \nanother 25 years, with a cost-of-living adjustment, but then runs into \ntrouble. You will see a reduction--if we don't do something in the 26th \nyear--by over 20 percent for each benefit payment. Unacceptable. So we \nshould think in honest terms about what we do today--small changes we \ncan make today in Social Security--which, when played out over 25 \nyears, like the miracle of compound interest, will buy us an even \nlonger life in Social Security.\n  I think there are reasonable ways to do that. For example, when we \npassed Social Security reform in 1983, we said 90 percent of wages in \nAmerica should be subject to Social Security taxation. Over the years, \nby not raising the ceiling on wages that could be taxed for Social \nSecurity, we have fallen behind in the 90-percent standard. I think we \nare close to 84 percent now. If we were to go back to the 90-percent \nstandard, which I think is reasonable, and raise the eligible income in \nAmerica for Social Security deductions up to 90 percent, it will move \nus toward solvency--more solvency--for Social Security. It is money \nthat will not be used to reduce the deficit but will be used to invest \nin Social Security. I think that makes sense.\n  There are other changes we can do that are reasonable. We also have \nto look at Medicare and Medicaid and acknowledge the obvious. The cost \nof health care is going up too fast. We can't keep up with it, neither \ncan State governments, local governments, businesses, unions or \nfamilies. So the cost containment in health care reform is just the \nbeginning, but we need to continue the conversation, and we need \nspending cuts.\n  Let's be very honest about it. We have taken a pretty significant cut \nin domestic discretionary spending just this year--even more than the \nBowles-Simpson commission envisioned. There is some risk associated \nwith spending cuts in the midst of a recession. But now we need to ask \nthe defense or military side of discretionary spending to also make \nsome sacrifice.\n  I think one obvious way is to start bringing our troops home from \noverseas--bring them home from Iraq. It is estimated it costs us $1 \nmillion per year for every soldier in the field--for all the support \nthat goes into training and sustaining and protecting our men and women \nin uniform, which we must do. It is an expensive commitment. As we \nreduce our troop commitments overseas, the amount of money being spent \nthrough the Pentagon will be reduced as well.\n  We need to take a close look at all the private contractors working \nfor the Pentagon. We had a hearing of this deficit commission and asked \nthe expert: Can you tell us how many employees there are at the \nDepartment of Defense--civilian, military--how many private contractors \nare working for the Department of Defense? The expert said: I have no \nidea. I can't even get close to giving you an estimate, but it is a \ndramatically larger number. We can reduce that spending, and we should.\n  The point I am making is that after we have taken care of the \nentitlement programs and the spending issues, that isn't enough. We \nneed to talk about revenue--revenue that can be brought into deficit \nreduction. Every year our Tax Code gives deductions and credits, \nexclusions and special treatment that account for $1.1 trillion that \nwould otherwise flow to the Treasury. Instead, it is money that isn't \npaid into taxes and into our government. We can reduce that tax \nexpenditure and do it in a fair fashion by reforming the Tax Code in a \nmeaningful way--as the Bowles-Simpson commission suggested, bring down \ntax rates as part of this conversation.\n  That, to me, is a reasonable approach. It parallels what was done in \nthe Bowles-Simpson Commission, putting everything on the table and \nreducing our deficit over the next 10 years by at least $4 trillion. I \nthink we can do it, and we should do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  The Republican budget plan, unfortunately, takes the wrong approach. \nThe House Republicans have proposed, among other things, a fundamental \nchange in how we pay for health care. It turns Medicaid into a block \ngrant program, and it eliminates the affordable health care act. One of \nthe sources of pride we all shared was the notion that 30 million \nAmericans currently uninsured would have insurance protection under the \naffordable health care act. What the Republicans do in repealing it is \nto add to the number of uninsured in America, thus making it clear they \nhave no place to turn in their extreme situations but to Medicaid. So \non top of eliminating the affordable health care act, adding to the \nnumber of uninsured Americans, the Republican plan then limits the \namount of money to spend on Medicaid. The net result is more and more \npeople uninsured seeking Medicaid help with no funds to pay for their \nmedical treatment. That is not a good vision for the future of America.\n  We had a presentation today at our Democratic caucus lunch. The \npresentation was made by Senator Kent Conrad, the chairman of our \nBudget Committee. He and Senator Stabenow of Michigan talked about what \nthe Medicare changes would mean in America, and what it basically means \nis the average senior citizen, under the Republican budget plan, will \nsee their Medicare benefits cut and will find their out-of-pocket \nexpenses to maintain current Medicare protection double--over $12,000 a \nyear.\n  There are many seniors in Oregon and Illinois and across the Nation \non fixed incomes. That is not a reasonable alternative--$1,000 a month \non Medicare insurance premiums? That is the Republican budget plan. It \nis not a reasonable way to deal with our future challenges in health \ncare.\n  We will have a chance to vote this week on the Republican budget \nplan, and it will be interesting to see how many on the other side of \nthe aisle want to support the approaches I have just described. \nAlready, some of them have announced they will not. They think it goes \ntoo far. I do too.\n  I hope we can reject the House Republican plan on a bipartisan basis, \nbut then let's come together in a bipartisan fashion and try to find a \nreasonable way to deal with this deficit. I hope we will use the \nBowles-Simpson Commission as a starting point because I think it is a \ngood one. Let's maintain some fealty toward our values, our values as a \ncountry that take care of the vulnerable whom we will always have among \nus, and make a pledge that our Tax Code will be progressive so working \nfamilies have a fighting chance, and try to at least share the burden \nof sacrifice in a reasonable and just manner.\n  Those who are better off should pay more. Those who are less well off \nshould pay less. I don't think that is an extreme position. I think it \nis a sensible, humane position.\n  Our debate begins this week on the budget. We have a great challenge \nahead of us. I hope some of the work we did on the deficit commission \nwill help us reach a positive conclusion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in honoring the \n20th anniversary of the Gang Resistance Education and Training--GREAT--\nProgram and to commend law enforcement agencies across the nation for \ntheir dedication to educating America's youth in gang resistance.\n  Founded in 1991 with the support of Congress, the GREAT Program is a \nschool-based curriculum led by law enforcement officers to instruct \nstudents\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\non effective ways to avoid gang involvement and prevent youth violence \nand delinquent behavior. This program provides elementary and middle \nschool students with the information and skills necessary to say no to \ngangs, to resolve conflict without the use of violence, and to set \npositive goals for themselves--helping America's youth take important \nsteps in creating a future for themselves that does not include gangs \nor violence.\n  With western roots, the first GREAT classes were taught in Phoenix, \nAZ, in September of 1991. Over the past 20 years, GREAT has trained \nmore than 12,000 law enforcement officers and nearly 6 million children \nhave been educated in gang resistance and violence prevention. The \nprogram has also built key partnerships with nationally recognized \norganizations, such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the \nNational Association of Police Athletic Leagues. These partnerships \nencourage positive relationships among the community, parents, schools, \nand law enforcement officers and help America's students build positive \nties with law enforcement officers.\n  In March of 1994, my home State of Oregon received its first GREAT \nclasses at Parkrose Middle School in Northeast Portland. Since its \ninception in Oregon, Portland Police Bureau officers have taught over \n1,400 GREAT classes with nearly 43,000 graduating students. Portland \nPolice Bureau officers have strengthened families to by participating \nin the GREAT families program, which has educated over 80 families \nintegrating nearly 300 family members.\n  Additionally, I would like to recognize that the Portland Police \nBureau was chosen by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms as headquarters for the GREAT Program's Western Region, which \nis one of five regional training sites.\n  I am proud to honor the GREAT Program's 20th anniversary, the \nthousands of lives it has touched, and share its ongoing commitment to \nstrengthening our communities through youth-violence prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/24/senate-section/article/S3266-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         COGSWELL, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. \nFrom June 24 to 26, the residents of Cogswell, ND, will gather to \ncelebrate their community's founding.\n  Cogswell townsite was founded at the junction of the Soo Line \nRailroad and the Milwaukee Road Railroad. Some believe it was named for \na Soo Line Railroad official, while others say it was named for MAJ \nThomas Cogswell, a Revolutionary War hero.\n  Located in Sargent County, the citizens of Cogswell are proud to \nmention the many reasons their community is so strong. The city offers \ngenuine smalltown living with a post office, bar and grill, repair \nstores, and construction companies. The people of Cogswell are known \nfor their exceptional work ethic and caring attitude toward others, \nmaking it a great place to live and raise a family.\n  In honor of the city's 125th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized an all-school reunion, school reunion supper, street dances, \na parade, 5K run/walk, games, classic car show, quilt show, talent \nshow, and other celebratory events.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nCogswell, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Cogswell and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to support and preserve the \n     Navajo Code Talkers' legacy and their substantial \n     contribution to the nation; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, the few, living Navajo Code Talkers are \n     undertaking a multi-year project to build an educational, \n     historical, and humanitarian facility that will bring pride \n     to Native American and non-native American communities alike;\n       Whereas, this project will educate both young and old and \n     conserve the instruments of freedom gifted to the American \n     people by an awe-inspiring group of young Navajo men who \n     served the country during World War II;\n       Whereas, during World War II, these modest young Navajo men \n     fashioned from the Navajo language the only unbreakable code \n     ever recorded in military history;\n       Whereas, these Navajo radio operators transmitted the code \n     throughout the dense jungles and exposed beachheads of the \n     Pacific Theater from 1942 to 1945, passing over 800 error-\n     free messages in 48 hours at Iwo Jima alone;\n       Whereas, the bravery and ingenuity of these young Navajo \n     men gave the United States and Allied Forces the upper hand \n     they so desperately needed in the Pacific, hastened the war's \n     end, and assured victory for the United States;\n       Whereas, after being sworn to secrecy for 23 years after \n     World War II, these young Navajo men eventually came to be \n     known as Navajo Code Talkers and were honored by President \n     George W. Bush more than 50 years after the war with \n     congressional gold and silver medals in 2001;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers are now in their eighties \n     and, with fewer than 50 remaining from the original 400, the \n     urgency to capture and share their stories and memorabilia \n     from their service in World War II is critical;\n       Whereas, these American treasures and revered elders of the \n     Navajo Nation have come together to tell their story, one \n     that has never been heard, from their own hearts and in their \n     own words;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' heroic story of an \n     ancient language, valiant people, and a decisive victory that \n     changed the path of modern history is the greatest story \n     never told;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers ultimately envision a \n     lasting memorial, the Navajo Code Talkers' Museum and \n     Veterans Center, on donated private land;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' mission is to create a \n     place where their service will inspire others to achieve \n     excellence and instill core values of pride, discipline, and \n     honor in all those who visit the Center; and\n       Whereas, through the lead efforts of the Navajo Code \n     Talkers' Foundation and many partners and individuals, the \n     Navajo Code' Talkers' legacy, history, language, and code \n     will be preserved to benefit all future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress, the Department of the Interior, \n     the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, the \n     Department of Agriculture, the State Department, and the \n     Department of Energy to support and preserve the Navajo Code \n     Talkers' remarkable legacy; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be presented to \n     the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-19.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to lift the freeze on \n     longer combination vehicles, so that states may conduct test \n     programs to evaluate routes, configurations, and operating \n     conditions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the American West encompasses a huge land mass of \n     approximately 2.4 million square miles, or over two-thirds of \n     the entire nation;\n       Whereas, the vast distances across the West clearly \n     illustrate the need for efficient surface freight movement of \n     goods throughout this area;\n       Whereas, one of the most significant ways to improve \n     freight system performance is through the use of more \n     efficient truck and truck combinations;\n       Whereas, the efficiency of the United States' freight \n     transportation has fallen far behind other developed nations;\n       Whereas, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union have \n     embraced up-to-date truck configurations;\n       Whereas, operation of these more productive vehicles, more \n     commonly known as longer combination vehicles (LCVs), has \n     been frozen in the United States by federal law since 1991;\n       Whereas, in a study requested by the Western Governor's \n     Association, the Federal Highway Administration found that \n     limited increase in the use of LCVs in 13 western states \n     would reduce heavy truck vehicle miles traveled in 2010 by \n     25%, reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 12%, save \n     shippers $2 billion a year, reduce pavement costs by as much \n     as 4% over 20 years, and reduce highway noise by 10%;\n       Whereas, a recent study in Ontario found the widespread use \n     of LCVs there would eliminate 750,000 truck trips per year, \n     remove 2,800 trucks per day from the roads in and around \n     Toronto, and reduce greenhouse gases by 151 kilotons per \n     year;\n       Whereas, a Canadian federal government study indicated that \n     LCVs have 60% fewer crashes than single trailer vehicles; and\n       Whereas, the Western States provide an excellent test case \n     for size capacity increases since LCVs are already in use on \n     many western highways: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     strongly urges the United States Congress to lift the freeze \n     on longer combination vehicles in the states of Colorado, \n     Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, \n     Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and \n     Wyoming, giving these states the flexibility to establish and \n     operate pilot test programs to evaluate longer combination \n     vehicle routes, configurations, and operating conditions; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of Transportation, the United States Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the United States \n     House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and to \n     the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-21. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah recognizing Utah native Philo T. \n     Farnsworth as the inventor of television; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, few inventors have impacted the world as much as \n     has Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth;\n       Whereas, Philo T. Farnsworth has deep roots in Beaver, \n     Utah, where he was born August 19, 1906, in a log cabin;\n       Whereas, when he was 12, Philo T. Farnsworth's family moved \n     to a farm in Rigby, Idaho, where he was fascinated by the \n     electricity that powered his new home;\n       Whereas, Farnsworth was intrigued by mechanical and \n     electrical technology and managed to convert his mother's \n     hand-powered washing machine to an electric-powered \n     appliance;\n       Whereas, as a youth living in Beaver, Utah, Farnsworth won \n     a national contest for a theft-proof car lock;\n       Whereas, at the age of 14, Philo T. Farnsworth startled one \n     of his high school teachers by sharing with him a diagram of \n     an Electronic Image Dissector, a key component in his \n     eventual invention of television;\n       Whereas, at age 16, Farnsworth's father died of pneumonia \n     and Farnsworth had to care for his mother and four siblings;\n       Whereas, after spending a few years in the United States \n     Navy, Farnsworth was honorably discharged and once again \n     pursued his interest in electronics;\n       Whereas, Farnsworth found investors who were not only \n     willing to help him pursue his work in electronics but also \n     provided a laboratory in Los Angeles where Farnsworth was \n     able to conduct important experiments;\n       Whereas, before relocating to California, Farnsworth \n     married Elma ``Pem'' Gardner, the sister of a close friend of \n     his;\n       Whereas, within a few months after arriving in California, \n     Farnsworth's success led him to apply for several patents for \n     his designs and models;\n       Whereas, on September 7, 1927, at a laboratory in San \n     Francisco, Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube \n     transmitted its first image, a straight line;\n       Whereas, in 1928, Farnsworth gave the first demonstration \n     of his television system to the press, and after several \n     improvements, gave his first demonstration to the public in \n     1934;\n       Whereas, Farnsworth formed his own company, prevailed in \n     key patent lawsuits against competitors, and developed other \n     important inventions, including a process for sterilizing \n     milk using radio waves and a fog-penetrating beam for ships \n     and airplanes;\n       Whereas, in 1938, Farnsworth established the Farnsworth \n     Television and Radio Corporation, which was in turn purchased \n     by International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) in 1951;\n       Whereas, while in the employ of ITT, Farnsworth developed \n     many more inventions, including a defense early warning \n     signal, submarine detection devices, radar calibration \n     equipment, an infrared telescope, and a PPI Projector, which \n     allowed safe control of air traffic from the ground and was a \n     forerunner of today's air traffic control system;\n       Whereas, later in life, the Farnsworths relocated to Utah, \n     where Philo passed away in 1971;\n       Whereas, for many years after his death, Elma Farnsworth \n     worked hard to help her deceased husband retain his rightful \n     place in history;\n       Whereas, crediting his wife's contribution to his life's \n     work, Farnsworth once stated, ``My wife and I started this \n     TV'';\n       Whereas, in 1999, Time Magazine included Farnsworth in the \n     ``Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century'';\n       Whereas, the log cabin where Philo T. Farnsworth was born \n     has been restored and can be visited by the public; and\n       Whereas, a statue of Philo T. Farnsworth is one of two \n     statues representing the state of Utah in the National \n     Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol, a \n     second statue of Farnsworth stands in the Utah State Capitol, \n     and a third statue stands in his hometown of Beaver: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, recognize the life and \n     contributions of Philo T. Farnsworth, Utah native, the \n     inventor of television and of many other inventions that have \n     benefitted millions of people around the world; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation, the Farnsworth family, the Utah \n     Travel Council, AAA, the tourism directors of each county in \n     Utah, Beaver County, and Beaver City.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-22. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging the federal government to protect \n     the communications spectrum that allows Utah's translator \n     system to provide free television access across the state; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the President of the United States has directed \n     the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     to consider removing channels 32 to 51 from the current FCC \n     channels 14 to 51 Television Broadcast Authorization;\n       Whereas, this action would devastate off-air television \n     reception to urban areas and also cause disruption to off-air \n     viewers nationwide;\n       Whereas, according to FCC records as listed in FCC MD \n     Docket No. 03-185 (FCC 10-172), page 26, dated September 17, \n     2010, 4,518 television translator stations, 567 Class A LPTV \n     stations, 2,227 LPTV stations, and 11 TV Booster stations are \n     now on file;\n       Whereas, according to FCC records, over 4,500 television \n     translator stations presently provide free over-the-air \n     television to rural communities throughout the nation;\n       Whereas, if this channel repacking were to become a \n     reality, many of these translator stations would no longer \n     remain in operation, requiring viewers to subscribe to either \n     cable or satellite programming;\n       Whereas, Utah has 649 of these television translator \n     stations, and the state's rural viewers would be forced to \n     either pay for subscription television or have no television \n     reception;\n       Whereas, after 40 years of analog broadcasting, the United \n     States Congress mandated the broadcasting industry to make a \n     conversion from analog to digital operation;\n       Whereas, supplying the general public with free over-the-\n     air digital television broadcast signals has been encouraged \n     by elected officials and the FCC;\n       Whereas, since the mandate, all TV Translator and LPTV \n     licensees in the state of Utah have planned, acquired \n     necessary funding, provided engineering, labor, construction, \n     travel, new and upgraded buildings, air-conditioning, new \n     towers, crane services, and extensive FCC licensing to help \n     make the DTV transition possible;\n       Whereas, through cooperation of the state's counties, the \n     University of Utah, the state of Utah, and the Federal \n     Communications Commission, the DTV transition has been made \n     possible;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah has supported the DTV transition \n     through four CIB grants since 2005 in the amount of nearly \n     $9,000,000;\n       Whereas, the University of Utah has supported the DTV \n     transition with a recent federal grant of approximately \n     $2,000,000;\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n       Whereas, Congress developed and funded the coupon program \n     at $1,500,000,000 for a digital to analog converter box \n     program;\n       Whereas, the NTIA, a division of the federal government, \n     currently offers all TV translator and LPTV licensees a \n     reimbursement program for the digital to analog conversion;\n       Whereas, small rural cable companies are beginning to use \n     digital TV translator signals for their systems free of \n     charge instead of paying for satellite feeds;\n       Whereas, repacking would cause eight Salt Lake City primary \n     television stations to find new channels, causing \n     unaffordable consequences to both urban and rural communities \n     in the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, it would be impossible to continue the ``Utah \n     Daisy Chain'' rural digital television translator services if \n     the proposed block of television channels were reclaimed by \n     the FCC, and this action would have a negative local economic \n     impact to the affected counties;\n       Whereas, broadcasters are required by the FCC to \n     participate in the National Emergency Alert System and are \n     also required to make regular tests to assure their systems \n     are always ready to broadcast any local warnings, including \n     flood conditions, high wind warnings, and bad road \n     conditions, and these warnings are automatically \n     retransmitted through television translator stations to also \n     alert rural viewers;\n       Whereas, closed captioning for the deaf is also a mandatory \n     requirement of primary broadcast stations and automatically \n     passes through television translators to rural viewers;\n       Whereas, if these viewers do not have access to any local \n     free over-the-air broadcast signals, they proceed without \n     local warnings or closed captioning for the deaf;\n       Whereas, counties in Utah are presently licensed with the \n     FCC for 649 digital television translators, or 35%, of the \n     nation's digital television translator licenses;\n       Whereas, an additional 173 applications are waiting for \n     final approval at the FCC, and when they are awarded, \n     additional digital channels will be available to the \n     remaining few underserved rural Utah communities;\n       Whereas, the FCC recently passed a rule to allow anyone to \n     operate unlicensed signals on unused channels within the \n     present television bands, while the FCC still requires \n     television translator stations to be licensed in these same \n     bands;\n       Whereas, these unlicensed devices will cause interference \n     to existing digital television services nationwide, and many \n     television translator viewers will possibly be vulnerable \n     with unacceptable interference because they receive their \n     home signals far beyond the FCC protected contours; and\n       Whereas, the federal government should ensure that rural \n     communities in Utah and throughout the nation are not forced \n     to either pay for subscription television service or go \n     without television: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, strongly urge the President of \n     the United States and the Federal Communications Commission \n     (FCC) to not remove channels 32 to 51 from the current \n     existing FCC channels 14 to 51 Television Broadcast \n     Authorization because of its negative impact on off-air \n     television reception in urban areas and to off-air viewers \n     nationwide, including rural viewers, who would be forced to \n     either pay for subscription television or go without \n     television service; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Chairman of the Federal \n     Communications Commission and each commission member, and to \n     the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     withhold funding to the Department of the Interior's Office \n     of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 270\n\n       Whereas, The Department of the Interior's Office of Surface \n     Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSMRE) is considering \n     new sweeping regulations that would cut surface mining \n     production and jobs by 21-30%, cut underground coal mining \n     jobs up to 50%, and risk eliminating over 66,000 direct and \n     indirect jobs nationwide; and\n       Whereas, Beginning in 2003, OSMRE conducted a 5-year \n     process, including public hearings, the submission of \n     thousands of public comments, and preparation of an \n     environmental impact statement, that culminated in final \n     regulations adding significant new environmental protections \n     regarding the placement of excess spoil and clarifying its \n     regulations relating to stream buffer zones pursuant to the \n     Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA); and\n       Whereas, The Secretary of the Interior attempted to avoid a \n     public rulemaking process by asking a court to vacate the \n     2008 OSMRE stream buffer zone rule without public comment as \n     required under the Administrative Procedure Act, but was \n     rebuked by a federal court which ruled that the Secretary may \n     not repeal the stream buffer zone rule without going through \n     a rulemaking process that includes public notice and comment; \n     and\n       Whereas, OSMRE, in its own words, admitted that before any \n     public comments were even received on its proposals, it had \n     ``already decided to change the (stream buffer zone) rule \n     following the change in administrations on January 20, \n     2009''; the Office is calling the new rule the ``stream \n     protection rule'', and it is much broader in scope than the \n     2008 stream buffer zone rule; and\n       Whereas, OSMRE has failed to justify why a new stream \n     protection rule is necessary or to explain the problem that \n     the Office is attempting to fix, and such concerns have been \n     echoed by the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, an \n     organization representing state mining regulators with \n     substantial expertise in SMCRA regulation; and\n       Whereas, OSMRE is inappropriately rushing to complete the \n     rulemaking because of a unilateral settlement agreement with \n     environmental groups, and is committing such flagrant \n     violations of the required National Environmental Policy Act \n     process that 8 of the state cooperating agencies have written \n     to the Office objecting to its quality, completeness and \n     accuracy, as well as calling the document ``nonsensical and \n     difficult to follow'', and ultimately threatening to pull out \n     of the process; and\n       Whereas, The coal mining industry is critical to the \n     economic and social well being of the citizens of Illinois, \n     accounting for over 3,500 direct workers and another 24,500 \n     indirect jobs that have an impact of over $1 billion on the \n     State's economy: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we \n     express serious concern about the scope, justification, and \n     substance of the OSMRE's stream protection rule, as well as \n     about the procedure and process that have been used to adopt \n     that rule; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we call upon OSMRE to immediately suspend \n     work on the environmental impact statement and the stream \n     protection rule until such time as the Office:\n       (1) clearly and publicly articulates why the 2008 \n     regulation has not been implemented and provides specific \n     details regarding each of its provisions and why the Office \n     believes that they are insufficient;\n       (2) provides scientific data and other objective \n     information to justify each and every provision of the new \n     proposal;\n       (3) explains why the Office is contradicting its own annual \n     state inspection reports which indicate good environmental \n     performance and refute the need for this new rule;\n       (4) justifies why a more limited approach would not achieve \n     the objectives of the Office; and\n       (5) surveys all of the state regulatory authorities to \n     determine whether they agree that such significant regulatory \n     changes are necessary; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we also urge Congress to oppose this \n     unwarranted effort by the present Presidential Administration \n     by withholding any further funding for OSMRE for the stream \n     protection rule and environmental impact statement until such \n     time as the Office justifies the need for new rules; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be sent \n     to President Barack Obama, the President pro tempore of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Secretary of the Department of the \n     Interior, and each member of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-24. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to honor longstanding \n     commitments to multiple use public lands management; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, the wise multiple use of the public lands in Utah \n     and in the Western United States is necessary for economic \n     stability, is critical to the state's future, and is an \n     important part of Utah's culture and heritage;\n       Whereas, prudent application of sustainable multiple use \n     principles allows the state's renewable and abundant natural \n     resources to be of value to all Americans, while protecting \n     the many unique and sensitive parts of the state;\n       Whereas, the federal government controls two of every three \n     acres of the state of Utah, second only to Nevada among the \n     Contiguous 48 states;\n       Whereas, the multiple use management of the lands held in \n     common in Utah has contributed to the well being of the state \n     and nation through energy development, mineral development, \n     production of food and fiber, and recreational opportunities;\n       Whereas, the creation of new wealth is tied directly to the \n     land and the judicious development of the state's natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas, ownership and private property rights are the \n     catalyst to increasing wealth and improving society's \n     standard of living, and is a belief central to capitalism and \n     a successful free enterprise system;\n       Whereas, risk and investment capital seek market \n     opportunities that exhibit political and policy stability, \n     the hallmarks of Utah's business climate, but are adversely \n     affected by the political posturing and disregard for state \n     input related to management of 23,000,000 acres of land \n     administered by the United States Department of Interior's \n     Bureau of Land Management;\n       Whereas, Revised Statute 2477, effective for more than 100 \n     years and purposely protected in the Federal Land Policy \n     Management Act of 1976, provided for the development of \n     Utah's natural resources;\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\n       Whereas, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 established the \n     legal obligation and responsibility of the federal government \n     to safeguard livestock grazing rights as part of the cultural \n     and social fabric of the West, ultimately upheld as the \n     ``chiefly valuable for grazing doctrine'';\n       Whereas, generations of economically viable livestock \n     grazing operations in Utah have been forged to families \n     combining private and public land resources that ultimately \n     contribute to local economies and are the catalyst for \n     preserving open space in many rapidly developing areas;\n       Whereas, management of the unreserved federal lands \n     administered by the Interior Department are obligated under \n     the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA) to incorporate \n     into agency management plans ``consistency'' in \n     partnership with state and local planning;\n       Whereas, a fundamental principle espoused by the nation's \n     Founders called for equality among the states and is referred \n     to as the ``Equal Footing Doctrine,'' a principle that calls \n     for each state to enter the Union equal in their sovereign \n     power;\n       Whereas, the Interior Department's ``Treasured Landscapes'' \n     internal planning document reveals an agency bias, and \n     outside influences identified as much as 130,000,000 acres of \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM)-administered lands for \n     special ``Wild Lands'' designation;\n       Whereas, the ``Treasured Landscapes'' internal document \n     also recommends that the Secretary of the Interior circumvent \n     congressional mandates related to wilderness designations, \n     calling for wilderness protection through Presidential \n     Proclamations;\n       Whereas, on December 23, 2010, the Secretary of the \n     Interior announced Secretarial Order 3310, calling for a re-\n     inventory of Bureau of Land Management lands with \n     ``wilderness characteristics'' under a new Secretarial \n     definition of ``Wild Lands'' and diverting funds from \n     critical agency needs;\n       Whereas, the BLM has inventoried lands with wilderness \n     characteristics, following the National Environmental Policy \n     Act requirements, as part of the agency's Resource Management \n     Planning process;\n       Whereas, Secretarial Order 3310 seeks to establish new \n     wilderness study areas in Utah and throughout the West based \n     on the new Wild lands definition and BLM inventory guidance \n     providing the BLM broader authority to stop energy \n     development, livestock grazing; mineral extraction, and \n     recreational activities;\n       Whereas, jobs generated through multiple use activities on \n     the public lands provide family sustaining, well paying jobs \n     to hundreds of thousands of Utahns and are the economic \n     backbone of Utah's rural communities;\n       Whereas, in recent testimony before Congress's House \n     Natural Resources Committee, the Director of the BLM \n     indicated that he lacked the statutory authority to implement \n     the policies of Secretarial Order 3310; and\n       Whereas, the Secretary of the Interior's decision to \n     withdraw from the 2003 Utah--Interior Settlement Agreement is \n     an insult to Utahns, and Secretarial Order 3310 is a \n     violation of the spirit and the letter of the Wilderness Act \n     of 1964, ultimately undermining the goodwill and \n     collaborative efforts currently underway in Utah to find \n     mutually agreeable land use solutions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge the United States Secretary \n     of the Interior to honor the 2003 Settlement Agreement and \n     abandon the ``Wild Lands'' wilderness re-inventory; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge the \n     United States Congress to honor the longstanding commitment \n     to multiple use management of public, lands in Utah and the \n     Western United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Secretary of the Interior, the President of the United \n     States, and to the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-25. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to relinquish to the state \n     of Utah all right, title, and jurisdiction in those lands \n     that were committed to the purposes of this state by terms of \n     its enabling act compact with them and that now reside within \n     the state as public lands managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management that were reserved by Congress after the date of \n     Utah statehood; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, under the United States Constitution, the American \n     states reorganized to form a more perfect union, yielding up \n     certain portions of their sovereign powers to the elected \n     officers of the government of their union, yet retaining the \n     residuum of sovereignty for the purpose of independent \n     internal self-governance;\n       Whereas, the aims of the Constitutional Convention provided \n     that state governments would clearly retain all the rights of \n     sovereignty and independence which they before had and which \n     were not exclusively delegated to the United States Congress;\n       Whereas, among the rights of sovereignty held most \n     jealously by the states was the right of sovereignty over the \n     land within their respective borders;\n       Whereas, in due time, the American states came to own vast \n     tracts of land as federal territories;\n       Whereas, by compact between the original states, \n     territorial lands were divided into ``suitable extents of \n     territory'' and upon attaining a certain population, were to \n     be admitted into the union upon ``an equal footing'' as \n     members possessing ``the same rights of sovereignty, freedom \n     and independence'' as the original states;\n       Whereas, the federal trust respecting public lands was \n     established eight years before the Constitution by the \n     Continental Congress and by the states which accepted the \n     terms of the trust;\n       Whereas, the federal trust respecting public lands was \n     subsequently codified within the text of at least five \n     clauses of the Constitution and is the foundation upon which \n     the Constitution and the American union of states were \n     erected for the benefit of every state without prejudice;\n       Whereas, the federal trust respecting public lands \n     obligates the United States, through their agent, Congress, \n     to extinguish both their governmental jurisdiction, and their \n     title on the public lands that are held in trust by the \n     United States for the states in which they are located;\n       Whereas, for, as long as the United States retains title in \n     and jurisdiction over federal public lands in the state of \n     Utah, the state is denied the same complete and independent \n     sovereignty and jurisdiction that was expressly retained by \n     the original states, and its citizens are denied the \n     political right to establish or administer their own \n     republican self-governance as is their right, under the Equal \n     Footing Clause;\n       Whereas, Utah, by terms of its enabling act compact, \n     disclaimed all right and title in the public lands within its \n     borders;\n       Whereas, ``right and title'' are elements of \n     proprietorship, and ``right and title'' are neither \n     sovereignty nor jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, Utah is entitled, under the Equal Footing \n     Doctrine, to the same rights of sovereignty, freedom, and \n     independence as the original states;\n       Whereas, Section 3 of Utah's Enabling Act, with respect to \n     disposition of public land, reads: ``And said Convention \n     shall provide by ordinance irrevocable with the consent, of \n     the United States and the people of said State . . . that \n     until the title (to the unappropriated public lands) have \n     been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and \n     remain subject to the disposition of the United States'';\n       Whereas, by these words the United States may only shelter \n     public lands from the obligation of disposal by the consent \n     of the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, with the passage of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, the United States shifted \n     from a policy of disposal of public lands and extinguishment \n     of the Federal title to one of retention of public lands and \n     their management in perpetuity through the United States \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM);\n       Whereas, the BLM now claims jurisdiction of over 22,600,000 \n     acres of public land in Utah, which is nearly twice as much \n     land as the 11,512,000 acres of land in private ownership;\n       Whereas, the BLM was directed to manage the public lands \n     for multiple use and sustained yield and to afford Utah and \n     other Western States a share of the revenues from the \n     production of the natural resources on public lands, \n     including revenues from timbering, oil and gas production, \n     and mining;\n       Whereas, the state and federal partnership of public lands \n     management has been eroded by an oppressive and over-reaching \n     federal management agenda that has adversely impacted the \n     sovereignty and the economies of the state of Utah and local \n     governments;\n       Whereas, Sections 6, 7, 8, and 12 of Utah's Enabling Act \n     provided for land grants to fund critical public functions \n     such as primary and secondary education, public buildings, \n     and water development;\n       Whereas, federal courts, including the United States \n     Supreme Court, have recognized this land grant as the \n     establishment of a trust, even a ``solemn contract'' between \n     the United States and the state of Utah, with the United \n     States in the role as settlor of the trust and the state of \n     Utah in the role of trustee;\n       Whereas, as settlor of the trust, the United States has an \n     obligation to pursue actions and policies that support the \n     trustee in its efforts to fulfill the purposes of the trust;\n       Whereas, federal land-management actions, even when applied \n     exclusively to the federal lands, directly impact the ability \n     of the state of Utah to manage its trust lands in accordance \n     with the mandate of the Utah Enabling Act and to meet its \n     obligation to the beneficiaries of the trust;\n       Whereas, the United States Department of the Interior has \n     arbitrarily and illegally affected private contracts by \n     cancelling duly awarded oil and gas leases at the time of \n     public auction, the validity of which were subsequently \n     upheld by a federal court of competent jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, in October of 2008, the BLM completed six of its \n     fundamental documents for the allocation of resource use and \n     conservation on BLM lands, called Resource Management Plans, \n     after up to eight years of study, public participation, and \n     the expenditure of millions of dollars;\n       Whereas, the BLM evaluated the allocation of all multiple-\n     use activities in these plans, including the primary \n     multiple-uses of grazing, timber, minerals, recreation, and \n     conservation, and made definitive allocation decisions at the \n     conclusion of the process;\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\n       Whereas, the BLM's failure to act affirmatively on these \n     definitive allocation decisions has created uncertainty in \n     the future of public land use in Utah and has caused capital \n     to flee the state;\n       Whereas, during the process of finalizing the six Resource \n     Management Plans, the BLM refused to consider state and local \n     government acknowledgments of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, or \n     other evidence of the existence of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, \n     which led to the closure of many R.S. 2477 rights-of-way in \n     the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument;\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States recently passed \n     the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which \n     included the designation of lands as wilderness and national \n     conservation areas in Washington County, Utah, and released \n     all other lands to the general multiple-use mandate of the \n     BLM;\n       Whereas, the United States Department of the Interior has \n     arbitrarily created a new category of lands, denominated \n     ``Wild Lands,'' and has superimposed these mandatory \n     protective management provisions upon BLM operations and \n     planning decisions in violation of the provisions of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the provisions of \n     the Administrative Procedures Act, and Presidential \n     Executive Order 13563 concerning openness in policymaking;\n       Whereas, the new Wild Lands provisions threaten to reopen \n     the issue of wilderness in Washington County, in violation of \n     the resolution of the issue through Congressional action;\n       Whereas, the creation of a new Wild Lands category, and the \n     immediate effect of its mandatory restrictive provisions, has \n     arbitrarily undermined the effectiveness of the six recently \n     completed Resource Management Plans of the BLM in eastern and \n     southern Utah, is contrary to the multiple-use mandate \n     outlined by FLPMA and other federal law, and threatens to \n     derail efforts underway locally to seek certainty in land use \n     allocation decisions through Congressional actions, such as \n     that recently completed in Washington County;\n       Whereas, other proposals to make use of the important \n     natural resources of the state, such as phosphate and \n     beneficial range improvement proposals, are how under threat \n     from these ill-conceived Wild. Lands provisions;\n       Whereas, the United States Department of the Interior has \n     failed to enunciate a valid source of statutory or \n     constitutional authority for the imposition of the \n     restrictive Wild Lands provisions;\n       Whereas, the cumulative effect of the Wild Lands \n     provisions, the illegal decision to withdraw validly granted \n     and gas leases, the duplicative Master Leasing Plan process, \n     and the United States Department of Interior's disdain for \n     the use of public review processes, has led to the demise of \n     a robust and viable oil and gas leasing program in Utah, \n     which negates an important revenue source to the state, and \n     eventually jobs for the citizens of Utah;\n       Whereas, the BLM has demonstrated a chronic inability to \n     handle the proliferation of wild horses and burros on the \n     public lands, to the detriment of the rangeland resource;\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture has \n     repeatedly tried to impose severe restrictive management \n     provisions on lands defined as inventoried roadless areas, in \n     violation of Congressional authorities, as reviewed by a \n     federal court of competent jurisdiction.\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is \n     proposing to extend its jurisdiction to regulate the waters \n     of the United States to areas traditionally dry, except \n     during severe weather events, in violation of the common \n     definition of jurisdictional waters;\n       Whereas, in 1996, the President of the United States abused \n     the intent of the Antiquities Act by the creation of the \n     Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument without any \n     consultation with state and local authorities or citizens;\n       Whereas, the BLM's Resource Management Plan for the Kanab \n     Field Office eliminated the filming of movies and filming for \n     commercial purposes within the Grand Staircase-Escalante \n     National Monument, thereby eliminating a source of economic \n     opportunity for Kane County through the loss of use of its \n     iconic ``Little Hollywood'' film site and other locations;\n       Whereas, bureaucrats within the United States Department of \n     the Interior are assembling information to prepare for \n     further designations without consultation;\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is \n     making decisions concerning various species on BLM lands \n     under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act without \n     serious consideration of state wildlife management activities \n     and protections designed to prevent the need for a listing, \n     or recognizing the ability to delist a species, thereby \n     affecting the economic vitality of the state and local \n     regions;\n       Whereas, the BLM has not authorized all necessary rangeland \n     improvement projects involving the removal of pinyon-juniper \n     and other climax vegetation, thereby reducing the biological \n     diversity of the range, reducing riparian viability and water \n     quality, and reducing the availability of forage for both \n     livestock and wildlife;\n       Whereas, differences of opinion about the appropriate use \n     of the public lands has created a massive logjam in the \n     advancement of any proposal for use of the public lands, \n     whether for energy production, recreation, conservation, \n     timber production, or similar uses;\n       Whereas, the states have been instrumental in convening \n     groups of stakeholders to consider protection for and \n     responsible use of federal lands;\n       Whereas, efforts in Washington County, Utah, the Owyhee \n     region of Idaho, and the Front Range region in Montana have \n     involved many various stakeholders, including \n     ranchers, energy officials, environmental groups, and \n     state and local government officials in an effort to \n     achieve agreement on proposals for wilderness and other \n     congressionally established conservation units, lands \n     available for local privatization of lands, and areas \n     available for traditional multiple-use;\n       Whereas, these efforts led to congressional approval of a \n     jointly prepared proposal in Washington County, Utah, and to \n     other proposals currently pending before Congress;\n       Whereas, the state is willing to sponsor, evaluate, and \n     advance these locally driven efforts in a more efficient \n     manner than the federal government, to the benefit of all \n     users, including recreation, conservation, and the \n     responsible development of energy, grazing, timber, and other \n     economic industries;\n       Whereas, citizens of the state of Utah have a love of the \n     land and have demonstrated responsible stewardship of lands \n     within state jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah has a proven regulatory \n     structure to manage public lands for multiple use and \n     sustained yield;\n       Whereas, federal land management policies are eroding the \n     fundamental pillars of sovereignty, freedom, and independence \n     upon which all states and the state of Utah founded under the \n     Equal Footing clause;\n       Whereas, by means provided under the Constitution, damaged \n     states may assert their rightful claim to the public lands \n     within their borders and restore the constitutional design \n     for the benefit of present and future generations; and\n       Whereas, Utah fully reserves and asserts all sovereign and \n     constitutional claims to its public lands: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah calls \n     on the United States, through their agent, Congress, to \n     relinquish to the state of Utah all right, title, and \n     jurisdiction in those lands that were committed to the \n     purposes of this state by terms of its enabling act compact \n     with them and that now reside within the state as public \n     lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management that were \n     reserved by Congress after the date of Utah statehood; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Interior, to the \n     United States Director of the Federal Bureau of Land \n     Management, to the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to the members of Utah's Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-26. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to adopt legislation \n     relative to public lands; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, for purposes of this resolution:\n       (1) ``Federally owned land'' means all land held in the \n     name of the United States or any agency of the United States, \n     including land held in trust, United States military \n     reservations, Indian reservations, and any other land used \n     for federal purposes.\n       (2) (a) ``Unappropriated public lands'' means all land \n     under the management and control of the Bureau of Land \n     Management or United States Forest Service.\n       (b) ``Unappropriated public lands'' do not include lands \n     which are:\n       (i) held in trust;\n       (ii) located within a United States military reservation;\n       (iii) a unit of the National Park System;\n       (iv) a Wildlife Refuge;\n       (v) a Wilderness Area designated by Congress; or\n       (vi) a National Historic Site.\n       (3) ``Western States'' means Alaska, Arizona, California, \n     Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, \n     Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\n       Whereas, Western States, as a group, are falling behind in \n     education funding as measured from 1979 to 2007 by growth of \n     real per pupil expenditures of 56% compared to 92% in the \n     remaining states;\n       Whereas, 11 of the 17 states with the lowest real growth in \n     per pupil expenditures are Western States;\n       Whereas, one effect of less funding for public education in \n     the West is higher pupil-per-teacher ratios;\n       Whereas, nine of the 12 states with the largest pupil-per-\n     teacher ratios are Western States;\n       Whereas, on average, the 13 Western States have 3.7 more \n     students per classroom than the remaining 37 states;\n       Whereas, between 2012 and 2018, the rate of enrollment \n     growth in Western States is projected to increase 9%, while \n     the rate of enrollment growth in other states is projected to \n     increase by only 3.3%;\n       Whereas, state and local taxes of Western States, as a \n     percentage of personal income, are as high as or higher than \n     other states;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that Western States tax at a \n     comparable rate and allocate nearly as much of their budgets \n     to public\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n     education as other states, Western States have lower real \n     growth in per pupil expenditures and have higher pupil-per-\n     teacher ratios;\n       Whereas, the federal government is the source of and has \n     the potential to solve the problem because of the enormous \n     amount of federally owned land in Western States;\n       Whereas, all states east of an imaginary vertical line from \n     Montana to New Mexico have, on average, 4.1% of their land \n     federally owned, while the Western States on average have \n     51.9% of their land federally owned;\n       Whereas, many of the Acts enabling the people of American \n     West territories to form their constitutions and state \n     governments and providing for the admission of those states \n     into the Union on equal footing with the original states, \n     included a common provision of which the following example is \n     typical: ``That five per centum of the proceeds of the sales \n     of public land lying within said state, which shall be sold \n     by the United States subsequent to the admission of said \n     State into the Union, after deducting all the expenses \n     incident to the same, shall be paid to the said state, to be \n     used as a permanent fund, the interest of which only shall be \n     expended for the support of the common schools within said \n     state.'';\n       Whereas, the plan language of these enabling acts proclaims \n     that the public land shall be sold by the United States \n     subsequent to the admission of the states into the Union;\n       Whereas, the United States honored this language by selling \n     public land within the Western States until the passage of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, wherein \n     Congress declared that the policy of the United States was to \n     retain public land in federal ownership and management;\n       Whereas, the United States has broken its solemn compact \n     with the Western States and breached its fiduciary duty to \n     the school children who are designated beneficiaries of the \n     sale of public land under the terms of the respective \n     enabling Acts of many Western States;\n       Whereas, the current shortfall in funding public education \n     in the Western States requires immediate Congressional action \n     to remedy this discriminatory federal land policy and prevent \n     the further disadvantaging of the school children of the \n     Western States; and\n       Whereas, the most efficient and cost effective remedy now \n     available to the United States is to grant to the Western \n     States 5% of the remaining federally owned land located \n     within each state and authorize each state to select land \n     from the unappropriated public land of the United States \n     within the boundaries of each state to satisfy the grant: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     Congress to adopt legislation that would include the \n     following provisions:\n       (1) instead of receiving, for the support of the common \n     schools, 5% of the proceeds of the sales of federally owned \n     land lying within the Western States which have not been sold \n     by the United States, grants of land will be made to each \n     Western State in the amount of land equal to 5% of the number \n     of acres of federally owned land within the state;\n       (2) each Western State shall select from the unappropriated \n     public lands within the borders of the, state in a manner \n     determined by the legislature of the state, land equal in \n     acreage to 5% of the federally owned land in the state;\n       (3) selection and transfer of land to Western States, shall \n     not be considered a major federal action for the purposes of \n     section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of \n     1969;\n       (4)(a) all mineral, oil, and gas rights to the land \n     selected by the Western States shall become the property of \n     that Western State unless the federal lessee of the selected \n     land is making royalty payments to the United States from \n     production of minerals, oil, or gas, in which case that \n     leasehold interest shall remain in the Ownership of the \n     United States until the leasehold interest terminates; and\n       (b) after the leasehold interest described in Subsection \n     (4)(a) terminates, the mineral oil, and gas rights shall \n     become the property of the respective Western State;\n       (5) all land selected by each of the Western States shall \n     be held in trust by a state educational agency empowered to \n     sell or lease the land, the proceeds of which shall be used \n     as a permanent fund, the interest of which shall be expended \n     only for the support of public education;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to impose a moratorium on \n     the promulgation of any new greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \n     regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency for a \n     period of at least two years, except for the need to directly \n     address an imminent health or environmental emergency; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, concern is growing that with the failure of cap-\n     and-trade legislation in Congress the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting to reduce \n     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the adoption and \n     implementation of regulations without Congressional approval;\n       Whereas, the EPA is proposing numerous new rules to \n     regulate GHG emissions as pollutants through the Clean Air \n     Act;\n       Whereas, the EPA has not performed any comprehensive study \n     of the environmental benefits; its GHG regulation in terms of \n     impacts on global climate;\n       Whereas, the EPA's regulatory activity of GHG has numerous \n     and overlapping requirements that are likely to have major \n     effects on the nation's economy, jobs, and U.S. \n     competitiveness in worldwide markets;\n       Whereas, neither the EPA nor the current administration has \n     undertaken any comprehensive study on the cumulative effect \n     that regulating GHGs will have on the nation's economy, jobs, \n     and U.S. competitiveness;\n       Whereas, state agencies are routinely required to identify \n     the costs of their regulations and to justify those costs in \n     light of the benefits;\n       Whereas, since the EPA has identified ``taking action on \n     climate change and improving air quality'' its first \n     strategic goal for the time frame of 2011-15, it should be \n     required to identify the specific actions it intends to take \n     to achieve these goals and to assess the cumulative effect of \n     these actions on public health, climate change, and on the \n     U.S. economy;\n       Whereas, the primary goal of government at the present time \n     must be to promote economic, recovery and to foster a stable \n     and predictable business environment that will lead to the \n     creation of new jobs; and\n       Whereas, the public's health and welfare will suffer \n     without significant new job creation and economic improvement \n     since environmental improvement is most successful in a \n     society that generates wealth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah calls \n     on Congress to adopt legislation prohibiting the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating \n     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without Congressional \n     approval, including, if necessary, not funding EPA greenhouse \n     gas regulatory activities; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on Congress to impose \n     a moratorium on, the promulgation of any new GHG regulation \n     by the EPA for a period of at least-two years, except for the \n     need to directly address an imminent health or environmental \n     emergency; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on Congress to require \n     the Administration to carry out a study identifying all \n     regulatory activity that the EPA intends to undertake in \n     furtherance of its goal of ``taking action on climate change \n     and improving air quality'' and, provide an objective cost-\n     benefit analysis and cumulative effect that EPA's current and \n     planned regulation will have on global climate, public \n     health, the U.S. economy, jobs, and economic competitiveness \n     in worldwide markets; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature expresses its support for \n     continuing improvements to the quality of the nation's air \n     and declares that such improvements can be made without \n     damaging the economy as long as there is a full understanding \n     of the costs and benefits of the regulations at issue; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States, the governor of each state outside of \n     Utah, the Senate President or President pro tem and the \n     Speaker of the House of each state legislature outside of \n     Utah, and to the members of Utah's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-28. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to take action to \n     maintain the integrity of the Endangered Species Act by \n     exempting wolves from the Act in every state and allowing \n     each state to protect its rural economies, game herds, \n     livestock, and pets; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, with a population of 60,000 in North America, \n     wolves are no longer an endangered species;\n       Whereas, the agreed-upon recovery goals of 30 packs and 300 \n     wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains has been exceeded \n     since 2002;\n       Whereas, wolf populations currently exceed by more than \n     600% recovery goals agreed upon by all parties, yet extremist \n     groups and courts block management as all parties had \n     previously agreed upon;\n       Whereas, excessive wolf populations are causing tremendous \n     negative impacts to game populations, livestock, and pets at \n     the cost of tens of millions of dollars each year to state \n     economies, and the problem is growing exponentially;\n       Whereas, excessive wolf populations are costing rural \n     economies many jobs;\n       Whereas, wolves are beginning to threaten and challenge \n     people;\n       Whereas, the experiences of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and \n     Minnesota prove that the administrative and legal process is \n     broken and does not serve the people, private property, \n     wildlife, or rural economies;\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     repeatedly failed to listen to\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\n     Utah's entire elected body of Governors, Senators, and \n     bipartisan Congressman to include the entire state of Utah in \n     the Northern Rockies population;\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only \n     included a small portion of northern Utah in the potential \n     delisting zone, leaving nearly the entire state of Utah as an \n     endangered species classification with no hope or promise of \n     a solution to the wolf problem for decades into the future;\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n     proposes to spend $25,000,000 to monitor and watch wolf \n     populations grow while they eliminate jobs and destroy game \n     populations, livestock, and pets;\n       Whereas, the court system has failed to allow the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service to delist wolves in spite of \n     scientific data, costing over $40,000,000 to gather, \n     justifying delisting, with national experts inside and \n     outside the government providing sworn testimony that wolves \n     should be removed from the endangered species list;\n       Whereas, 32 state wildlife agencies have requested wolves \n     to be removed from the Endangered Species Act through \n     congressional action;\n       Whereas, state game and fish agencies are much better \n     prepared and capable of managing wolves than the federal \n     government;\n       Whereas, western states face many habitat conservation \n     challenges, and the focus of investment of limited wildlife \n     funds should be to protect habitats and abundant herds that \n     provide hundreds of millions of dollars each year to rural \n     economies and food for tens of thousands of families; and\n       Whereas, the state of Utah, in consultation with the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, and based on extensive \n     professional wildlife management input and a two-year public \n     process, has adopted a wolf management plan: now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge the United States Congress \n     to take action to maintain the integrity of the Endangered \n     Species Act by exempting wolves from the Act in every state \n     and allowing each state to protect its rural economies, game \n     herds, livestock, and pets; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the Director of \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the executive \n     director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the \n     United States Secretary of the Interior, members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation, and governors and presidents of the \n     Senate in all 50 states.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-29. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to defend the democratic \n     right of the Iranian people; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, the American people recognize and support the \n     Iranian people in their century-long struggle for democracy, \n     freedom, justice, and human rights;\n       Whereas, the government of the Islamic Republic's \n     crackdowns on democracy, support for terrorism, and pursuit \n     of nuclear weapons pose a grave threat to the Iranian people \n     as well as the security of the United States, Israel, and \n     their allies in the Persian Gulf;\n       Whereas, since its establishment in 1979, the government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in numerous criminal \n     and terrorist acts, including the arbitrary and unlawful \n     judicial murder of thousands of Iranian political and \n     religious dissidents as well as minors and juveniles;\n       Whereas, the Islamic Republic has also established a system \n     of religious apartheid in which Iranian women are treated as \n     second class citizens, and Iran's minorities are persecuted \n     for exercising their freedom of religion;\n       Whereas, in 2009, the government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran staged a presidential election that was marred by fraud \n     and violence in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed \n     millions of Iranian voters demanding free and fair elections \n     as ``dust and dirt'';\n       Whereas, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, sanctified \n     the rigged election by equating the fundamentals of religion \n     with fraud, force, terrorism, and tyranny;\n       Whereas, since the fraudulent elections, grieving mothers \n     and families searching for missing relatives and demanding \n     the release of political prisoners have been denied justice;\n       Whereas, there has been a dramatic surge in death sentences \n     carried out by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     despite United Nations' calls for a moratorium on executions;\n       Whereas, there has been a systematic crackdown on students, \n     scholars, workers, teachers, clerics, and journalists for \n     exercising their freedoms of speech and assembly;\n       Whereas, the American and Iranian people have been and \n     remain steadfast friends and allies;\n       Whereas, over the past century, the American people's \n     support for Iran's political and economic independence \n     enabled the Iranian government to end the Soviet occupation \n     of Northern Iran and led to the peaceful withdrawal of the \n     Red Army from Iran in the aftermath of the Second World War;\n       Whereas, the United States played a pivotal role in Iran's \n     economic development from 1946 to 1979, and American aid and \n     assistance helped the Iranian people's efforts to eradicate \n     poverty, famine, disease, and illiteracy;\n       Whereas, Iranian-Americans have emerged as a vital and \n     vibrant force in American political, economic, and civic \n     life;\n       Whereas, successive American presidents and statesmen have \n     stood by the Iranian people in their struggle for justice, \n     democracy, peace, and prosperity;\n       Whereas, the Iranian people's call for democracy and \n     freedom has helped to light the torch of hope, liberty, \n     dignity, and justice not only in Iran but throughout the \n     Middle East and the Islamic world; and\n       Whereas, the liberation of humankind from under the yoke of \n     fascism, communism, and other false ideologies that elevate \n     the state above the individual depends on the moral \n     conviction of free people everywhere to reject oppression, \n     slavery, tyranny, and terrorism: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, declare that the people of Utah \n     stand with the people of Iran in their struggle for freedom, \n     justice, peace, and prosperity for Iran, and reaffirm the \n     bonds of friendship between the people of Utah and the people \n     of Iran; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor call on the \n     government of the United States, as well as the international \n     community and the Islamic world, to support the Iranian \n     people by defending the democratic right of the Iranian \n     people to choose their own government through free and fair \n     elections, demanding that Iran's supreme leader recognize and \n     respect the sovereignty of the Iranian people and that he \n     cease abusing his religious and political standing by rigging \n     elections and equating fraud and force with the fundamentals \n     of religion and democracy, to protect Iran's civil society by \n     demanding that the Iranian judiciary end the arbitrary \n     arrest, detention, torture, and execution of Iranian citizens \n     for defending the right to elect their own government, \n     determine their own destiny, and exercise their freedom of \n     religion, to prevent Iran's leaders from using proceeds from \n     the sale of oil to arm and finance private militias, \n     terrorist groups, and other extremists responsible for \n     committing acts of terrorism against the Iranian people as \n     well as the United States and its allies in the Middle East, \n     to deny Iran's leaders the capacity to hold the Iranian \n     people and the rest of the world hostage by developing \n     nuclear weapons and engaging in nuclear blackmail, and to \n     help facilitate the Iranian people's struggle to transform \n     Iran into a bastion of democracy, prosperity, and peace in \n     the region; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary General of the United Nations, the \n     chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, the chairman of the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-30.

Culmer to \n     help seamstress and flag maker Agnes Teudt Fernelius in \n     finalizing the design of the flag;\n       Whereas, on May 1, 1903, the Utah delegation to the St. \n     Louis World's Fair marched proudly alongside the state's new \n     flag in the Parade of States;\n       Whereas, the flag was formally referred to as the \n     Governor's flag or the Governor's regimental flag until 1911, \n     when the Legislature formally adopted its design as the \n     official state flag;\n       Whereas, a second flag was finished in early 1913 and \n     presented by the state to the battleship U.S.S. Utah on June \n     25, 1913.\n       Whereas, that same year, Representative Annie Wells Cannon \n     successfully introduced House Joint Resolution 1, which \n     established the current flag design reflected in statute;\n       Whereas, Utah Code Section 63G-1-501 describes the flag as, \n     ``a flag of blue field, fringed, with gold borders, with the \n     following device worked in natural colors on the center of \n     the blue field:\n       The Center is a shield; above the shield and thereon an \n     American eagle: with outstretched wings, the top of the \n     shield pierced with six arrow's arranged crosswise; upon the \n     shield under the arrows the word ``Industry'' and below the \n     word ``Industry'' on the center of the shield, a beehive; on \n     each side of the beehive, growing sego lilies; below the \n     beehive, and near the bottom of the shield, the word \n     ``Utah,'' and below the word ``Utah' and on the bottom of the \n     shield, the figures ``1847'', with the appearance of being \n     back of the shield there shall be two American flags on \n     flagstaffs placed crosswise with the flag so draped that they \n     will project beyond each side of the shield, the heads of the \n     flagstaffs appearing in front of the eagle's wings and the \n     bottom of each staff appearing over the face of the draped \n     flag below the shield; below the shield and flags and upon \n     the blue field, the figures ``1896''; around the entire \n     design, a narrow circle in gold'';\n       Whereas, a third state flag was prepared in 1922 which \n     mistakenly has the year 1847 beneath the shield instead of on \n     the shield, and the error has been perpetuated to this day; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the interest of accurately preserving a symbol \n     of the state's rich history, and to follow the wording of \n     Utah Code Section 63G-1-501, all new flags should be made to \n     reflect the statutory flag description and all Utah flags \n     currently in use or in stock should be utilized until \n     unserviceable: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, recognize that Utah Code Section \n     63G-1-501 accurately reflects the 1913 description of the \n     official state flag of Utah; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     manufacturers of the state flag to modify the current design \n     of the official flag of the state of Utah to accurately \n     reflect the description of the flag as approved by the Utah \n     Legislature in 1913; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     all Utah flags be prepared in honor of past generations and \n     for the benefit of present and future generations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to \n     Colonial Flag, Annin & Company, C.F.

A bill to address remedies in bankruptcy for negligent, \nreckless, or fraudulent assertion of claim; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nFighting Fraud in Bankruptcy Act of 2011. I thank Senator Whitehouse \nand Senator Blumenthal for joining me as cosponsors of this \nlegislation. This bill will give the Department of Justice and the \nUnited States bankruptcy trustee important new tools to combat creditor \nabuses in the bankruptcy process. The Fighting Fraud in Bankruptcy Act \nis another step forward in the Judiciary Committee's important efforts \nto protect American citizens from fraud.\n  Since the onset of the housing market's collapse, the bankruptcy \ncourts and the United States trustee have encountered serious problems \nrelated to foreclosure documentation submitted by mortgage lenders and \nservicers in the bankruptcy process. As scrutiny has been brought to \nbear on foreclosure-related filings by bankruptcy judges, attorneys, \nand the United States trustee, a pattern of negligent, reckless, or \nfraudulent conduct on the part of mortgage lenders and servicers has \nbeen revealed with a consistency that indicates systemic problems.\n  Under Attorney General Holder's leadership, the Department of Justice \nis making a considerable effort to ensure that mortgage lenders and \nservicers are playing by the rules and treating homeowners fairly and \nhonestly. As part of its efforts to more closely scrutinize foreclosure \ndocumentation in bankruptcy cases, the United States trustee's office \nreviewed 10,000 proofs of claim filed by mortgage servicers. What was \nfound was far more serious than what mortgage servicing industry \nofficials have been asserting. For example, in testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in 2008, an industry executive stated that \nthe rate of loan servicing errors in bankruptcy cases adverse to a \nhomeowner was ``less than one percent.''\n  In its review, however, the trustee found an error rate based upon \nblatant,\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nobvious errors more than ten times greater than what was testified to \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. And these errors are not harmless. In \nsome cases, they were wildly inaccurate statements of what a homeowner \nowed to the lender, in others, the claims contained unsupported junk \nfees that servicers had piled on, yet for which they provided no \ndocumentation. If left unchallenged, the result would be that a \nhomeowner not only loses a home, but is cheated on what he or she owes \non that home. Americans in foreclosure, and the trustee as guardian of \nthe system are right to demand accuracy and truthfulness from \ncreditors' representations in court.\n  Unfortunately, the major players in the mortgage industry are showing \nlittle interest in addressing these problems head-on. Instead, when \nfaced with the trustee's scrutiny of their claims, some major mortgage \nservicers have resorted to engaging in litigation challenging the \nauthority of the United States trustee to look behind their claims and \nprovide sanctions where warranted. The United States trustees in \ndistricts around the country are now facing hundreds of challenges to \ntheir authority to effectively police the system. It is a great \ndisappointment to see some of the very same banking entities that have \nbenefited so much from congressional action and taxpayer funded \nassistance put up so much resistance to simple demands for accuracy and \ntruthfulness in their representations to the court and those whose \nhomes they are seeking to repossess.\n  The unfortunate reality is that lenders in many cases will continue \nto exercise their legal right to foreclose, rather than work with the \nhomeowner to modify a loan. What is entirely unacceptable is for \nhomeowners on the precipice of losing their homes to be mistreated by \ntheir lenders--whether through unsupported fees, willfully inaccurate \nor negligent accounting, or a lack of supporting documentation. This \nconduct only adds to the pain and hardship so many are experiencing.\n  In 2010, over one million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. \nThis year, housing industry analysts expect the problem to get worse. \nThe magnitude of this problem, and its effect on American families, is \ndifficult to comprehend. As this crisis continues to deepen, the \nincentives for lenders and servicers to cut corners, inflate profits, \nrush foreclosures, and hide from their misconduct will only increase.\n  The legislation I introduce today is about ensuring fair treatment \nfor homeowners, preventing a fraud on the bankruptcy courts, and \nholding wrongdoers accountable. When Congress created the United States \ntrustee program in 1978, it described the trustee's role as the \n``watchdog'' of the bankruptcy system, and vested the trustee's office \nwith the power to investigate fraud in the process. This legislation \nwill support and strengthen this important role so that all \nparticipants in the bankruptcy system conduct themselves in accordance \nwith the law.\n  My legislation will do four things. First, it clarifies the United \nStates trustee's inherent power and duty to police all corners of the \nbankruptcy system. Second, it provides the trustee and the courts with \nremedies to correct and sanction misconduct and fraud committed by \ncreditors in the bankruptcy process. Third, the legislation empowers \nthe trustee to establish a system of audits to ensure that creditors \nare complying with the law. These provisions taken together will help \nmake certain that debtors and creditors are held to the same standard \nin the bankruptcy process.\n  Finally, the legislation addresses a particularly offensive form of \nmortgage servicer misconduct against men and women serving in our \nmilitary. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) protects active \nduty military personnel by requiring a stable, manageable interest rate \nfor military homeowners on active duty, and by staying foreclosure \nactions during their deployment. A Government Accountability Office \nreport released this month found that among just two of 14 major \nmortgage servicing organizations that provided data to Federal \nregulators, 50 foreclosure actions were carried out in violation of the \nSCRA.\n  In response to this finding, and to bolster the SCRA's protections \nfor the men and women serving in the military, this legislation would \nrequire a mortgage lender seeking relief from the automatic stay to \ncertify under penalty of perjury that the foreclosure was in compliance \nwith the SCRA.\n  As Congress looks at ways to mitigate the foreclosure crisis to \nreduce its impact on homeowners and the economy, I hope all Senators \ncan agree that the foreclosure process for Americans should be a fair \none and one in which there is accountability for fraud or other \nmisconduct. And I hope we can all agree that the integrity of our \njudicial system is something worth protecting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1054\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A result should come out of this.'';\n       Whereas, during his visit to the United States in November \n     2009, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I raised the issue of \n     the continued closure of the Theological School of Halki with \n     President Obama, congressional leaders, and others;\n       Whereas, in a welcome development, for the first time since \n     1922, the Government of Turkey in August 2010 allowed the \n     liturgical celebration by the Ecumenical Patriarch at the \n     historic Sumela Monastery; and\n       Whereas, following a unanimous decision by the European \n     Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in 2010, ruling that \n     Turkey return the former Greek Orphanage on Buyukada Island \n     to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, on the eve of the feast day \n     of St.\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\n     Andrew observed on November 30, the Government of Turkey \n     provided lawyers representing the Ecumenical Patriarchate \n     with the formal property title for the confiscated building: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) welcomes the historic meeting between Prime Minister \n     Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I;\n         (2) welcomes the positive gestures by the Government of \n     Turkey, including allowing allowed the liturgical celebration \n     by the Ecumenical Patriarch at the historic Sumela Monastery \n     and the return of the former Greek Orphanage on Buyukada \n     Island to the Ecumenical Patriarchate;\n         (3) urges the Government of Turkey to facilitate the \n     reopening of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Theological School \n     of Halki without condition or further delay; and\n         (4) urges the Government of Turkey to address other \n     longstanding concerns relating to the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Snowe, Reid, Shaheen, Whitehouse, and Menendez in introducing \na resolution calling upon the government of Turkey to facilitate the \nreopening of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Theological School of Halki \nwithout condition or further delay.\n  I was privileged to again meet with the Ecumenical Patriarch, \nBartholomew I, during his 2009 visit to the United States. His \nimpassioned request to those of us gathered was for our support for the \nreopening of the Theological School of Halki, forcibly closed by the \nTurkish authorities in 1971. In this year marking the 40th anniversary \nof that tragic action, I urge the Turkish leadership to reverse this \ninjustice and allow this unique religious institution to reopen\n  Founded in 1844, the Theological School of Halki, located outside \nmodern-day Istanbul, served as the principal seminary of the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate until its forced closure. Counted among alumni of this \npreeminent educational institution are numerous prominent Orthodox \nscholars, theologians, priests, and bishops as well as patriarchs, \nincluding Bartholomew I. Many of these scholars and theologians have \nserved as faculty at other institutions serving Orthodox communities \naround the world.\n  Past indications by the Turkish authorities of pending action to \nreopen the seminary have, regrettably, failed to materialize. Turkey's \nPrime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with the Ecumenical Patriarch \nin August 2009. In an address to a wider gathering of minority \nreligious leaders that day, Erdogan concluded by stating, ``We should \nnot be of those who gather, talk and disperse. A result should come out \nof this.'' I could not agree more with the sentiment. But resolution of \nthis longstanding matter requires resolve, not rhetoric.\n  In a positive development last August, the authorities in Ankara, for \nthe first time since 1922, permitted a liturgical celebration to take \nplace at the historic Sumela Monastery. The Ecumenical Patriarch \npresided at that service, attended by pilgrims and religious leaders \nfrom several countries, including Greece and Russia. Last November, a \nTurkish court ordered the Buyukada orphanage to be returned to \nEcumenical Patriarchate and the transfer of the property has been \ncompleted.\n  As one who has followed issues surrounding the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate with interest for many years, I welcome these positive \ndevelopments. My hope is that they will lead to the return of scores of \nother church properties seized by the government. In 2005, the Helsinki \nCommission, which I co-chair, convened a briefing, ``The Greek Orthodox \nChurch in Turkey: A Victim of Systematic Expropriation.'' The \nCommission has consistently raised the issue of the Theological School \nfor well over a decade and will continue to closely monitor related \ndevelopments.\n  The State Department's 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom \nis a reminder of the challenges faced by Orthodox and other minority \nreligious communities in Turkey.

Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a resolution \ncalling on the President of the United States to posthumously pardon \nthe world's first African-American heavyweight boxing champion, John \nArthur ``Jack'' Johnson.\n  As you may remember, Representative Peter King and I introduced a \nsimilar bipartisan resolution during the last session of Congress, and \nit passed both chambers unanimously. I was very pleased that two of the \nresolution's strongest supporters were the Senate Majority Leader, my \nfriend Senator Reid, and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy. However, I am disappointed to say that the President \nstill has not pardoned Mr. Johnson. Today, I call upon my Senate \ncolleagues to once again pass this resolution and send a clear message \nto our President that this unacceptable historical injustice must be \nrectified.\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\n  For those who may not be familiar with the plight of Jack Johnson, he \nis considered by many to be the most dominant athlete in boxing \nhistory. John Arthur Johnson was born March 31, 1878, in Galveston, TX, \nto parents who were former slaves. At an early age he realized his \ntalent for the sweet science. In order to make a living, Johnson \ntraveled across the country fighting anyone willing to face him. But he \nwas denied repeatedly, on purely racial grounds, a chance to fight for \nthe world heavyweight title. For too long, African-American fighters \nwere not seen as legitimate contenders for the championship. \nFortunately, after years of perseverance, Johnson was finally granted \nan opportunity in 1908 to fight the then-reigning title holder, Tommy \nBurns. Johnson handily defeated Burns to become the first African-\nAmerican heavyweight champion.\n  Mr. Johnson's success in the ring, and sometimes indulgent lifestyle \noutside of it, fostered resentment among many and raised concerns that \nhis continued sporting dominance would somehow disrupt what was then \nperceived by many as a ``racial order.'' So, a search for a Caucasian \nboxer who could defeat Johnson began, a campaign dubbed as the search \nfor the ``Great White Hope.'' That hope arrived in the person of a \nformer champion, Jim Jeffries, who returned from retirement to fight \nJohnson in 1910. But when Johnson defeated Jeffries, race riots broke \nout as many sought to avenge the loss.\n  Following the defeat of the ``Great White Hope,'' the Federal \ngovernment launched an investigation into the legality of Johnson's \nrelationships with Caucasian women. The Mann Act, which was enacted in \n1910, outlawed the transport of Caucasian women across State lines for \nthe purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for ``any other immoral \npurpose.'' Using the ``any other immoral purpose'' clause as a pretext, \nfederal law enforcement officials set out to ``get'' Johnson.\n  On October 18, 1912, he was arrested for transporting his Caucasian \ngirlfriend across State lines in violation of the Act. However, the \ncharges were dropped when the Caucasian, whose mother had originally \ntipped off Federal officials, refused to cooperate with authorities. \nShe later married Johnson.\n  Yet Federal authorities persisted in their persecution of Johnson, \npersuading a former Caucasian girlfriend of Johnson's to testify that \nhe had transported her across State lines. Her testimony resulted in \nJohnson's conviction in 1913. He was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in \nFederal prison. During Johnson's appeal, one prosecutor admitted that \n``Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but that it was \nhis misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the \nintermarriage of whites and blacks.''\n  After the trial, Johnson fled the country to Canada, and then \ntraveled to various European and South American countries, before \nlosing his heavyweight championship title in Cuba in 1915. He returned \nto the United States in 1920, surrendered to Federal authorities, and \nserved nearly a year in Federal prison. Despite this obvious and clear \ninjustice, Johnson refused to turn his back on the country that \nbetrayed him. Mr. Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n  The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our Nation's \nhistory. Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. Again, this \nresolution calls on the President to pardon Mr. Johnson posthumously. \nIt recognizes the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the \nachievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry \nand prejudice. Johnson was a flawed individual who was certainly \ncontroversial. But he was also a historic American figure, whose life \nand accomplishments played an instrumental role in our Nation's \nprogress toward true equality under the law. And he deserved much \nbetter than a racially motivated conviction, which denied him of his \nliberty and served to diminish his athletic, cultural, and historic \nsignificance.\n  We are quickly coming up on the 65th anniversary of Jack Johnson's \ndeath, and we should take this opportunity to allow future generations \nto grasp what he accomplished against great odds and appreciate his \ncontributions to society unencumbered by the taint of his criminal \nconviction. We know that we cannot possibly right the wrong that was \ndone to Jack Johnson, but we can take this small step towards once \nagain acknowledging his mistreatment and removing the cloud that casts \na shadow on his legacy. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/24/senate-section/article/S3280-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3280-S3281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 22--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nJOHN ARTHUR ``JACK'' JOHNSON SHOULD RECEIVE A POSTHUMOUS PARDON FOR THE \n  RACIALLY MOTIVATED CONVICTION IN 1913 THAT DIMINISHED THE ATHLETIC, \nCULTURAL, AND HEROIC SIGNIFICANCE OF JACK JOHNSON AND UNDULY TARNISHED \n                             HIS REPUTATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

In order to make a living, Johnson \ntraveled across the country fighting anyone willing to face him. But he \nwas denied repeatedly, on purely racial grounds, a chance to fight for \nthe world heavyweight title. For too long, African-American fighters \nwere not seen as legitimate contenders for the championship. \nFortunately, after years of perseverance, Johnson was finally granted \nan opportunity in 1908 to fight the then-reigning title holder, Tommy \nBurns. Johnson handily defeated Burns to become the first African-\nAmerican heavyweight champion.\n  Mr. Johnson's success in the ring, and sometimes indulgent lifestyle \noutside of it, fostered resentment among many and raised concerns that \nhis continued sporting dominance would somehow disrupt what was then \nperceived by many as a ``racial order.'' So, a search for a Caucasian \nboxer who could defeat Johnson began, a campaign dubbed as the search \nfor the ``Great White Hope.'' That hope arrived in the person of a \nformer champion, Jim Jeffries, who returned from retirement to fight \nJohnson in 1910. But when Johnson defeated Jeffries, race riots broke \nout as many sought to avenge the loss.\n  Following the defeat of the ``Great White Hope,'' the Federal \ngovernment launched an investigation into the legality of Johnson's \nrelationships with Caucasian women. The Mann Act, which was enacted in \n1910, outlawed the transport of Caucasian women across State lines for \nthe purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for ``any other immoral \npurpose.'' Using the ``any other immoral purpose'' clause as a pretext, \nfederal law enforcement officials set out to ``get'' Johnson.\n  On October 18, 1912, he was arrested for transporting his Caucasian \ngirlfriend across State lines in violation of the Act. However, the \ncharges were dropped when the Caucasian, whose mother had originally \ntipped off Federal officials, refused to cooperate with authorities. \nShe later married Johnson.\n  Yet Federal authorities persisted in their persecution of Johnson, \npersuading a former Caucasian girlfriend of Johnson's to testify that \nhe had transported her across State lines. Her testimony resulted in \nJohnson's conviction in 1913. He was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in \nFederal prison. During Johnson's appeal, one prosecutor admitted that \n``Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but that it was \nhis misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the \nintermarriage of whites and blacks.''\n  After the trial, Johnson fled the country to Canada, and then \ntraveled to various European and South American countries, before \nlosing his heavyweight championship title in Cuba in 1915. He returned \nto the United States in 1920, surrendered to Federal authorities, and \nserved nearly a year in Federal prison. Despite this obvious and clear \ninjustice, Johnson refused to turn his back on the country that \nbetrayed him. Mr. Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n  The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our Nation's \nhistory. Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. Again, this \nresolution calls on the President to pardon Mr. Johnson posthumously. \nIt recognizes the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the \nachievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry \nand prejudice. Johnson was a flawed individual who was certainly \ncontroversial. But he was also a historic American figure, whose life \nand accomplishments played an instrumental role in our Nation's \nprogress toward true equality under the law. And he deserved much \nbetter than a racially motivated conviction, which denied him of his \nliberty and served to diminish his athletic, cultural, and historic \nsignificance.\n  We are quickly coming up on the 65th anniversary of Jack Johnson's \ndeath, and we should take this opportunity to allow future generations \nto grasp what he accomplished against great odds and appreciate his \ncontributions to society unencumbered by the taint of his criminal \nconviction. We know that we cannot possibly right the wrong that was \ndone to Jack Johnson, but we can take this small step towards once \nagain acknowledging his mistreatment and removing the cloud that casts \na shadow on his legacy. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/24/senate-section/article/S3281-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3281-S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 335.

REPORT ON INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) in democratic societies, citizens rightly expect that \n     their government will not arbitrarily keep information secret \n     from the public but instead will act with secrecy only in \n     certain limited circumstances;\n       (2) the United States Government has an inherent \n     responsibility to protect American citizens from foreign \n     threats and sometimes relies on clandestine methods to learn \n     information about foreign adversaries, and these intelligence \n     collection methods are often most effective when they remain \n     secret;\n       (3) American citizens recognize that their government may \n     rely on secret intelligence sources and collection methods to \n     ensure national security and public safety, and American \n     citizens also expect intelligence activities to be conducted \n     within the boundaries of publicly understood law;\n       (4) it is essential for the American public to have access \n     to enough information to determine how government officials \n     are interpreting the law, so that voters can ratify or reject \n     decisions that elected officials make on their behalf;\n       (5) it is essential that Congress have informed and open \n     debates about the meaning of existing laws, so that members \n     of Congress are able to consider whether laws are written \n     appropriately, and so that members of Congress may be held \n     accountable by their constituents;\n       (6) United States Government officials should not secretly \n     reinterpret public laws and statutes in a manner that is \n     inconsistent with the public's understanding of these laws, \n     and should not describe the execution of these laws in a way \n     that misinforms or misleads the public;\n       (7) On February 2, 2011, the congressional intelligence \n     committees received a secret report from the Attorney General \n     and the Director of National Intelligence that has been \n     publicly described as pertaining to intelligence collection \n     authorities that are subject to expiration under section 224 \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56; 115 Stat. 295); \n     and\n       (8) while it is entirely appropriate for particular \n     intelligence collection techniques to be kept secret, the \n     laws that authorize such techniques, and the United States \n     Government's official interpretation of these laws, should \n     not be kept secret but should instead be transparent to the \n     public, so that these laws can be the subject of informed \n     public debate and consideration.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall publish in \n     the Federal Register a report--\n       (1) that details the legal basis for the intelligence \n     collection activities described in the February 2, 2011, \n     report to the congressional intelligence committees; and\n       (2) that does not describe specific intelligence collection \n     programs or activities, but that fully describes the legal \n     interpretations and analysis necessary to understand the \n     United States Government's official interpretation of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 \n     et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 340.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``PATRIOT Sunsets Temporary \n     Extension Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, Congress hastily passed the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law \n     107-56; 115 Stat. 272), which significantly expanded the \n     authority of the intelligence community and law enforcement \n     agencies to collect intelligence on, and conduct surveillance \n     of, citizens of the United States.\n       (2) Recognizing that the USA PATRIOT Act had significantly \n     expanded Government authorities at a time of national crisis \n     and with minimal deliberation, Congress established sunset \n     dates for 16 of the most controversial provisions in the Act. \n     Congress also included a sunset date in the amendments to \n     section 101(b)(1) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 118 Stat. 3638), \n     commonly known as the ``Lone Wolf'' provision.\n       (3) In 2005, Congress made 14 of those provisions \n     permanent, but retained sunsets for the Lone Wolf provision, \n     as well as provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act authorizing the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to issue warrants for \n     roving wiretaps and broad orders compelling the production of \n     business records or any other tangible thing.\n       (4) Since the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Justice has released \n     various reports that highlight abuses of the provisions of \n     the Act and sharp increases in the use of secret court \n     orders, national security letters, and electronic and \n     physical surveillance. Since passage of the Lone Wolf \n     provision, it has not been used in a single investigation.\n       (5) The sunset dates provide a means for Congress to \n     fulfill its oversight responsibilities and to hold careful \n     and deliberative debate about the controversial provisions, \n     to consider amendments to the laws, and to determine if the \n     provisions should be granted addition long-term extensions.\n       (6) Congress has not devoted the time necessary to hold a \n     substantive debate and to discuss and vote on a number of \n     amendments before the provisions expire on May 27, 2011.\n       (7) Until such a debate occurs and an open amendment \n     process is conducted, Congress should not grant a long-term \n     extension of the expiring provisions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 197 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 197) honoring the entrepreneurial \n     spirit of small business concerns in the United States during \n     National Small Business Week, which begins on May 15, 2011.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I do not believe small businesses need \ngovernment assistance to exist. In fact, I believe the best thing our \ngovernment can do is to shrink the size and cost of the Federal \nGovernment. With less government, minimal Federal regulation, and lower \ntaxes, businesses--regardless of size, industry, and location--will \ninnovate in meeting American consumer demands and achieve phenomenal \ngrowth.\n  Instead of encouraging dependence on the Federal Government, I \nbelieve politicians should seek to find ways to free businesses to \nthrive independently. Additionally, with a national debt of almost \n$14.3 trillion, Congress should start considering ways to enable \nsustainable economic growth instead of authorizing or increasing more \nFederal subsidy programs that more often than not have limited or \nquestionable benefits.\n  As a former small and large business owner, I know the struggles \nsmall businesses face because of unnecessary government regulations and \ntaxes. In fact, the Federal Government's interference in my ability to \npractice medicine prompted me to first seek office. Small businesses \nare invaluable to the economic health of our great country and embody \nthe American dream.\n  While I join the Senate and the President in recognizing the \ncontributions of small businesses all over the country, I would like to \njoin Senator Paul in opposing a resolution passed by the Senate today \nthat lauds big government and the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize \ncertain small businesses.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was a small businessman before I was \nelected to the Senate. I know well the struggles small businesses face \nbecause of government regulations and taxes. I also know that small \nbusinesses are a key driver of economic growth and employment. That is \nwhy I join the Senate and the President in recognizing the \ncontributions of small businesses all over the country during National \nSmall Business Week.\n  Unfortunately, this resolution goes a step beyond recognizing the \nhard- working entrepreneurs who are our small businessmen and \nbusinesswomen. The resolution also praises big government and using \ntaxpayer dollars to subsidize small businesses. I do not believe small \nbusinesses need government assistance to exist. I do not believe we \nneed an entire agency of the Federal Government to encourage \nentrepreneurs. Quite the opposite--I believe that with less government, \nbusinesses of all sizes will be created, existing businesses will grow, \nand the American spirit will thrive. That is why I voted against this \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are ready to act \non this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 197) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I now ask that we act on the preamble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the preamble.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 197\n\n       Whereas the approximately 27,200,000 small business \n     concerns in the United States are the driving force behind \n     the Nation's economy, creating 2 out of every 3 new jobs and \n     generating more than 50 percent of the Nation's non-farm \n     gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses are the driving force behind the \n     economic recovery of the United States;\n       Whereas small businesses represent 99.7 percent of employer \n     firms in the United States;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 97.6 percent of \n     all exporters and produce 32.8 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total Federal Government purchases, \n     contracts, and subcontracts for property and services are \n     placed with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total sales of government property are made \n     to such small business concerns, and to maintain and \n     strengthen the overall economy of the United States;\n       Whereas every year since 1963, the President has designated \n     a ``National Small Business Week'' to recognize the \n     contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2011, National Small Business Week will honor \n     the estimated 27,200,000 small businesses in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns by providing access to critical lending \n     opportunities, protecting small business concerns from \n     excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, helping to ensure \n     full and open competition for government contracts, and \n     improving the economic environment in which small business \n     concerns compete;\n       Whereas for more than 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business concern, and \n     has played a key role in fostering economic growth; and\n       Whereas the President has designated the week beginning May \n     15, 2011, as ``National Small Business Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the entrepreneurial spirit of small business \n     concerns in the United States during National Small Business \n     Week, which begins on May 15, 2011;\n       (2) applauds the efforts and achievements of the owners and \n     employees of small business concerns, whose hard work and \n     commitment to excellence have made such small business \n     concerns a key part of the economic vitality of the United \n     States;\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\n       (3) recognizes the work of the Small Business \n     Administration and its resource partners in providing \n     assistance to entrepreneurs and small business concerns; and\n       (4) recognizes the importance of ensuring that--\n       (A) guaranteed loans, including microloans and microloan \n     technical assistance, for start-up and growing small business \n     concerns, and venture capital, are made available to all \n     qualified small business concerns;\n       (B) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as Small Business Development Centers, \n     Women's Business Centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are provided with the Federal resources necessary \n     to provide invaluable counseling services to entrepreneurs in \n     the United States;\n       (C) the Small Business Administration continues to provide \n     timely and efficient disaster assistance so that small \n     businesses in areas struck by natural or manmade disasters \n     can quickly return to business to keep local economies alive \n     in the aftermath of such disasters;\n       (D) affordable broadband Internet access is available to \n     all people in the United States, particularly people in rural \n     and underserved communities, so that small businesses can use \n     the Internet to make their operations more globally \n     competitive while boosting local economies;\n       (E) regulatory relief is provided to small businesses \n     through the reduction of duplicative or unnecessary \n     regulatory requirements that increase costs for small \n     businesses; and\n       (F) leveling the playing field for contracting \n     opportunities remains a primary focus, so that small \n     businesses, particularly minority-owned small businesses, can \n     compete for and win more of the $400,000,000,000 in contracts \n     that the Federal Government enters into each year for goods \n     and services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/24/senate-section/article/S3288-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING THE ALASKA ACES HOCKEY TEAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
