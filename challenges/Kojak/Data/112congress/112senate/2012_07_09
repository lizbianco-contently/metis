Objection having been heard, the \nmeasure will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                            Focusing on Jobs\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month we got a lot done. It was \nincredibly productive. Congress and President Obama worked together to \nprevent interest rates from doubling for more than 7 million college \nstudents, and we also worked to put 2.8 million Americans back to work \nor create new jobs and to rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, and \nother parts of our transportation system. The Senate passed an FDA \nbill, which was so necessary to focus on why we have, among other \nthings, shortages of lifesaving drugs. We also passed something that \nwill allow the construction industry to go forward, which is flood \ninsurance for the entire country. We passed a farm bill that will \nstrengthen the agriculture industry and support some 16 million jobs.\n  We were able to accomplish this much last month because Republicans \nand Democrats worked together and compromised. Rather than wasting time \nparticipating in political theater, we actually legislated.\n  I hoped to continue that productive process in this work period, \ncharacterized by cooperation between lawmakers on both sides of the \nCapitol and in both Chambers. Unfortunately, we already know that our \ncolleagues in the House are going to waste much of this short work \nperiod refighting very old battles.\n  Republicans had indicated they would support the ruling of the \nSupreme Court. They, in fact, said the Supreme Court is going to decide \nthis matter regarding affordable health care. Well, they have now \nchanged their tune. Mitt Romney has said he would nominate Supreme \nCourt Justices just like Justice Roberts. I wonder if he is saying that \nto his rightwing base today.\n  But now that the Court has upheld this landmark health care reform \nwith the majority decision, written by Justice Roberts, Republicans \nrefuse to admit that the matter is settled. This\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nweek the House will vote--and this is almost hard to comprehend--for \nthe 31st time to repeal health care reform. They have already voted 30 \ntimes, but Speaker Boehner said: Let's do it again--31 times, taking \nmany hours and many days that should have been spent on creating jobs. \nCongressional Republicans have spent months trying to repeal a law that \nhas already saved lives and made people more safe as they look at \nhealth care in this country.\n  While House Republicans hold a political showboat, the Senate will \ntake a different approach. We are going to continue to try to be \nconstructive and focus on jobs. While Republicans are stuck in the \npast, we will be addressing the most pressing issues facing this \nNation: creating jobs and securing the economy.\n  Last week's job report underscored the fact that Congress must do \nmore to strengthen the recovery. So the Senate will immediately \nconsider a package of commonsense tax cuts that will lower the cost of \ndoing business for small businesses and pave the way for small \nbusinesses to succeed.\n  Our legislation will cut taxes for small firms that invest in new \nworkers and equipment. The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act will \nprovide a 10-percent income tax credit for companies that add up to $5 \nmillion to their payroll, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. \nBusinesses are eligible for a tax break if they hire new workers or if \nthey raise the wages of hard-working employees already on their \npayroll. And because the credit is capped at $500,000, it is targeted \nto benefit small businesses most.\n  The legislation will also allow companies to write off the entire \ncost of purchases, such as new equipment, and they will be able to do \nit in the year the purchases are made instead of writing them off over \nlong periods of time.\n  More than 2 million companies could get a boost to their bottom \nlines, creating hundreds of thousands more jobs.\n  Proposals such as these have garnered Republican support in the past, \nand I hope they will receive bipartisan support again tomorrow.\n  After our weekly caucus meetings tomorrow, the Senate will vote to \nend a Republican filibuster and begin to debate these tax cuts. \nDemocrats can't undertake the work of strengthening the economy alone. \nWe will need Republican support, which is why we have proposed \nconsensus tax cuts that should pass the Senate overwhelmingly.\n  It was good to see that so many reasonable Republicans were willing \nto work with us last month to save college students money, rebuild the \nNation's infrastructure, and help protect American farmers. Tomorrow, \nRepublicans will have an opportunity to prove they are willing to \ncontinue working with us to create jobs.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, Senators \nare permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may address \nthe Senate as in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Fairness\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, ``fairness'' has become one of the watch \nwords in this year's political debates, both at home and abroad. The \nterm echoes throughout Europe, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel is \nunder pressure to come up with billions in bailouts for troubled \neurozone countries. Her insistence on reasonable reforms is considered \nunfair by many in those countries, even though Germans have sacrificed \nto live within their means, for example, by forgoing wage increases to \navoid the problems of their neighbors.\n  In the United States, President Obama and his supporters have used \nfairness as a justification for various redistributionist policies, \nincluding a massive tax hike, a government takeover of health care, \ncomplex financial regulations, and new government spending programs.\n  The President and his supporters believe the Federal Government \nshould pursue policies that will result in economic equality. But \nforced equality is inherently unfair. It necessarily relies on the \nwrong incentives that penalize success. More fundamentally, it is based \non a shallow, materialistic definition of ``fairness.''\n  Aristotle wrote: ``The worst form of inequality is to try to make \nunequal things equal.''\n  Contrary to the goal President Obama pursues, the key determinant of \nlasting happiness and success is not whether you have as much money as \nyour neighbor, regardless of the differences between you. Rather, it is \nwhat American Enterprise Institute president Arthur Brooks calls earned \nsuccess and meritocratic fairness.\n  Much research shows people are happiest when they have the \nopportunity to succeed and earn their rewards. Sometimes we take risks \nand succeed. Sometimes we fail. Sometimes we defer gratification by \nsaving our money. Maybe our neighbor does not. Some of us are better at \nmaking money than others. Some deliberately earn less to enjoy other \npursuits in life. Decisions about families result in very different \neconomic circumstances.\n  When the government tries to equalize everyone or take all the \ntrouble out of life by taking care of our every need, it makes earned \nsuccess and meritocratic fairness that much harder to achieve. When \ngovernment aims to smooth over every rough patch, it eliminates the \nexperiences that make us resourceful and resilient--the experiences \nthat teach us how to work harder or smarter for our rewards.\n  Those of us who believe in earned success and meritocratic fairness \nbelieve the best way to promote these concepts is through the free \nenterprise system, a system in which opportunity is sacred and \nexcellence is rewarded. We reject the notion that it is fair to impose \ninterventionist and redistributionist policies to guarantee material \nequality. As Brooks notes: ``For the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, fairness means rewarding merit, not spreading the wealth \naround.''\n  In his new book, ``The Road to Freedom,'' Brooks asks some \nfundamental questions related to the future of earned success, the \npursuit of happiness, and meritocratic fairness:\n  First, ``Will we see a growing bureaucracy or more \nentrepreneurship?''\n  Second, ``Will we be a culture of redistribution or a culture of \naspiration?''\n  Third, ``Will we be a nation of takers or a nation of makers?''\n  These are serious questions that will be answered in the long run--\nnot in 1 day or 1 year or in one session of Congress. But for now, I \nwould like to focus on the short term. How do recent government \npolicies help answer these questions about what is fair?\n  How does government spending, and the staggering debt that comes with \nit, affect bureaucracy and entrepreneurship? How does a \nredistributionist tax policy affect the aspirations of job creators and \ninnovators? And how does our burdensome regulatory regime affect the \nso-called ``makers'' in American society?\n  Let's take these Brooks' questions one at a time. First, will we see \na growing bureaucracy or more entrepreneurship? We all know \nentrepreneurship requires opportunity and private investment. But a \nburdensome Federal Government reduces opportunity and it crowds out \nprivate investment. Let's take a look at the growth of government under \nPresident Obama. Since his inauguration in January of 2009, the Federal \ndebt has increased by more than $5 trillion, and it is rapidly \napproaching $16 trillion in total.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal budget deficit has exceeded $1 trillion 4 \nyears in a row. The highest deficit before President Obama was less \nthan half that\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\namount. How did our deficit and debt skyrocket so quickly? Well, for \nstarters, President Obama's economic policies have resulted in slower \nGDP growth, which means less tax revenue flowing to the Treasury and \nmore Americans requiring government assistance. So government income is \ndown.\n  Second, the President has dramatically increased government spending. \nPrior to the 2008 fiscal crisis, the 40-year average for Federal \noutlays was less than 21 percent of our gross domestic product. But \nunder President Obama, spending soared over 25 percent of the GDP in \n2009. It has remained above 24 percent since then. This new spending \nhas grown the Federal bureaucracy and it has increased the regulatory \nburden on families and businesses.\n  For example, the President's 2,700-page health spending law created \nor codified at least 159 new boards, bureaucracies, and programs, along \nwith thousands of new pages of government regulations and more than 20 \nnew taxes. A recent Bloomberg News report notes that the President's \nhealth care law imposes $813 billion in taxes on middle-income families \nand job creators, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In \ntotal, it has imposed $24 billion in new regulatory costs on the \nprivate sector and States, as well as almost $59 billion in annual \npaperwork hours on the economy.\n  The 2010 Dodd-Frank law is a similar story. It is still creating \ncountless new rules and its direct compliance costs have already \nexceeded $7 billion. Indeed, according to the Financial Services \nRoundtable, Dodd-Frank will force more than 26,000 employees to comply \nwith the law.\n  Other Obama initiatives have failed to pass the Congress, but \nlikewise would have expanded the bureaucracy and funneled resources \nfrom the private sector to the government. These initiatives include \ncap and trade, the deceptively named Employee Free Choice Act, and the \nmore recent Paycheck Fairness Act. We need to get back to basics.\n  As Congressman Ryan has said, we need to make it easier for people to \nemploy their ``right to rise.'' That means leaving more money in the \nprivate sector and reducing the size of the Washington bureaucracy. We \ncan start by stopping tax hikes and bills such as ObamaCare that suck \nneeded resources out of the economy and give unaccountable regulators \nimmense power.\n  Let's consider Brooks' second question. Will we be a culture of \nredistribution or a culture of aspiration? Public policy has a direct \nimpact on economic aspiration and economic mobility. America has \ntraditionally been an aspirational society with high levels of \nmobility. Although President Obama has made class warfare a central \ncampaign tactic, we do not have a class system here in America. We do \nnot have an American aristocracy or noble bloodlines. Because of our \nmeritocratic system, people in America can and do jump from one income \nlevel to another throughout their lifetimes, from the one place to \nanother. But with unemployment stuck above 8 percent now for 41 \nconsecutive months, and the Obama administration's preference for \nredistributionist policies, there is real concern that America's \nculture of aspiration may gradually be replaced by a culture of \nredistribution.\n  Look at the tax issue. President Obama wants to increase the top \nmarginal income tax rates in order to expand the entitlement state and \npromote what he calls greater ``fairness'' in society. But what about \nthe economic consequences of taking more money from successful people \nas the economy continues to struggle? The Joint Committee on Taxation \nhas told us that allowing the top two marginal income tax rates to rise \nfrom 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively, will hit \n53 percent of net positive income and just under 1 million business \nowners overall.\n  Raising marginal tax rates is no way to encourage aspiration or job \ncreation. It certainly imposes a wet blanket on the kind of risk taking \nthat has helped build America. It is merely redistribution under the \nguise of social justice. The President's approach to investment is also \nhostile to aspiration and risk taking. He has endorsed raising the top \ncapital gains rate from 15 to 23.8 percent, and he also wants to raise \nthe top rate on dividends from 15 to 43.4 percent.\n  The so-called ``Buffet tax'' is yet another method of hiking taxes on \ninvestment. All of these taxes on investment reduce the value of the \nasset by reducing the aftertax return. Our private economy runs on \nbusiness investment, which is highly sensitive to tax rates, especially \non capital gains and dividends.\n  Some of those who prefer higher taxes have argued that if taxes do \nnot go up, those in the top brackets will invest and save more, but \nthat will not do much for job creation and economic growth. Well, that \nis factually incorrect. Saving does not mean throwing your money under \na mattress or burying it in your backyard. Anyone who saves money \neither puts it into the bank, where it is lent to someone, often a \nbusiness, so they can hire more people, purchase equipment or invest in \nstocks and bonds, or the money is directly invested in a stock or a \nbond, which provides capital for the same purpose.\n  In other words, savings actually puts the money saved to work \nproviding capital for someone to do something with it. And that creates \neconomic growth. If that increment of income is instead taken from \nthose who earned it and spent by the government, the effect on the \neconomy will almost always be a net negative. If we want to encourage \naspiration, innovation, and the job creation that comes with those, is \nit a good idea to raise the capital gains rate by almost 59 percent and \nnearly triple taxes on dividends, even though these profits have \nalready been taxed once at the corporate level? The President and some \nCongressional Democrats think so, but I strongly disagree.\n\n  Here is Brooks' third question: Will we be a Nation of takers or a \nNation of makers? Many have lamented the decline of the manufacturing \nbase in America. Although the United States is still the largest \nmanufacturing economy in the world, there is no doubt that policies \nfrom Washington have made it more difficult for manufacturers--and \nthose are the economy's foremost makers--to compete in global markets. \nThe list of these policies is long. Let me explain a few.\n  First, the corporate tax rate. At over 39 percent, our combined \ncorporate tax rate is now the highest in the industrialized world. \nOther countries are cutting their corporate tax rates to encourage \neconomic growth, but we are doing nothing on the tax front to follow \ntheir lead and attract more investment to the United States. Is it any \nwonder jobs are moving overseas? If not, whose fault is it, the company \ntrying to return a profit to its investors or the government which \nmakes it impossible to compete with foreign corporations?\n  Look at energy. Manufacturers rely on cheap sources of energy to \nproduce products cheaply. Yet President Obama has stood in the way of \ndomestic production of energy such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and \nworked tirelessly to punitively raise taxes on the oil and gas \nindustries. New regulations on coal-fired powerplants, emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, and industrial boilers will also hurt our economy.\n  Simply put, domestic makers are being hurt by the President's anti-\nenergy and proregulatory agenda. Is this fair? Why should Americans pay \nmore than the real economic cost of available American energy? And is \nit fair that a few corporations make billions because the government \nmandates that we buy ethanol from them, just to cite one example?\n  Now let's turn to labor. Manufacturers are also being burdened by \nunion-dictated rules including from the National Labor Relations Board \nsuch as the ``ambush elections rule'' and new rules on the \nestablishment of ``micro unions'' within the workplace.\n  With anticompetitive tax, energy, and labor policy, it will be \nincreasingly difficult for our country to compete as a Nation of \nmakers. These are precisely the kinds of policies that encourage \nemployers to move jobs overseas, which hurts American workers and the \ngreater economy. And this is required in the name of fairness?\n  We are also trending toward being a Nation of ``taking.'' The \ngovernment is the biggest taker. But a majority of Americans now take \nmore than they contribute. In tax year 2009, 51 percent of Americans \npaid zero Federal income\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\ntaxes, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation--over half of \nAmericans. And these citizens take much more than their follow citizens \nin government benefits.\n  Look at food stamps, for example. As my friend Senator Sessions has \npointed out, ``food stamp spending has quadrupled since 2001. It has \ndoubled just since 2008. A program that began as a benefit for 1 in 50 \nAmericans is now received by 1 in 7.'' Spending on food stamp welfare \nhas increased 100 percent since President Obama took office. Some 80 \npercent of all spending in the recently passed farm bill will go toward \nfood stamps.\n  In total, there are 69 means-tested Federal welfare programs costing \ntaxpayers $940 billion every year, including both Federal programs and \nState contributions to those programs. The number of Americans living \noff the wealth of ``makers'' keeps growing and growing. There are \nnearly twice as many government workers today as there are in the \nmanufacturing sector, meaning that there are more government workers \nthan people making products and paying their salaries. Is that fair?\n  As economist Stephen Moore noted, ``This is an almost exact reversal \nof the situation in 1960 when there were 15 million workers in \nmanufacturing, and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the \ngovernment.''\n  The growth of taxpayer-funded dependency is directly connected with \nthe growth in the economy. The more we make as a Nation, the more \nwealth we generate and the less people who rely on welfare to survive. \nTo get there we need aggressive progrowth policies in place to \nencourage free enterprise and discourage a Nation of taking. It is \nneither fair to the makers nor those who must rely on the government \nfor the President to impose policies that reduce economic growth, \nreduce job creation, reduce savings and investment, and reduce \nopportunity and freedom.\n  In conclusion, free enterprise and meritocratic policies are \nconsistent with our founding principles. As Thomas Jefferson declared \nin his first inaugural address, ``A wise and frugal government . . . \nshall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.''\n  Will America remain the country our Founders envisioned or will we \nbecome a country where fairness means equal outcomes for all dictated \nby the government? Will we make it easier or harder for people to earn \ntheir success? And will the American people be happier if allowed to \npursue their dreams, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, or if the \ngovernment tries to force equal economic outcomes? Which is more moral, \nwhich is more fair, which is more American?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Passthrough Income\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, if the distinguished whip will remain on \nthe floor for a second, as I was passing through listening to his \nspeech, I wanted to add some meat on the bones of this business of \npassthrough income and the 940,000 American small businesses that will \nbe affected dramatically by the President's announcement today.\n  For 22 years, I ran a subchapter S corporation. A subchapter S \ncorporation passes through its revenues to its investors who pay it at \nthe ordinary income tax rate of an individual. Now, $250,000 is not an \ninordinate amount of a number for somebody to have passed through to \nthem in the ownership of a subchapter S corporation.\n  I passed the money through and paid them back based on the investment \nthey made in the company I ran. When you raise the tax on the \nindividual rate, then for a subchapter S corporation and limited \nliability corporation, for a limited partnership, you have two \ndecisions to make as the runner of that operation: Do you reduce your \nretained earning investment in your company to maintain the return to \nyour investors at the same level or do you continue to wind your \ncompany down because you cannot distribute at the rate you used to \ndistribute?\n  It is very important to understand that whichever decision you make \nhas a direct negative impact on future hiring in that company. The \nCongressional Research Service estimates 940,000 businesses will be \naffected. But listen to this number. As the leader has said, 53 percent \nof all passthrough income becomes subjected to the higher tax rate--53 \npercent, over half. That is American small business. So I want to \ncommend the leader, because he has hit the heart of the story. This is \na tax on what we need the most; that is, reinvestment of earnings to \nhire more people to build more businesses in America. This has the \nexact opposite effect on the middle class that the President described.\n  The second thing I will point out is that today America suffers \neconomically from the uncertainty of what is going to happen \npostelection. With this proposal, the President has now made a \nrecommendation that would extend that uncertainty for another year. The \nlast thing American business needs is to have that uncertainty about \nwhen the next shoe is going to drop in terms of taxation on the middle \nclass--or any class.\n  I commend the assistant leader for coming to the floor and telling \nthe story about American business. We are not here to try to shelter \nthe rich. We are here to empower business, to have more employees in \nthe United States, and to empower our economy. Again, I commend the \nwhip on his remarks on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TONI RYSER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Mrs. \nToni Ryser of Laurel County, KY, a businesswoman who is a pillar of her \ntown, East Bernstadt. Mrs. Ryser's entrepreneurial spirit caused her to \nopen a furniture store in East Bernstadt, KY, in 1969 that continues to \nthrive and service the people of Kentucky and other States in the \nregion. She is a shining example of a Kentuckian who has established a \nsuccessful business while maintaining an important role in her \ncommunity.\n  The daughter of Chester and Carrie Bales, Mrs. Ryser grew up in East \nBernstadt. Despite hard financial times during the Great Depression, \nshe grew up as a happy child. Her father was a truck driver and \ndelivered groceries around Laurel County for Laurel Grocery, and her \nmother worked in the home. Her mother used to joke with family members \nthat of the four children, Mrs. Ryser was the most difficult child \nbecause she always did what she wanted and had a mind of her own.\n  Mrs. Ryser graduated high school at age 16 and worked for Aetna Oil \nCompany. In a bold move encouraged by her then-boss, Mrs. Ryser asked \nher would-be husband, R.D. Ryser, out to the movies for their first \ndate. The couple married in June of 1947 and at age 20, Toni had their \nfirst child, Kandy. The Rysers had two more children, Bo and Kim, over \nthe course of the next 5 years.\n  Though Mrs. Ryser always wanted to be a mother, she decided she \nwanted to do more than keep the house during the day. Remembering the \nskill her mother taught her as a child, she began sewing and selling \ndrapes. Soon Mrs. Ryser's drapery business grew and she could not \ncomplete orders as quickly as they arrived. As business increased, she \ndecided to expand and not only sell draperies but also upscale \nfurniture.\n  In 1969, Mrs. Ryser approached a furniture retailer that was hesitant \nto do business with her because of the rural nature of East Bernstadt. \nHowever, despite the concerns of the retailer, Mrs. Ryser decided she \nwas going to sell furniture and was not dissuaded by the larger \ncompany's misgivings. She never doubted her ability to sell the \nfurniture and make a profit. So in September of 1969, when Toni was 39,\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nRyser's Inc. was officially open for business.\n  Despite the continued success of the drapery business, Ryser's Inc. \nfurniture sales did not really take off until 1972, when the Kentucky \ncoal industry experienced a boom. The extra cash flow in the area \ncaused the furniture business to flourish in East Bernstadt and the \nsurrounding region. Before long, the entire family worked for the \ncompany: taking orders, making deliveries, and even offering advice on \ninterior design.\n  Ryser's Inc. quickly became a premier name in furniture in Kentucky, \nTennessee, and Florida. The store in East Bernstadt evolved into a \nwarehouse, and Mrs. Ryser spent her time in the Laurel County area and \nthe greater region bringing upscale furniture to the people. The \nreputation of the family business continued to grow over the years \nthroughout the region and State and caused Mrs. Ryser to be named a \nKentucky retailer of the year in the 1990s.\n  A long standing member of East Bernstadt Baptist Church, a dedicated \nwife and mother, and a successful business woman, Mrs. Toni Ryser is \nmost deserving of recognition for her contributions to the greater \nLaurel County community and economy. Mrs. Ryser never hesitated in her \njourney to establish a fine furnishings store in a rural area some 40 \nyears ago. It was her belief in herself, her family, and most \nimportantly her fellow Kentuckians that allowed her dream to become an \nenduring reality.\n  I am honored to recognize Mrs. Toni Ryser's admirable commitment to \nbuilding a successful family business in East Bernstadt, KY. I ask my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate to join with me in celebrating Mrs. \nRyser's entrepreneurial spirit and tenacity and her important \ncontributions to the greater Laurel County community. A recent article \npublished in the Sentinel-Echo, a Laurel County publication, \nhighlighted Mrs. Ryser's accomplishments. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 30, 2012]\n\n            Faith and Family Helped Build Furniture Business\n\n                           (By Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       As Toni Ryser sits down to talk about her life, she is the \n     picture of elegance. With soft, silver hair that frames her \n     face and several long necklaces offsetting a black blouse, \n     she sinks into an overstuffed chair whose arm a cat casually \n     uses as leverage to stretch its back.\n       The room itself can only be described as magnificent, with \n     ochre tomes toppled against each other on grand bookshelves, \n     drapes embroidered with the most delicate flowers, and a \n     giant, opulent mirror standing sentinel on the far wall. Yet, \n     despite the beauty, the room is comforting and unpretentious, \n     much like Ryser herself.\n       She was born in Harlan County on Valentine's Day 1931, the \n     daughter of Chester and Carrie Bales. While Ryser was still \n     very young, the family moved to Livingston before settling in \n     Laurel County when she was 7. Chester ``bought a truck and \n     started hauling groceries for Laurel Grocery,'' Ryser said, \n     while Carrie got to work making her home in East Bernstadt, \n     something she was particularly gifted at doing.\n       ``Mother could do anything,'' Ryser said. ``We had \n     beautiful clothes, we had wonderful food, we had a house that \n     was spotless.''\n       Though money was tight and the Great Depression was raging, \n     there were always fresh-cut flowers in the house and ``I \n     always felt rich because mother knew how to sew so I always \n     looked the part,'' she said.\n       Ryser was the second-born of four children, and though \n     Carrie was a strict disciplinarian, Ryser had a ``way of \n     finagling and not doing any work so I was a very happy \n     child,'' she said.\n       And a precocious one. At the age of 4, she was getting paid \n     a quarter to dance on the tables and, throughout her \n     childhood, she said she broke her nose once playing baseball \n     and four more times doing ``whatever else I could get \n     children to play with me.''\n       She recalled one occasion when an aunt, ``who thought she \n     was an aristocrat out of Louisville,'' came to visit.\n       ``People used to discuss dying earlier than they do now,'' \n     she remembered. ``She said, `Why Carrie, if something happens \n     to you, who's going to take care of these children?' Mother \n     said, `Well, so-and-so would take Sara Lee. So-and-so would \n     take Mikey. But I don't know who would want Toni.' I was \n     really lazy.''\n       Carrie was not, however, and when Ryser started attending \n     East Bernstadt School, she was one of the best-dressed girls \n     in her class.\n       ``I went to school in starched pinafores every day,'' she \n     said. ``In fact, they often made a joke about how my butt had \n     to be cold--I sat right on the seat because my dress went \n     straight out.''\n       Though she looked like she could be a city girl, her life \n     was firmly planted in East Bernstadt, which ``was a little \n     more town than it is now,'' she said.\n       ``We had a hotel, we bought groceries in East Bernstadt, we \n     went to church in East Bernstadt, we went to the movies in \n     East Bernstadt,'' she said. ``Sometimes, when we got a little \n     older, we would ride the train to London and see an afternoon \n     movie and ride the train back, but we had pretty much what we \n     needed right here in East Bernstadt.''\n       Ryser was a good student but having fun was still her major \n     goal, and she ``liked to see what I could get away with,'' \n     she said. She became fast friends with Betty Marie Muster and \n     Pat Finney. Together, they were cheerleaders, with a photo \n     still hanging at Weaver's of Ryser wearing her uniform. \n     ``Every Friday night, there was a dance at the Swiss Lodge,'' \n     she remembered. ``That was our big thing as we were going \n     through high school. We did a lot of dancing.''\n       She graduated from high school at 16 and ``immediately got \n     married.'' During her final semester, she'd gotten a job at \n     Aetna Oil Company and her boss Mr. Miller looked over at \n     Hunt's Cafe one day, saw R.D. Ryser, and said, ``Go over, get \n     a Coke, and ask R.D. out.'' She did, passing ``Colonel'' \n     Harland David Sanders who was eating with Mr. Hunt along the \n     way, and asked him.\n       ``I said, `Why don't we go to the movies tonight?' He said, \n     `No, I don't think so.' I said, `I would like to go with you \n     tonight. I'll be expecting you; I'll be ready at 7:30.' He \n     says, `I don't think so,' but at 7:30 he showed up. That was \n     the end of him, we got married.''\n       The wedding was in the afternoon of June 14, 1947.\n       ``The thing I regret the most about it is my mother had \n     made me the most beautiful wedding dress,'' she said. ``You \n     can't even imagine in your wildest dreams what a pretty dress \n     I had. I was so foolish; I never even saved it. It was \n     organdy and it was white and it had a full skirt and sleeves \n     to my elbows and it had the most gorgeous appliqued pink \n     flowers and leaves all the way around the skirt that you've \n     ever seen. Her work was beautiful. I mean, nothing today \n     could compare with it. Now I'd give anything to have that \n     dress.''\n       Ryser and R.D. moved into the two-room washhouse in the \n     back of her parent's house--``I don't know where mother did \n     her laundry after that''--and in 1949 moved into a home they \n     built together.\n       At the age of 20, she had her first child, Kandy, followed \n     by Bo three years later and Kim two years after that.\n       ``I had always wanted to be a mother, very definitely,'' \n     she said. ``I just thought it was wonderful.'' Like her \n     father, R.D. was a truck driver, hauling coal to Louisville \n     three times a week--a five hour trek--and returning that day \n     with groceries for Laurel Grocery. Ryser stayed home to raise \n     her children, which she loved doing.\n       By the time Kim was in sixth grade, though, ``I got to \n     thinking I didn't want to spend my time doing nothing, so I \n     decided to start making draperies.'' She'd been taught to sew \n     by her mother and deeply enjoyed the meticulous work. Asking \n     her friend Ruth Gabbard to help, she went into business and \n     soon had so many orders they could hardly keep up.\n       ``We'd stay backed up. Generally when we'd take an order, \n     we'd tell them it would be two to three months,'' she said.\n       Eventually, the pressure to couple her drapery business \n     with a furniture store grew.\n       ``What changed things is I would go out to hang drapes and \n     would spend maybe half a day with someone telling them what \n     kind of sofa to go buy or where should they set their bed and \n     wouldn't it be good to hang lights on the wall, that kind of \n     conversation,'' she said. ``I saw I was spending an awful lot \n     of time, so I said if I'm going to spend my time with \n     furniture, I'm going to be selling furniture.''\n       Opening up a furniture store--which she decided from the \n     beginning would be very high end--in the middle of East \n     Bernstadt was risky. But she had the full support of her \n     husband--``He was enough Swiss that if it was making money, \n     he was for it,'' she joked--and so headed to market in High \n     Point, N.C. She approached the big, upscale furniture lines, \n     one of the only women there who was the main buyer.\n       ``I went to Henredon and they didn't much want to open an \n     account with me,'' she said. ``They'd looked at East \n     Bernstadt on a map. They said, `Here's what we'll do: You \n     place an order for $20,000. We won't say we'll let you have \n     an account, but we'll come by and see your place, and then \n     we'll know if we want to take you on as a customer.' So he \n     comes by, there's cows on this side, cows on the other side \n     of the store, and he says, `I want to know: Who in the world \n     do you hope to sell furniture to?' I said, `I'm not a bit \n     worried about it, you just better believe I'll sell it.' So \n     he opened up an account that day, and there never was any \n     confusion after that.''\n       Having put up everything she and her husband owned as \n     collateral, Ryser's Inc. opened in September 1969. Ryser was \n     39.\n       She was soon working around the clock, keeping her focus by \n     reminding herself, ``All we have to lose is everything R.D. \n     has ever worked for since he was 17.''\n       The drapery business continued to flourish, but it wasn't \n     until the coal boom in 1972 that furniture sales truly took \n     off.\n       ``Over night, many coal companies large and small hit the \n     big time and there was lots\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\n     of extra money in circulation,'' she said. ``We happened to \n     be in the right place at the right time. We had a large \n     inventory and were willing to work night and day to help with \n     their furniture needs. The bottom line was business was \n     good.''\n       Gabbard and two other women continued making draperies, and \n     Ryser hired her family to do everything else.\n       ``It wasn't too long before Kandy was at the store,'' she \n     said. ``Bo was helping. I'd go out to the high school and \n     Harold Storm was the principal. I'd say, `Can Bo go with us?' \n     And he'd say, `How many do you want, Toni?' He'd give me two \n     or three boys and so off we'd go with a truck full of \n     furniture and drapes to hang.''\n       Once arriving at their destination, Ryser would work her \n     magic, attending to every last detail in a room.\n       ``We did everything,'' she said. ``We moved their old \n     furniture until it looked nice, we put the new pieces in that \n     they really needed. You set up and then you don't want to see \n     a little lamp on the floor, you don't want to leave a picture \n     hanging over here when it should have gone over there, so you \n     just start doing it.''\n       Once the home owner arrived home, the room would be \n     completely transformed, with the pieces they knew they were \n     buying accompanied by their existing furniture and a few \n     extras that rounded out the space. The effect was enchanting, \n     with all the parts seamlessly coming together to make the \n     whole.\n       Her eye for design was flawless, with one customer who \n     dealt in antiques asking her what she thought about his plan \n     to mass produce the look of an antique table. Her opinion was \n     so valuable to him that he called it the Mrs. Ryser table, \n     which to this day is still being sold.\n       Word traveled fast, with the Rysers name soon extending \n     throughout Kentucky and spreading down into Tennessee and \n     Florida.\n       Ryser was having a ball and was on the road every day, \n     telling her children, ``If we are in the store, we aren't \n     making money.'' Indeed, given its remote location, the store \n     was always meant to be more of a warehouse than a space for \n     customers to shop.\n       When Bo was in college, she said she ``saw she had too much \n     to handle'' and the flooring side of the business was getting \n     neglected, ``so I told my son, `If you want to buy the \n     business, it's here for you.' ''\n       He did. Kandy, meanwhile, had her own set of customers, and \n     Kim, after graduating from Eastern Kentucky University's \n     school of design, joined her siblings. Even her mother Carrie \n     had a hand in things.\n       ``Mother would come down and would tell them a thing or two \n     about drapes. It was her way or no way,'' she laughed. ``But \n     Ruth, she never one time get upset that mother tried to boss. \n     Ruth is a wonderful person, that was her nature.''\n       Business continued to grow, with customers by now all over \n     the country. In the 1990s, Ryser was named Kentucky's \n     retailer of the year.\n       Though she stayed constantly busy, ``thinking nothing of \n     going in at midnight or one in the morning,'' Sundays were \n     reserved for church and family.\n       To this day, she remains one of the most faithful members \n     of East Bernstadt Baptist Church, with Pastor Norm Brock \n     joking the only way to keep Ryser at home on a snowy, icy \n     Sunday morning is to cancel church.\n       ``I feel like God has walked beside me my whole life, my \n     whole life,'' she said. ``I like to give credit where it's \n     due and it's definitely not due me.''\n       Every Sunday evening, she would cook a sprawling family \n     dinner.\n       ``We had a ball,'' she said. ``They would bring their \n     dates, their friends and this house would fill up from that \n     end to this end. We'd all settle down in my kitchen and there \n     weren't enough seats and all we'd do is discuss all the fun \n     we'd had all week.''\n       In 1992, she and R.D. decided to build a new house on the \n     land on which he was born and, since they'd enjoyed their \n     first home so much, decided to replicate the floor plan to \n     the letter. She continues to live there.\n       In 2003, R.D. suffered a stroke and Ryser left the store to \n     take care of him. She returned to work after he died a year \n     later, but in 2006 Ryser also had a stroke. She's taken a \n     back seat to the business for the past five years. But she \n     continues to be active and last spring took a few months off \n     from her regular Body Recall aerobics class to redecorate for \n     a friend who was wintering in Florida but needed her \n     Lexington home completely redone in time for Derby. She only \n     trusted Ryser to do it.\n       Looking back, Ryser's eyes light up while talking about the \n     excitement of the business and become moist when talking \n     about her faith and family. When asked if she's proud of what \n     she's accomplished, she shakes her head and sits up in her \n     overstuffed chair.\n       ``I'm proud of my family,'' she said. ``I don't feel proud \n     of myself. I've enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/09/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         SOPHIA, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to bring \nattention to a small town in my home State. Sophia, WV, began its 100-\nyear anniversary celebration on June 2, 2012, and will hold a litany of \nfestive events throughout most of the summer.\n  Many of you present today will recall that Sophia is the town our \ndear friend and colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, so often referred to \nwhen he spoke of his home among the hills. This beautiful community \nserved as his and Erma's haven for much of their lives.\n  The town of Sophia is reportedly named for Sophia Gravley McGinnis, \nwho was born 200 years ago, in 1812. Mrs. McGinnis and her husband, \nPyrrhus McGinnis, owned nearly 2,000 acres of land in and around the \narea according to the family's historical documents. Sophia became the \nfirst official citizen and its endeared namesake when the town \nincorporated in 1912. She went on to live to the ripe age of 104 years \nold and died in March of 1916. She is buried near Flat Top, WV.\n  Many times over, Senator Byrd reflected on his and Erma's time in \nSophia, fondly remembering the friendships and once-bustling economy. \nHistorically, the town of Sophia was known as the epicenter of the \nWinding Gulf region where countless tons of coal have been mined and \ntransported all over the world via the extensive rail network \nintersecting the region.\n  Senator Byrd is certainly Sophia's favorite son. The memories he \nshared so freely with all of us act as a reminder of the importance of \ncoal and its far-reaching impact on the State of West Virginia and our \nNation. They also bring to mind the tremendous character of the people \nwho helped create those memories and how they helped guide him in his \nduties as the longest serving member of the Congress.\n  Unfortunately, as with many towns across our great land, Sophia fell \non hard times for a number of years. With the march of technology and \nthe mechanization of the coal industry, fewer men were needed to mine \ncoal and service the railroads, causing Sophia's population to quickly \ndwindle. Grocers and markets and small shops began to close their \ndoors. Schools helping to educate the children of Sophia were \nconsolidated. The town soon became a shell of its former glory.\n  However, like other parts of West Virginia that have experienced \ndecline, the citizens of the town of Sophia never gave up. Their story \ncontinues today and proves to be a testament of the talented and \ndedicated residents living there. Many of the efforts to revitalize \nthis rural village have resulted in enormous success. Economic \ndevelopment initiatives have culminated in a bright future for Sophia \nthat includes an economy of growth and a renewal of the spirit that \nlies deep within the hearts of the people Senator Byrd held in such \nhigh regard.\n  Evidence of the revitalization in the town of Sophia includes the \nopening of the Affinity Coal mining operation and the regular passage \nof railcars once again full of coal. Burning Rock Outdoor Adventure \nPark is bringing visitors from all across the Nation and the rich \nheritage of the coal industry is creating new tourism proposals and \ninterest in the studies of mine safety and engineering. The young men \nand women of Sophia are no longer forced to leave their homes to find \ngainful employment because opportunities are once again available to \nthem and their families.\n  All of these measures bring me to the floor to recognize what should \nbe considered a shining example of dedication and commitment in times \nof hardship and adversity. On behalf of the people of the town of \nSophia, it brings me great pride to present this statement in \nrecognition of a community spirit that has fostered ongoing \ntransformation, while always holding true to a history rich with \nfortitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/09/senate-section/article/S4788-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION REPORT\n\n       Derek J.
